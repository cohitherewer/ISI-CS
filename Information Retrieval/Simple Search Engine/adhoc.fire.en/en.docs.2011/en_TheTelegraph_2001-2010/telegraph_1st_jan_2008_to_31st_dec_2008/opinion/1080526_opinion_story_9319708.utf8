                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SOUTHBOUND                                                    
	Karnataka seems to have answered L.K. Advanis appeal. He had asked the electorate in the state to give the Bharatiya Janata Party that precious one chance to rule, so that the party could show the people what stability, good governance and development could mean. In these assembly elections, the BJP, which was the largest party in 2004 as well, has bettered its count remarkably. It is now just a little short of majority, leaving the Congress scrambling pitifully for second place. For both the Congress and the BJP, the Karnataka polls were important in two different ways. The BJP has at last opened its account in south India. It is no longer confined to the north and the west of India: it can look forward to the Lok Sabha elections with much greater confidence. And for the Congress, it is a bad shock, right at the beginning of the fifth year of the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.         
	It is a difficult moment for the UPA, with rising prices and inflation making it unpopular to the voter. No amount of loan waivers for farmers or follow-up action on the Sachar committee report on the minority community seems to have helped. The Congress in Karnataka had also built its hopes on the fact that the BJPs base was confined to the Lingayat community; as a kind of anti-Lingayat front it had among its leaders and candidates not just Vokkaligas, but Kurubas, Dalits, Muslims, Christians, Brahmins too. But the vote was evidently not cast on community or caste lines. It was something else that Karnataka, rendered politically unstable by the Janata Dal (Secular)s repeated antics, was looking for, something that the Congress missed.        
	The BJP was clear and vocal, even repetitive in its messages, proclaiming B.S. Yediyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate, reminding the people of Yediyurappas excellent budgets when he was finance minister, and talking of development and stability. For a state under presidents rule for months, these seemed to have made sense. These weighed more than the BJPs known closeness to the mining mafia for, in comparison, the Congresss appeals were indecisive, its platform vague. It had no specific chief ministerial candidate. All three aspirants for the chair were in the fight  Mallikarjun Kharge, Dharam Singh and H.K. Patil. That seemed symbolic of the Congresss lack of focus. In every way, the BJP was clearer. Mr Advani had said during the campaign that rather than tie up with the JD(S) again, the BJP would sit in opposition. Whether or not the JD(S) split the Congress vote has now become irrelevant. The regional party may still be hoping to regain its position of kingmaker  and king-breaker  a role it thoroughly enjoyed the last time at the cost of the welfare of the region that had brought it to power. But such hopes may be long in the fulfilling.

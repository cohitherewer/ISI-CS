The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Turmoil in the Valley
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TURMOIL IN THE VALLEY                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Listening to Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party defend herself and her party workers for trying to cross the line of control reinforced the untrustworthy nature of the shifts and truths that have diseased the political space in Jammu and Kashmir, including Ladakh, but more so in the valley. Mufti never answers the questions she is asked, always skirts the issue in a devious manner and is obsessed with what her father did or did not do. It is quite frightening to think that the fragile and volatile realities, which involve the lives of millions of citizens in India and in the subcontinent, are in the hands of people who have no ability to hear nor have agile, creative minds that are willing and intent on ensuring long-term humane socio-economic solutions that embrace peace and development. Frankly, there is not one leader who has stood apart, who has asserted sanity and thoughtfulness, who has been politically savvy and firm, enforcing the law correctly and for all, over the last month as Jammu and Kashmir went through one of the worst and painful upheavals in recent times.        
	To think that the political leadership in the troubled state could only think of walking to the LoC sums up their limited agendas and their parochial, non-secular and anti national positions. Why did the Muftis and their ilk not make a call to walk through the Jawahar Tunnel that links Jammu with Kasmir, in an effort to reach out to their fellow citizens, to ensure that the communication lines remain open and the state with its strong and fine cultural diversity remains intact? Was that much too difficult for them? Did it involve the possibility of unleashing unforeseen and unpredictable consequences that they would be unable to assimilate? Had they, in fact, through their rule running over decades, alienated the people of both Jammu and Ladakh as they jockeyed for power and consolidation in the valley?                
	Stormy times        
	As if supporting the state governments failures over the years in their various self-serving political interventions, the Central home ministry too came across as incompetent for handling the aggravated and emotionally intense situation, immobilized in mind and action. The fact that the ministry did not state categorically that any attempt to cross the LoC would be unacceptable and attract shoot-at-sight orders, as would an illegal blockade of the main artery that linked the two parts of the whole, went on to show the lackadaisical attitude of the law enforcement authorities of India. This indecision alone clearly defines a weak and soft state, wanting in a strong leadership, both at the level of the head of the ministry responsible for law and order and his chief bureaucrat. Turn your gaze to a distressed or disturbed place in India and you see a complete breakdown of order, brought about by the authority mandated to serve the people and ensure safety and peace.        
	Our prime minister reached a point of no return after enduring endless nonsense on the nuclear deal from the supporters of the United Progressive Alliance everyday, and then put his foot down firmly. Now he needs to call a definite and authoritative stop to the messy, non-committal, weak, irresolute and spineless operation of his lieutenants who are responsible for keeping peace. They have failed. They need to be replaced. India is going through a tempestuous and stormy period with extraordinary changes happening that spell growth but it is also a time when the gaping wounds of poverty brought about by decades of administrative neglect have compelled vast number of people to assert and demand their basic civil and human rights. The prime minister must show his paces yet again as he prepares to lead the country to the polls, promising us a safe and better future.

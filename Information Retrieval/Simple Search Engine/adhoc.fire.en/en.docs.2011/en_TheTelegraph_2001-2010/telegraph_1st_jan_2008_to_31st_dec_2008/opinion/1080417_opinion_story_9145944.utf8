	It is not often that both of Sonia Gandhis children are in the news at the same time. This is especially true since Priyanka Vadra (ne Gandhi) most of the time stays away from the limelight, preferring to lead a private existence. Rahul Gandhi, because he has chosen politics as his vocation, cannot help being in the news. But in the last couple of days, he has unfortunately been dragged into the news not because of his own actions, but by other people who have made irresponsible statements. In an attempt to snipe at the prime minister, and to be more royal than the queen, Arjun Singh gratuitously announced that Mr Gandhi should be the Congresss candidate for prime minister in 2009. Subsequently, Mr Singh was rapped on the knuckles for needlessly stirring up a controversy and for trying to belittle Manmohan Singh. What is worse is that by bringing in Mr Gandhi in an unseemly manner, he provoked the Congress spokesperson, Jayanthi Natarjan, to make the statement that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have always kept away from an environment of sycophancy. The fact that such a statement had to be made is a measure of the distance between the values of the two Gandhis and the prevailing culture within the Congress. Mr Gandhi has an uphill task in changing this culture, and he has taken the right steps by showing that he is aspiring to leadership on merit and not on birth.        
	The entry of Mr Gandhis sibling into the arena of news-making is more poignant and perhaps more meaningful. Ms Vadra met one of the persons accused of being part of the conspiracy that led to the assassination of her father, Rajiv Gandhi. The meeting, from her side, was intended to bring to an end the cycle of violence that took the life of her father and many others. Whether her intentions will bear fruit or not only time will tell, but it is undeniable that her gesture is imbued with significance. Ms Vadra made the point that she did not want hatred and violence to have power over her life. This voice needs to be heeded simply because so much hatred and violence have utterly vitiated the world and the ambience of contemporary politics. It would be cynical to see Ms Vadras words and actions as a show bereft of all content and sincerity. Her gesture is far removed from the culture of sycophancy and machinations that her brother has to contend with.

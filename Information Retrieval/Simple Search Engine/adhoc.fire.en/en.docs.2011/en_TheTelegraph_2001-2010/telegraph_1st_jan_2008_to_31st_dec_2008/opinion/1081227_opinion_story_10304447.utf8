	Lesson in art                  
	Sir  Sandip Rays fourth Feluda film, Tintorettor Jishu, has been running successfully at theatres for over two weeks now. He must be thanked for reacquainting Bengali film-lovers with Tintoretto, the famous Venetian painter, by adapting a story written by his illustrious father earlier. Tintoretto may not be as popular as Picasso or Leonardo da Vinci, but after the release of this film, the younger generation is showing interest in the painters life. Credit goes to Ray Junior for making a film on a subject that inspires learning.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad
        
	Name game          
	Sir  It is a matter of shame that our politicians have been busy changing the names of Indias cities and roads instead of solving the real problems that threaten this land (Name-game brigade casts eye on IITs, Dec 22). Now they want to change the names of IIT Bombay and Madras to IIT-Mumbai and -Chennai respectively. What the leaders do not realize is that changing the names of the cities or institutions does not alter history. The alumni and present students of the two IITs must protest against netas altering the names of their institutes or interfering in their internal matters. In this context, one must also thank The Telegraph for retaining the name of Calcutta instead of using Kolkata.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Apurba Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The fear that the change of names of IIT Bombay and IIT Madras will affect the institutes brand value is unfounded. After all, these institutions are recognized for their excellence, and not by their location. Initially, it might be a little inconvenient to call the institutes by their abbreviated names like IITM or IITC. But once people get used to the new names, it will, in fact, become easier for the international recruiters to locate the institutes geographically. In fact, the names of management institutes like the IIMs should also be changed in accordance with the altered name of the cities. For instance, IIM Calcutta should henceforth be known as IIM Kolkata.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyam Chaddha, Jaipur

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that regional political parties like the Shiv Sena are now interfering in the official matters of premier educational institutes of India. The Shiv Sena is insisting that IIT Bombay should be renamed as IIT Mumbai. If the Centre does not prevent such political intrusions in academic affairs, these outfits might end up forcing the IITs and IIMs to ignore the merit list and enrol applicants from particular regions or communities, much like what the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena demanded for the railways recruitment process. If such a thing were to occur, the global reputation of the institutions will be dented.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nandita Banerjee, Calcutta

                          
	Slow war          
	Sir  The Bengal land minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, seems to have woken up to the need to expedite the judicial process at last (Mutation in 90 days, Dec 23). I filed a case at Judges Court in April, 2005 for eviction of illegal tenants. The term, tenant, is a misnomer here because the family to which we had rented the premises has shifted elsewhere making way for the other illegal occupants. The case continues to get deferred for a variety of reasons  the defendant is absent one day, his lawyer is ill on the next, the judge has time for only interim cases on another day, and so on. I rush from work only to be told that the hearing has been postponed. The government may not amend tenancy laws but it can at least take steps to ensure that legal cases are disposed of at the earliest.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Banerjea, Calcutta

	Too many laws enforced with unthinking rigour often lead to situations that are both ridiculous and unjust. In Bengal, it has led to a senior and renowned Czech entomologist (and his friend) being remanded indefinitely in the Darjeeling Correctional Home. Petr Svachas offence was to collect  for his research, and not for any commercial purpose  beetles, moths and butterflies from a protected national park in north Bengal. Mr Svacha was doing what he has been doing all over the world throughout his professional life, quite clueless that he was actually in a protected area and hence doing something technically illegal. He was caught by forest officials and promptly put in judicial remand, where he remains, unable to move for bail because government officials were on strike in the area. His colleagues all over the world have petitioned the prime minister, the Chief Justice of India and the chief minister of West Bengal for his release. The petition has more than 700 signatures now.        
	India is a country that is thick with archaic laws, and full of zealous officials eager to enforce them with a mechanical and mindless ritualism. Hence, this legal officiousness has to be tempered now to suit the common sense of a modern and liberal present. This calls for a more sensible approach to using ones discretion when faced with certain offences. Most civilized and progressive societies have old laws that look absurd in the context of accepted norms of modern behaviour. The best way to deal with them is to let them quietly fall into disuse. Besides, jurisprudential good sense also talks of being able to distinguish intelligently between using a law defensively like a shield and using it offensively like a sword. The problem with India is a certain mindset that relishes the use of bureaucratic power to harass relatively powerless individuals. This is usually combined with what might be called a Brahminical finickiness that sticks to an established ritual with a sort of obedient righteousness. This can be a deadly combination in the hands of, say, a customs or forestry official, desperate to vindicate his own existence. Justice demands firmness and scruple, but it also asks for an essential sanity when it comes to the particular of human actions and situations. To embody the former while being incapable of the latter is to undermine the very principles of a humane order.

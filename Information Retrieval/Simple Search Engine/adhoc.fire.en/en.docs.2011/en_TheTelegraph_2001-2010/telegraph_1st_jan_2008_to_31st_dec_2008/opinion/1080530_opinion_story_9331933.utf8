The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dhaka diaries, in the gathering storm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DHAKA DIARIES, IN THE GATHERING STORM                                                          Jahanara Imam and (below) H.M. Ershad				                           
	The Jamdani Revolution: Politics, Personalities and Civil Society in Bangladesh 1989-1992 by Krishnan Srinivasan, Har-Anand, Rs 595        
	The duke has been making a lot of mistakes lately, says the courtier to the king in The Wizard of Id, perhaps you should punish him. Youre right!..., replies the king, Ill make him an ambassador.        
	The message encrypted in the cartoon strip is well understood by all who have had the privilege of representing their countries abroad, particularly in so-called challenging assignments. Krishnan Srinivasans account of his stay in Dhaka, between 1989 and 1992, as the Indian high commissioner illustrates this admirably. The title of the book is inspired, as the diarist states, by the Velvet Revolution, the Orange Revolution and the Rose Revolution.        
	Srinivasans tenure in Dhaka coincided with a gathering storm in Bangladesh over the misrule and corruption of the H.M. Ershad regime and, from an Indian point of view, a stagnation in inter-State relations. The three issues that he had identified as important in moving relations forward  sharing Ganga waters, the return of Chakma refugees from their camps in India to their homes in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and a closure to the issue of Tin Bigha  all remained unresolved as he left Dhaka at the conclusion of his term. Even though he was not nave enough to believe that the settlement of one or all of these three concerns would transform Indo-Bangladesh relations into one of co-operation and harmony, he concedes that ignoring them may not be the best option either.        
	The book is a reproduction of a weekly diary meticulously kept by Srinivasan during his stay, reflecting his mood when the entries were written, though it will show that [he] was wrong on many counts in [his] assessment of persons and events. Maintaining such a diary is an admirable trait, not commonly found in Indians. Unavoidably perhaps, the diary deals more with the minutiae of sterile inter-governmental discussions between the two countries that led nowhere, than with the ferment that was barely under the surface in the Bangladeshi society of the time. The latter would have added greatly to an understanding of the underlying causes of the Jamdani Revolution, the first occasion in South Asia when the peoples power compelled an autocrat to step down. The second would follow in Nepal, nearly sixteen years later, with far wider political ramifications.         
	Besides noting the bare facts, The Jamdani Revolution says little about the contemporary social circumstance. The author has dealt with his primary responsibility as Indias envoy to Bangladesh and has not recorded the impressions he gathered from his interaction with a cross section of Bangladeshi society or with the people he met in his visits outside of Dhaka.         
	Srinivasan is trenchantly perceptive of the foibles of the political and bureaucratic elements he had to deal with both in Dhaka and Delhi and, if anything, sharper with the latter. The book provides an accurate and, at times, amusing litany of events, though the author would hardly have found them so at the time.        
	A theme that repeats itself is Delhis indifference to progress on issues of bilateral interest. Delhis short attention span in dealing with neighbours is both an old and continuing phenomenon, and this is widely commented upon. The diaries, however, do not quite underline any strenuous effort by Dhaka to arrive at conclusions except on its own terms. It needs to be added that Srinivasans anguish at the negative attitude of the Indian ministry of water resources is fully justified. In one of the few analytical comments the diarist permits himself, he notes, Even if we do solve some of these long standing problems, the question arises whether there would be any appropriate response from Bangladeshi side. The forces which are anti-Indian, and which have considerable influence in Bangladesh, have such a vested interest in keeping up an aggressive anti-Indian posture that it is not realistic to think of any great change in attitude from Bangladesh. Given this scenario in Dhaka, along with Ershads negative statement on Kashmir, the continuing harassment of Hindus and the apparent encouragement to Islamic fundamentalist tendencies  all of which Srinivasan notes in his diaries  it is not surprising that Delhi at the time may not have been anxious to go the extra mile. Of course, it is also a fact that all was not as hopeless as the diarist had apprehended. The undercurrents of resentment were to explode on the month of his departure from Dhaka in March 1992, when a public tribunal under the leadership of shahid janani Jahanara Imam tried and convicted some of the worst Bangladeshi offenders for the genocide in 1971. Aggressive demands for the guilty to be tried continue to come from the new generation of Bangladeshis today.        
	One of the saddest commentaries on the Indian understanding of the events in Bangladesh is the note in the diary, revealing that barely a week before the ouster of Ershad by the people, the then Indian minister of external affairs  albeit one engaged in a game of musical chairs for the post  had overruled sage bureaucratic advice to clear a visit to Bangladesh by the Indian chief of army staff.        
	Krishnan Srinivasan represented India in Dhaka at a time not only of turmoil in Bangladesh but also of kaleidoscopic changes in the Indian political scene where decision-making was notably absent. His detailed account of his activities over the three years of his stay are enlivened with dry, at times scathing wit. His work during this time was related to inter-governmental negotiations and involvement in the political processes in Dhaka and would be useful for serious students of Indo-Bangladesh relations. In the Epilogue, the author overcomes the frustrations of his assignment and casts an analytical eye on the nature of the Bangladeshi polity and that of Indo-Bangladesh relations. His judgement will stand the test of time.                    DEB MUKHARJI

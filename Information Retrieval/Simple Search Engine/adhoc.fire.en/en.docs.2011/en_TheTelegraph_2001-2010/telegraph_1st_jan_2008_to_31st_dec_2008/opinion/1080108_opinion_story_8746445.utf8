	There is much the Congress could learn from the results of the primaries in Iowa, a conservative state where the majority population is white and rural. Barack Obama, born of a Kenyan father and a white American mother, has revived the great American dream  of hope and opportunity, of equality and freedom  one that had been forgotten and hugely diluted over the last decade. Hillary Clinton, a white woman and wife of the charismatic former president, Bill Clinton, came in third despite her vast experience and similar liberal positions as her very successful husband. All this churning is allowing the United States of America, and its diverse people, a chance to reinvent itself and discard its tired, flagging, self-righteous persona that has drawn flak from other cultures across the world, primarily for being socially insular and politically unilateral. 
    
	The Congress, once liberal and all-embracing, geared to tend to the needs of an exploited people, has managed to reduce itself to being a confused political entity, without a clear focus and with an ailing, aged and predictable leadership that has arrested change. It has, with its self-serving interests, tried to become a jack of all ideologies, making a mockery of its historic beginnings in 1947. It is not strong in any single region of India. It no longer has the revolutionary zeal that it used to. It has no idea of how to reconstruct itself to take on the challenges of a changing world. The most critical failure is that it has no impassioned leaders who can instil faith, trust and pride in the party.
        
	Reinvent the wheel
    
	The mandate is the same for all parties in a country like India where half the population lives a life of continuous socio-cultural indignities that are a direct consequence of misgovernance. The Congress, centrist and liberal by birth, has become a home for opportunists and failed politicians who are desperate to survive till they are left with no option but to go. Competent leaders are few and far between in the party. Superficial, often venal, politicking by unimpressive members of that party has demolished what was once a dedicated and committed party with members who represented the values, ethics and plurality of our sub-continent and civilization.
    
	The Congress has ceased to engage with the people at large and has ignored the new generation in particular. It has nurtured the average and pass, celebrating those who have failed to win the confidence of the electorate. It has made loyalty the first priority for office instead of extending support to new ideas, to healthy argument, debate and discourse, or to the necessary dissent required for reinvention, improvement and honest democratic activity. 
    
	Mayavati has made herself over! The Bharatiya Janata Party keeps reinventing itself and readjusts its rhetoric to merge with the larger plurality of a changing India because of the sheer necessity to handle and operate that reality. 
    
	When will the Congress throw its failed caution to the winds and fight, desperately hard, to regain the liberal, all inclusive space that it inherited but frittered away? Will it have the courage to unceremoniously and ruthlessly discard the losers and replace them with an unknown, but fresh set of young men and women? Can the party provide a challenge to their enthusiasm and ignite their passion to do a Barack Obama, risk some defeats, fight and take on other challenges yet again, and move swiftly to rule one of the youngest nations on this planet? Or will the grand old party slide into the pages of a history book? Will it abdicate? Where are those ambitious regional satraps who once comprehended the varied cultures and needs of the states? Where is the intelligent handling of the problems that plague entrepreneurial India? Where is the out-of-the-box thinking?

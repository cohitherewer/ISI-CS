	Money cant buy                  
	Sir  The decision taken by the National Commission for Women to extend the support of alimony outside marriage is shocking, because alimony itself is a reprehensible thing, (Bonanza for the other woman, July 23). It is acceptable only in cases where the deserted women are financially unstable. Else, it goes against the rationale of gender equality by perpetuating womens dependence on men. There must be more suitable ways to compensate the emotional trauma of women from broken live-in relationships than by forcing their partners to cough up money.          
	Yours faithfully,

	To sell news          
	Sir  The regional media seek a short cut to popularity by obsequiously giving in to plebeian demands for easily digestible items. Parochial sentiments are thoroughly exploited and many events of national or international importance are ignored. Under the veneer of seriousness, they present superficial facts with the insidious purpose of creating an entertainment package. Even astrological predictions and game shows have become regular features of local news channels. Instead of making use of its direct interface with the people to promote socio-political awareness, these channels sell cheap thrills to reap commercial benefits.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The print and electronic media in India are largely oblivious of their ethical responsibilities towards society. Their explicit coverage of sex and violence in the name of faithful representation of reality actually betray their blatant disregard for public sensitivity. Shocking photographs of murders or bomb-blasts are strategically used to create sensation. Crime scenes are re-enacted, perhaps to help novice criminals hone their skills. The features on fashion and films are overtly prurient. These corrupt the young viewers, for whom there should be programmes and articles on the rich cultural heritage of India           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The proliferation of news channels on television has turned out to be a menace. Their target is to achieve high TRP ratings rather than providing information. But in order to prove their professional commitment to expose uncut reality, they transform straight facts into sensational fiction. Their glib debates and discussions often shamelessly favour specific political parties. It is unfortunate that the pursuit of popularity and profit has displaced the basic principles of journalism. The initial overwhelming response to the glitz of private news channels having subsided, one feels nostalgic about the simplicity of Doordarshan news.          
	Yours faithfully,

	One for the road          
	Sir  Indians, while visiting cities abroad, meticulously adhere to traffic regulations and other civic norms. But in their own country, they do the opposite. From turning a deaf ear to traffic instructions, to littering the streets, Indians would probably top the list of civic nuisance.          
	The usual passivity of the authorities is changing, but slowly. The recent initiatives taken by Calcutta Police in putting up posters with rhyming couplets warning law-breakers, or deploying student volunteers at important crossings seem to have failed to convey the message. The police must resort to punitive action instead of verbal threats. Imposing fines on unruly pedestrians or drivers using cellphones; arresting drivers for flouting parking rules are some penalties that could be imposed.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Utpal K. Basu, Calcutta

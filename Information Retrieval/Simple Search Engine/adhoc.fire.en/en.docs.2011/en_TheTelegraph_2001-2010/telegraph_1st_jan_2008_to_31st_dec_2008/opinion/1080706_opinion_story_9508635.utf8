                              Plain speaking, high thinking          
	 Rahul Gandhis preferred style of plain-speaking has reminded many of the Rajiv Gandhi era. The young AICC gen-sec seems determined to change the work-culture and way of thinking in his party, which tends to treat his family as royalty. Vikram Chowdhury, a youth Congress leader from Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, got a taste of the party presidents sons mode of functioning recently. It happened when Rahul was interviewing aspirants for the Madhya Pradesh Youth Congress presidents post. Chowdhury got an audience with the Amethi MP. In the stipulated 30-second time for introductions, Chowdhury emphasized his caste status, pointing out that in the MPCC, the weaker sections were under-represented. Rahul told him to stop waxing eloquent on caste considerations. In the Congress, he reminded the job aspirant, caste has never been a determining factor. Some insiders say that Chowdhury has since been seeking a reliable refresher course in politics.                        
	 If the Congress and the Samajwadi Party make for strange bedfellows, then stranger are the rumours flying about on what or who brought them to the bed. One set of people seems to think it was Rahul Gandhi, and he did the trick by befriending Akhilesh Yadav, son of Mulayam Singh. As they say, the way to get a measure of the father is often through the son. But then, some people in our political circles are gifted with really fertile imaginations. And these gentlemen and gentler women have come up with the theory that UP governor TV Rajeshwar, who also happens to be a former chief of the Intelligence Bureau, used much intelligence  some his own and some gathered from former colleagues  to bring Mulayam Singh amp; Co. round from hating the nuke deal to loving it. The mind boggles at the memories of Samajwadi protests against the deal  they could put Karats cadre to shame. Surely it cannot be that easy to make such an indignant flock turn around and walk towards the PMs residence? Those who operate our overactive rumour mills say that the faces of the Samajwadi Party, Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh, have enough skeletons, tapes, CDs, photo albums and suchlike in their cupboards for Rajeshwar to try his hand at some political engineering. IITs and polytechnics should immediately open departments for social engineering and political engineering, headed by Mayavati and Rajeshwar respectively.                            
	 Remember we told you how Union petroleum minister Murli Deora is a stickler for rules and refuses to use his official transport for personal engagements? Deora has, however, failed completely to set an example to the officials in his ministry. The delegation that accompanied him to the World Petroleum Congress in Madrid had no less than 70 members, some of them with spouses in tow. Clearly, the PMs austerity drive and their bosss ideals dont impress them much. Deora, on the other hand, is not only the PMs follower, but he is also quite close to 10 Janpath and its extended family. As such, he must have been quite shocked to hear, while in Spain, rumours about his impending exit from the cabinet following the changed political alignments. Deora hastened his return to Delhi, and breathed a sigh of relief on finding that his chair in Shastri Bhawan was intact. It is learnt that Deora likes playing cards at the Gymkhana in his spare time. We feel that the intrigues of chess would be of greater use to him.                            
	 After India Shining, it will be Cabinet Shining. The country is in election mode, and most ministers have directed senior officials in their ministries to prepare a list of achievements so that the same can be advertised in the media. That India is an agrarian nation has been proved by the fact that the agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, has beaten everyone else at selling his feats on television. Commercials by other ministers are on the way. Is no one worried about the fate that befell India Shining?                            
	 The loyal cadre at Alimuddin Street are at their wits end on whether to call their lady Rajya Sabha MP, who is also a politburo member, Ms Mao Zedong or Ms Ceausescu.                        
	 We always knew there was a child in LK Advani or is it that he is in what they call a mans second childhood? He has earlier been spotted shedding copious tears in front of TV cameras. And now he has taken to playing hide-and-seek too! At least thats what the popes of Jhandewalan are allegedly miffed about. The parivar has reportedly taken note of the PM-in-waitings absence from the meeting called by the BJP last Tuesday to take stock of the Amarnath Yatra situation. The organizers were informed that Advaniji was in Bhopal. But party leaders apparently learnt later that the leader had come back to Delhi before noon, while the meeting was not until 4 pm. Experts say Advani is merely trying to change his image from a communal hardliner to a secular leader. The views of the parivar are not known. Only Murli Manohar Joshi had reason to be pleased. He was asked to occupy the chair on the dais reserved for the lauha purush.

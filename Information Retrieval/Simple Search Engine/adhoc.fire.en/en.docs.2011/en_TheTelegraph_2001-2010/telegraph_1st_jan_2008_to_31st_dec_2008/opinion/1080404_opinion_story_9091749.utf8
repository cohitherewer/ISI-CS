	Autonomy is given, but independence is acquired. This is why the latter is more absolute than the former, which is usually shadowed by the double-edgedness of gifts. Autonomy never quite manages to exorcize the ghost of control from its system. It is time the Indian institutes of management saw this fact in the face, and cut themselves entirely free from the paternalism of the meddlesome State. They will have to wrest their independence in a series of clear and quick steps, and not wait for the ministry of human resource development to relinquish its hold over them. Left to the ministry, that would perhaps never happen, or never completely, for old habits die hard. Something like the latest twitch of the ministerial leash (however diminished in tightness) that the chairman of the Ahmedabad IIM had to feel after the fee-hike in his institute can be avoided only if the IIMs take things in their own hands and sever all obligatory ties with the government. This would involve not taking any funding at all from the government, and also paying it back for the land that it had given each institute when it was first set up. Most of the IIMs are now in a position to be able to do this, and there is no reason why they should remain yoked to a token accountability to the government when nothing but their history ties them to it today.        
	The governments concern for the less affluent applicants has been amply addressed by the IIMA by making the eligibility criterion for scholarships more inclusive with respect to family income. Making themselves totally independent would also enable the IIMs to honour the governments reservationist policies without compromising on merit: only those who meet the academic standards would be eligible for the reserved seats. But the institutes must also devise their own means of working the corporate sector that benefits from the premium products they create. The IIMs must work, on the one hand, with the banks to make them provide higher loans to students, and, on the other, with the corporate sector, which should be persuaded to pay off the loans incurred by the students they recruit from the institutes, a strategy that some of their American counterparts have pulled off successfully. The new institutes that come up should, from the beginning, operate according to this notion of independence from the State, rather than having to waste their time later in battling for autonomy.

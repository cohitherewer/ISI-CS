	The pianist, Adolovni Acosta, played a recital of works by Frdric Chopin on November 4 at the Calcutta School of Music. Based in the Philippines, she has had an impressive pianistic career, having been awarded the 2006 Philippine Presidential Award.        
	At the end of each of the four delightful mazurkas that Acosta played, nobody clapped. This was not strange as one does not interrupt the continuity of a set as one would not with a sonata. But at the close of the last, there was a pregnant silence, and the pianist went straight on to the three nocturnes in C sharp minor, F major and C minor. All were equally poignant and beautiful, but played with too much rubato, enough to almost distort the rhythm, and with more than a few wrong notes. The two young men on my left commented in a loud aside that it was shameful not to encourage the pianist with some applause, and then led the audience with some lusty clapping.        
	Perhaps Acosta was distracted by the few late-comers who entered before the interval. She interrupted the performance to chide the lone, unfortunate cougher. She also seemed to suffer from the heat on stage, a misfortune shared by the Spanish guitarist a few weeks ago. Not surprising, considering the hot halogen lamps bearing down on the performer. Given this and the eccentricities of the concert grand, of which Acosta nobly did not complain, it seemed more like a battle of endurance.        
	The Barcarolle (Op. 60) was followed by four ballades in G minor, F major, A flat major and F minor. Acosta has a limpid technique and excellent pedal control, but there seemed an emotional detachment in her playing. There were a few students in the hall whom I have heard playing one or two of these works with reasonable competency, but one expects more than that from a concert pianist. So it amazed me when my two sympathetic neighbours led the befuddled, and perhaps slightly relieved, listeners in applause and also shouted for an encore. Acosta immediately and graciously complied, twice.         
	This recital had been preceded by a master class conducted by Acosta on November 3. It was held at the CSM, on the old Steinway, in a room that resounded with the clangour caused by the worn-out felts. However, the light was cool and soothing, and the young performers impressed Acosta with their talent and potential musicianship. The performers were Archan Bhowmik, Oishik Ganguly, Gaurab Dutta, Kaushik Das, and Arijit Kundu: too long a repertoire for one evening. Acosta was immensely patient and gently instructive, proving her long experience of master classes in some significant conservatories of the East.

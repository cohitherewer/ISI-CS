	What is political about burning propane? Fabricated icons like the Olympic torch are meaningless enough, in themselves, to take on any meaning. Who would have thought that a bit of fire ignited in a pseudo-Hellenic ritual would be the symbol around which the entire philosophy of sport would be taken up into the clash among nations? With protests against Chinas position on Tibet spreading from London to Paris to San Francisco, the International Olympic Committee is getting ever more anxious to remind the world, in terms that sound more ridiculous as they try to get more solemn, that the torch is not a Chinese torch, but the property of the IOC. Alongside this paranoia is the Chinese attempt to play the protests down by sheer misreporting, and by asserting, again and again, that there is nothing political about the Olympics: these games are all about reconciliation, hope, peace and harmony. But China is not alone in keeping up this spuriously apolitical rhetoric. The rationale of torch-bearers wanting to distance themselves from the protests is that sportspersons should not mix up what they stand for with politics.        
	The Olympics, where nation-states play one another under the godlike gazes of their leaders, is nothing if not political. And perhaps the most political element in it is the torch-bearing pageantry, which began with the 1936 Berlin Olympics, masterminded, among others, by the Nazi propaganda chief, Josef Goebbels, and filmed by Leni Riefenstahl. At that time, it was the Nazis wanting to show the world how Aryan athletes were like Greek gods. The Third Reich had to be projected then as a dynamic and modern State with growing international, particularly economic, influence. More than seven decades later, the image that China aspires to in the eyes of the world is not very different from this. That image is now beginning to show its objectionably imperialistic aspect, which the symbolism of the unquenchable flame is getting identified with. Hence, the Parisian police chief promised to look after the torch as he would a head of state, protestors in San Francisco got arrested for conspiracy, and the sinister men in blue accompanying the torch everywhere have been scuffling with policemen and the public as if naturally entitled to do so. And if the torch has nothing to do with politics, why does the prospect of hosting it for a while make India so lily-livered?

                 Fifth Column - Abhijit Bhattacharyya
               
	One was shocked but not surprised at the reported killing of two Indian students in the Louisiana State University campus in December, 2007. My reasons are simple. As India shines and as long as the media hype of this incredible India continues unabated, and the Indians go high profile in the arena of world economics, New Delhi should be mentally prepared to deal with such attacks on its successful citizens, whether in India or abroad. 
    
	The Indians, notwithstanding their poverty, ignorance and illiteracy back home, are perceived to be developing at an unprecedented 9-10 per cent growth rate per annum. They are seen in south-east Asia and Australasia, and from Canada to Cairo. To make matters more complex, the surviving brown sahibs the Mittals and Hindujas, Pauls and Tatas, Ambanis and Birlas  are in take-over mode across the globe. Western car and steel, tea and telecommunication industries are shifting their corporate headquarters from the suburbs of Boston and London to downtown Mumbai and Lutyens Delhi.
    
	But what could be wrong with the movement of Indians and why should one feel threatened by the take-over of foreign institutions by Indian companies? The answer lies in the fact that the Indians possess three distinct advantages in the global market. First, Indias burgeoning young population. Second, the largest number of English-speaking people outside the US-Europe consortium. And finally, of all the Asian developing countries, India is the least prone to violence, fanaticism, fundamentalism and terrorism. Indias disadvantage  which is its population  is also an advantage in this case, since the lack of opportunity within the country leads to many using their talent and skills in distant shores.
        
	Reason why
    
	Little wonder, therefore, that hordes of Indian students are descending on British and American universities and Indian professionals in Western corporate houses. 
    
	A recent British survey revealed a loss of 10,0000 British jobs owing to the entry of East Europeans in London. The flip side is that while British labour may have had it rough, Britains economy moved in the right direction, as the efficiency and comparatively low wages of the immigrant workers kept inflation and interest rates down. 
    
	If an Indian immigrant is killed or abused in an alien land, one must understand the fundamentals of fear psychosis related to economics. Thus, whereas in the Sixties, American children were advised to study hard to help India overcome unemployment and starvation death, today they are like to be given the same advice to ensure that the Indians do not take their jobs and put them on dollar dole. 
    
	This would be just as true of India. Resentment and hostility among provincial brothers. Understandably, therefore, the economic success of Marwaris have at times evoked jealous attacks by communities in the East. Similarly, Marathis of Mumbai have often expressed their anger against the Hindi-speaking labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
    
	Seen thus, what happened to Indians in Kenya, Uganda and Myanmar in the Fifties and Sixties and what is sporadically happening in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Russia and elsewhere today are only attacks that a potentially powerful nation should expect to face from those who feel threatened by its economic growth, employment opportunities and other livelihood options. As India marches ahead with a potential 10 per cent growth rate, it should also be aware of the dangers of ethnic violence from time to time against people of Indian origin living in alien lands.

	It is becoming difficult for the rest of the world to prevent ordinary Zimbabweans from giving in to the hopeless terror that rules their lives now. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, had pulled out on Sunday from the run-off presidential ballot to be held on June 27. He has now taken terrified refuge at the Dutch embassy in Harare. The authorities headed by his opponent, Robert Mugabe, have assured Mr Tsvangirais safety if he decides to emerge from the embassy in the next 48 hours. But given the violence and lawlessness that Mr Mugabe and the Zanu-PF cadre have unleashed in the country, Mr Tsvangirai is no longer sure. Now the United Nations security council has also warned Mr Mugabe that a free and fair election was impossible in Zimbabwe. The council met for only four minutes to make this statement, but China and Russia have also joined in the condemnation of Mr Mugabe. For this 84-year-old guerrilla-leader-turned-president, in power now for almost three decades, the absurdity of forging ahead with the election (and indeed of still calling it so) is the only logical thing to do. It would ensure a victory that he has already, in a hideous sense, begun to enjoy.        
	Yet again, that four-minute meeting, and what came out of it, proves the ineffectuality of a mechanism like the UN in dealing with a situation like Zimbabwe. If what Zimbabwe needs is an African solution to an African problem, then perhaps some sort of hope lies in its immediate neighbours. Yet, the South African presidents soft diplomatic approach seems unwilling to condemn Mr Mugabes ways with any firmness, let alone cut off electric supplies to the country, as suggested by some in the West. And if the African Union and the Southern African Development Community have not been allowed to monitor elections independently in Zimbabwe, then how would they even begin to address the larger chaos that rules the country?

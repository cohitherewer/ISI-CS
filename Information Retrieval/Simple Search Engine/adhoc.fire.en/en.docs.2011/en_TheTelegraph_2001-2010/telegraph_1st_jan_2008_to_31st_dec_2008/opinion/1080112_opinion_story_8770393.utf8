	Dario Fo has suddenly become the flavour of the theatrical season, with three versions of The Accidental Death of an Anarchist in three languages staged in the last three weeks, while another of his works, A Woman Alone and Others, continues running in a Bengali adaptation. This latter, named Manu(sh)shi by Kalyani Kalamandalam, burlesques a housewifes mundane daily routine, aptly explained by the original actress, Franca Rame, as, We women have been crying for two thousand years. So lets laugh now, even at ourselves. The Bengali director, Santanu Das, adds to Fos deliberately grotesque caricature by casting men in the two wives parts. Although this supports Fo in theory by de-stressing the female body to focus on the person inside (as in Dass title), ironically, it prevents actresses from enacting roles written for them. Thus objections could be raised about men again appropriating territory meant for women by reverting to the obsolete practice of female impersonation!
    
	Moving on to Accidental Death, the three productions showed how variously relevant this contemporary satirical classic is. The Kashmiri edition that came to the Nandikar festival unearthed the political subversion in it, targeting the absurdities of the Indian administrations inadequacies in that state. Nandipats revival of Mrityu na Hatya, directed by Bibhash Chakraborty, must be seen as a comment on the dissent in Bengal today about the lack of governmental accountability, illustrated by Singur and Nandigram. Why resurrect this eight-year-old adaptation otherwise?
    
	The newest interpretation, in English by Theatrecian (picture), narrowed the focus further to close up on the Rizwanur incident, even though it universalized all the names. Since Fo depicts the unravelling of a cover-up by the police of an undertrial in custody driven to suicide by them, by implication Theatrecian suggested that the same happened with Rizwanur. In its earnestness, however, it sacrificed some of the riotous farce that Fo had scripted.
    
	Deborshi Barat, as the seeming madman who sneaks into the police station to investigate the case and lets loose chaos on the precincts, came into his own as the play developed. But Barat should have behaved maniacally from the beginning, in keeping with Fos intentions. The butt of his ridicule, the inspector (Tathagata Chowdhury), should have gone totally ballistic by the end  nearly achieved when he shot his pistol unexpectedly  so that their dramatic graphs intersect and we see him virtually run amok, contrasted with the concluding sanity of Barats position.
    
	Once again with Theatrecian, the absence of a director resulted in some weak supporting characterizations. The other inspectors part should never have gone to a woman, because Fo wants to underline male abuse of power; Jhelum Ghosh just refused to act, as a woman almost purposely subverting Theatrecians aims! Freya Dasgupta was better as the journalist, but suffered stage fright occasionally with her lines. Among them, only Shadab Kamal satisfied as the superintendent confused by the weird goings-on.

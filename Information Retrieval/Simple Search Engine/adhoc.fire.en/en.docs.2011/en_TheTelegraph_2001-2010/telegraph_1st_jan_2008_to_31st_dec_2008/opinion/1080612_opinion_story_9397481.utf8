                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SKELETONS OUT OF THE CLOSET                                  In the aftermath of the panchayat polls, Bhaswati Chakravorty visits Birbhum to find out why the CPI(M)s stronghold has been shaken in areas unaffected by land acquisition                                            
	This time I have fought alongside people I have fought against earlier, said an opposition leader I met in a village close to Suri town in Birbhum district. For me, this is a dearly loved place; I keep going there. Each time, I meet a few people who strike me as distinctive personalities. As was this gentleman, whom my friends there had arranged for me to meet. I wanted to know why the Left Front, dominant in the area since the panchayati raj came into being, had received such a shock in the just-concluded panchayat elections. This was neither Nandigram nor Singur; industrialization and land acquisition are distant mirages in the gently-paced life of a world far from railway tracks and highways. In this particular area, the Opposition has not been fully victorious, for of the nine panchayat seats, it has won four, and lost the crucial fifth by just 10 votes. Even then, it is an enormous achievement for anti-Left-Front forces. After I had heard how it came about, it seemed to me an astonishing convergence of determination and tireless work, political sagacity, careful negotiation to create a united front against the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and the mobilization of accumulated public anger that needed a defined leadership to shake itself free of the fear of CPI(M) reprisals  all of it consolidated in a frenetic phase of a little over three months.               
	I was facing one of the chief architects of this achievement, a gentleman with a long background of struggle, striking in the directness of his account of the political history of his area, of his own shifts, and in the nuanced quality of his analysis. He repeated the first sentence three or four times during the course of our conversation, with a touch of personal irony perhaps, but also because that was the most important point of the struggle. The CPI(M) has been almost cornered because the fight was, as many said, one is to one. This apparently simple strategy, difficult to achieve in reality, is the key, according to everyone I met. This gentleman had a Congress leadership for this election, but he fought alongside allies of the CPI(M) who had turned against it, especially the Forward Bloc, and alongside the Trinamul Congress and independent candidates put up by anti-CPI(M) forces, even former party leaders now either discontented or disgusted. Fighting together was no easy job, but the participants even achieved consensus over a new, shared symbol in seven of the nine villages, so that voters would not be confused. It was agreed that one Trinamul-dominated village would keep its original party symbol and another the Forward Bloc symbol, and this would help, not hinder, the collection.         
	Such an understanding can only come about on the basis of issues that intimately affect the people. The one issue, I was told, was corruption. The corruption of ration dealers and that in the administering of what is called there hundred-days work head the list. This was one of the areas where the peoples movement against ration-dealers first began in Birbhum. The explosion of anger against corrupt dealers, who for years deprived people of their rightful share of staple, was directed towards CPI(M) leaders when they openly threw their weight behind the public offenders. What struck me in this and in the other cases was that the partys corruption had become open; it was visible to every villager. Leaders could be seen to be supporting everything that hurt the people most.        
	Equally hurtful, if not more so, were the irregularities in the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. There was a continuous game with job cards, which were often kept by the officials instead of being given to the card-holder, a total lack of transparency regarding who did have cards, or who was being paid for what, a fudging of books regarding the number of days of work  some people have worked for only nine days out of the guaranteed hundred. In villages, everybody knows everybody. So illiteracy is not always a barrier to the knowledge of rights. Awareness spreads by word of mouth. The irony is that the CPI(M) had inaugurated this consciousness of rights. But for the economically disadvantaged, being wrongfully deprived of work and payment is the worst evil. It had also become clear that job cards were being given to educated middle-class jobless young people, who need not actually do the required work. At Rs 70 a day, 10 days would earn Rs 700, of which Rs 350 would go to the card-holder, Rs 350 to the official in charge. Once again, all this was only too visible.        
	I heard similar stories about BPL cards and the widow allowance. What came through was not just the pocketing of money by those in charge, but also the nurturing of a middle-class constituency by giving it the benefits that should go to the poor. The Marxists are no longer being seen as friends of the labouring classes; the latters disillusion has come to a head over a series of events over the last one-and-a-half years. Another leader I spoke to had also been one of the chief organizers of the CPI(M)s electoral embarrassment, but he had been a partyman for 29 years. He too spoke of the partys closeness with contractors and corrupt dealers. When a village monitoring group had recently stopped contractors from metalling the main road with third-rate material, for example, local CPI(M) leaders had ignored the group and negotiated quietly with the contractors. The work has continued.        
	Where everyone knows everyone else, a leaders background and actions are crucial in the gaining and losing of trust. One of my friends had voted for the CPI(M) candidate at the panchayat level, because he did not trust the candidate in Opposition. His other two votes, though, were not for the CPI(M). When a cycle rally of 118 CPI(M) activists was matched by one of over 400 against them, members of the dominant party went from house to house threatening terrible consequences if the householders dared to vote. For the Opposition, it was a tremendous effort, three days before polling, to promise protection. But it polled the highest number of votes where the CPI(M) had threatened the voters. Some feel that Nandigram and Singur were indirect influences, for newspapers and the television brought them close. Not land acquisition, but the use of terror was the determining factor. Video cassettes prepared by those who had worked in those areas were distributed by the Opposition. But for people beyond the reach of such witness, watching their leaders was enough.         
	The CPI(M) has milked dry the political advantages of its famed land policy, said another friend, whose dispassionate and meticulous analysis of issues has always helped my understanding. In its place, I felt from a story I was told, the villagers see an arrogant and unintelligent display of power. There is only one locality among the nine villages that houses the minority community. There is no electricity, and the community has been asking for a light for the mosque there for years. This time, a big Opposition leader simply donated that light in his fathers name. When the process of connection had begun in the local electricity office, CPI(M) activists came thundering in, demanding that the process be stopped. The mosque has its light, and the party lost the vote of the community.              
	Actually, the fight has just begun. The composition of the gram sansad unnayan samiti will determine much of the future. The struggle to gain control of that will be harder. The secretary of that committee signs every document relating to the disbursal of funds. The formation of the samiti takes place after the panchayat pradhans are appointed, an event that has been unexpectedly postponed. The delay, it seems, is unusual. And afterwards? One side of the one is to one equation is not one but many. At the moment, there is a strong sense of unity and a determination to work on the issues over which the elections were fought. Righting past wrongs would itself be working for development, feels one leader, since that would begin to bring the benefits of the different schemes to the target groups. What seems most important is the pressure of the people. At the moment, again, working for them, staying together, fighting together on larger platforms and gaining electorally appear to be clearly connected. It is a pity I could not make the time to find a CPI(M) leader who could have said what he thought about this.

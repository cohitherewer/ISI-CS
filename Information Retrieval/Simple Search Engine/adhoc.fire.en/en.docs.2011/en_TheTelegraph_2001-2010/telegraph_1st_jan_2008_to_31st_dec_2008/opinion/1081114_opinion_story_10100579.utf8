	Beauty and oddity              
	Ambivalence in Hardy: A Study of His Attitude To Women (Anthem, Rs 295) by Shanta Dutta is a book of undisputed scholarship on one the most controversial Victorian writers. Hardys nonconformist and allegedly proto-feminist beliefs scandalized contemporary critics and readers, an outrage made memorable by Margaret Oliphants emphatic disavowal of Jude the Obscure as an assault on the stronghold of marriage. Dutta does a close reading of some of Hardys more famous works, and places the author in time to show that his attitude towards women was deeply ambivalent. At a time when the demand for womens suffrage was reaching a peak, Hardy was sceptical of the issue for a long time, much to his wifes dismay. In his novels, Hardy can be seen as subtly endorsing the dominant patriarchal ideology even as he appeared to oppose it. Duttas meticulously researched work would help readers understand and appreciate Hardy better.                        
	Love Marriage (Hachette, Rs 350) by V.V. Ganeshananthan is written in an interesting style, with the narrative swinging between the present and past as the protagonist, Yalini, reconstructs the history of her extended family. Like Tristram Shandy, Yalini sees her parents growing up separately in Sri Lanka, migrating to the US, falling in love  a course of events that has its climax in her birth. She rediscovers family traditions as she sifts through the nuptial histories of her relatives. Although there is nothing unique about the theme, the way it is treated makes the novel appealing.                                  
	Multiple Cities: Writings on Bangalore (Penguin, Rs 399) edited by Aditi De is similar in structure to other collections brought out by Penguin on Indian states and cities like Goa and Hyderabad. There are excerpts from the works of such writers as R.K. Narayan, Janaki Nair and Anjum Hasan. The short pieces bring out the pollution, the glitter, and the charm of the city. Especially captivating is the photographic essay from the turn-of-the-20th-century postcard collection of Clare Arni.                        
	Study Smarter (Puffin, Rs 125) by Anitha Bennett claims to provide clever methods and handy tips for becoming a better student. If one becomes a better student when the process of learning becomes less daunting, then this book, with its cheerful illustrations and helpful words of counsel, will succeed in its aim.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       POWER BEFORE PEOPLE                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	There is a sense of despondency that has permeated the atmosphere, one that impacts us all. Some of it may have to do with the general mood that is a consequence of the international crash, but a great deal of it is the result of a complete moral breakdown that has overwhelmed India. Whichever way one looks, ethics have gone for a six, the rule of law has been dispensed with, criminality has become a way of life across social divides to settle personal scores, and political, social and cultural differences are used to trigger mindless confrontations that are fast breaking up the society.        
	Political parties are actively participating in and endorsing this unthinking corruption. The misuse of power has led to fierce and uncontrolled anarchy that is making ordinary life a nightmare. It has become the great leveller in our society with its many-layered realities. What is the difference between the Vilasrao Deshmukhs, Margaret Alvas, Ajit Jogis, Rajnath Singhs, Najma Heptullahs and Naveen Patnaiks? Where is the national vision? Where is the global vision? Where is that powerful communicator with an all-embracing vision who is brimming with passion and commitment, motivated and inspired to transform India into a modern, civilized nation-state operating within the parameters of democratic functioning and the rule of law?        
	The administration of India is non-existent. Simple functions of a municipality are left wanting. Garbage is never collected and disposed, except in the areas where our politicians and administrators live. Drains lie clogged, roads remain bruised and battered, much like the civilians of the many cities and towns, faulty electricity distribution and a canopy of illegal wires are a reminder of the possibility of fatal fires that could kill hundreds, crooked administrators are consistent in demanding bribes for ensuring our legitimate, already-paid-for, community facilities, and none of the men and women in authority is ever held accountable.                
	False hope        
	The rot has begun to stink and the stench has given birth to a fatal virus that has overpowered India and Bharat. It has entered the minds and bodies of Indians. We have state elections happening all around us. The Congress should be working to win all the states, but instead, it is indulging in divisive tactics, which will ensure defeat. In Chhattisgarh, where old Congressmen with unsavoury political records are battling each other to grab the gaddi, if it comes the way of their party by default, they are, collectively, giving the state away to the BJP on a platter.        
	Ajit Jogi, a Dalit-turned-tribal, is believed to have a deep desire to rule again. By encouraging a bunch of dissident Congress candidates to stand as independents, he hopes to defeat the candidates recommended by his other colleagues in the Congress, and then blackmail the high command  make me CM and I will form a coalition with the 19 odd independents! This old and predictable formula failed in Karnataka and may well fail the Congress in Chhattisgarh. And, if it is Raman Singh pitted against Ajit Jogi, it is clear who the people will choose. It is also clear that if the Congress had a committed political person at the helm in that state, it would have the support of the people. Congressmen and women have betrayed the party, compelling thereby the dangerous polarization of our polity.        
	Why does the Congress allow this kind of utterly divisive political activity? Why are all the top-echelon leaders silent about the damage that is being inflicted on the social and political fabric of India? Here was an opportunity to wake up. But nothing happened. Close to winning four states, Congress leaders will, once again, delude themselves into believing they are winning, but will, in fact, lose them all. It is almost as if the Congress has done a deal with their opposition!

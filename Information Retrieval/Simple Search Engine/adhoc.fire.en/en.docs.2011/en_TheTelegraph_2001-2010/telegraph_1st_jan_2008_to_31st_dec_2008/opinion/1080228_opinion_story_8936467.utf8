                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Small change                  
	Sir  The editorial, Out of the warp (Feb 22), makes a well-assessed point about the slow pace of Cubas economic progress when compared to other countries. Does success in one or two fields of social welfare justify the perpetuation of one-party rule? While Cubas success in healthcare and education is commendable, these two services are provided by the State free of cost in many countries. But free of cost does not necessarily mean efficiency and good quality. Primary education is free in India too, and even includes mid-day meal schemes in schools. Government hospitals keep a ward for patients who are treated free of cost. Is this achievement unremarkable simply because ours is a democracy? Does the same provisions automatically become commendable because Cuba is a communist state? Incidentally, Fidel Castro flew in a doctor from Spain for his treatment. I do not think such luxury is available to ordinary Cubans.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Most of the great communist leaders fail to or refuse to understand that ideology can never be for the sake of propounding impracticable theories; the theories have to be implementable in order to bring about improvement in the lives of people. In case of Indian communists, the situation is particularly bad. Fidel Castro, one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, who took on the mighty United States of America bravely, is a hero for many; but like many great communist leaders of the past, he failed miserably to understand the scale of his responsibility towards his country. Apart from his success in healthcare and basic education, his long reign has isolated Cuba from social and economic advances of the time. Like a dictator, Castro has robbed Cubans of one precious possession: liberty. His choice of Raul, his brother, as his successor is also typically dictator-like. Will history regard him as a great man?                     
	Yours faithfully,         Nipam Kumar Saikia, Sonitpur, Assam        
	Sound and fury          
	Sir  Why do we need to be so tolerant of our chief minister when he breaks rules (Sir, if you do this, how can you uphold the law?, Feb 22)? When ordinary citizens flout rules, they are penalized. The Telegraphs criticism of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will matter little to him. The campaign against grafitti on the citys walls had failed to move him. Anyone caught flouting pollution norms  and this includes the chief minister  should be arrested. Without strict action, the problem of noise pollution will continue. This is examination season and students deserve to be allowed to study in peace. Saying that there were not too many Madhyamik examinees in the vicinity of the poetry festival  in which Bhattacharjee participated, ignoring the ban on microphones in public spaces  is no excuse at all. There is a hospital in that area as well. If not an arrest, at least a stern warning should immediately be issued to the organizers of the festival.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is incomprehensible how poetry can pollute the environment. No cultural activity connected with books, poetry and music should be considered a pollutant. People have very misleading notions about what a pollution-free environment should have. Their combative mindset makes them find fault with progressive cultural activities. The use of loudspeakers is only normal for cultural functions. The question of allowing them does not rise.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Surely, no court of law can declare Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees recitation of a poem over the microphone illegal. Going by the photograph published, ones object of concern should not be Madhyamik examinees, but rather, the chief minister. If the speakers could have disturbed patients and examinees hundreds of metres away from the scene of crime, then Bhattacharjee must have been superhuman to endure the sound waves sitting only a few feet away from them. Since the sound did not seem to be affecting him, one must conclude that it was within permissible limits.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The report on our law-breaker chief minister is a little too harsh. I was present at the inauguration of the Kabita Utsav arranged at the Buddhadeb Basu-Ajit Dutta Mukta Mancha in front of the Paschimbanga Bangla Academy on February 21. Although there were large sound boxes, the decibel level was so low that the ambient noise of passing traffic was actually disturbing the poetry-reading. Further, when I went for a cup of tea in the kiosk outside the canopy where the festival was being held, I could hear no noise from inside.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Guha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The chief ministers violation of noise norms reflects the culture of disregard for rules by the powerful. It is our fault that we let our leaders get away with such derelictions. The festivals organizers and the police, predictably, refrained from reminding Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about the ban. Hopefully, the leaders themselves will recognize the need to practice what they preach.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhasis Barman, Hooghly

	India was ushered into the high-cost economy when, on Wednesday, the government raised the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas. This could put the brakes on the consumer spending that kept the economy ticking these last three years. With inflation at a two-year-high of 8.1 per cent, the price increases are going to make several things  food, leisure and travel  dearer almost immediately. In the next two quarters, as producers adjust to higher fuel costs, inflation is likely to go even higher; the full impact is likely to be a 2 percentage point jump in inflation in the next six months. Consumers are also likely to put off big-ticket item purchases as they review their spending plans. For companies, inflation is likely to push up already high interest rates, increasing production and service costs further. For automobile companies, the long honeymoon with car-buyers and high sales will probably end soon. For other manufacturers, inflationary expectations will force them to raise prices in anticipation of rising raw material and other input costs. All of this may not be a bad thing. Subsidized fuel creates a kind of consumer moral hazard; worse, the group that benefits most from the subsidy is the class that can afford to pay the higher prices: the urban upper middle class. The cost, however, is borne by the poor, who are least able to afford it. About 60 per cent of petroleum products are subsidized. Diesel accounts for 37 per cent, petrol for 7 per cent and cooking gas for 9 per cent. Kerosene, the fuel of the poor, accounts for just 7 per cent. The other 40 per cent of petroleum products  naphtha, aircraft turbine fuel, and so on  are sold at market prices. And with rising incomes and benefits, consumption is likely to become more conspicuous if the rising price of oil is not passed on to the consumers.         
	Raising fuel prices by relatively small amounts while keeping subsidies in place may make for good politics, but it does not make for good policy. In fact, given that Indias growth prospects will be driven by energy-intensive industries for the next two decades, it is time that the government  particularly the next one  put out an energy policy that is publicly debated and discussed. The insidious assumption about relatively translucent policymaking is that people cannot make the appropriate choices as consumers and citizens in the face of adverse global prices.

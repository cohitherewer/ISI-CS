	Spread the light                  
	Sir  The report, Great Bengal power sale (May 9), questions the prudence of the sale of power outside the state when the state government is unable to provide electricity to its rural populace. I would like to present the facts in this matter so that readers can assess the probity or otherwise of the state governments policies in this regard.          
	The power demand in West Bengal varies substantially in different seasons and even at different times of each day. Power demand in the off-peak hours (11 pm-5 pm of the next day), particularly in the winter months, falls as low as 50 per cent compared to demand in the evening peak hours (5 pm-11pm) in summer. Our power system is designed to make enough power available to meet the evening peak-demand highs. When demand falls in the off-peak hours, we have to either reduce generation substantially or find buyers for the surpluses, as power is a commodity that cannot be stored. The states power availability mix is predominantly thermal (97 per cent) and cut-backs or step-ups in power generation, though easily effected in hydel plants, create large metallurgical stresses, resulting in boiler tube leakages and shutdowns in thermal power plants. We have thus had to look at markets outside the state for our off-peak power surpluses in order to maintain the reliability of the states power system.          
	The availability of an inter-connected grid, with regulated and codified system operations from 2003-04, has opened viable options to transfer our off-peak surpluses to power-deficit states in west and north India. With the regulator allowing 90 per cent of the surpluses earned by the West Bengal State Electricity Board to be passed through to its consumers, it is primarily the latter that have benefited through low-electricity tariffs.          
	As regards rural households electrification, the real initiative came only as late as in 2005 after the Electricity Act 2003 transferred the onus of rural electrification tasks from the utilities to the governments at the Centre and the states. The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana was formulated in April 2005 under the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government.           
	We recognize that access to electricity for our rural households will result in their inclusion in the process of economic growth. We have planned this massive task in two phases. In the first phase  the village electrification phase  of the RGGVY (2005-08), we have completed the electrification of around 6,000 unelectrified mouzas. About 43.09 lakh or 39 per cent of the states rural households now have access to electricity. The 20 per cent household electrification status of West Bengals 1.12 crore rural households reported in the article is a 2001 census record, not a Bharat Nirman 2005 status. We expect to reach a position of No unelectrified rural mouzas in the state within June this year.          
	In the next phase  the rural household electrification phase  under the RGGVY, we will intensify the existing rural electricity networks to provide electricity to a further 53 lakh unelectrified rural households in 33,000 mouzas in all 18 districts of the state.          
	Incidentally, the completion of this massive task will only add to the states peak power demand  though not very substantially, as rural households are very frugal consumers of electricity. For our off-peak surpluses, we shall continue to have to look for markets outside the state.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sunil Mitra, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Power, Government of West Bengal, Calcutta

                
	Turning a new leaf          
	Sir  Arjun Singh stirred up a hornets nest with his remarks about the Nehru-Gandhi family and the lack of inner-party democracy in the Congress. Later, Singh issued a clarification and reiterated his loyalty to the clan. Singhs conduct shows that in Indian politics, the line that separates loyalty and sycophancy is often fuzzy. For instance, how are we to distinguish a political aide from a factotum? For a Congressman, the question of loyalty is an equally tricky one. Should one remain loyal to the party, the Nehru-Gandhis, or to oneself? Loyalty may have its own rewards, but it is not without risks. Congressmen who have fallen out of favour with Madam would vouch for that. Opponents of the Congress can take heart from the fact that the damage done to the party by squabbling loyalists would be considerably high when compared to what its detractors have managed to inflict.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Union human resource minister, Arjun Singh, has found himself between the devil and the deep sea. His alleged comments against the Nehru-Gandhis earned him brickbats from loyalists at 10 Janpath. If Singh had not retracted his statement, the loyalists would have succeeded in turning the tables on this veteran politician. They did the same to Natwar Singh earlier, who now finds himself in the political wilderness.           
	Singh, ever the wily politician, was however quick to make amends. He did not waste time in declaring that he would remain loyal to the family as long as he lived. However, such solemn promises are unlikely to earn him a reprieve. Sonia Gandhi can still sack him without batting an eyelid just to prove that the Congress, like a true democratic outfit, has no place for sycophants.          
	Yours faithfully,

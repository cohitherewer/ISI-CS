                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FRIENDS NO MORE                                  CHIROSREE BASU                              
	Asif Ali Zardari, the Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman, loves the spotlight as it bounces off his immaculately-gelled hair. He loves it when his partymen throw constitutional logic to the wind and clamour that he should be the prime minister. He loves it even more when his party is joined unexpectedly by long-standing rivals like the Mohajir Quami Movement to demand that no less than a man of his stature and wisdom deserves to be the president.         
	All this gives little pleasure to Nawaz Sharif, former prime minister and the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), and not merely because Zardaris hair is better than his. Sharif has found himself trounced at every stage since the political drama began in Pakistan in 2007. It was he who became the martyr for the cause of democracy when he was sent back packing to Saudi Arabia by Pervez Musharraf. Yet, it was Benazir Bhutto, the one who supped with the devil, who became the ultimate shaheed through her death.        
	Sharif, obviously, cannot grudge her that, but he has every reason to grudge what her husband is making of his plans of a grand comeback to Pakistans politics. The PPP, by the weight of its mandate, has claimed for itself the post of prime minister, speaker, and now, almost certainly, that of the president. It has conceded to the purge of Musharraf but has not turned its back on him, and may even see to his safe retirement. The worst of the lot, it has forced the PML(N) to practice a kind of brinkmanship over the restoration of the judges which is most inopportune for it at a time it is still unsure if the people prefer Sharifs martyrdom to Benazirs.         
	There was much to be had from this partnership, and Sharif, despite his posturing, was clearly loath to end it in a hurry. Had he been any less sure of its promise, the PML(N) would have walked out of the coalition earlier instead of extending its stay every time the PPP cocked a snook at Sharif and his pious defence of the judges cause.                 
	Third time unlucky        
	One of the things that could be had from the coalition was a third attempt at prime ministership. Between friends, the constitutional provision that debars a contest for the post for the third time, could be turned around. The by-elections in June would have given Sharif the opportunity to take the first step towards this goal by becoming a member of parliament. But the judiciary, its judges appointed by Musharraf last November, came in the way by disqualifying Sharif on the basis of a previous conviction. It further convinced Sharif of its conspiratorial tendencies by refusing to hear the plea of the federal government against the judgment on grounds of a technicality.         
	Sharif retaliated by stepping on the gas for the removal of Musharraf, whom he suspected of being the prime motivator of judicial ill-will towards him. The second, of course, was a re-emphasis on the judges restoration clause of the Muree declaration, which alone could ensure that the hindrances on his way were cleared. Perhaps there could have been compromises had Zardari shown some consideration for the aspirations of his compatriot. One of them could have been the president, the other prime minister, and lived happily ever after. But Zardaris blatant greed leaves Sharif with no choice.         
	He will now have to take the trouble of walking over to the opposition benches, spend some time there badmouthing the PPP, and then go back to the people for a fresh mandate. Given the points he will have scored with the electorate by then, Sharif may romp back home. He should only hope that the people, while voting, have no memory of his rare feat on November 27, 1997. On that day, during his second prime-ministership, his goons stormed the supreme court and sent home the chief justice, Sajjad Ali Shah, for issuing a contempt petition against him. Justice Shah was removed within days, and more summarily then Iftikar Chaudhry.

	Slippery terrain                  
	Sir  The Central government has declared that petrol and diesel prices would rise by Rs 5 and Rs 3 per litre respectively, while cooking gas would be dearer by Rs 50 (Price blow, strike bonus, June 5). This steep hike is solely due to the faulty economic policy followed by the United Progressive Alliance government. On the one hand, the government exchequer has been overly burdened by the agricultural loan waiver and various other subsidies announced in the budget while on the other, there has been a huge loss of revenue as a result of duty-cuts and tax rebates, which were introduced to curb the rising inflation.           
	It is true that at a time when the price of fuel is on the rise the world over, the Indian government cannot keep the people here insulated for long. But it should not have sat idle when crude oil prices were rising globally over the last four years. Had the government increased fuel prices gradually, then the consumer would not have been as badly hit as he is today. The common man will not take the shock kindly and the UPA cannot even hope to rule for another term. Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram will be remembered for the way they weakened the Indian economy forever.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The Union finance minister has not acted wisely in passing the burden of the increased fuel price on tax-payers. This cess should have been collected from the vehicle owners, whether private or public. Many individuals and organizations keep on buying new vehicles to save tax. They should have paid the extra money on petrol as a penalty.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The price of a litre of diesel has been increased by Rs 3 a litre. The hike in diesel price is Rs 2 less than that of petrol because trucks run on diesel and a sharp rise in its price will have a direct impact on the cost of essential commodities. But diesel is also used in small cars and more and more car-owners will switch from petrol to diesel now to save money. Since diesel pollutes the environment more than petrol, pollution will accelerate in the days to come. The government should have introduced a differential pricing for diesel used in trucks and in small cars. But now that the damage has been done, it needs to encourage the use of battery or solar-powered vehicles and alternative fuels like CNG.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Nirmallya Sen, Haldia

                
	Sir  The Congress was waiting for the Karnataka elections to get over. As soon as the voters elected the BJP and not the Congress, the UPA government decided to teach the electorate in the country a lesson by hiking the price of petrol. This is a cruel blow to the common man, as the prices of all essential commodities will now shoot up even more. It is a fact that fuel retailers are making huge profits but they are also presenting the public with false statistics. P. Chidambaram should have regulated the tax pattern in such a manner so as to make the petroleum companies bear the brunt of the rise.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

      
	Sir  The message delivered to Indian citizens by Manmohan Singh in his address to the nation after the price hike should be considered seriously by every Indian (Save energy for children, says PM, June 5 June). But should not the prime minister initiate the process of conserving energy by cutting down on the fuel consumption of his cabinet?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupesh Garg, Jaigaon, Assam 

                
	Sir  Considering the rise in the international prices of crude oil in the last 3 months, a modest increase in the prices of petrol and diesel respectively is fully justified. Actually the hike is much lower than what is warranted by the situation. Keeping in mind the interests of the people, the government had laboriously avoided increasing prices over the last year in spite of rising international market prices. As such, the protests of the Left against the price rise have no justification.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Khemka, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The pathetic state of the Indian economy under Manmohan Singh is all the more ironic because our prime minister is an economist. What sort of an Incredible India has he created? Is the aam admi slogan meant only for election graffiti and leaflets or does it have any relevance for the people? With the people being harassed to no end by the inflation and now by the price rise, we have lost our faith in the government.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kshama Agarwal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I am shocked that the Bharatiya Janata party has called the hike in oil prices economic terrorism (BJP slams economic terror, June 5). Did not the party investigate the global oil scenario before making the harsh comment? If the BJP comes back to power in 2009, it should perhaps introduce a Prevention of Economic Terrorism Act, which would freeze the price of petroleum-based products for five years irrespective of the international prices. That would prove that the party leaders practise what they preach.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad 

                
	Sir  The increase in prices of petrol, diesel and LPG cannot be said to have been unexpected. Everyone knows that the petroleum reserves of the earth are not unlimited. With the progress of time, their quantity would go on decreasing, resulting in an increase in the prices. Hence, protesting against this price hike by calling bandhs and organizing rallies is futile. The only option left for the Union government now is to develop alternative non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind and biogas. Tapping these sources would also make the country self-reliant in oil.           
	Yours faithfully,

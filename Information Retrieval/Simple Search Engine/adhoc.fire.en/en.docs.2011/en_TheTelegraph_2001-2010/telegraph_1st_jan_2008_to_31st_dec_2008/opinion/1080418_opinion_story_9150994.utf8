                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DELIVER OR LOSE                                                    
	At the forefront of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees project of building a new and industrialized West Bengal has been the information technology sector. It was the IT companies that were the first to put their faith in Mr Bhattacharjees dreams. Their faith may have been belied, and they appear to be moving their investments to other pastures. This move away from West Bengal has nothing to do with Mr Bhattacharjee, his intentions and his plans. It has to do with only one thing: the absence of delivery on promise. Reports show that plans for expansion put forward by leading IT companies, like Infosys and Wipro, are lying with the government for the last two years. There may or may not be valid grounds for this delay on the part of the government of West Bengal, but capital and investments do not move in the same rhythm as a procrastinating bureaucracy. Mr Bhattacharjee recognized this problem by coining the slogan, Do it now. Obviously, the three words have only remained a catchy slogan with no relevance to ground realities. In West Bengal, procedural delays hold up business projects. This may well turn out to be the bane of Mr Bhattacharjees plans. Between the project and its implementation falls the shadow of the bureaucracy.        
	While West Bengal delays, its neighbouring states gather speed. This is particularly true of Orissa, where IT companies have had their plans passed without too much delay. It is this contrast between the speed of response in Orissa and the delay in West Bengal that might tilt the scales in favour of Orissa. Orissa has emerged as a hub of new investment. This is a reality that the chief minister of West Bengal can no longer afford to ignore. The problem is complex, but in no way insuperable. Mr Bhattacharjee has successfully changed the attitude of investors towards West Bengal. The state is no longer seen as a last destination, but the preferred one, other things remaining equal. Among these other things are time and implementation. Mr Bhattacharjee must now work to change the attitude of bureaucrats, and convince them that no longer is there a premium on procrastination; there is a huge one on delivery. He himself must emerge as the chief minister not just of promise, but of action and implementation as well. Mr Bhattacharjee has to refashion his inheritance. The inheritance includes not only his government, but also his party.

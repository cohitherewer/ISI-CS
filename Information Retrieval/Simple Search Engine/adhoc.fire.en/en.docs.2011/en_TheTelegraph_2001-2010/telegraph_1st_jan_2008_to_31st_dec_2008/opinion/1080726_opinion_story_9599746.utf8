	This year, Ganakrishtis just-concluded Natya Utsav  however truncated  went international, with invitees from Slovenia and Canada, and at the same time featured elements of tradition: an apparently impossible combination, strange but true.        
	For one thing, both the foreign teams employed puppetry, surprisingly not of modernist but of antique techniques. The Ljubljana Puppet Theatre transported its handful of spectators into a quaint and unique middle-European heritage from the 18th century: the miniature puppet theatre (picture). The company opened a small aperture  16 inches wide and 9 inches high  which enclosed all the essential old-fashioned stage trappings behind its proscenium arch, modelled to scale. A virtual picture frame lit by tiny footlights in front, a detailed, painted curtain that rolled up and down mechanically, intricate scenic vistas with backdrops and cut-outs in three-dimensional perspective, and three-inch marionettes manipulated by strings  enough to take ones breath away visually and reawaken those childlike feelings of enacting make-believe dramas on similar cardboard toy stages.        
	The play itself, Doctor Faustus, offered little except for a simple folkloric, rather than Goethean or Marlovian, variant of the Renaissance Faustian legend. It began funnily with Charon telling Plato that the slothful devils in hell catch few sinners any more, so Pluto orders them to bring at least one soul worthy of a thousand. Faustuss subsequent adventures find comic parallels in the naughty antics of his servant, Kasperle. Jelena Sitars revival and direction condensed the original 150-minute script into 50, probably the utmost for an Indian tour, given the language drawback.        
	The tradition used in Anandams dance-theatre composition, Tirtha (from Toronto), shadow puppetry, has such literally colourful avatars on the southeast coast of India that the abstract, monochrome, Canadian background designs hardly created the desired effect. When solo performer-director, Brandy Leary, entered on all fours, pushing a clay pot from which she smeared ash on herself, eventually smashed the vessel and climbed upwards acrobatically on cloth that dropped down from the flies (recalling the fairies in Tim Supples A Midsummer Nights Dream), we could comprehend the intended spiritual progress, albeit with a sense of dj vu. The ten-minute curtain-raiser preceding Tirtha, titled Anchored, featured her atop a huge menhir, rooted but turning in various poses before ultimately grasping her symbolic anchor in security and relief. I dont know why I kept thinking of the IIT student perched on the water tower last week.        
	Both the Indian troupes participating came from the south, rich in tradition. Y.P. Rajus Vir Abhimanyu gave Calcuttans a glimpse of Burrakatha, once enormously popular in Andhra Pradesh, and a vehicle of CPI messages. Sadly, Rajus retelling proved why its art of balladry is in current decline. Unlike Pandavani, a relative from the same family, there is much less attempt to contemporize. Even though Raju injects a novel touch by speaking in English (the first instance of a folk form using English?) so that non-Telugu audiences can understand, he hardly changes the familiar ancient storyline, a bit much for two hours. The lack of any melodic instrument and the completely unnecessary burra (tambura), carried over the shoulder but never played, exemplify the archaism. The choreography and costume are rudimentary, not as attractive as ornate Telugu idioms such as Yakshaganam. The singing, too, is not particularly varied.        
	Lokadharmi, from Ernakulam, brought Bhasas classic, Karnabharam, in K.N. Panikkars Malayalam translation. The director, Chandradasan, writes in favour of rebelling against the old guard to establish a new theatre in Kerala, but his production does not follow his doctrine. In fact, it can be seen as a genuflection to Panikkars acclaimed versions of Sanskrit drama, including this one. The same emphasis on ritual (the many lamps and flames on stage caused a mutiny among the Rabindra Sadan authorities, we hear) and the traditional styles of performance recur, down to the same costume pattern that Panikkar adopted in Madhyama-vyayoga. Chandradasan does interpret Karnas tragedy as a Brahminical conspiracy to crush a lower-caste hero, the chorus of Brahmins often tugging at their sacred threads in a show of power, but we have seen such interpretations before. Lokadharmi must do something more startling for a successful revolution on stage.

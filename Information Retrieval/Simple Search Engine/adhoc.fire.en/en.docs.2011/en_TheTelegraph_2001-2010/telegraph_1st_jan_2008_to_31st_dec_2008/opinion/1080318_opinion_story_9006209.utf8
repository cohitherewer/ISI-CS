	It is an intriguing role that the army in Pakistan has to play in the coming days. An institution meant to guard the international borders of the nation, the Pakistan army has been the virtual, if not parallel, ruler of the state from its inception. That has been the case during the tenure of Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia-ul-Haq and Pervez Musharraf. In fact, the army in Pakistan has been one of the most deadly players in the politics of power and aggression within and without the country.         
	The army engineered the Kashmir conquest in 1947; was complicit in the Ayub Khan-led coup in 1958; organized the 1965 Indo-Pak war, helped Yahya Khan capture civil power in 1969; made a mess of the 1971 war with Bangladesh, sent the elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to the gallows; created the taliban to counter the Kremlin at Kabul; planned the Kargil conquest and was responsible for Pervez Musharrafs transition to civilian authority in 1999.        
	As the wheel of history turns full circle, civilian rule looms large in Pakistan, relegating the army to a more subservient role. Thus both the president and the army chief of Pakistan appear to be preparing themselves for a role of cooperation rather than confrontation. One may ask how the handpicked successor of Musharraf could come to the unprecedented decision of trying to keep the army out of politics. Has there been a genuine change of heart? Or is the stance a reflection of the declining morale of the defence personnel?         
	Reality indeed could be the reason for the change in stand. The president had said that he would fully support the new government if peace is maintained? What if peace continues to be as fragile as it currently is in Pakistan? Will the president then dissolve the parliament? And will Ashfaq Kayani come to the rescue of his mentor to save the country? The crux of the matter is that both the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) have decided to keep the army out. This is dangerous for the army, which has always been sensitive to criticism and whose generals have been known to be abrasive and vindictive.                
	Limited choice        
	Can a civilian government banish the Pakistan army from politics? The decision of the leaders, in fact, may rock the rickety political boat more strongly than ever. Pakistans history shows that even when civilian rulers like Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif had chosen their blue-eyed boys as army chiefs to strengthen their position and diffuse the opposition, they had ended up feeling rather sorry for having made the choice.         
	The situation continues to be tricky. Mohajir Musharraf can accept Sindhi Asif Zardari, but he cannot afford to see his sworn Punjabi foe, Sharif, as the head of the government. It would also be unwise to expect the army to ditch its former chief if political circumstances so demand. Musharraf may have faced repeated threats to his life from elements within the army; his is also a unique case where so many former generals have expressed their lack of support. It was also during his tenure that the strategic deployment of the Pakistani troops underwent a sea change. Till recently, Pakistans main military foe was India. But 9/11 changed all that. The army was now deployed to fight al Qaida, mullahs and madrassahs.         
	Understandably, the army has over-stretched itself. With democracy crawling back, potential problem sites have re-emerged. What happens if the new rulers decide to take on the army? Will the army then tolerate the sacking of generals? Seems unlikely. Hence send the troops back to barracks and announce neutrality. The chances of problems emanating from the civilians will be reduced. Let the civil authorities fight amongst themselves once more.

	Empty promises?                  
	Sir  Despite his grand promises, Prasoon Mukherjees business proposals have barely come to fruition (Prasoon eyes $50bn investment, July 28). Mukherjee has been acting as the pointman for the Indonesia-based Salim Groups proposed investment projects in Bengal. So far, only an ornate faade has been erected on the land allotted to the business group to build a township near the Kona Expressway. The rest of the tract is still a wilderness. It was also declared that TVS would manufacture its Star range of bikes at a factory after it entered into an agreement with Salim Groups Mahabharata Motors, co-owned by Mukherjee. But one has not even seen the boundary wall of the factory come up till date. Instead of trusting Mukherjee, who was probably mistaken as a power-broker because of his influential proximity to the ruling party, this reputed motor-cycle company should have approached the government directly.           
	One is also sceptical about Mukherjees commitment to build a high-capacity power plant in Bengal. Who knows, it may turn out to be another empty promise as well. If the government is interested in accelerating industrial growth in the state, it must keep watch over the performance of investors. Perhaps Mukherjee is more interested in garnering political support for himself than in the states industrial expansion.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tamal Basu, Hooghly

                
	Sir  Prasoon Mukherjees flamboyant plans of building deep-sea ports, large power plants and special economic zones in Bengal, Maharashtra and Gujarat over the next 10 years are far from convincing. The sourcing of Indonesian coal for his proposed mega-power plants may become a challenging affair. Indeed, I can affirm from my own experience that Indonesian coal has low heat value and an abnormally high moisture. Hence, it is likely to become unusable after its long-distance sea transport to India. Besides, mining conditions in equatorial Kalimantan from where most of the coal will be taken are hardly conducive. Tata Power has acquired mines in eastern Kalimantan, and one can only hope that mining conditions and transportation facilities will improve in the future. It seems that this project too is doomed, much like Mukherjees other proposals.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Legally corrupt          
	Sir  Hostile trade union activities under the banner of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the labour arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), forced most industrialists out of Bengal in the last three decades. Despite Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees support to Bengals industrialization, Citu still continues with its hooliganism in the name of protecting the proletariat. Recently, it launched a despicable drive to give touts identity cards at the Public Vehicles Department in Beltala so that they can now become authorized salesmen of the various services offered by the PVD (Happy union, July 29). Illegal acquisition of driving licences and fitness certificates for outdated vehicles will now become easy to acquire in return for money.           
	Inviting private enterprises to facilitate the process of industrialization in Bengal is certainly welcome. Unfortunately, the activities of Citu cannot be supported anylonger. Perhaps the CPI(M)s poor showing in the recent panchayat and municipal elections can be explained by the revulsion towards its labour unions strong-arm tactics. With the elections still a few months away, only the judiciary can save helpless citizens who have fallen victim to this vicious cycle of politics.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan            
	Clad them young          
	Sir  Dakshinee, an eminent institute of performing arts in south Calcutta, has been imposing a bunch of irrational rules on its students for some time now. Recently, our eight-year old daughter had a traumatic experience within a few days of her admission there: she was expelled for wearing a salwar-kameez. The institute stipulates that students should be dressed as simple as possible while attending their classes and should be loyal to institutional ideals and regulations, (Regulations, http://www. dakshinee.com/admission.html). A printed copy of the rules, given to us at the time of our daughters admission, bears this sentence too. At no point was it communicated by the management to us, even verbally, that wearing salwar kameez is forbidden at the institute.           
	It is not acceptable that a school which teaches Tagores ideals and songs would resort to such arbitrary and chauvinistic practices. It blatantly violates the principle of personal liberty of citizens in a democratic society. It is recommended that children be taught the distinction between decent and improper dresses from an early age. But salwar kameez does not look indecent  at least not on a young girl of eight. This reflects a growing and unhealthy trend among certain sections of our society to dictate dress-codes to women. The recent controversies about whether female teachers should be allowed to wear salwar-kameez in schools bear testimony to this fact.          
	The officials of Dakshinee did not even deign to inform us or take care of our child in the interim. Thankfully a parent of another pupil gave us a call, and when we reached the institute, we saw our child profusely weeping, standing in the street in front of the Dakshinee building. It is a shame that a centre dedicated to cultural excellence espouses obnoxious doctrines and has no place in it for humane sentiments.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Another captain          
	Sir  Away Test wins (Aug 4) lists Indias win over Australia by 59 runs in Melbourne in 1981 among Indias Test victories abroad. The compilation also mentions that Indias win came under the captaincy of Bishan Singh Bedi. But the captain of that Indian team was Sunil Gavaskar, Bedi having restired from Test cricket a couple of years earlier.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sajal Kanti Ghosh, Baruipur

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Kingdom of dirt and muck 
                                                                                                                 KINGDOM OF DIRT AND MUCK                                   Malvika Singh                              
	The cockroach is a deft creature that manages to invade our lives, our living spaces, our privacy, our possessions and it multiplies by the minute, becoming the foremost candidate to replace the tiger as our national animal! The grand and regal tiger that represents law and order, good governance, strength and beauty, has been decimated by us in our greed for the quick buck. Its elimination has been condoned in pursuit of the easy vote that symbolizes the failure of the ruling authority to deliver balanced rules and norms.         
	The cockroach, on the other hand, is all-invasive, inevitably appearing to grab the crumbs left behind, climbing up the gutters to get into the lives of people, burrowing into the privacy of clothes in the cupboards, congregating wherever there is dirt and muck, strong enough to evade and become immune to all repellents, and to survive a nuclear holocaust! What does the cockroach kingdom remind you of? We should replace the national animal  the already-destroyed, majestic tiger  with this devious little creature that has overwhelmed us and has learned to stay put, despite DDT.        
	We destroy and degrade our environment. Animals maintain the delicate but essential balance of nature. We carelessly step out of our limits, while they remain within the confines of their space except when we enter their domain to exploit it. As forests dwindle and animal habitats shrink, the denizens of the forests move out to find prey, and then we kill them, forgetting that we have usurped their territory. Intelligent leadership in this new millennium is faced with the challenge of ensuring the growth and health of both kingdoms, one utterly vulnerable and the other, able to sustain itself.         
	Bureaucrats cannot devise the formula. It is the political leadership, with a will to deal with such issues, that will have to work in tandem with wildlife and environmental experts in the field to evolve a strategy which will begin the process of urgent restoration, both intellectual and physical.                
	The legacy        
	To politicians of the Left and Right all this sounds like emotional rubbish, but, in fact, their inability to govern according to the rules of the planet and nature has proven their incompetence as men and women who had once been entrusted with the duty to rule. But they have betrayed the trust. They have failed pathetically in their task. The Indian State now believes that it can pacify the anger of neglected tribal and other marginal communities by handing over the last tracts of forest lands to them and thus ease the governmental guilt for having exploited the poorest of the poor.         
	Nature will take its revenge. It will devour those that have ripped into its core and raped it. It will come in a fury as did the tsunami. Every environmental norm that is abused and broken has already caused much grief in areas that have been consciously degraded in the name of development.        
	Wherever the government at the Centre has failed to deliver the basic dignity of life and living, local political dispensations have usurped more and more pristine areas to degrade them. Short term grab-and-run policies have diseased our planet and infected it with deadly viruses that we shall be forced to leave behind for our children. That will be our only legacy for them.        
	Why has simple, straightforward common sense, laced with selfless policies and stern accountability of those empowered to legislate, not been actively pursued? Why have governments betrayed the people and have been allowed to cover up their inappropriate rule by remaining in denial and reacting only in a crisis situation and even then, without a clear and definite goal to conserve and protect?

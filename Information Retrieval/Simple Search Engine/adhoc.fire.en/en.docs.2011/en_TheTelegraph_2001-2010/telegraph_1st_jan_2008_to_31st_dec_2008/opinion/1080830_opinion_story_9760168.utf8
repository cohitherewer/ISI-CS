	A n image in Jasmeen Pathejas exhibition, Running Amok (August 2-13 at 46 Satish Mukherjee Road), brought to mind an untitled photograph made by the brilliant Czech photographer, Miroslav Tich. Tichs black-and-white image shows the long, bare limbs of a woman in an impossibly short, white dress, sitting with her left leg across her right. Remarkably, the left leg (in stockings?) is a shade darker than the other, making it look as if it belongs to someone else altogether. In Pathejas photograph, a girl sits on an inflated, plastic settee with a doll with dangling arms and legs on her lap. In a delicious switch between the real and the unreal, the photograph seems to suggest that it is the doll, and not the girl, that has the human arms and legs. Tichs image prods us to question and scrutinize. The womans face in his picture has been kept out of the frame. We wonder if this is deliberate. What does his photograph tell us about desire, or the ethics employed to frame the object of ones desire? Or about torment, for that matter? Pathejas photograph, apart from the element of surprise, has nothing else to offer.        
	Cartier-Bresson is supposed to have said of photography, There are only coincidences. It is coincidence that binds Tichs image to Pathejas in a continuum across time and space .Thus, extraordinary and perfectly ordinary photographers sharing themes and replicating images is not uncommon. However, what sets their work apart, inevitably, is the difference in finesse between them.         
	Pathejas images also appear clichd because of their faithful depiction of a certain kind of urban Indianness. Already, there are enough photographers taking pictures of city markets, mannequins, men selling womens underwear, posters of deities, cut-outs of iconic movie stars on the beach, glasses filled with frothy liquid in a sooty kitchen-sink, and we can do without one more photographer joining this burgeoning brood. What is sorely missed in Pathejas collection of images, as is the case with many other young photographers today, is a capacity to create something invigoratingly new that could set her work apart and would outlast the initial shock of the new. Pathejas camera does not speak in a universal language that can transcend space, time or culture  an element crucial to her medium. On several other occasions, be it in Commute (still women in a moving, lurching tube train) or Running Tanisha (girl in a red jumper skipping along on a shady street, her hair swishing up like an Indian chiefs feather hat), she consciously opts for an international, but equally unoriginal, stylization.         
	But it is not as if Patheja lacks talent. She has an eye for detail, as is evident in the manner she captures the tight muscles of the shoulder and at the back of the neck of the woman who strains to read the tiny scrawl on a wall covered with coloured slips of paper. There is also the picture of the two hair brushes, their prickly, fence-like ends bearing grey strands of a womans hair. This photograph, unlike the rest in the exhibition, makes us want to know more about this womans invisible presence.

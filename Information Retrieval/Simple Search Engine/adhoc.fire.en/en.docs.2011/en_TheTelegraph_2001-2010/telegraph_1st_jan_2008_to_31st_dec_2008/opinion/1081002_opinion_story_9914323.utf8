                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TO SPEAK OR NOT TO SPEAK                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	The tainted milk scandal is still making waves. With 22 brands having been found contaminated with melamine (including Olympic sponsor, Yili), people are angry with celebrities whove endorsed them. Some celebrities have apologized and promised to donate the earnings from these endorsements to fund the medical bills of the sick babies. Reporters have been asking whether the celebrities have themselves used these milk products for their babies.        
	Intellectuals across the country are filled with shame at their guilt. We are wearied by the struggle between remaining silent and speaking out. Will our conscience become numb... if we stay silent for too long? If that happens, it would signify the end of our morality and spirituality, writes Cui Weiping, film scholar and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, in her blog. Cui recalls her rural cousin telling her in 2005 that farmers near Shanghai had discovered that the pesticide they had used for their rice crop was poisonous, as their pigs began dying after eating the chaff from that rice. So they decided to buy rice from elsewhere for themselves, and sold the poisoned rice to Shanghai buyers.         
	Cui kept quiet about this, thinking no official would pay attention to her if she informed them. To speak, or not to speak, this is the question. But what weve lost is the ability to make basic moral judgments. Similar agonizing thoughts are being aired by senior journalists who delayed publishing the news about babies getting kidney stones after consuming baby powder in deference to the harmony required by the government during the Olympics. Local newspapers in the affected provinces were reporting the news without naming any brand.                 
	Ugly truth        
	It was only on September 11 that SanLu was named for the first time in a news report. The reporter who decided to do so has written a long explanation on one of Chinas popular websites on why he took the risk of being sued not only for defamation but also for weakening domestic brands. His post got 80,000 hits in two days; after that, it was taken off the website. Meanwhile, search engine Baidu has denied that it offered to delete all negative references to SanLu for three million yuan.        
	After weeks of denial and shifting the blame, SanLu apologized in public. We feel really sad, said its vice president, at this food safety accident. Accident? The full ramifications of the cover-up are now out and no one has come out clean. The New Zealand prime minister claims credit for having pushed the Chinese government into action. But why didnt Fonterra, the New Zealand company that has a 43 per cent stake in SanLu, go public with its suspicions after its requests to SanLu to investigate the milk powder went unheeded?        
	The list of the guilty is long, and high on it are those in the Chinese Communist Party responsible for media affairs. In the beginning of August, official (Party-controlled) media sponsored a campaign called 30 years: brands that have changed the lives of Chinese. Among the first brands they chose was SanLu. By then, reports of ailing babies had already started coming in, though SanLu had not been named. But the correspondent who wrote all the articles, including the one on the governments food industry website, was fully aware that SanLu was the unnamed company, because he was no journalist but a PR official of SanLu! Again, it was SanLus PR manager who carried the Olympic torch, along with the local communist party official in her city. She too wrote articles on SanLu for government websites. Which is worse? Maos media, when it was difficult to distinguish political propaganda from news, or the media controlled by todays market reform driven Party, in which commercial advertising has become news?

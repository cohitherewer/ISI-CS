                              Intermission      
	 When in power, be serious. When within smelling distance of it, be even more serious. That is the message LK Advani, the BJPs prime minister-in-waiting, has got from his party think tank. Other than politics, Advani is known to be passionate about two things: cricket and films. Cricket these days is becoming more and more amenable to TV-viewing, so Advaniji has no problems following the game from his drawing room. But one of his greatest pleasures used to be watching films, particularly new releases, on the big screen, often with family, friends and the films lead actors for company. The last such outing was to the Plaza theatre, to watch the Aamir Khan production, Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na. But the happy pop-corn days are over, it seems. Some party leaders feel that the lauha purush watching films at multiplexes might project a frivolous image of him just before the elections. As if that were not enough, now there is strict supervision over Advanis public utterances and meetings as well. And thus, with a heavy heart, the PM-in-waiting prepares for the hustings.                        
	 Yet another BJPwallah has been made to face the music. The man in question is Prakash Javdekar, the party spokesman, who was recently caught on camera shaking a bottle of champagne at a corporate function in Indore. The picture found a prominent place in all the local newspapers. The Congress wasted no time in labelling Javdekar the real face of the BJP  a party with a difference. The embarrassment in the saffron family has led to the chief of the Madhya Pradesh BJPs disciplinary committee toeing the Congress line. Word has reached the Delhi leadership too. Amid all the din, Javdekar has been trying to tell everyone that what he had been holding and drinking was nothing more sinful than fruit champagne. Could someone please lend him a ear?                            
	 From Jammu to Orissa, the stars are not favourable at the moment. Neither are the stars of the stars. Before the ugly war of words between the two Khans, Salman and Shah Rukh, at Katrina Kaifs birthday party could fade out of the gossip columns, comes the news of another showdown in B-town. This one involves old buddies and gym partners, Sanjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty. The two had a heated exchange on the sets of Shettys film, EMI. Sanju was supposed to make a guest appearance in the film. After his part was shot, Sanjay felt that he was looking rather plump on the screen and wanted the scenes to be re-shot. Shetty is known to have conceded, but Sanjay failed to show up at a media interaction planned to promote the film. Insiders say that a livid Shetty then went to a dubbing studio to meet Sanjay and a verbal duel ensued. Requests for cooperation and fresh dates to finish the project were not welcomed at all. Thankfully, before the exchange could graduate into a fight, Shetty was escorted out. Alls well that ends without injury, or whatever it is that they say.                            
	 If its campaigns are anything to go by, then the UPA government must be really dedicated to womens empowerment. Then why is it that there isnt a single woman officer of joint secretary or additional secretary rank in its finance ministry? Or for that matter, in the ministries for petroleum, civil aviation, power, commerce and industry, textiles, environment, and in the departments of banking and insurance and defence production? And that too when there are six vacancies in petroleum, seven in power, five in banking and insurance, 12 in commerce and industry, 15 in defence production, five in civil aviation and five in textile? Thats a word-deed mismatch.                            
	 Tarry a while before rooting for Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyaam party. For it may not be called by that name, after all. A doctor from Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh has already filed an application with the Election Commission to register a political party with the same name. The only way for the Telugu superstar to be the king of Praja Rajyaam is to make the Kadapa doc withdraw his application. How difficult can that be for someone whos worked his charm beautifully on the Souths filmdom?                            
	 Why are Congressmen and women, Harkesh Bahadur, Harish Rawat, Chandresh Kumari and Ram Prakash, getting so many visitors bearing gifts and flowers these days? Because these four have recently been appointed observers for recommending candidates to the party high command for the Delhi assembly elections.                
	 What does it take to win Madams heart? Dont ask Arjun Singh, he doesnt know the answer himself. Desperate for a favourable sign from 10 Janpath, Singh first pushed for reservation for minorities in higher educational institutes. But the courts played spoilsport and shot down the proposal, leaving a seething Singh in the cold. Now, the HRD minister has hit upon a new plan: he recently chaired a meeting of the board of governors of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and ordered the removal of the lotus as the logo of the Kendriya Vidyalayas. The national flower, we all know, reminds Singh and Co. of their arch rivals. And hence, an attempt to remove the saffron influence in education, however much that may cost the 980-odd KVs. But it might still not help Singh win Madams affections. For the logo for the KVs was adopted during the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru. Oops! Seems like some more trouble is in store for the poor man.

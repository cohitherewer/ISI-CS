                              Clean sweep      
	 We always knew that Rahul Gandhis visions were of a different order. Only recently, he had introduced corporate-style interviews for candidates hoping to become office-bearers in the Congress. Then he drew up the blueprint for the creation of the aam admi ka sipahi force, though Congressmen are not traditionally known to have any soldier-like qualities. And now, the young party gen-sec has launched a campaign to make it mandatory for Congress workers aspiring to national and state bodies of the youth Congress or the students wing to come armed with their PAN cards. This is a cleanliness drive that has no need for brooms and mops and disinfectants. Yet, at the end of it, the party will emerge squeaky clean. Old hands are heard to be taking wagers on Rahuls success with the PAN-card idea, given that only a few Congressmen have managed to develop the habit of filing income tax returns. Besides, isnt the average Congressman too aam an admi to fall into the tax bracket? But come filing season, dont be surprised if you see a separate queue for Congress workers at the Aaykar Bhavan.          
	 Mani Shankar Aiyar has been troubled by the unrest in paradise. Aiyar, who visited the Dal Lake only a few months back, had been surprised to find a throng at a concert at the venue on a working day. He had also partaken of other heavenly pleasures: a leisurely shikara ride, for instance, during which Aiyar, taken in with the lakes beauty, apparently forgot about the boatman who had been ferrying him for hours. He soon made amends though, offering his apologies as well as a handsome tip to the exhausted man. The present turmoil has left Aiyar wondering how things change at short notice. There is no peace in Kashmir now. That can only mean no more trips on the lake for poor Aiyar.                            
	 Fali H. Major last voted 10 years ago. No, there is nothing wrong with the voters list, we are told. Its just that the Indian air force chief has mostly been away from home during elections. The armed forces, reportedly, is teeming with men like Major who, incidentally, has cast his ballot just four times in his long career. To end the plight of his colleagues, Major is now pushing to streamline the voting system for defence personnel in a bid to secure their democratic right. But this major initiative, the grapevine tells us, has left the netas cold. Now is that because an armymans vote, unlike the aam aadmis, is difficult to rig?                            
	 Guess who is trying to play the peacemaker to bring the Left and the Right together again? It is none other than the southern patriarch, M Karunanidhi. Apparently, Karunanidhi has been burning the midnight oil, trying to reunite the Congress and the Left parties after they fell out bitterly over the Indo-US nuclear deal. Karunanidhi, reportedly, caught up with the Congress president recently and expressed his desire to forge an alliance with both her party and the communists in his home state. Madam too, one learns, was not unwilling but the CPI(M) gen-sec, Prakash Karat, refused to come on board. Meanwhile, Karunanidhis party lent full moral support to the recent All-India strike that was called by Left trade unions. But will this be enough to melt Karats heart and bridge the distance between the warring partners?                            
	 The third front, it appears, is on the verge of collapse, even before the groundwork could be laid. Prakash Karat is said to have done some repair work but that came undone at the hands of a disinterested Mayavati. Ajit Singh too is on his way out, hitching a ride on the BJP bandwagon, after being humiliated by Behenjis high-handed ways. Former PM Deve Gowda tried to keep Singh in the flock but was tersely told that the RLD supremo could not possibly be seen begging Behenji for seats in his own lair. Hearing this, Gowda urged Karat to save the front but the wily leader did nothing, knowing that his party simply did not have the numbers in UP to bring pressure on Singh. So its curtains for yet another third front. Anxious BSP party workers must be wondering whether it is the end of their bosss prime ministerial dreams as well.                            
	 An SMS doing the rounds goes like this: BJP has got Amarnathji/ Congress has got Amar Singhji.                     
	 The entrance that once promised dancing beauties in nights smelling of alcohol, currency notes and raw lust will now welcome men and women seeking a healthy and morally upright lifestyle. Mumbais legendary Deepa dance bar  that lovely lady of Vile Parle whom scamsters, cricketers, dons, gamblers and politicians found irresistible  will soon emerge in the avatar of Swami Baba Ramdevji Yog Chiktsa Kendra. Abdul Karim Telgi is once said to have given the dancer, Tarannum, a note bath here. The currency collected added up to over a million rupees. Even if Tarannum were to come to her old den now, she would strictly have to dance to the tune of Baba Ramdev  and do anulom-vilom instead of her jhatkas. Many, including Sanjay Dutt, have lauded the change of heart of Deepas owner. But most are secretly wishing that the old order hadnt changed. One of them was heard ruing the fact that Ramdev has replaced Kamdev.

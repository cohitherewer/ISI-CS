	Inflation is not welcome in any country, but in this country it wears a particularly scary mask. Incomes do not go up automatically with prices, so most people suffer an erosion of their purchasing power when prices go up, and have to make do without their fancied little luxuries. Paranoia is reinforced by the fact that the government publishes its latest figure of the wholesale price index every Thursday evening; if it gets tired calculating it on Thursday, then by the time people get to work on Friday. Annual inflation, as measured by this index, has been running in double digits for three months now; that is a long time for the people to bear the mental burden. The National Democratic Alliance government had got them used to inflation close to four per cent; memories of those days made the burden even more onerous.         
	Distressed by the peoples sufferings, the government would like to tell them that their index is inaccurate; for years it has been in the throes of conceiving a new one. Those labours seem to be about to yield a lemon. Just why so much effort was put into revising the wholesale price index remains a mystery. All over the world, inflation is measured by the retail price index; after all, it is retail prices that common consumers pay. But this country prefers to be an outlier if it cannot manage to be a pioneer. It has three cost-of-living indices, just in case the people start taking any one of them too seriously; and it publishes them only once a month, with the usual delays. That has deprived the retail price indices of all news value; the press hardly takes notice of them. There is no earthly reason why the retail price indices cannot be published every week, just like the wholesale price index, but that would be too reasonable a thing for the government to do.        
	Meanwhile, with the constant focus on year-on-year inflation, no one has noticed that the wholesale price index has hardly stirred in the past five weeks; it has hovered between 240.2 and 240.8. For comparison, in the three previous periods of five weeks, it had risen by 5.9, 2.8 and 1.1 points respectively. This rough-and-ready observation suggests that inflation has been slackening  in fact, that it has ground to a halt for the present. In other words, if it were calculated over just the recent weeks, there is no inflation. This is good news, and if the government wanted people to feel good, it would advertise it. But the Indian government is engaged in bigger matters such as atomic diplomacy; the prime minister is about to fly off to Washington to indulge in bonhomie on the subject with the American president. May he enjoy himself; in the meanwhile, let the consumer enjoy the respite from inflation.

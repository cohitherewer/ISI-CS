	There are not many international examples left for Indian communists to draw their lessons from. But this one from the Maoists of Nepal could make the likes of Prakash Karat rethink their strategies. Prachanda, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), will contest the elections to the constituent assembly due in April. This should appear to be the most logical thing for any party to do once it has decided to accept electoral democracy. Maoist leaders of Nepal waged a 13-year-long armed struggle in the name of the people. Violence, fear and force were keys to their strategy. The time has now come for them to face the popularity test without the help of the gun. Whether Prachanda wins or loses the polls is not half as important as the fact that he has decided to face the test. The difference with the top leaders of Indian communist parties is striking. Mr Karat, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or A.B. Bardhan, his counterpart in the Communist Party of India, heads parties claiming to represent the people without caring to be elected by the popular vote. The elections within their parties are not democratic affairs and do not entitle them to represent the common people. 
    
	The practices of Indian communist parties would not have mattered if their leaders did not exercise the kind of influence that they do in public policy and affairs. And this role of unelected leaders is not just undemocratic; it undermines the role and power of elected leaders. In a democracy, leaders who are not accountable to the people should have no role in deciding or implementing public policies. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is answerable to the people of Bengal for his governments performance. Mr Karat or Biman Bose, secretary of the CPI(M)s Bengal unit, has no such responsibility. Yet, both have enormous powers to decide how Bengal should be administered. The contrast with the democratic parties such as the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party is obvious. The Indian communists have come a long way from when they called Parliament a pig sty. They have long embraced the parliamentary system, even if somewhat half-heartedly. But then, communists everywhere are known to be slow learners. It is doubtful, therefore, if the Indian comrades would follow the example of Nepals Maoists anytime soon.

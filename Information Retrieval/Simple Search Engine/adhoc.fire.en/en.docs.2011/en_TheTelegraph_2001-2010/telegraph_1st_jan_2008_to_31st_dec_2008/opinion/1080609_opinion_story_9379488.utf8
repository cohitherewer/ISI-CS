	A rebellion is an expensive thing to keep up. People in most of the north-eastern states have been compelled to go on paying for the various movements in their name for years. That system is well-established, as in Assam, where there is big money made from industries and institutions. Elsewhere, as in Manipur, it is the small traders and factory owners who bear the brunt of extortions, which in turn, are much smaller in scale compared to the amounts in Assam, although as damaging to those who pay. But the people of Manipur have always been in the forefront of organized protest. A series of protests by transporters, labourers, rickshaw-pullers and even film personalities in the last two months has shown that, whatever their feelings of fear or sympathy, people are finding the rebel groups unceasing demands insupportable. Shops and factories are now closing, because what the militant groups are asking for is way beyond what factory owners or various traders associations feel they can afford. Around 20 pharmacies in Thoubal have shut. The Chemists and Druggists Association of Thoubal decided this, since it could not make the required payment of two lakh rupees by May 31. The shops will remain closed till the demand is withdrawn. It is the same with brickfields in Imphal West, whose owners shut their gates, leaving hundreds of daily wage-earners without their jobs. It is not the owners alone who have to pay; each of the trucks carrying coal to the kilns has taxes levied on it by various groups. In a strange irony, owners and labourers joined in the protest against continued extortion.        
	The different rebel groups claims to championing the interests of the people, region, or tribe sit strangely with the tribulations and difficulties that the people have to go through for their sake. Caught between the violence of the militants on the one hand and of the military on the other, the people of Manipur are now faced with the shutting of factories and shops because of continuing extortion.

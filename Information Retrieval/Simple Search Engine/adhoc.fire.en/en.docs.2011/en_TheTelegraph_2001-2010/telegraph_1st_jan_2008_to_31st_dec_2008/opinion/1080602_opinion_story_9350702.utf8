	Children love attention, adults like to be famous, and television companies want to make lots of money. This combination of desires is crucial to the success of the many childrens talent contests that vie with one another on Indian television. In most of these shows, the talent is confined to singing and dancing in the popular cinematic style, and the role models remain unabashedly adult. So there is the shock of watching the little Shah Rukhs and the little Bipashas with their strained, half-comprehending smiles trying to mimic the motions of grown-up seductiveness. But there is the equally sinister spectacle of the parents anxious stakes in their childrens winning and losing, the extent to which the former would go for the glory of the latter. There is now going to be a third party in these bizarre dealings  the State. The National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, overseen by the women and child development minister, is going to study the lawfulness of such shows in terms of existing legislation on child labour. The minister is concerned about the conditions in which children might find themselves being groomed for these shows and about the kinds of pressure that might be put on them to win the top prizes. This is both a question of values and of physical safety. The commissions findings might well result in the tightening of regulations around such shows  involving, of course, the information and broadcasting ministry.        
	The diversity of childrens lives in India, and the range of work they do, from the hazardous to the lethal, should put enough on the Centres plate of a profoundly urgent nature, for it not to have to waste its resources on matters of less immediate importance. Providing the basic infrastructure of education, health and safety, and for the proper implementation of all the aspects of the current Juvenile Justice Act, has shown up alarming shortcomings in the work of both Central and state governments. Increasing the Centres regulatory powers over TV channels is hardly the right way of addressing these basic failures.

	Waste side of the story               
	Blood of the Earth (Penguin, Rs 450) by Dilip Hiro takes up the battle for the worlds vanishing oil resources. The first section of the book, Oil: a biography, is a political biography of oil. The book is also an oil travelogue of sorts, darting back and forth between the US Midlands and the Gulf countries. But above all, this is a book whose primary aim is to expose the American (read Bush familys) conspiracy to strip the world of its oil resources. Agreed, this is one expos that has been done to death, but it still does not cease to amaze how an alcoholic and incompetent George W. Bush was bailed out time and again by his powerful father and by US industrial giants. But the obsession with America is also the books weakness, from which Hiro recovers somewhat in the third section, Alternatives to oil, where Latin America, South and East Asia and Africa make an appearance. Thankfully, Hiro is not a doomsayer, but a pragmatist, albeit a bit political.                                
	The Killing of an Author (Invisible Man, Rs 195) by Richard Crasta is the reconstruction of the literary past of the Tao of cleverness. Crasta can take pride in the fact that the self-deprecating-but-ultimately-self-congratulatory tone that his writing epitomizes has gone on to launch a thousand newspaper columns. Thanks to this book  a product of the authors own publishing venture  we now have the low-down on American creative writing programmes, the Indian civil service, meet the editor sessions, famous authors as mentors, conceiving books and children at the same time, publishers parties and much more. It was at a publishing party that Crasta met Jackie Kennedy (the protagonist of Crastas The Revised Kama Sutra wrote letters to the former US first lady). If this book is to be believed, then the pleasures of being a subversive writer are fewer than the pains. But then again, had it been the other way round, this book would not have been written.                        
	Who Stole My Energy (Macmillan, Rs 195) by Ariana Trinity might fox you into thinking that it is about the depletion of energy resources in the world. But one can always rely on an author named Trinity to be a little more personal than that. When you feel drained of energy, then follow Trinitys example and turn to spirituality. And for heavens sake, dont ever try to find out who stole your energy. In nine cases out of ten, the answer would be you.

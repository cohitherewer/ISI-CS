The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | exit, pursued by politics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             EXIT, PURSUED BY POLITICS                                                          
	The inevitable does not produce any sense of shock. A month ago, The Telegraph wrote in these columns, Singur is a chronicle of a disaster foretold. Ratan Tatas announcement last evening that he was pulling the Nano project out of Singur only confirms what The Telegraph had apprehended. There is thus no shock. Perhaps a twinge of sadness, but more than that a nagging fear that West Bengal will continue to sink into the quicksand into which the states politicians put it way back in the Sixties. Mr Tata very generously described West Bengal as a state with potential. What he left unsaid was that a state and a people without the power and the ability to fulfil its and their potential earn no forgiveness from history.        
	Mr Tata did not mince his words about why he was forced to leave, and why West Bengal will remain stagnant. He said emphatically that it was the politics of agitation, rallies and demonstrations that compelled him. He was referring to what Amartya Sen, in a recent piece in The Telegraph, called the attraction of street activism. In the particular instance of the Nano project, it was the utterly meaningless agitation of Mamata Banerjee, the prima donna of the Trinamul Congress, that caused the retreat from a very crucial project of industrialization. But there is no sign that the ruling party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has abandoned the politics of street activism that it so assiduously and, for the state, disastrously followed in the past. History will make Ms Banerjee responsible for the failure of West Bengal to finally get the Nano project, but it will not also spare the communists for their failure to nurture a congenial environment for industry and investment by making a fine art of street-fighting and displays of cadre power. Ms Banerjee has hoist Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with a petard the CPI(M) made.        
	It is difficult to exaggerate the consequences and implications of Mr Tatas decision for the investment climate of West Bengal. The state of the climate was revealed by the chief ministers assurance to Mr Tata that his enterprise would be provided full security and protection. If a manufacturing unit needs police protection for functioning then that is a sign that prevailing conditions are not ripe for industrialization. All those who had considered West Bengal a possible investment destination will take note of these developments, and will, with some justification, take West Bengal off their maps.        
	The circumstances demand that the people of West Bengal  members of civil society, the common people and the political leaders  ask themselves two very simple questions. Do they want industrialization? Are they prepared for industrialization in terms of the costs it entails? The existing situation would suggest that, at the moment, the answers to both questions are in the negative. Perhaps West Bengal has got an apposite Puja present.

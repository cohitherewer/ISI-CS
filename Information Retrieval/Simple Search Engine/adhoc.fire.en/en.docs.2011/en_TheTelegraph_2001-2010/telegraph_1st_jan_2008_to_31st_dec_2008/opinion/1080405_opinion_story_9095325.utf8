The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dreams come alive in a solitary darkness
                                                                                                                 DREAMS COME ALIVE IN A SOLITARY DARKNESS                              Soumitra Das      Visual Arts                                                
	Veteran artist Amitabha Banerjee, an exhibition of whose works at Akar Prakar was significantly titled, Imprints off a Sensitive Soul (March 19 to April 2), is best know for his graphic work. And this exhibition provided evidence enough of his mastery of the medium.         
	Banerjee spent the early years of his life in the isolation of his home on the isle of Sandwip, close to the mouth of the river Meghna in Bangladesh. So it is understandable that a sense of solitude pervades his works, and the images of birds, love-lorn women and flowers, which recur in his drawings, paintings and prints, are all depicted in a half-light.         
	His forte being printmaking, some of the strongest works at this exhibition were his intaglios and dry points. He had honed his skills in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties at the small studio opened by the Society of Contemporary Artists. Their poetic mood notwithstanding, these graphic works are distinguished by the precision with which they are done. The paintings and drawings look somewhat vague by comparison in terms of execution.        
	Of course, printmaking techniques require a certain degree of exactitude, but here a precision of thought is also involved. The intaglio showing a tiny butterfly hovering over a landscape of bushes and boulders has a delicacy of touch, yet the craggy surface of stone is clearly depicted. The petals of the noctilucent flowers, the faces of the women seemingly in a trance and the roosting birds are marked by the same feeling beauty. Yet the play of light and shade is so subtle that it definitely required technical skills of a high degree. Although the owl, an intaglio executed way back in 1970, is a typical product of those times and looks somewhat dated, it is tightly structured and has an architectural quality about it.         
	An etching, entitled The Mirror, executed in 1971, demonstrates how simplicity itself can be the strength of a work. The importance of lines in this method of printmaking becomes apparent when one scrutinizes this semi-rotund visage ravaged with wrinkles.        
	As a young artist, Banerjee was obviously highly impressed by the drawings and paintings of Rabindranath Tagore, and his own darkling images share a certain degree of kinship with the poets fantastic creations. In a way, dreams seem to come alive in Banerjees works and in keeping with such an ambient mood he uses mostly greens, browns and ochre, often acid-edged.        
	His works in various other media look pale in comparison. They may have the same dark and brooding quality but at times they look nebulous, as if the artist was hesitant. This is not a pleasant quality.

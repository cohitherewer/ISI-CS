	Beneath the pious look                  
	Sir  In his article, A space for integrity (Aug 1), Ashok Mitra applauds the Left parties for their non-participation in the murky drama of horse-trading staged before and during the trust vote in the Lok Sabha. True, as far as the ugly cash for vote episode is concerned, no one can raise a finger against the Left. But how did Mitra forget to mention that it was the Left, which, by withdrawing its support from the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, paved the way for the horse trading? Moreover, the hands of the Left are not as clean as Mitra would have us believe. If the Congress took the help of maligned leaders like Shibu Soren to save its government, then the Left too, in its desperate attempt to topple the government, took the help of the six dissenting members of parliament from the Samajwadi Party (including convicted criminals like Atiq Ahmad and Mukhtar Ansari) who were lured by none other than Mayavati, the latest ally of the Left. The dilemma of the Left is that despite being recognized as a national political party, their presence and impact are confined to just three states  West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. Incidentally, in all these states, Congress is the main, or one of the main, opposition parties. If the Left had continued supporting the Congress at the Centre till the next elections, it would have found it difficult to campaign against its ally before the polls.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Rajesh K. Sharma, Kankinara 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra insists that the Left cannot be bought by wads of currency notes, but ignores the fact that to remain in power in West Bengal, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has proved its expertise in the politics of buying and selling conscience. With an eye on the vote bank, their appeasement approach has pulled down this state into a bottomless abyss where arrogant and irresponsible unions rule the roost, with ample help from the ruling party. Perform or perish is the law of nature but the Left leadership fails to see the writing on the wall. Mitra hails the Lefts integrity and commitment to a cause, but chooses to stay mum on the fact that the party line was clearly not to the liking of many of its members. Whether the line was right or wrong, history will tell. But if commitment were everything, then history would have showered praise on a Hitler or a Charu Majumder for their integrity to warped causes.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabir K. Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Lefts so-called integrity is actually its inability to decide on a course of action. The leftists in India are perpetually stuck between their paranoia regarding the United States of America and their yearning for political power. Why did they leave any room for negotiation with the UPA if they were so strongly against the nuclear deal? This shows how their sheer craving for power prevents them from acting realistically.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Joyati Bhattacharya, Silchar

                
	Sir  What Ashok Mitra identifies as the Lefts principles and conviction, appear to me as qualities that make the leftists put their party before the country. They have been opposing the Indo-US nuclear deal, which will be beneficial to India, only because the US is a party to the deal. Mitra hopes that there would be increasing appreciation of the Left as standard-bearers of principle and integrity. One wonders how a party that considers its own constitution more important than that of the country, will ever be appreciated by anyone other than a communist.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ajit Kr Mukherjee, Jamshedpur

                
	Speech therapy          
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas Like father, like son (Aug 2), was a delight to read, particularly the reproduction of Behram Contractors fictitious account of preparations for Rajiv Gandhis visit to Bombay. The culture of sycophancy, unfortunately, runs very strongly in the blood of most Indians. It may even be our second most important trait, after corruption.           
	Wise politicians in the past used to discourage such practice. I remember hearing live on All India Radio, Acharya Kripalini speaking at a rally in Delhi after the Janata Partys victory in March 1977, advising his followers never to touch the feet of politicians, as then they would trample on such people.           
	Rahul Gandhis speech on July 22 in the Lok Sabha reminded me of my school days when students had to stand up and recite mugged up poems or answers. Only a sycophantic party like the Congress would consider it high oratory. Yet another trend is that of promoting family members to leadership positions. The Congress is again ahead of the rest in this respect, submitting to dynastic rule with a glee that ought to put the people of a civilized nation to shame. The first family of the Congress thus looks set to reign for a long time to come.           
	However, I do not agree with Guha that Mohammed Salims speech was among the best on July 22. It was no more than a theatrical performance fit for the Calcutta Maidan.           
	Yours faithfully,

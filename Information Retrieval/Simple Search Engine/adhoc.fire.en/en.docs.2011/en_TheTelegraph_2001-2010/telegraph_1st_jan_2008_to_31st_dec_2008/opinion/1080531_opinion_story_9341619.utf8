	The spotlight that has shifted from Shri Panch Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva should rightly fall on Sitaram Yechury, to whom the United Progressive Alliance government virtually outsourced Indias relations with Nepal. Since he has been the principal interlocutor between the two countries, our expectations of a stable and responsible regime that is mindful of Indias interests on a strategic border are largely concentrated in him. Much will depend on how Yechury has presented the Indian national position, as distinct from his own ideological inclinations, to Prachanda and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).        
	Strictly speaking, the transformation of the worlds only Hindu kingdom into a republic is no concern of Indias. Forms of governance are internal matters. But since domestic evolution is intertwined with foreign policy, especially for a landlocked country whose fortunes are so closely linked with those of its southern neighbour, New Delhi will carefully watch how the new men in Kathmandu conduct themselves in the coming weeks and months. The jubilant crowds we see on television screens speak of relief and hope. Since neither is a permanent factor in the merry-go-round of politics, those crowds can just as easily turn either into the Maoist mobs that have ravaged Nepal for years or protesters to be mown down like the civil wars 13,000 victims.               
	This column has earlier cited statistical evidence suggesting that however conclusive Tuesdays voting might have appeared, abolition of neither the monarchy nor of Nepals Hindu status enjoys universal endorsement. Despite Prithvi Narayan Shahs merger of some 60 principalities in 1768, Nepalese society remains extraordinarily diverse for the countrys size. But adherents of unfashionable causes find it expedient to lie low for the time being with 10,000 Maoist supporters out in the streets of Kathmandu. The four Rastriya Prajatantra Party royalists must be the most courageous persons in Nepal. The other parties might be crushed into permanent silence. On the other hand, they might surface again one day, especially if the new regime does not deliver.        
	Getting rid of an unpopular monarch was the least of Nepals problems, an easy one-point diversion dazzling a hungry populace with circus instead of bread. Even the formal framework of democracy will not satisfy basic needs in a land where the conservative official unemployment rate of 42 per cent  high by any international reckoning  does not reveal the full extent of deprivation. The looming economic challenge concerns India profoundly because of the open 1,700-kilometre border that can, in theory, allow all 29 million Nepalese, most of whom survive on less than a dollar a day, to debouch into Indias plains if they are pressed hard enough in their native hills and valleys.         
	India must be prepared for some version of that danger. But poverty is not the only challenge. Nor the most immediately pressing one. A rudimentary feudal society must see its way towards forging a democratic coalition that can agree on a new constitution and actually work it to ensure growth and establish social order, security and welfare. Considering conditions in some adjoining parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh after 61 years of Indias independence and democracy, that is a tall order. But unlike Indians, the Nepalese have now seen how violence can topple the established order. The precedent is a reminder that even if revolutions dont devour their children, they can beget other revolutions.         
	The offices of state that have to be filled will indicate how power is shared in the new republic. There is talk of punishing war crimes and reforming the existing army which is thought to be royalist. The Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) and the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum will continue to resist Prachandas demand that his Peoples Liberation Army with a nucleus of 3,000 ideologically committed cadres is integrated with the army. An amicable resolution is imperative not only to save a fragile political unity which alone can produce a constitution in two years but to ensure that absolute state power, as in the old Soviet Union, is not used to destroy the spirit that infused the revolution.        
	Though two parallel forces have come together to produce this culmination, they have not fused into a single entity with a common agenda. Despite their present cooperation, the constitutional parties, so to speak, did not seek more than a liberal democratic dispensation under a constitutional monarchy. They were coerced by an overpowering CPN(M) into taking a more radical line, the kings persistent obtuseness cutting off their only means of escape. Whether these groups will be allowed to retain a separate and meaningful political identity, contributing to a plural dialogue, depends on the CPN(M)s posture now that it has realized its ambition.        
	This is where Yechurys mission might have been more illuminating. As New Delhis empowered point man, he has repeatedly assured the Maoists that India favours a democratic republic, in effect sealing the monarchys fate. In the process, the authority he enjoyed as New Delhis envoy may have sanctified his ideological persuasion in the eyes of the CPN(M), leading it to believe that India approves of everything it does. Perhaps this overlapping was necessary to draw Prachanda and his men into the mainstream of legitimate politics and persuade them to take part in elections and sit in a constituent assembly. That is certainly a creditable achievement but only if the leopard in harness transforms itself into a different creature from the leopard in the wild.         
	What does India gain from all this? The need for a quid pro quo from Nepals new rulers seems to have escaped attention. We have no evidence that it was impressed on the Maoists that once they assume office, they will also inherit historical, political, social, economic and strategic obligations to the country on which depends Nepals access to the world and its economic development. This is not a question of the treaties that the CPN(M) questions. Its a question of survival for Nepal, the logic of geopolitics that no Nepalese ruler can afford to ignore. India-Nepal relations continue to be guided by the Gujral doctrine of not asking for reciprocity but giving all that (India) can in good faith and trust. But while one can give willingly and generously to a friend, it is more difficult to do so to a hostile neighbour.              
	It is in this context that Yechury, with his blend of ideology and nationalism, might have tried to clear the enigma that is Prachanda. At one time, the Maoist chief swore by the inevitability of unending war with India. Apart from revising treaties, there is talk of banning army recruitment. But the two most important questions are the scope and nature of the new regimes relations with China and its ties with Indias Marxist-Leninist groups. The second is a law and order problem that India can arguably deal with even if the CPN(M) is foolish enough to succour the so-called Red Corridor rebels. But China is the great imponderable. Because Beijing invested heavily in King Gyanendra, there is no reason why it should not also develop ties  if it has not already done so  with his successor. Ideology is less relevant than strategy though ideology might facilitate diplomacy. That is not something India would wish to control, but there must be assurances of a proper regard of this countrys security and economic interests, and no repetition of games like King Mahendras northern route or King Birendras six-point peace zone concept.        
	In the past, India tried to follow the British Indian practice of buttressing the Himalayan thrones in the belief that one monarch was more easily manipulated than a dozen politicians. Now that that alternative has disappeared in Nepal, it must be hoped that the Yechury mission has delineated the basis of a constructive relationship with a Prachanda who recognizes that there is no way he can do without India

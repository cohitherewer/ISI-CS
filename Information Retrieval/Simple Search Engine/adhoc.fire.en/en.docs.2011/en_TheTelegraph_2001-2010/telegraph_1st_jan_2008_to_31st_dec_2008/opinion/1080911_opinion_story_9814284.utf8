	When it comes to cutting down the number of non-European immigrants staying on in Britain, there seem to be two ways of going about it: the BNP way and the balanced way. The British National Party would do it through intimidation and abuse. That is the way of race riots  too uncivilized, even for the most diehard Tory. But now there is a new middle path, which goes by the benign name of Balanced Migration. It is the title of a report based on which the British Home Offices migration advisory committee has worked out its new immigration policy. In a nutshell, skilled immigrants from outside the European Union will not automatically be allowed to settle down in Britain after their four-year work-permits expire, but only if they conform to a number of stricter criteria, and that too within a capped limit of 20,000 people per year, including dependents. Moreover, 300,000 skilled jobs currently open to non-EU migrants will be closed to them under this new system from November. Doctors, nurses, secondary-school teachers and social workers are among this newly guarded lot. But, oddly enough, non-EU sheep-shearers and ballet-dancers are among those with exceptional intellectual, scientific or artistic merit who will be considered, provided their English is good enough, for permanent residency.        
	This is a commonsense agreement that must be put in place if Britain is to be saved from turning into an overcrowded country, the burgeoning population of which would require the building of seven new cities of the size of Birmingham by 2031. The wonderful thing about balanced migration is that it is a cross-party idea, uniting Labour rebels and senior Tories, that kills two birds with one stone: capping non-EU immigration without turning it into a partisan issue, and putting Gordon Brown in his place. Besides, the the report shows overwhelming support for balanced migration from new, black, British citizens. Yet, inextricable from the economic concern about jobs and pressure on public services is the presence of what a former archbishop of Canterbury calls a deep visceral distress regarding the possible demise of Britishness itself. What does it mean to be British in this rapidly changing scenario? And what is happening to the English language? Perhaps, if non-EU ballet-dancers are allowed, an all-Bangladeshi Swan Lake at Covent Garden would become a distinct possibility.

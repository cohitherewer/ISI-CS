INDIA                          - In spite of its cricket mania, India never had a sports culture					 					      SUPRIYA CHAUDHURI                        India vs USSR, Indira Gold Cup, 1985				                                                   
	On March 29, 2008, The Indian Express reported that the Indian womens hockey team, our only hope of a hockey berth at the Beijing Olympics since the men failed to qualify, have not been getting their monthly pay-cheques since last July. The team left for its last qualifying tournament (in Russia) on April 9. Denials and excuses followed the complaint. The president and the treasurer of the Indian Womens Hockey Federation insist there has been no delay. The secretary says that the sponsors have defaulted, and so payments (from Rs 4,000 to 15,000 per month) have been held up, but only from November. The sponsors assert that they have paid the federation in full. The coach, mens Olympic gold medalist M.K. Kaushik, says that this is not the time to be thinking about money, since the team has to focus on its preparation for the Olympics.        
	Is there anything at all surprising about this report? It is entirely of a piece with the sorry tale of administrative incompetence, public apathy and underpaid athletes endlessly reiterated in Indian sports history. Everything about it is typical: the contradictory official statements, the paltry amounts in question, the coachs high-minded dismissal of financial considerations, the athletes own sense of grievance. Against this background, it would be a wonder if the womens team in fact beat the United States of America in Kazan to clinch the only remaining Olympic berth. They last qualified in 1980, but have had some success at the Asian and Commonwealth levels, winning the Commonwealth Games gold medal at Manchester in 2002. That victory, led by Mamta Kharab, still the team captain, inspired the award-winning film Chak De! India.               
	Meanwhile, cheques continue to pour in for cricketers who have signed for the Indian Premier League. Even those who are playing in the Indian Cricket League are well off; those who make it to the BCCIs national team are richly rewarded, both by the board and by the sponsors. Shah Rukh Khan, having done his bit for womens hockey in a film that established, above all, a crucial conjunction between his iconic screen status and the sporting arena, has swiftly passed on to promoting mens cricket through his patronage of the Kolkata Knightriders in the IPL. This association, profitable to both parties, confirms what we already knew about the self-perpetuating nature of iconicity. SRKs star image cannibalized the field of womens sport in Chak De and subsumed its minor triumphs within the already iconic persona of the actor. The IPL draws upon the hypervaluation of mens cricket by the media to promote a league of super-rich gentlemen, while it utilizes SRKs star image to make itself a glamour club. What is particularly remarkable about the exercise is its unashamed acknowledgment that glamour equals money. The more you fetch in the market, the more famous you are. At this superior level, money is no longer a pay-cheque; it is an icon.         
	Money had already come to acquire this unreal, non-material aura in television game shows and contests that masked their kinship to the lottery by staging an elaborate round of competitions to determine the winners of unimaginably large cheques or hugely lucrative contracts. Perhaps it would be cynical to suggest that the IPL will be a competition of this kind, but the format, the timing (the height of summer in India), the rivalry with the ICL, the showbiz trappings, all contribute to the suspicion that what we are about to witness is more an exhibition than a contest.         
	Both have their place in modern sport; but cricket in India seems uniquely set to acquire, through a vigorous cultivation of star value, the status of non-sport or hyper-sport. Ideally placed (like tennis) to draw television sponsors because of the frequency of breaks during which commercials can be shown, cricket is now so inundated with funds, so conscious of itself as spectacle, so naked in its pursuit of screen value, that it seems old-fashioned to ask about the game itself, its necessary skills and painfully acquired competences. As it happens, Im writing this on a day when India was dismissed for 76 in twenty overs at the Motera, in the first innings of the second test match against South Africa.         
	The ambiguous success of Indian cricket, I would suggest, conceals the real undervaluation and neglect of sport in India, the complete absence of anything that could be described as a sports culture. The Indian middle-class turned its back upon sport some time in the Fifties, perhaps compelled by economic insecurity to urge successive generations to pursue  exclusively  academic success or business enterprise. Sport came to be seen as a waste of time for the young (always referred to as students) and unimaginable for adults, except in the case of the very rich who had time for a leisure pursuit; it was never integrated into a way of life. At the school level, sports have some presence in the curriculum; at university (despite the existence of teams and tournaments) sports are invisible. For the aspiring athlete, cricket, football, and to some extent tennis, which command large audiences and attract sponsors, might repay the risk of commitment; though the ordinary state- or club-level cricketer can scarcely make a decent living. But given the scale of public apathy, other sports remained dependent on state patronage, at the mercy of corrupt officials, inefficient organizations, and pathetic infrastructure. As a result, national sports programmes can scarcely sustain long-term commitment at an acceptable level.        
	India has around 20 astroturf pitches for hockey; Holland has over 300. In Bengal, the game is virtually not played any more, though there is a single astroturf pitch at the SAI complex in Salt Lake. Is it only official neglect that is to blame? Absence of infrastructure and the lack of a vigorous sports education policy only reflect general indifference and distrust. For all that we think that we love sport and follow it, for all that we sit before our television sets or crowd the cricket grounds, most Indians actually loathe and fear sport. Athletics attract no interest whatever, though everyone knows about fitness programmes and the affluent visit gyms. The Indian middle class barely suffers its children to play some games in school (virtually never in college). Cricket, tennis and swimming lessons even carry a certain cachet, but such activities are soon overtaken by exam preparation and the relentless grind of the tuition racket.        
	For the vast majority of Indias poor, or its struggling lower middle class, sports ability might hold out the promise of a livelihood, but only at some risk, given that there is no guarantee of adequate diet or insurance against injury. In some instances, the discovery of a genuine talent does persuade a family to invest in sport, but such decisions are never easily taken, whatever the imagined rewards. The family becomes an exception, constantly having to justify its choice in a climate of doubt and anxiety. In such circumstances, the choice will not be made unless there is a real possibility of recognition and success.              
	But a sports culture does not mean a nation of exceptionally gifted athletes. It certainly does not mean fitness as a fashionable lifestyle choice. It means the inclusion of a wide range of sports at all levels of ability in ordinary lives. It is founded on the possibility of participation through childhood to adulthood, in a climate of support and involvement. Talent can emerge from these conditions without having to explain itself at every stage. India never had a sports culture in this sense, and the present cricket mania does not promise one for the future.         
	All that has happened is that the value of the screen icon has come to be attached to the cricketing superstar, investing him with an aura, which is, on examination, no more than the aura of money. Whatever his individual distinction, the glow of hyperbolic success serves to seal him into a media bubble. Interestingly, sportspersons who never quite gained that aura  whatever their successes  have been able to take decisions in defiance of media concerns, as when P. Gopichand refused a Pepsi contract because he did not approve of aerated soft drinks, or when Bhaichung Bhutia decided, unasked, not to participate in the Olympic torch rally. Meanwhile, the women hockey-players wait for their pay-cheques, while SRK, in his new role as IPL owner-manager rather than hockey coach, debates what to do with the 1.3 crore he has paid for Shoaib Akhtar.

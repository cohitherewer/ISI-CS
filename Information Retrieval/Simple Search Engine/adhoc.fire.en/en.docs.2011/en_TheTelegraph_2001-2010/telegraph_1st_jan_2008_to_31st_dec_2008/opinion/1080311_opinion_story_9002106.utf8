                                                                                                                 GROUND REALITY                                                    
	Politics is also the art of the impossible. The National Front or Barisan Nasional, which has retained political control of Malaysia for five long decades, is quietly coming round to see the point. It has suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in recent memory in the just-concluded general elections. The political tsunami, as the results are being popularly called, may not have washed away the coalition completely, but it has severely weakened the ground on which it stands. The National Front has barely managed to retain a simple majority in parliament, and has lost control over vast swathes in the north where a curious political amalgam, representing both ethnic and business interest groups, has seized power. The most prominent constituent of this mixed opposition is the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which is an old thorn by the side of Barisan and now finds its standing unexpectedly improved in two more states, apart from Kelantan, where its radical Islamism has been in full sway. The leftist Democratic Action Party has also made headway with the support of the Chinese community, which has given it control of Penang, the home state of the Malaysian prime minister. Mahathir Mohamad, former prime minister who, till recently, dictated the course of Malaysias future, has concluded this to be shameful, and has conveyed his feelings to his protg, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Mr Badawi, however, is unwilling to call it a day so soon or to take the entire moral responsibility for the debacle.        
	He may have a point in doing so. The principles that have guided government policy for the past few decades  particularly the preferential treatment of the majority Muslim Malay population  that have increased ethnic divides and brought matters to such a pass were not laid down by Mr Badawi. He has merely stringently and systematically followed them to offset the gains made by other parties that have played the game more wantonly and increased the consequent political stakes. Be that as it may, Mr Badawi cannot run away from taking some of the responsibility for creating the political foment. The minorities  the Indians more than the Chinese  now feel more isolated from the mainstream than ever before. The ethnic instability together with the sliding economic situation may even ground Mr Badawi together with his party, the United Malays Organization, sooner than he thinks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THROUGH A VEIL OF MIST                                                                  
	In So Many Words: Womens life experiences from Western and Eastern India, edited by Aparna Basu and Malavika Karlekar, Routledge, Rs 475        
	At the Dolma-La Pass, 18,600 feet above sea level on the way to the abandoned city of Tsaparang in Tibet, Li Gotami, born Rutty Petit in Bombay, had an extraordinary experience. I do not know exactly what happens at that height, she wrote in The Illustrated Weekly of India in 1951, but at that altitude, one feels there is a strange nearness to things that is born of the complete absence of all atmosphere between you and the things you are looking at. It is as though some thin misty veil has gradually dissolved and you start to see everything 100-fold more clearly. This experience is not merely a physical one, but spiritual too, for you also start to feel that something obstructive, which had been standing between you and your inner self all your life, has miraculously fallen away, and left you free to understand that you and the blue waters and the hills and the sky are but one and the same thing. Li Gotami was an artist; to her this unforgettable moment of spirituality could be articulated only in terms of sight.        
	For the reader of In So Many Words, too, this is a unique moment. The collection of personal narratives and an interview of eight remarkable Indian women, born between 1872 and 1913, naturally contains many more such moments. Whether it is Sailabala Das refusing to hand over her silk saris to Mahatma Gandhi in exchange for khadi, or Sarala Devi Chaudhurani (picture) angering her uncle, Rabindranath Tagore, by making a hero of Pratapaditya, a villain in Tagores assessment, or Anasuya Sarabhai claiming that I smoked 10 cigarettes a day with great relish, these women are startling in the originality of their thinking and in their forthrightness. Although, as the editors point out, they tend to be silent about intimately personal experiences, the reflections, memories and commentaries in their public persona are enough to convey their determined independence and strong desire to act positively, whether in politics or in society.        
	The volume brings together women from the east and west of India, so with Sarala Devi, Sailabala or Kalpana Joshi, well known in the East, there are also Vidyagauri Neelkanth, one of the two first women graduates in Gujarat, and a leader in the cause of womens education, Anasuya Sarabhai, who founded the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association on Gandhian lines but would not follow Gandhiji on all things, and Shakuntala Paranjapye, who shocked society by moving about the villages of Maharashtra spreading the message of birth control. They are formidable and funny, adventurous and earnest, obviously very different in their personalities and circumstances, yet similar in their confidence that they can change things. Many of them were educated at a time when women were not so fortunate, but it is what each did with her education that is extraordinary.        
	Preceding the personal narratives are biographical essays, and accompanying the text are rare photographs with explanatory captions. The pictures sometimes tell their own, often different, story. It is impossible not to wish there was more on the photographs, and on their relation to the narratives. That would have been far more illuminating than the recounting of theories in the introduction. The editors appear a little confused as to the purpose and the target readership of the book. There is a little bit of everything and not enough of any. And why these particular women, and not others?                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

	Time, it is generally supposed, endows events with perspective. The Nanavati inquiry commission into the burning of the Sabarmati Express in Godhra and its aftermath, appointed by the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, took six years and 12 extensions to make sure of that perspective. The Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 does not specify how many extensions a commission of inquiry appointed by either the Centre or by a state government is allowed. This commission was satiated with 12; it could have taken 20 more with impunity. The first part of the commissions report, relating to the Godhra burning, says that the coaches were burnt as the result of an extensive conspiracy among the minority community. That the first part of the report should chime in so well with the gradually escalating Hindutva aggression elsewhere  Orissa and Karnataka, for example  is no doubt just a coincidence. The Bharatiya Janata Partys glee may look indecent, but that is purely pseudo-secular prejudice. The party has every reason to cheer.        
	It might seem odd that the second part of the report, to do with the genocide that followed Godhra, will be released quite a few months later, in December. The act does not say that the report should be given at one go. It seems odder that the conclusions of the second part are given ahead. The first part not only declares that the chief minister, Mr Modi, and his ministers did not play any role in the Godhra incident, but also that there were no lapses on their part in providing protection, relief and rehabilitation to the victims of communal riots. The oddest feature of all is that the inquiry report should take it upon itself to answer unasked questions. But no one can say that the commission flouted the act under which it was framed. The U.C. Banerjee inquiry commission, instituted by the railway minister in 2004, reported in 2005 that the fire on the train was an accident. But the report could not be tabled in parliament because the Supreme Court stayed it on the petition of a Godhra survivor since the Nanavati commission was already running. That is exactly according to the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.         
	Godhra, and all terrible events of the kind, end up bristling with commissions. Yet it is the job of institutions such as the police to find facts. Do inquiry commissions betoken a lack of trust in their efficiency, or perhaps in their integrity under political pressure? Or are all policemen failed judges, since judges are preferred as heads of inquiry commissions? Presumably, a commission of inquiry exists in a kind of no-mans land, away from the police and the courts. But that is not quite a guarantee of either efficiency or independence from political pressure. The one thing that inquiry commissions most certainly do is endlessly postpone the possibility of decisive action. Perhaps that is why politicians love them.

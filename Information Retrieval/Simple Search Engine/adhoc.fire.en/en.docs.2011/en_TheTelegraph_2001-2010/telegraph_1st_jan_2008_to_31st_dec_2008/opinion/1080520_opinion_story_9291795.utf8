	In every case of prolonged violence, it is ultimately the state government that has to bear the blame. It is fortunate for the Congress-led government in Assam that the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah has declared a ceasefire after a spate of intense violence in the North Cachar Hills. Before this, Opposition parties had been demanding that the government resign because it had failed in its election promise of preserving the life and security of its people. Most of the victims of the recent killings in the North Cachar Hills, carried out allegedly by the DHD(J), were labourers, railway workers, truck drivers and their helpers. Many of them were from outside the state  which suits one of the purposes of the DHD(J) or the Black Widow group. Professedly campaigning for Dimaraji, or a homeland for the Dimasa tribes in the North Cachar Hills, the DHD(J) is not particularly friendly towards other tribes that inhabit this region where the Dimasas are dominant. It is hardly to be expected that it would welcome migrants. The attacks were also meant to target the Lumding-Silchar-Jiribaum railway gauge conversion project. The destruction the group is wreaking is not confined to assaults on development and communications  the east-west corridor project of the National Highway Authority of India and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation were its pet targets too  but is also infecting others in ironic ways. Four hundred railwaymen and their families, frightened and insecure, destroyed parts of Lumding station in protest against the DHD(J) violence.        
	Militant outfits that live largely by extortion, wrestle for dominance among themselves  as the birth of the DHD(J) from the DHD illustrates  have expediently changing relationships with other groups  as the DHD(J) has with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah)  give cause for wariness when they declare a ceasefire. The DHD(J) did so earlier, in March. But even if the government was being cautious, it seemed too slow in its response to the DHD(J)s eight-point charter. The blame for the apparent lack of coordination between the police and the army must also be laid at its door. The DHD(J) alleged that the army killed its men during the ceasefire, and the last series of killings was a result of that. Declaring the latest ceasefire, the DHD(J) has also said that it will leave the road and railway projects in peace. The state government has perhaps been more fortunate than proactive.

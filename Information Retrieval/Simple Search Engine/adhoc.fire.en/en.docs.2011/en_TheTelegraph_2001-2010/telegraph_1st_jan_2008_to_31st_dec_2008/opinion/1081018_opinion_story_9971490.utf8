	Rich guys dont dance                  
	Sir  Peter Lovatts claim that dancing is the modern human equivalent of courtship displays used by birds and other animals is rather tenuous (Dance like Travolta to floor a woman, Oct 13). What percentage of the global male population can afford to go to nightclubs? Perhaps Lovatt should visit Bengal next Puja to sample our indigenous dance forms like dhunuchi naach. The purpose of wooing is to assure the female of the prowess and dependability of the male. Rather than dancing, a quick peek into the wooers bank balance, in these difficult times, would perhaps yield better results. Men need not always be great dancers to get a ladys attention. Aristotle Onassis may not have been Uday Shankar, but still he managed to floor a first lady.           
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar 
        
	Women at war          
	Sir  Mayavati seems to be taking political vendetta to new levels. Her latest tantrum was to cancel the land that had been allotted for the construction of a railway-coach factory in Rae Bareli, the constituency of the Congress first family (Mayavati pulls land rug from under Sonias feet, Oct 13). Since the rivalry between Sonia Gandhi and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister is unlikely to end quickly, the Supreme Court should intervene to ensure that the project does not get stuck. When political adversaries decide to hinder development plans, the losers turn out to be the common people, as in the case of Singur. Legislations should be enforced to forestall disputes on land acquisition.  
	Yours faithfully,         S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi       
	Sir  Nothing pleases the UP chief minister more than a fierce display of one-upmanship. When the Allahabad High Court stayed Mayavatis cancellation of the land transfer for the railway project, she clamped Section 144 to prevent Sonia Gandhi from flagging off the bhoomi pujan. The entire sequence of events reads like a thriller that only Mayavati is capable of scripting. Only this time, she has met a redoubtable match in the Congress chairperson. Sonias advantage is that the people are on her side. If a development project is stalled by a vindictive chief minister, then the people of her state would never forgive her.           
	Yours faithfully,        Madhur Mohanty,Bhubaneswar     
	Sir  The editorial, Lands end (Oct 15) projects Mayavati as a suspicious, jealous and mean-minded politician, but the Centre, too, has a far from unblemished reputation. Why, for instance, did it leave the land, which belongs to the ministry of agriculture, unused for years? The railways decided on the project in February 2007, while Mayavati transferred the land to the gram sabha in May 2008. What was the Centre doing in the intervening time? The government should have been more proactive about the project and rolled it out before giving behenji a chance to launch her game plan.    
	Yours faithfully,        Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta          
	Trust deficit          
	Sir  Bhaskar Dutta claims that economic theory has progressed sufficiently since the 1930s to be able to deal with a crisis even as huge as the Great Depression (Poised on the brink, Oct 14). Dutta should realize that Americans, as a nation, have forgotten how wealth is generated  people make money by hard work, not just by investing in banks and in the stock market. It was the latter that started the present crisis. Americans are now plagued by large trade and budget deficits, and most importantly, by a deficit of trust. People are finding it difficult to trust anyone, least of all their political leaders.           
	Yours faithfully,         Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

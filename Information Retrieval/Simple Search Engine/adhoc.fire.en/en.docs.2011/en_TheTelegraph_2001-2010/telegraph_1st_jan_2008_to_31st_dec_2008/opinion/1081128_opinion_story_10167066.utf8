	Sea of peril                  
	Sir  The Indian navy made the nation proud after INS Tabar sank a Somali pirate ship recently (Indian naval ship INS Tabar sinks pirate vessel, Nov 20). Naval forces around the world utilize their ships against the enemy only at the time of war. The Indian navy, however, is different on this count. It not only protects the countrys coastline, but is now also securing the unsafe Somali waters for international commercial vessels. The government of Somalia has been a complete failure to provide maritime security near its shores . The United Nations should take this matter up with the Somalian government on behalf of the international maritime community. Pirates hijacking ships for ransom should not be tolerated, even if it means taking stringent steps that would seem to compromise Somalias ocean rights. World bodies such as the UN are duty-bound to intervene to ensure the safe passage of ships in Somalia.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The release of the crew of Stolt Valor is good news, but the fact that a hefty ransom was allegedly paid to secure their safety will send a wrong signal to these armed gangs (Ransom frees sailors in Somalia, Nov 17). A Japanese vessel, Chemstar Venus, had been seized off the coast of Somalia recently, as was the Sirius Star, a very large crude carrier, near east Africa. At a time when pirate attacks on ships are mounting in the Gulf of Aden, the news of the ransom is certain to encourage these desperate men. The Indian navy rescued two vessels from pirates only recently, and one hopes that the international community will follow suit as well as put in place a strong anti-piracy policy to get rid of the menace.           
	A few other steps can also be undertaken. For instance, a sea corridor for mercantile vessels can be created, to be patrolled by an international naval force. Shipping companies should deploy armed guards on their carriers. Since the pirates are Somali nationals, the Somali government also has a responsibility in providing intelligence inputs to eradicate the problem on this stretch of water.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  INS Tabars sinking of a Somalian pirate ship in the Gulf of Aden will definitely fill Indian hearts with pride. That we have a strong naval force is beyond doubt. What is required though is a proactive attitude on the part of the government. The people of India are looking forward to seeing the government use its armed forces to put an end to the mischief made by hostile neighbours.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The attacks by Somali pirates on ships are proving costly to international trade, much of which is routed through the Gulf of Aden. This year alone, 92 ships have been attacked in and around this stretch of water, the latest victim being the Saudi super-tanker, Sirius Star. A platform for naval support of coalition countries exists to stop piracy in the region, but it is proving to be inaffective. What is required is a UN mandate for hot pursuit against the pirates on Somali waters so that international powers can make this busy sea-route safe once again.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was a relief to read that the Indian navy has freed the entire crew of Stolt Valor after two months in captivity. It appears that the Gulf of Aden has turned into the piracy capital of the world. Ships  big and small  have been targeted by these bandits on the high seas. The pirates are armed with sophisticated weapons and use boats that are faster than the ones used by cargo ships. It is strange that cargo ships are not fitted with weapons that can deter the assailants. The international community must act fast, and decisively, to ensure the safety of the crew of cargo carriers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  R.L. Stevensons Treasure Island has made pirates such as Long John Silver memorable. There is a line in the novel that says Of Silver we have heard no more. Perhaps Silver has resurfaced once again, leading his band of Somali pirates on the Gulf of Aden. Of course, a few things have changed. These days, Silver and his men sing Yo-ho-ho a barrel of oil aboard the Sirius Star. And it isnt treasure, but ransom-money that the men are after. We hope that the Jim Hawkins, Captain Flints, Squire Trelawneys and Ben Guns of this era would be able to tackle Silver and his merry men this time as well.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The English press reported that some of Englands players think India is a tough place to tour and win games. Everything appears difficult and unachievable to a losing side and its players. Whenever England lose cricket matches in India, Australia or elsewhere, we get to hear such complaints. However, English players should remember that when other teams, especially those from the subcontinent, come to play in England, in early May for instance, it is still rather cold in this part of the world. The visitors have plenty of difficulties adjusting to English playing conditions: damp pitches, swinging ball and frequent drizzles. But English cricketers seldom spare a thought for the visitors during those trying times. The fact is that the Indians are playing better cricket than their English counterparts at this point of time. Englands dismal performance has nothing to do with the country they are touring, so the players can stop giving excuses. The same cribbing players seem keen to play in the IPL. Now thats a surprise considering India is such a tough place.          
	Yours faithfully,

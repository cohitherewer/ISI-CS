	This is an attack on India, not a terrorist operation in Mumbai alone. This has clearly been planned for months and has involved agencies, groups, operators, who function outside the law. It seems to be a combination of al Qaida, Taliban, as well as mercenaries and underworld characters who fled from Mumbai and now live as aliens elsewhere in the world. Their dangerous plan should have been on the radar of the intelligence services of India. But since India was caught unawares, heads must roll fast. This guerrilla invasion into the country has started a war and often, wars of this kind continue unabated with short intervals of peace punctuating the larger horror. If citizens can see the reality and the writing on the wall, why are our intelligence agencies oblivious of what is happening under their noses?        
	A paparazzi press is another aspect of terrorism. Terrorists outside the attacked hotels and other establishments must have been relishing, as zealous news anchors, sitting comfortably away from the firing squads, analysed the blueprint of defence operations . The childish excitement of the media, still learning to report and indulging in endless speculations that was sometimes intelligent but at other times foolish, only helped the horror to burn on. On the other hand, an inept, inexperienced, superficially trained and unintelligent authority announced a curfew in the adjoining areas but was unable to enforce it. There was no representative of the government to brief the nation on a regular basis. There was utter confusion because of the medias random conjectures that led to rumours such as this: there has been renewed firing at CST, to be followed by: we have verified our report about renewed firing and want to say that there was no firing at the terminus. Why did the channels not verify the piece of information before screening the story? This single idiotic, unthinking, juvenile report by an immature, excitable correspondent could have caused more damage than what has already been faced.                
	Horror of hysteria        
	What emerges from this is that the media is manned by hundreds of untrained kids, either preening behind laptops, reading out the contents shown on teleprompters without understanding anything, or reporting from the field without being able to bring in historical perspectives of what they are witnessing. They also tend to infuse emotions rather than reporting in a restrained, calm way, which is imperative in a war zone. Seasoned editors here would have controlled their teams. The coverage we were inflicted with was like a football game where hysteria was interspersed with silences instead of information. It was sickening to watch the breaking news brigade stick their microphones into the mouths of traumatized guests of the Taj and Oberoi who were being escorted out of hell. Would they have allowed their mothers to be treated in this uncivilized manner? Were their silly sound bites more important than the emotional truths of the victims? A strange disease of one-upmanship seems to have overwhelmed this breed of insensitive, sub-standard reporters. What a relief when the jammers started working and news channels fell dark and silent!         
	Much damage has been done. Lives were put under threat and some were lost. India did not win, the opposing guerrilla forces did. Surely we should be disciplined enough to know that analysis and speculations are something that require hindsight and a calm manner, neither hysteria nor a high pitch of the voice. The invasion of Mumbai has shown us that the press must follow some ethics and norms in such situations where there is infinite danger to innocent lives. Senior editors must keep the banshee-like reporters, who look for sensational tidbits, on a tight leash after a rigorous training in good conduct, both personal and professional.

               THIS ABOVE ALL

            No time for harsh words				 
                   
	Anger is listed second among the five deadly sins by the Indian sages: kaam (lust), krodh (anger), moh (attachment), lobh (greed) and ahankar (pride). I think they were exaggerating because in proper proportion all five are integral to human beings. It is only when some of these exceed the limits acceptable to human society that these sins become evil. At the moment, let us consider only anger. 
    
	Anger is of different grades, ranging from minor irritation to uncontrollable rage. At times it is justified, as when parents reprimand their children for misbehaving. There is no ill-will on the side of the parents. Nor when a child throws up a tantrum. For a minute or two, it is raging against the world, flailing its arms at anyone who tries to quieten it. Its anger suddenly fizzles out and it is happily sitting on its parents lap. No trace of bitterness is left. You cant call such outbursts sinful. 
    
	Likewise in quarrels between married couples. They may shout at each other, sulk and stop talking to one another for a day or two, then they resume making love and all is forgotten. However, if such quarrels become habitual, they take all the fun out of married life. And if they become violent  it is usually the husband who first raises his hand against his wife  you can be sure that the marriage would either break up in a court of law or the couple would start living apart. You attribute the break-up to uncontrolled anger. 
    
	However, I was witness to one case of uncontrolled anger, which took place about every other month in a flat opposite me in Colaba, Bombay. It was a family of four  parents and two children both under 10. I could not find out what caused the explosion; I could only see the man pacing up and down the room, chanting obscenities at the top of his voice while the wife and children huddled together in a corner. It would end with the man banging his head against the wall till he drew blood. His wife would run up, wipe the blood with her dupatta and put a strip of bandage on the wound. Peace returned to the household. Next morning, I would see the man, dressed in a coat and tie, going to work with the strip of white on his forehead. What kind of self-inflated anger was it? Perhaps an example of what Horace described in his Epistles as Ira furor brevis est  anger is short madness. 
    
	When it comes to workplaces, ill-temper is the privilege of the boss. In fact, anger helps burra sahibs to assert authority, while remaining calm and mild is often taken as a sign of weakness. In my limited experience, I arrived at the conclusion that the ill-tempered are at their worst in mid-mornings and become even-tempered by mid-afternoon. My one-time boss, Krishna Menon, had a foul temper; he was also at his wittiest when running down people. Pandit Nehru was also short-tempered and was known to throw files at his officers if he disagreed with them. He was best admired from a respectable distance; no one working close to him enjoyed doing so.
    
	More important than listing different kinds of anger is to find ways to control anger. You have to learn to control your tongue, to not give a piece of your mind as a retort. Some say, when in anger, count till ten before you reply, others extend the figure to one hundred. In any event, Never let the sun go down on your anger, advises the Bible. If you do, you will pay for it with a sleepless night.
        
	Trial and error
        
	There was a time I used to make New Year resolutions. For many years it used to be the same: I will not speak ill of anyone anymore. It was important to me because I was in the bad habit of running down people behind their back, making witty and hurtful jokes about them just to get a laugh out of friends around me. Inevitably, what I had said got to them. Some dropped me, some confronted me and I had to lie that I had said no such thing, or apologize for having said so. My resolution seldom lasted more than a week. My friends thought I was getting old and dim-witted. I could no longer raise a laugh. So I was back to my old ways till the end of the year. And once again resolved, I will never speak ill of anyone any more.
    
	If you must make New Year resolutions, make them trivial, such as, I will cut down on my smoking, chewing paan and tobacco. You may succeed on keeping the resolve for some weeks or months. My father used to relish achaar with his meals. This gave him a sore throat, which led to bad colds and cough. He had to have anti-catarrhal vaccine injections to fight them off. So every new year we would announce that pickles were to be banished from the dining table. At the end of the month, he found his meals too bland for his taste. So varieties of pickles were back for lunch and dinner.
    
	I suggest a variation in the theme of resolutions: instead of one for the year, make one for everyday. It will not get lost in the passage of time and you can look it up every night before you retire. Start your mornings in silent contemplation of what you have to do that day. It will depend on your business or other occupation  who you must see, ring up, what you have to complete and so on. Do everything in good time. Dont waste time on pointless telephone calls or on your cronies. Time is god. Also, give thought to what you will eat at your meals because taking care of the body is of utmost importance. Your meals must be tasty, wholesome and small. They are not meant to be gulped down nor taken in quantities which might harm your digestive system beyond repair. Every night, go over what you had scheduled for the day and check whether or not you kept to it. It will soon become a habit  this time a good one.

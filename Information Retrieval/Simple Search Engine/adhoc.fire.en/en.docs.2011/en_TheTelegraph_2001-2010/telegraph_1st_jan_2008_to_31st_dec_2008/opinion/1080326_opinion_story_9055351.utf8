                                                                                                                 WHERE TO FROM HERE?                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Sumanta Sen                              
	With D.D. Lapang failing to muster the strength needed to prove his majority and resigning, Meghalaya joins the ranks of states in the Northeast which have reposed their faith in parties other than the Congress. Of course, the Congress had emerged as the largest single party in the Meghalaya elections but then its opponents closed ranks. Meghalaya has a history of unsteady coalitions, with many failing to last the full term. It cannot be said for sure that this wont happen again. But at the moment, the state presents a picture that is not at all comfortable for the Congress. For the Northeast as a whole, losing in three states should come as a surprise for the party that had banked heavily on the recent razzmatazz over huge promised investments for the development of the region.        
	The message then is clear. People in the Northeast have become sceptical about promises from New Delhi for they find things remaining very much the same as before. And it also seems that, barring Tripura, there is little faith on the promises made locally. The result: fractured mandates, which can never help progress. In Nagaland, for instance, the earlier ministry had collapsed and there was a brief spell of Central rule, giving the Congress the opportunity to ask for votes and stability. But all that happened was that the same old loose coalition bagged a majority of the seats.         
	Earlier in Assam and Manipur also, the Congress had managed to form ministries not on its own but with the help of others. Yes, the others had been its coalition partners but the party had been desperate to gain majority on its own. In Assam, the scenario is particularly disturbing as the Congress is depending on an ethnic body that has no interest in issues of national relevance. So when Biharis are butchered in the state, the Congress is worried but not its partner.                
	Losing hold        
	It is not that the ordinary citizen in the Northeast is regional in his or her outlook. The younger generation, in particular, wants to reach out to the world beyond the borders. But very rarely does the Naga or the Manipuri find that sentiment reciprocated. Even when New Delhi made a big noise about the flow of funds, it spoke of regional and ethnic sentiments, thereby, even if unwittingly, strengthening regionalism. Such a mindset encourages a non-Congress leader in Kohima to claim that people in Nagaland liked regional parties more than others. Has such liking been created only by forces within the state?        
	Certainly not. In Tripura, the Congress has made it a practice to align itself with a tribal outfit that is not only regional in nature but is also widely believed to have links with the extremists. And the alliance continues despite a majority of the tribals making it clear that they have little interest in such regionalism. So who is trying to keep regionalism alive? The Congress in Tripura has always sought to play Bengalis against tribals and vice versa, thereby, over the years, losing the support of both the communities.        
	One is not lamenting over the fate of the Congress in the region  if people do not like a political party, it has to lose. But then it continues to be around, as a ruling force in some states and certainly at the Centre. The problem is, bereft of any ideology, the Congress has only tactical lines to go along. It tells Manipur not to be worried, talks national integration in Assam and joins divisive elements in Tripura and, above all, does not know whether to treat the United Liberation Front of Asom as a political problem or as a threat to law and order in the region. This is surely not the way to go about in a sensitive region. Thus at present, and perhaps well into the future, the fate of the Congress in the Northeast hangs in balance.

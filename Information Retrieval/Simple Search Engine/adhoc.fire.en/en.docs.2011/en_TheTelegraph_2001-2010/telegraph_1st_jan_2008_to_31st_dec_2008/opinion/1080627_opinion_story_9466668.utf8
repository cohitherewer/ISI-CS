The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cut a fine deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CUT A FINE DEAL                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The last few days in Delhi have been much like a party, where the hosts have been schmoozing about, lost in a mindless, midsummer madness. Silly, superficial, personal agendas have been carried forward, and all serious debate and dissension drowned. People have been left wondering why this kind of irresponsible behaviour has been allowed. With political parties operating as they are, indulging in petty, short-term interests, India has been bewildered, saddened by its intellectually vacant political class, unable to extricate itself because there is no real difference in the calibre of leadership across all the ideological divides. For all, one priority is paramount  to stay in power till the last possible moment, at any cost.        
	Any sensible, non-political person would have gone for a mid-term poll last August when the Congress was at the peak of its tenure, having let loose fresh initiatives. At that time, the decline of all its partners in the coalition had begun. A shrewd party, inspired and determined, wanting to gain points, numbers and trust, hungry to grow in strength and deliver the promised goods and services that they are committed to, would have seen the advantage.        
	However, they decided to allow the coalition to live albeit in an advanced stage of terminal sickness. The Congress needs to use the nuclear deal as a symbol of its determination and commitment to India, and should allow the 123 agreement to live. Imagine the negative backlash of an electorate that saw the Cabinet, represented by all coalition partners, sign off on the 123 agreement to take the nuclear deal forward, but which, to stay in power for three extra months till the end of term, does a turn-around. How can any of those men and women muster genuine respect?                
	Number game        
	It is amply clear that all the coalition partners of the United Progressive Alliance, barring the Congress, will be reduced to rather pathetic numbers in the next Lok Sabha polls. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) will most probably be somewhere between 30 and 35 seats. The Dravida Munnettra Kazhagam may well be wiped out. The Rashtriya Janata Dal will, undoubtedly, decline dramatically. Chances are that the Nationalist Congress Party will come to some agreement with the Shiv Sena and break from aligning with the Congress in Maharashtra. Small wonder then that the leaders of these dispensations want to make hay and not go for a snap poll and lose out earlier than May next year.        
	The Congress, on the other hand, has only to gain from standing apart, taking its decisions regardless of the possibility of a snap poll. Its lowest numbers today come to approximately 140 seats. In Andhra Pradesh, for example, chances are that if the chief minister, Rajshekhar Reddy, is left alone and not put through the shenanigans of insecure and inelectable general secretaries from Delhi, he will come back for a second term. The Congress will gain by defying the blackmail and personal political interests of its partners.         
	The deal does not need Parliament approval. It is an executive decision. The Cabinet has approved it even if members are backtracking today. It has been minuted. To procrastinate any longer would be foolish. Dont make a fool of India. Sign it. When parliament convenes for the monsoon session, the walkouts will kill debate, further destroy democratic institutions and the screeching will be about prices and inflation. No one will listen, no one will hear. India will be insulted. A snap poll will be announced. A six-month, time-bound caretaker government will lead the country to elections in January/February instead of in April/May. The Congress will gain. But, if the Congress becomes the victim of blackmail, it will possibly lose and be at double digits, down-and-out like its failed friends.

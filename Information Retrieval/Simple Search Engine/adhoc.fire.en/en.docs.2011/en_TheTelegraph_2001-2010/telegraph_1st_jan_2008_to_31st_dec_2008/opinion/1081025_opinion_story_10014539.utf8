                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       GOD IS MANIFEST IN ALL                                  This Above all: Khushwant Singh                          Dancing queen                                        
	Surjit Kaur is in hospital in Washington DC. She is being treated for cancer. She has written to me, asking me to pray for her. Although a notorious non-believer, I respect other peoples faiths and the power of prayer for those who believe in it. Surjit had been undergoing surgery earlier for breast cancer. She refused to have her breast lopped off and made do with a small incision. Her recovery was a minor miracle. Soon, she was back to work and, as usual, visited her homeland every winter to pay homage at the Golden Temple and in other gurdwaras. Although Surjit has been living in America for the past 30 years as an American citizen, her heart has remained in India.         
	She planned to return here eventually. She built a home in Zirakpur near Chandigarh, where she intended to retire. Cancer has now infected her pancreas and it is spreading. She has undergone surgery and chemotherapy and is now being given radiation. She is again praying for help.        
	I have known Surjit Kaur for many years. Her role model was her father, Professor Jodh Singh. She doted on him and became as devout a Sikh as he was. When I was on a three-months scholarship at The Wilson Centre, I had her assist me update my History of the Sikhs by getting material in Gurmukhi from the Library of Congress. She would collect the relevant material and on the way back to her home in Sterling, would drop it in my apartment in Arlington. She often cooked me an Indian meal, had a drink with me before she ordered a taxi to take her home. She spent her Sunday mornings in the gurdwara in Washington. She knew most of the members of her community and wrote a book, Among the Sikhs, which was released in my home in Delhi by Manmohan Singh.        
	How did I respond to Surjits call to pray for her? I could think of nothing better than write back the original of a hymn, which is probably the most widely-used one by Sikhs who seek divine help. Note the entirely Hindi terminology used by the Guru who also claimed that Sikhs were neither Hindus nor Muslims but a community apart. I give a free translation of the hymn:                
	Taatee vaa na laagayee, Parbrahma sharnaee
  Chugird hamaarey Raam kar, dukh lagey na bhai        
	No ill-winds will harm you,
  God is your refuge and helper.
  Of all four sides He has drawn Ramas protective lines,
  No sorrows will afflict you, brother.        
	Satguru poora bheytia, Jis banat banaee
  Raam Naam aukhad diya, eka liv laee        
	The true Guru is manifest, in all things created you will find
  The name of Rama is the antidote of all ills, keep Him in mind.        
	Raakh leo tin raakhan haar, Guru sab biaed mitaaee
  Kaho Nanak kirpa bhaee,
  Prabhu bhaey sahaaee        
	He protects those that deserve protection,
  Of all problems He is the solver;
  He is merciful, says Nanak, He has become your helper.        
	Above all, when in distress never lose heart; ever remain in charhdikala  in buoyant spirits. Sursum corda  lift you heart. This is to wish you quick recovery, Surjit Kaur.                
	Naval and novel encounters                
	A retired admiral entered the television room of a defence services club to listen to the BBC news. There he saw youngsters watching a dance number on MTV that was a combination of salsa, lambada, samba, grind and nach baliye. Watching the gyrating bodies of the dancers, all with their midriffs exposed, and their horrendous pelvic thrusts, the veteran military historian left the room aghast, with this expert comment: In my entire naval service, this is the first time I have witnessed a naval encounter where no sailors are lost.        
	Another novel encounter in which men in uniform participate but do not get killed are the much publicized, bold and (in)famous police encounters (fake).

	The eightfold path                
	Strangely but truly, the digit 8 has played a great role in the completion of the Indo-US nuclear deal, as evident from the following facts:        
	The Left withdrew its support to the UPA government on July 8.        
	This happened when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was attending the G-8 Summit in Japan.        
	The total number of people who represented the CPI(M), CPI, Forward Block and the Republicans in the talks over the nuclear deal with the UPA was 8.        
	President George W. Bush signed the legislation for the nuclear deal on October 8.

	February 18 suddenly seems a long way away. Whoever was behind the fatal gun and bomb attack on Benazir Bhutto has succeeded in putting those longing for democracy in Pakistan on tenterhooks again. The postponement of Pakistans elections for a month and ten days has struck many as ominous. The pretext offered by the election commission is that preparations for the January 8 ballot had been set back by the post-assassination violence and that government property, including ballot boxes, were destroyed in many places, especially in Sind. But the opposition parties were eager to face the electorate on January 8; so anxious was Asif Ali Zardari, Bhuttos widower and co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, to take advantage of the popular outrage over his wifes death, that he persuaded Nawaz Sharif, leading the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), not to boycott the elections as the latter had planned. In this context, which could be perceived as a thrust for positive change, the governments decision to postpone the elections can only arouse fresh suspicions about its intentions.        
	But the president, Pervez Musharraf, is not exactly banking on the trust of his people, but on that emanating from the United States of America. That remains his primary concern; he needs to prove, now more urgently than ever, that he is still in control  even without his military coat  and will do as he has promised in his own sweet time. His countrys history, oscillating between military rule punctuated by army coups and blood-soaked experiments in democracy in its 60 years of existence, does not help in lending him an air of trustworthiness. It is not just Pakistans human rights commission which is worried that the elections may not take place at all after the delay  for anything can happen in between  but also Britain that is making gentle nudging noises to Mr Musharraf, urging his government to create trust and carry out fair elections. The proof of this pudding will lie in the elections alone.

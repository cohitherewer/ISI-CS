	Southeast Asia was the first to evolve a security framework of its own in Asia  the Asian Regional Forum, of which India is a member. The management by these states of their security environment has been a remarkable success. These countries are diverse  ethnically, religiously, linguistically, culturally and economically. They do not have a common history, most of them having been colonized by different countries in the past. Amongst them are those that have fought the United States of America bitterly and those that have security arrangements with the US. Some of these countries have an Islamic orientation and others feel threatened by Islamic elements. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is creating a peaceful space for itself in which they can maintain their economic prosperity, insulated from great power rivalry.         
	This fits in well with our Look East policy. As we have no intention or capacity to dominate the region, our interest is to prevent it from moving into Chinas orbit as it continues its scorching growth, develops its military strength, seeks to protect its sea-lanes through the Malacca Straits, and leverages its ground strength in some of these countries through economically dominant local Chinese communities. We have a growing community of interest with Japan, increasingly vulnerable to Chinas mounting strength. Japans political and military ambitions are not contrary to our interests, and are a problem for China. The security cooperation agreement we have signed with Japan is a step in the right direction.               
	Japan faces a major security problem, and so does South Korea, because of North Korean nuclear and missile capability. Just as China gave Pakistan nuclear and missile capability to corner India, it is entirely possible China has given this capability to North Korea to corner Japan. The US and Japan have become dependent on Chinese goodwill to resolve this problem, giving time to China to leverage American and Japanese strength for accelerating its rise as a power. As it grows stronger, China can dispense with the North Korean card.         
	In the emerging security landscape in Asia, the most important development is Chinas inexorable rise. Chinas double-digit growth rate for well over a decade has integrated it with the global economy far more than India has. As Chinas interests stretch across the globe, it will want to develop the means to protect them. It is inconceivable that Chinas economic rise will not be accompanied by the expansion of its military capabilities. Already the Chinese are developing advanced technologies like anti-satellite capability, additional nuclear submarines for which a large facility at Hainan is being built, apart from building an aircraft carrier and testing a submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile.         
	China has many problems with countries in the region, but its strategy is to neither create a confrontation with others over them nor resolve them. It is belligerent over Taiwan, yet has built a strong economic relationship with it. With Japan, the underlying tensions are high, yet Japan is the largest foreign investor in China. China has built a strong economic relationship with Australia that is making Australia politically well-disposed to China too, reflected in its decision to take no further part in the quadrilateral initiative comprising of the US, Japan, Australia and India. Chinas policies are astute, and it is getting away with its pretensions of peaceful rise. It is too big a country to ignore, too successful economically not to attract partners, too financially strong (with reserves of $1.7 trillion) not to have clout, especially now with a financial crisis confronting the world.         
	In search of raw materials and markets, China is going into all corners of the globe. To protect its lines of communication, it is pursuing the famous string of pearls strategy of seeking port facilities in countries across the Indian Ocean. For the time being, the Indian navy is the dominant littoral navy in this area. We have to make an assessment of Chinas strategic aims and of whether, in the foreseeable future, it will have the ability to pose a challenge to us in the Indian Ocean.        
	The US will remain a part of the security landscape of Asia. US engagement with China is to control its behaviour, give it incentives to work within the US-created international system and not aspire to wreck it. The mutuality of interest created between the two is a disincentive to rocking the boat to either side. The US has seen that within the framework of this arrangement, it can continue to arm Taiwan and ensure its security, maintain and even strengthen its defence arrangements with Japan and be present militarily in the Korean peninsula, besides being present in southeast Asia as an insurance against any Chinese attempts at hegemony. China is, at one level, not averse to the US-Japan defence pact as it constrains those in Japan in favour of building an independent defence capability.        
	We now have central Asia with its own security challenges. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has sandwiched central Asian states together between Russia and China, with both the giants keeping an eye on each other in this strategic space between them. The US has inserted itself in the region mainly to have access to the hydrocarbon resources of the region, independently of Russia. The US effort to push these countries towards greater linkages to south Asia as part of the USs greater central Asia project is seen with great suspicion by Moscow. With the continuing turmoil in Afghanistan and fears of Pakistans collapse, this policy has lost its thrust. The Iranian nuclear question is raising disturbing questions about the future security of the Gulf region. The US, Europe and even Russia see Irans nuclear ambitions as unacceptable. Israel is pushing for military action against Iran before it crosses the nuclear pale. The Arab countries are greatly concerned, especially in the context of greater Shia-Sunni rivalry in the region after the change in Iraq.               
	Terrorism has emerged as a huge security problem in Asia. Apart from west Asia, the severity of the problem is being felt in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and China. The epicentre of this terrorism is in our region: in Pakistan and in the Afghan areas contiguous to it. The resurgent Taliban are inflicting increasing casualties on the international forces in Afghanistan. Pakistan is getting internally destabilized because in its role as an ally of the West in the war against terror, it has earned the ire of local fundamentalists, who have begun to spread terror inside the country.         
	The situation is made more complex by the involvement of Pakistan agencies in the extension of clandestine support to the Islamic elements in the country backing the Taliban. Pakistans descent towards failure is a cause of worry to the West because of the countrys nuclear status, and the danger of its nuclear weapons falling into the hands of the terrorists. Pakistan embodies in itself the combined threat of Islamic fundamentalism, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai by Pakistani elements underscore the grave danger to regional peace represented by these fanatical forces. If the West fails in Afghanistan, the danger to the Asian region as a whole, and well beyond, will multiply manifold.

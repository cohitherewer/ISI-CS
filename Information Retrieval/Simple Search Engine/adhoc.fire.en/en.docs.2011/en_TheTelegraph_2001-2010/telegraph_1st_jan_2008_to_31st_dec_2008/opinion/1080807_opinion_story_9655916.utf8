	Suddenly, a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation seems more than an occasion for the regions heads of government to exchange niceties. It is Afghanistan, Saarcs newest member, which has added the zing. Ignoring Saarcs self-defeating, but cardinal, working principle that disallows the discussion of contentious bilateral issues, the president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has directly charged the Inter-Services Intelligence, and thereby Pakistan, with the Kabul blasts and for fomenting terror in the region. He has declared it from the podium and reiterated it in his meeting with the Pakistan premier in Colombo. India has seconded the accusation. This joint assault does not exactly have Pakistan quaking in its boots. But in a rare gesture, the Pakistan pre- mier, Yousaf Raza Gilani, has acquiesced to initiating an independent inquiry into the Kabul blasts. Coming from the head of the Pakistani government, this may sound a little suspect. But for Pakistan, which has steadfastly refused to look where the accusing finger pointed until the United States of America poked it in the eye with its recent report on terror, this is concession enough.        
	Apart from successfully cornering Pakistan, Saarc members cannot claim to have achieved much by way of dealing with terror, which was acknowledged as the single biggest threat to south Asia. They have relented to signing the convention of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, cracking down on trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic drugs, and promised to implement the regional convention on suppression of terrorism. However, the modalities of putting the last into force or getting the terrorist offences monitoring desk working are yet to be formulated. It has been that way since the late Nineties, when the need for jointly combating terror dawned on the members and a string of conventions were signed. The will to get the South Asia Free Trade Agreement off the ground is lacking too. As with terror, economics also remains enmeshed in the conflicting interests of the Saarc members. Apart from terror, member countries seem to have woken up to another relevant issue. They are supposed to meet again later this year to ensure food security in the region. Hopefully, food will sustain their interest longer than the need to be more realistic about dealing with terror.

	The prime minister has, for most of his tenure, been his own foreign minister. He has spent much time abroad, hobnobbing with the high and mighty, and slowly working his way into that charmed circle; the sterling performance of the Indian economy in the past three years has helped him. An unlikely pair as they were, the prime minister got on well with George W. Bush; with Bushs help, he overcame all opposition and brought an end to Indias pariah status amongst nuclear powers. The flirtation with Bush cost him the support of the communists. But he changed horses midstream, jumped on the socialist party chariot and survived. Now, with his major objective achieved and with the lull in international confabulations forced by the change of guard in the United States of America, the prime minister has turned his attention to his own country. And what could be more natural than taking control of economic policy? That is where he made his name 17 years ago; and as luck may have it, the economy faces as great a challenge as it did then.        
	There are some differences. The crisis of 1991 was an Indian crisis, forged and perfected by its own policymakers; the crisis of 2008 is an international one, which till now has left India largely unscathed. And Indias considerable exchange reserves give it some breathing space. Even if the Indian economy is mismanaged, it will take a year or two to melt down; by that time this government will long have been replaced. Just as the Bharatiya Janata Party government handed over a booming economy to the prime minister, he can hand over an ailing economy to his successor. So he could afford to leave economic policy in less capable hands.        
	But now that he has time on his hands, he has decided to try his hand at economic policy again. He has brought new hands on board. He has brought in Raghuram Rajan from Chicago to help him understand the workings of international finance; and Suresh Tendulkar, his old colleague from the Delhi School days 30 years ago, to advise him on macroeconomic policy. His Man Friday, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, is of course around to pitch in whenever asked. D. Subba Rao, whom he placed in the Reserve Bank of India instead of sending him off to Washington, is the fourth member of the team. Till now, the impact of this kitchen cabinet is not obvious. But there has been a perceptible decline in the frequency of statements made by the finance minister. It would be wrong to infer that he has been put on the shelf. The prime minister is too politically correct to do something so obvious; the finance minister is invited to every important meeting. But the new dispensation does impose some discipline on the finance ministers freedom of speech. This may be good for the economy, but it is a tragedy for journalism.

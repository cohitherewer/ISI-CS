	The Telegraph yields to no one in celebrating an Indian victory in any sphere. Victories in cricket are, of course, celebrated with the highest dose of euphoria. But there are other triumphs that are enjoyed albeit in a far lower key than wins in cricket. Very recently, India has won a legal victory at an international forum, which might invite applause, but The Telegraph refuses to join it. The World Trade Organization ruled in favour of India in a legal battle with the United States of America regarding the duties India imposes on imported spirits and wines. The grouse of the US was that while India had committed to the WTO that it would cap its duty at 150 per cent on liquor, in practice India imposed additional discretionary levies. This meant that the duties were way above the 150 per cent level. Were these additional duties customs duties? The US said yes, and India answered in the negative. India argued that the two additional duties were levied to offset different kinds of internal taxes and were charged not under the Indian Customs Act, 1962, but under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. On this line of argument  call it legal casuistry  India won its point over the US. It might appear that the Indian Jack has killed the US Giant, without the help of any magical beans.        
	The immediate fallout of this will be the fact that those who love their bourbon and their Californian wines will feel the pinch in their pockets. This might strike a chord in the puritanical souls of some Indians, but will hurt all those who love a good tipple. It is an odd prejudice that links drinking with drunkenness and addiction. All drunks and alcoholics are by definition drinkers, but all drinkers are not drunks and addicts. There are people who enjoy their drink as an accompaniment to an evening of social chatter or with a meal. There is no reason why Indians who can afford a good bottle of wine or want to enjoy a peg or two of bourbon should be deprived of this enjoyment. Morals have nothing to do with this. What is also worth putting on record as a sign of changing social mores is that the imbibing of wine is on the increase in India. With this comes a growing awareness about the varieties and the qualities of wines. This select band is acutely conscious that when they are drinking wine grown in India, they are actually not drinking world-class stuff. This applies to whisky too, though the real connoisseur will say that American whisky is not the real water of life.        
	This is where the extra duties that the Indian government imposes on imports of wine and spirits hurt. There is no logical reason why a lover of good wine should pay anything higher than global prices for his libation. The affluent is on a par with his global peers in all things save his bottle of wine. There is something illogical and unfair in this arrangement. India has won a victory in the WTO; so has unreason. Hence, the reluctance to raise a toast. It is too expensive to do so, in any case.

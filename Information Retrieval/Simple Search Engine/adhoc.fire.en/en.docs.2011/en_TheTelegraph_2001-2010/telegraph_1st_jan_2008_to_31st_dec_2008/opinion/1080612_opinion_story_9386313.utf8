	Stand still                  
	Sir  The twin bandhs called by the Left Front and the Trinamul Congress on June 5 and 6 defied logic (Bengal beyond bandhs, June 7). With oil prices skyrocketing the world over, the rationale for the price hike is clear. As such, the Left had no reason to call the strike. If the Left had to protest, it could have done so in any way other than bringing life to a standstill. When the government of West Bengal is trying hard to attract foreign investors to the state, the bandh sets a very bad precedent. It only underscores the Bengali culture of stopping work at the drop of a hat. The appeal by the state secretary, Biman Bose, to TMC to call off the bandh naturally fell on deaf ears. Why should the Opposition refrain from doing something that the ruling party is doing without any compunction? The outcome was that the state enjoyed an extended weekend, with no production for two days and the daily wage-earner deprived of his means of livelihood. The Left Front could have slashed the sales tax on essential commodities had it really cared for the people.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Shyamali Ghose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Bandh as a form of protest is losing its effectiveness because of over-use. Nowadays a bandh just means a holiday. Politicians need to come up with new ways to express their anger if they seriously want to find solutions to problems.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Amar Singh Rai, Darjeeling

                
	Sir  The left Front had no business calling the bandh on June 5, as it was complicit with the Centre on raising the price of crude oil. Had the comrades really been against the hike, they could have easily stalled it by withdrawing support to the United Progressive Alliance government when the hike was declared.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The politicians of Bengal have become high-handed only because we have allowed them to be. The utterance of the B word is enough for us to start planning the D-Days menu at home. Instead of resisting the machinations of the political leaders, we encourage them by being such cowards. Even if a small percentage of the citys population had hit the streets against bandhs, the pretenders could have been put in place.           
	But who will take the initiative? Well, the media can. They can start a bandh-haters club, whose members will rise in protest whenever a bandh is called.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anand K. Jhunjhunwala, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I had taken a taxi on my way home from office on June 5. I casually asked the driver about the impact the fuel price hike would have on his business. He began a tale of woe. He said that the owner of the car he drives is not willing to have his daily percentage lowered because of the hike. That means a monthly loss close to Rs 1,500 for the taxi driver. Add to it the days of bandh, and the cabman is losing several hundred rupees. Lakhs of people like him are being denied their daily bread, thanks to our political representatives.           
	Since it seems increasingly impossible to ward off bandhs, they can be modified to serve at least the daily wage-earners. The partymen who roam the streets on bandh days can travel only in autos or taxis. That way these drivers would get their wages. And the local paanwala should be allowed to keep his shop open so that the party cadres refreshments are taken care of (provided, of course that they pay the shopkeeper).           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anirban Chakraborty, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I had to travel to Calcutta from Dhanbad on urgent family business on the day of the TMC strike. I started on the road with trepidation but was in for a surprise. The TMC cadre I encountered at Memari, Durgapur, Andal and Asansol were extremely courteous to me and my family. They made enquiries but allowed us to pass without trouble. I would like to congratulate Mamata Banerjee for having such well-mannered partymen under her wings.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Roy, Dhanbad

                
	Sir  Years of communist rule have made Calcuttans lazy, idle pontificators who accept bandhs without questioning their significance. If the state is to stage a revival, then that has to be under a new dispensation. The communists, with their anachronistic modes of functioning, must leave if West Bengal is to prosper.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Ramani, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In addition to the four days of leave for Durga Puja, we got to enjoy two days plus a weekend of bandhpuja this year. One cannot but appreciate the politicians deep concern for the common man as evident in these bandhs. With nothing to do for two days, I decided to conduct a personal SMS poll to find out many people actually supported the twin bandhs. Even after spending a hefty sum on SMS and mobile calls, I was unable to find a single person who claimed to enjoy the shutdowns. I had expected the oil prices to be halved by Thursday and totally rolled back by Friday evening. Alas, nothing of that sort happened. So, what did Biman Bose and Mamata Banerjee achieve for the common man they claim to represent? If the rush of cars on Calcutta streets after the bandhs got over on both days are any indication, I can only say that Bose and Banerjee made a laughing stock of themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Siddhartha S. Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Two Bangla bandhs on the same issue can be acceptable under no circumstance, especially since every political leader condemns the sudden hike. If bandhs are considered an effective form of protest at all, one 12-hour bandh would surely have been enough.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sujit K. Sengupta, Monirampore 

                
	Sir  Whether a bandh is called by the ruling party or the Opposition, it affects the common people in the same way. If the parties are concerned about the ordinary men, as they claim to be, then why do not they come to the aid of the people stranded in railway stations, bus depots, airport terminals and hospitals, with fresh drinking water and food?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rakesh Bhatia, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There have been protests all over the country against the oil price rise, but it is only in West Bengal that life came to a stop for two days. Among the states of India, Bengal may not be the leader in any field of development but it certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest in the number of working hours lost to bandhs.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

	Car-pools are not the safest way to get to school and back. Mumbai is beginning to wake up to a reality Calcutta has already lost much sleep over. The van that went up in flames within the school compound in Jogeshwari had 11 children crammed into it, and would have, on a more ordinary day, done its rounds to the convenience of both parents and the van-owner. While the former saved on time, the latter saved on costs, which the retrofitted contraption in the car allowed him to do. The owner of the vehicle and the private agency that ran the service for 15 years with the full trust of its users, saw no harm in opting for the cheap LPG kit, made cheaper by the modifications, when the technology was so readily available. Neither he nor the parents saw the compromises being made on the childrens safety when striking up a perfectly reasonable bargain. 
    
	Trading off safety for convenience is perhaps not such a difficult job when the dangers of the exchange are not immediately apparent. How many commuters in Calcutta are aware that the hassle-free LPG fitting their smart-aleck autorickshaw drivers are increasingly opting for can blow up if the wiring is faulty? Or for that matter, how many in the environment-friendly capital of India know that even CNG-powered buses are as susceptible to a blaze as the school van in Mumbai if the fittings are substandard or are not checked for leakages regularly? For a technology to make sense and to make a difference in public life, it is not enough for it to be made freely available. The safeguards have to be put in place and the users must be made conscious of the heavy price they have to pay for disregarding the rules. The unfortunate incident in Mumbai is a wake-up call that cannot be ignored either by caring parents or by discerning travellers, all of whom want more for less.

	The humbling of a beacon-wielding politician by the rule of law must be one of the delights afforded by a functioning democracy. More so, because the instances of it are few and far between. The traffic sergeant who booked a parliamentarians driver for breaking the rules thrice on the road was simply doing his duty. But given what the flashing red light means, and gets away with, on Indian roads, his correctness begins to look like a heroic quality. This is good for the sergeants career, but unfortunate, even dangerous, for the country. Yet, Sudip Kumar Maity has set an excellent example, and Tarit Topdar has confirmed an unsavoury stereotype. Both have serious implications for society as well as polity. Mr Topdar  former teacher, union leader, state committee member of the Communist party of India (Marxist) and six-time MP  showed instant outrage at his car being held for such perfectly natural entitlements as jumping the red light, violating the central line and refusing to produce the drivers licence. Mr Maity had been emboldened in his resolve to stop the car by his boss. The ordinary people who happened to be near the car also stood around in support for Mr Maity. These are healthy signs. A police force that regards none as above the law, and a public that fearlessly, and peacefully, co-operates in the process are both to be lauded and sustained.        
	But the beacon is the sign of a larger syndrome than law-breaking politicians. A feudal society and polity that encourages unequal and hierarchical distribution and display of power would need the flashing light to keep its acts in place. Very important people come in various guises in India. Politicians, uniformed officers, judges, together with those belonging to their circle of influence, need and use every public symbol of privilege to intimidate and override the less powerful ones entrusted with the keeping of order. India bristles with rules and regulations, laws and penal codes, but takes particular delight in flouting these in order to vindicate a higher order that remains unwritten and unspoken, but robustly practised. The Calcutta high court, for instance, allows only police pilot cars, ambulances and the fire brigade the right to carry beacons. But the ubiquity and effectiveness of these lights tell a different and dismal story. The unrelenting stance that Mr Maity and his seniors took with Mr Topdars driver is a welcome sign of hope.

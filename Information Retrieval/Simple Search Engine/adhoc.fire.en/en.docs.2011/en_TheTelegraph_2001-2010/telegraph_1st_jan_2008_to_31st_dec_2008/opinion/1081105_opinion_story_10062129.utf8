	It may be difficult to believe that terror could spawn anything beneficial, but there is no other way to describe the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hinds latest announcement. Indias largest Islamic body has organized a meeting on November 8 where 6,000 Muslim clerics are expected to sign a fatwa against terror. This seems to be the outcome of meetings by the Jamiat and the influential Dar-ul Uloom Deoband earlier this year, which made significant declarations dissociating Islamic religion from terrorism. Three clerics signed an earlier fatwa; the arrangement this month makes sure of 6,000 signatures in a conscious effort to make the message clearer, weightier and farther reaching. The intended effect seems to be two-directional. The central message would attempt to disentangle terrorism from jihad. That is a message for non-Muslims who are confused into hostility through the identification of terror and jihad, as well as for those of the faith who are not well up on the scriptures and therefore may be led into violence by the twisted reasoning of extremists. The second also leads on to the plan to set up counselling centres for young people.        
	In a secular country like India, it is crucial to have the communitys stand against terror declared loud and clear. Although much damage has already been done, it is heartening to find Islamic bodies stating their position at last, while also declaring that life for a Muslim is not at all bad in India. That they should be asking the government for an anti-communal violence law is not surprising; the debates around the growing number of arrests and encounter deaths of young men from the community make this logical. But signing a fatwa, however far-reaching, will no longer be enough. The idea of counselling centres is promising, and it can be linked with the modernizing of madrasahs already taking place. The religious leadership needs to allow greater space to liberal voices from within the community, and debates on democracy and womens status. On the other hand, the government cannot sit idle. It should not only work on concrete projects that will help remove the communitys sense of being discriminated against  and quick-fix quotas are not the way  but should also make sure that mischievous propaganda equating a religion with terrorism is severely penalized. It takes two sides to heal wounds and isolate killers. Patience and determination would help.

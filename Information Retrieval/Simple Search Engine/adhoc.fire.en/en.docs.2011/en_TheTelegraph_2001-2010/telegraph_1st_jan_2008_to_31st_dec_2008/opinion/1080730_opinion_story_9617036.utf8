	The Maoists in Nepal have had the first taste of what life can be like in a parliamentary democracy. Just when they were strutting about in the former kingdom as if it were they alone who mattered, the three other political parties, Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum got together in the constituent assembly to bag the offices of both the president and the vice-president. Right now, these offices may be more ornamental than anything else but it is also a fact that the president may have a crucial role to play when the new government is formed and the Maoists may once again realize that it is all about numbers in a multi-party system.        
	The election results may not reflect the current nature of the Maoists strength in the countryside. But their embarrassment cannot be glossed over. Just when the world was being made to believe that Nepal was all about Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Prachanda and Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, there came Ram Baran Yadav, a person of Indian origin, to run away with the presidents office and to prove that if those who hold the ballot to be more important than the bullet team up, the Maoists will always be in a minority in the present parliament.        
	The embarrassment could have been avoided if, at the outset, the Maoists had agreed to united action and to seat-sharing. They ought to have done so, as the change in Nepal did not come about because of their efforts alone. Yet, they chose to be intransigent and refused to accept the veteran Girija Prasad Koirala as the president, in which case they could have bargained for the second post. Now, as things have turned out, they have had to accept Koiralas party colleague as the head of state and a MPRF representative as the deputy head. And there is no reason to believe that in the days to come the three anti-Maoist forces will not work together again for what they may perceive is in the interest of the country. The chances of the Maoists sharing that perception appear bleak right now. And therein lies ample cause for concern for the future.                
	Sore thumb        
	To begin with, it is necessary to watch carefully whether there is any attempt at stirring up ethnic unrest. Both the president, Yadav, and the vice-president, Paramananda Jha, are Madhesis and this can encourage mischief-mongers who always seem to find a potent weapon in ethnicity. If that happens, not only will the foothills be in flames but the impact will also be felt in adjoining areas in India, particularly in the Darjeeling hills.         
	For the time being, the Maoists lack of success in the two elections must have come as some comfort to the ousted king, Gyanendra, as he can now expect a little more space for himself along with the other three parties. Physically, he may be out of Narayanhiti palace but Gyanendra may still play an indirect role in matters of policy-making and government-functioning. The alliance that brought down the Maoists has been described by the Nepali Congress as democratic, and this should be music to Gyanendras ears as he most certainly did not want his palace dictatorship to be replaced with some kind of proletarian hegemony.        
	A democratic alliance in Nepal will also be of advantage to India. More so, if the Maoists agree to be a part of it, contesting the others but not disturbing the apple cart. And with the changed political scenario in New Delhi, the Maoists in Nepal no longer have anybody to intercede on their behalf in India. When running a small country, such intercessions are often needed, and Prachanda and his comrades will do well to realize that. The choice before them is simple: either play a meaningful role in Nepals reconstruction or stick out like a sore thumb.

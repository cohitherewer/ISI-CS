	The holding of public office inevitably brings with it certain responsibilities. These responsibilities, most of the time, are clearly defined, and, in certain cases, even laid down in the Constitution. The carrying out of those responsibilities often entails the suppression of personal views, and remaining strictly within the confines of the defined role. Thus, the Chief Justice of India is, of course, free to have a personal view on any matter; the problem arises if he begins to articulate these views. Hence the purists view that for holders of high public office, such as the Chief Justice of India, silence is golden, and speech silvern, if not bronze. The Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, while speaking at a meeting organized by a non-government organization, expressed his views and criticism on a diverse range of topics. He expressed his anguish over the politics of divisiveness and disruption that engendered violence. It can hardly be doubted that Mr Balakrishnans sadness is widely shared by most right-thinking people who respect democracy.        
	The validity of his statements cannot remove the nagging doubts about their propriety. The Chief Justice of India is not, many would argue, the nations conscience keeper. His job is to ensure that the law of the land is upheld, and that the allocated punishments and penalties are imposed on those who violate the law. To step outside of this role is to transgress the line that demarcates the roles and responsibilities of the Chief Justice of India. In democratic practice, the form is as, if not more, important as the content. Form dictates that the Chief Justice should restrict his pronouncements to matters directly related to his appointed role. Mr Balakrishnans views are laudable, but not perhaps totally proper from the chair of the highest judicial authority in the country.

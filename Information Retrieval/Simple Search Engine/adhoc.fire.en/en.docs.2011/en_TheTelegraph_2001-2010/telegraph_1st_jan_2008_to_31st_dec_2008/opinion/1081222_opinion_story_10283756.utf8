                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SHOCK QUESTION                                                    
	Nawaz Sharif knows his shock value. He has used it to remarkable effect ever since Pakistan started to weigh its democratic choices against the failing dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf. Beginning with his defiant bid at re-entering Pakistan last September, Mr Sharifs interventionism  in government-formation, in the reinstatement of sacked judges, in the removal of the former president  has established him as a credible political option. It is possible that Mr Sharifs interjection in the narrative emanating from the Pakistan establishment about the States non-involvement in the attack on Mumbai was motivated by a political stratagem and not by sudden pangs of conscience. But in asking why the government should cordon off the alleged residential area of the arrested terrorist in India when it has nothing to hide, Mr Sharif has lent his voice to a section of people in his country who no longer dare to ask the question. Their seemingly needless worry over truths and half-truths has been smothered by the emotions that the Indian allegations have raised in Pakistan. They have not only united the radical with the liberal, but also brought the civilian society together in support of the army, which, until recently, was seen as a stumbling block in the path of democratization.        
	Having raised the uncomfortable question, it remains to be seen whether Mr Sharif would have the energy to seek its answer. As he knows, the answer, most probably, can be provided not by the Pakistan president, whose pitch Mr Sharif has queered, but by the military. And there he would reach a dead end. It is a curious amalgam of blind faith, opportunism and so-called tradition that has kept the Pakistan army always a step ahead of the political leadership. If Asif Ali Zardari is having to lip-sync with the army on the issue of terror, it is only because the army has managed to stymie Pakistans transition into democracy at a crucial stage with its clandestine operations in the name of strategic defence. According to a recent study, Mr Sharif could make a real difference with an overwhelming support of 59 per cent of his nation. But to do that, he would need to answer some questions honestly. Given his religious sympathies that are evident in his persistent advocacy of a dialogue with militants, would he be able to make a dispassionate analysis of terror and its workings?

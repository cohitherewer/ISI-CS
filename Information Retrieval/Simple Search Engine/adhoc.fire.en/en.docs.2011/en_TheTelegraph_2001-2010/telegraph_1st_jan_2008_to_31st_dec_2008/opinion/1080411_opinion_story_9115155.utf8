The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Imagine a better India
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IMAGINE A BETTER INDIA                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The world circa 2008  a vibrant world where past principles and ideologies are being ruthlessly questioned, where creative minds are thinking out of the box, looking at new possibilities which will dignify the lives of more, rather than the few, in the larger scheme of our contemporary civilization, where human rights and values are taking precedence over considerations that are meant to exploit the helpless, the less privileged among us. If only India had an uncorrupted leadership, the country, with all its indigenous sciences, philosophies and storehouse of knowledge, could have got over the errors and mistakes of the last century and lead the way in showing the other countries of the world the path to a better future. Instead, our dull and selfish elected representatives are aspiring to bring back everything that has been rejected, forcing us to regress because of their incompetence.        
	With honest political will and commitment to deliver the goods by doing whatever it takes, India could transform itself in a comparatively short time. Status quoism must be damned and rejected, flushed out of the political and administrative system. The terrible habit of remaining silent, of not wanting to rock the boat by initiating dramatic, much-needed reform and change, of reprimanding the robust risk-takers through threat and blackmail, has made our sub-continent stand still at a time when the world is changing rapidly. This inability to break out of the colonial mindset must be deemed criminal. As must be the politicians and bureaucrats who invade our lives and destroy our hitherto strong value system and our traditional ethics and morality.                
	Awake, arise        
	There are examples of how ministers, who attempt to step out of the archaic patterns of governance to bring in fresh air and oxygen, are tortured by their colleagues, who will be exposed for ineptitude if the status quo is disrupted, as well as by the media that have, by and large, misused their freedom to make unsolicited comments without bothering to find out the truth. There is a great, new methodology that is followed by the media whenever they want to transform information into fact. Sheila Dikshit, Renuka Chowdhury and Ambika Soni have been recent victims of such warped and superficial reports. These three women are intelligent, literate, experienced and worldly-wise, have dared to think beyond the usual parameters, have taken the accompanying flack in their stride  all for the future of the country. They opted to be in public life only for the sake of India. However, their colleagues work against them, often drive the three against each other in order divide and rule, and bureaucrats forcibly enforce the marking time so that their initiative is killed, and then the media add fuel to fire and assist the attack on change. These women are thwarted because they are only three, fighting against a million. For their ideas to succeed we need many mutinies.        
	The Indian public can see the degradation of the political class, its subservience to a corrupt political boss and rejection of the few honest men with whom they do not want to align. The self-serving men have betrayed India. But India is no longer fooled by them. Rich India uses these moneyed men to its advantage in every way possible and they in turn continue to exploit those who do not have an adequately loud voice and political clout. Both the classes have to be sized correctly and made to facilitate growth, not stall it or exploit it.         
	Only a strong leader can begin the process and the new generation of Indians will take it forward and pull this great civilization out of the dreadful mire that has begun to choke ideas and energy, growth and dignity. India is yearning for that leadership. Of course, the leader has to work at the risk of destroying the status quo. But then, that is exactly what is needed now.

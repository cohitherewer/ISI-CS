	Many years ago, the walls of Calcutta buildings used to declare in ugly graffiti that Chinas chairman is our chairman. The possessive pronoun in the slogan signified the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). This craven loyalty to China was resurrected by none other than the government of West Bengal, when last week it prohibited a rally to protest against the repression being carried out in Tibet by the Chinese government. That prohibition order is somewhat unique: neither the government of India nor any other state government has instituted such a ban on any show of protest by Tibetans against the Chinese government. To see such an order being passed on a protest rally in a city like Calcutta is enough to take anyones breath away. Calcutta is famous (or infamous) as a city of processions and rallies; the party that heads the government of West Bengal, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has on innumerable occasions taken out rallies to protest against acts of imperialist aggression by the United States of America. But when it comes to China, the CPI(M) and the government it runs quietly and shamelessly retract their radical fangs.        
	The CPI(M) is free to declare allegiance and support to any country and to any action by that country. What it cannot afford to ignore is that in India, and therefore in West Bengal, it functions within a democracy. A democracy allows people the right of peaceful protest. The CPI(M) has taken full advantage of this right even though its demonstrations of protest have not always been peaceful. Therefore the government that it leads in West Bengal cannot logically disallow a peaceful protest rally showing solidarity with the people of Tibet. It had only one reason for not permitting the rally. It did not want anything to happen in Calcutta that would be embarrassing to China. The Chinese government has responded with alacrity. The consul general of China in Calcutta has expressed his profound satisfaction at the decision of the government. Comrades, after all, should always stand by comrades. The exhibition of this kind of solidarity has only served to reveal the scant respect the CPI(M) and the government of West Bengal have for democracy and its rights. This might win the CPI(M) a few points in China but will fetch it none in India. It has covered the party in shame.

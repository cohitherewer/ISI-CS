	It is rare for any Indian to hit the bullseye in any event, let alone where it is most required, rifle shooting. Thus, the fact that Abhinav Bindra rose to the occasion to hit the target is by itself remarkable. But the more remarkable and joyous matter is that he aimed right when it was most needed, and won for India its first individual gold medal in the Olympics in 108 years. Sportsmen from countries of far lesser size and eminence than India have many Olympic gold medals to show for their sporting abilities. Indian sportsmen have perhaps taken the motto of amateur sports a bit too literally. That motto says that playing and participating are more important than winning. This is a creed that most modern sportsmen scoff at. One plays to win and not to lose. Mr Bindras triumph will hopefully inspire Indian sportsmen to abandon antiquated notions and to compete only to win the gold.        
	Mr Bindras victory has some additional and special flavours. He was by no means the favourite to win the 10-metre air rifle event. On the contrary, he was ranked 17th, and can thus be described, without undue exaggeration, as the outsider who won. To become the Olympic champion, he had to beat the Athens Olympic champion, Zhu Qinan of China, and the Finnish shooter, Henri Hakkinen. In the course of the tournament, it was by no means clear that Mr Bindra was emerging as the clear favourite. In the qualifying round, he had a two-point deficit against Messrs Qinan and Hakkinen. But his first shot in the final round placed him in the third place, and before the fourth he was in the second spot. By his seventh shot, he was leading and he clinched the title, to the surprise of most and the delight of all sports lovers in India, with his deciding shot. Indias solitary gold medal in an individual event came in a sport that is neither well known nor popular. Mr Bindra is a businessman who has mastered the science of using an air rifle accurately as a solitary pursuit without any fan following. He will come back from Beijing as a national hero, and as is the custom in India, he will be fted and may even perhaps be treated as an icon till he suffers a loss in a major tournament. He should keep that head and hand steady and his eyes fixed on the bullseye. That will fetch him more medals, than will the publics adulation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STRUCK HARD                                                    
	Unless it causes serious loss and inconvenience, there is no point to a strike. This must have been the feeling behind the two-day bank strike called by the United Forum of Bank Unions. Held in the last week of September, one day away from the weekend and just four days before the banks half-yearly closing  on which day there will be no public transaction again in the middle of the week  the strike has been timed perfectly to put ordinary people into serious difficulties. In West Bengal, for those whose only good time during the year is the Durga Puja it is worse, because the pujas are early in October this year. But ordinary people have no unions; they are not able to strike against the strange fate that makes them the victims of a tussle between the Indian Banks Association and the UFBU. A bank strike, for one day, at any time of the year, is hard enough; on two consecutive days before the half-yearly closing it is punishing. No doubt the unions are very conscious that the definition of essential service in the Essential Services Maintenance Act includes that in which a strike would prejudicially affect the maintenance of any public utility service... or the maintenance of supplies and services necessary for the life of the community or would result in the infliction of grave hardship on the community. Either the bank employees on strike for two days want to drive home the point, making sure that even the ATMs run out of money  leaving travellers and families of emergency patients quite helpless  or they cannot believe that closed banks can cause grave hardship for the non-bank population.        
	The unions list of grievances is long and varied. It ranges from the IBAs failure to implement an earlier understanding about wage revision, pension option and compassionate appointment, to the demand that the IBA should make a commitment that privatization of banks, the merger of public sector banks and the proposed amendments to the Banking Regulation Act will not be done. The finance ministry is making its most conciliatory noises, both reassuring and soothing. But bank employees unions refuse to be soothed. They feel they have a lot due to them, including a granting of their wish that there should be no reform in banking. Compared to their ire, the difficulties of ordinary people, foreign exchange trading and money market operations  hit by the two-day strike  are unimportant issues.

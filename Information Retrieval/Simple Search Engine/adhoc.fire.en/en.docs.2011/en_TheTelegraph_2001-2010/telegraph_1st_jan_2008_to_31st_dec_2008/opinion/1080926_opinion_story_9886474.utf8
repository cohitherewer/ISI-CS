	Ever since the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, there has never been an end to defining, declaring and legislating for the sake of protecting childhood. But childhood is a notion, usually clung on to by adults, while children are actual human beings. Their lives are too real and diverse for the fixities and universals of conventions, definitions and laws. So when the national commission for protection of child rights comes up with yet another suggestion for the safety and education of Indian children, then the realists response is bound to be ambiguous. The commission wants the age bar on child-workers to be raised from 14 to 18, and all children out of school to be declared victims of child labour. Some child-workers can be allowed to work during vacations, but only under monitored conditions. Like most well-intentioned declarations about the worlds children, this one sounds unexceptionable too. But also like most such declarations, it seems to emanate from a realm of abstractions that is far removed from the complex actualities in which children are forced to work, or stay away from school, in India.        
	The Central and state governments must all be aware of how it has proved impossible to implement the recent bar on child-workers below the age of 14. Everywhere, from roadside tea-stalls to middle-class homes to garment factories, little boys and girls are being made to work at the expense of their education and other basic requirements for well-being. If poverty makes the home and family far from the safe havens they are supposed to be for children, then the State and its various protective institutions have not been any more effective in guaranteeing the UNCRC utopia. The laws are all more-or-less in place, given the scale and depth of the problems in India when it comes to primary education and child labour. So why does it not strike the Centre and the state governments to leave declarations aside, and make a concerted effort to bring the existing physical infrastructures up to scratch? The courts, child welfare boards, remand homes on the one hand, and the schools, mid-day meals and anganwadi schemes on the other: the entire system could do with an urgent shot of hard work driven by political will. Only then, perhaps, would all the thinking and suggesting in high places begin to sound less absurdly well-meaning.

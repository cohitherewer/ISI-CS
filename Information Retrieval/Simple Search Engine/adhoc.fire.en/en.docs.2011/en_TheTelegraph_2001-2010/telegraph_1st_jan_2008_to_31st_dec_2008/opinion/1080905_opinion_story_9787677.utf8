	Democracy is something to be officially celebrated as well as feared. This ambivalence informs the Indian State, and manifests itself most tellingly around election time. With assembly polls coming up in six states in a few months and general elections early in 2009, the government has begun to express its old and unresolved anxieties regarding exit and opinion polls. In the run-up to the 2004 general elections, all political parties were unanimous in wanting them banned (the Rashtriya Janata Dal wanted to stop even astrological predictions from being published or telecast), and the Election Commission could not agree more. But the Supreme Court had firmly shot down as unconstitutional the proposal for such a ban, sticking to a 1999 verdict that it would be devoid of merit. So this time, the EC and the Centre have decided to take legislative recourse, and discuss a proposal to amend the Representation of People Act, 1951: exit polls should be banned from the date of the ECs notification, and opinion polls until the end of the last phase of elections.        
	The fear of the formation and circulation of public opinion, of debate and discussion, is at the heart of such a unanimous political reaction. But in wanting to ban opinion and exit polls, this fear expresses itself as the States concern for the quality of information being made available to the public, mainly by the media, for the publics judgment. Such a concern is essentially and anxiously patronizing, assuming that the public is a hydra-headed monster of passivity that is swayed by every swing of opinion served up to it by the manipulative media, especially when elections are held in phases. But this has been proven wrong repeatedly in India, particularly in 1971 and 1977 with the overwhelming support and the equally overwhelming rejection of Indira Gandhi. So, the governments fear of the people being misled is unfounded and can also be dealt with level-headedly without recourse to such infringements on the freedom of speech. And nothing less than this is ultimately at stake in the matter, as the apex court and as a number of attorney-generals have pointed out, more than once, in their censures to the EC. As long as people are clearly told who had paid for and conducted the poll, when and for how long it was conducted, and what the sample and margin of error were, there is no reason to think that they would be incapable of exercising their critical faculties adequately.

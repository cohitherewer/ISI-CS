                                                                                                                 BLAME VICTIM                                                    
	It is sinister and shameful how the fact of Scarlett Keelings death in Goa is getting lost in a haze of misplaced outrage. A dangerous unwillingness to look at what is really at stake in the brutal incident is being deflected into opinions, attitudes and judgments, the greater part of which is focusing attention away  unthinkingly, but deliberately as well  from the real issues. It is now fairly certain that Scarlett had been raped, possibly by more than one man, and then murdered. In the five weeks that have passed since her death, it has also become more than obvious that the Goa police have suppressed and distorted the facts of the case more than once. The first autopsy report was misinterpreted to suit the polices version of the case that has now been proved wrong. Witnesses have not been pursued properly, and investigations have suddenly speeded up, casting doubt on the thoroughness with which the police are following the leads. Significantly, the moral of the story seems to be embodied in Scarletts fatal recklessness with sex and drugs, and in her mothers equally reckless negligence of her minor daughter. This scenario then gets packaged in the xenophobic myth of the Goan white trash lifestyle. Thus the question of how this criminal nexus is sustained by a network of powerful interests involving the police as well as senior politicians can be shelved conveniently. So the chief minister of Goa can, with impunity, blame Scarletts mother for not being responsible and careful enough.        
	 Both in India and in her native Britain, Fiona MacKeowns tattoos, piercings, single motherhood and alternative lifestyle have provided reason enough to undermine the validity of her struggle against the Goa police and government to establish the truth of her daughters death. At the core of this way of thinking lies the conviction that women who are free with themselves deserve the violence that they provoke. Besides, Ms MacKeown may have opened a Pandoras box of connected crimes and corruption, implicating the entire gamut of the Goan social and political establishment, from the seediest to the most powerful. This establishment must remind itself that what is being investigated is a crime. The appearance and lifestyle of the victim or her mother do not, in any way, make it any less of a crime, or any less brutal. The culpability that Goa must confront is far more home-grown than that of irresponsible foreign parenting.

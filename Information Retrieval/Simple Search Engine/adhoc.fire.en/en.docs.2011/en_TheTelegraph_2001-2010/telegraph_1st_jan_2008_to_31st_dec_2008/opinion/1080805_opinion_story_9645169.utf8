	One by one the various obstacles are being removed. The first obstacle was internal, with the Left parties vehemently opposed to the Indo-US nuclear deal. The government of Manmohan Singh took that hurdle in its stride, despite many predictions to the contrary. The second hurdle was assumed to be the meeting of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which in its meeting on August 1 approved a safeguards agreement with India. This approval was largely expected and it came by way of a unanimity among all its members. The next step is to secure the approval of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and then the sanction of the Congress of the United States of America. The last one is probably the most uncertain because it is outside the purview of Indian diplomacy. The approval of the IAEA is a significant milestone in the road that will lead to Indias emergence as a major nuclear power. To achieve this status, India had to first end its isolation among the countries that determine the supply of uranium and other radioactive material. This supply, controlled by the major nuclear powers, has been available to those countries who have signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and have given an undertaking not to produce nuclear bombs. India has refused to submit to such a one-sided agreement, but Indias position has weakened after Pokhran-II and the complete stoppage of supplies to Indias reactors. With the IAEA approval, this long period of drought and isolation is about to end.        
	What is significant is the unanimity of the approval from the IAEA. Even Pakistan, which could have had reasons to be miffed at the special status being accorded to India, did not oppose the proposal. This demonstrates two things. One, the standing that India now enjoys in the community of nations; two, the hard work put in by Indian diplomats behind the scenes in Vienna and in other important international capitals to allow the proposal to go through without a glitch in the IAEA. The unanimity stands in stark contrast to the myopic opposition within India by some political parties to the Indo-US nuclear deal, of which the approval of the IAEA was an essential part. The opposition of the Bharatiya Janata Party was based on the logic of sour grapes, and that of the Left on a phobia about the US. The world has shown that it has no time for such concerns and is eager to accept India in the high table of nations.

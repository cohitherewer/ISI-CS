The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Shot in the school
                                                                                                                 SHOT IN THE SCHOOL                          - US campus deaths distract Indian diplomats from their work        Diplomacy -   K.P. Nayar                          Northern Illinois University, February 14, 2008                                              
	For an Indian journalist based in the United States of America, the worst professional nightmare these days is the sudden appearance of a red Breaking News banner on the CNN screen, announcing yet another university shooting. It invariably sends me and my colleagues from other Indian newspapers in Washington scrambling for the telephone numbers of international student faculty advisers and office-bearers of Indian student associations in the US university where the latest gun violence has erupted.        
	This month, in just one week between February 7 and 14, when the most recent carnage occurred in Northern Illinois University near Chicago, I had to cancel appointments and reorganize my schedule on five days to check on breaking television news for possible Indian or Indian-American students or academics among the victims of Americas campus gun-culture.        
	That gun-culture is not the subject of this column. The problem of easy access to guns in the US has been discussed extensively in the American and international media for many years with no results except that the situation has gone from bad to worse. What is at issue in Indias external affairs is the brazen double standard in official New Delhi, when the security and welfare of Indians are at stake in the US on the one hand, and in the less glamorous regions of the world on the other.              
	The Indian government and its agencies have been called upon repeatedly in the last one year to invest their resources and manpower in bringing succour to compatriots who are victims of Americas campus violence. Yet no one in New Delhi has so far spared any time or effort to consider an institutional response to the recurring claims on their reserve of goodwill and facilities. Such a lackadaisical approach is in marked contrast to the steps that have been taken in New Delhi, ostensibly to prevent victimization of Indians in the Gulf, and to ensure that Gulf Indians make no claim on the Indian States resources.        
	The first seven years of the new millennium have seen a phenomenal increase in the number of Indian students travelling to the US to pursue higher studies. The visa uncertainties following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 slowed down this flow of young Indians, but only briefly. Even third-rate American campuses now have Indian students in considerable numbers. This movement of Indian students to the US is set to increase if the dollar continues its slide and if prosperity and easier availability of foreign exchange in India grow the way it has done in the last 10 years.         
	If it were not for this new wave of Indian academic questers in US institutions, it is unlikely that 31-year-old Chandrasekhar Reddy Komma and 33-year-old Kiran Kumar Allam would have found themselves out of luck in December last year, when they were shot in an apartment in the Louisiana State University campus in the crime-ridden city of Baton Rouge, the seat of the Indian- American governor, Bobby Jindal. It is equally unlikely that the Jadavpur University alumnus, Abhijit Mahato, would have died last month  shot  if it were not for the new rush of Indians to study in the US. There have been several more such instances, including the deaths of Indian students and an Indian-American professor at Virginia Tech last year, the deadliest shooting rampage in an American campus that claimed 33 lives.        
	But consider this. Every Indian going to work in the Arabian Gulf countries, except professional degree holders, professional managers and those falling in similar categories of emigrants, is considered to be at risk in those countries. The government has gone to great lengths to ensure that the taxpayers money does not have to be used to repatriate them if they are in trouble or to bring their bodies back to India if they die in the Gulf.         
	These workers are allowed to go to the Gulf states to take up employment only after they are cleared by the Protector of Emigrants. To obtain such clearance, their prospective employers have to deposit a sum of money with the Protector of Emigrants that is roughly equivalent of the cost of repatriating them  or their dead bodies  to India if and when such repatriation becomes necessary. In many cases, the prospective employees themselves cough up the deposit because they are desperate to work in Dubai or some other El Dorado in the Gulf.        
	Every time there are Indian victims in a major shooting in an American university, Indias embassy or its consulates in the US despatch diplomats to the campuses to organize relief. Because the ways of the American bureaucracy can be as bewildering, irrational and inefficient as that of the Indian police and local administration, senior consular officials, who are experienced, persevering and tactful, have to be spared for these assignments in order to have the bodies of victims speedily released or even to ensure that the relatives of victims get the necessary information.         
	These exercises have become a huge drain on the manpower and financial resources of the Indian mission and diplomatic posts in the US. Recently, the Indian government decided to outsource its passport collection and visa processing activities to a private company. This became necessary because consular officials are under pressure and no longer have the time to do this work themselves. It is not only that the demand for Indian visas to the US has gone up with the upswing in Indo-US engagement. Preoccupations such as Americas campus violence make it impossible for Indian diplomats posted in the US to attend to consular work as it has traditionally been done.        
	It is not that New Delhi is left without choices. Mexicos National Immigration Institute, an arm of the interior ministry dealing with visas, has 29 offices across the US. Mexico has consulates in 19 American states: in some states Mexico has five to six consular offices. India must decide whether it wants to follow Mexicos lead  and that of some other Latin American countries, which have large numbers of their citizens in the US  although it wont be necessary for New Delhi to expand its consular activity in the US on Mexicos scale. But some thought has to be spared in New Delhi on how it is going to cope with the growing consular demands on its diplomatic facilities in the US from the culture of violence in America that is claiming the lives of Indians both in campuses and outside.              
	A second option is for New Delhi to do to Indian students going to the US exactly what it has done to Indian workers going to Arabian Gulf countries. India could make emigration clearance mandatory for Indians who enrol in US universities. As part of this clearance, it could demand a deposit from every Indian enrolling in a US campus for study that would cover the very real and increasing risk of getting shot in an American university. Like in the emigration clearance deposit that is collected from Indian workers going to the Gulf states, this deposit will pay for the expenses if the student is shot and his body has to be repatriated to India.        
	It is not a proposal that will find favour in the corridors of power in New Delhi. The offspring of secretaries to the government of India or children of Indian politicians do not go to the Gulf to work as labourers. But they do go to the US to study. Members of this privileged class will resist any such levy because many of them believe India owes them what its officials abroad are now doing in instances of US campus violence.        
	The problem of gun violence in America is only likely to get worse, not better. B.S. Prakash, Indias consul-general in San Francisco, recently wrote an eminently readable account on a popular website about his social encounter with some otherwise normal Americans who endorse Americas powerful gun lobby. The encounter understandably left Prakash bewildered. But it is an indication of why things will not change in the US that after his account of the evening was published, Prakash was the target of organized hate mail by this lobby. If Americas gun lobby is capable of trying to silence an Indian diplomat writing for an Indian website, do Americans who want to impose even modest restrictions on guns in their country have any chance?

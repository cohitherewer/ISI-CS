	The art of pointing fingers                  
	Sir  The Marxists blame the bourgeoisie for all kinds of social malaise. But the prevalence of racism and xenophobia in China proves how absurd such allegations are (Rules for the games, July 24). We remember how black students were assaulted by Russian white supremacists at the Patrice Lumumba Peoples Friendship University in Moscow during the golden age of Soviet Marxism. The cultural insularity of Marxists breeds racial intolerance. Yet in India, Marxists criticize the prime minister for his recent diplomatic involvement with the racist US.

	Sir  Corruption and favouritism in missionary institutions are nothing new. The controversial recruitment of undeserving Christian candidates as lecturers at a premier missionary college in Delhi has proved this again (Row over teacher selection splits Stephens, July 14). Recently, I experienced such shameless duplicity at Don Bosco School, Siliguri. The principal had published a notice in March 2008, claiming that there was no vacancy in any class except class XI. The applicants returned empty handed. But within two months, he started admitting new students, all of them Christians, without even conducting an admission test. This was not merely unethical but also fraudulent on the part of the administration, and went against the ideals that the school claims to espouse. This kind of discrimination is not permissible in a secular democracy like India.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The admission procedure of the West Bengal University of Technology is appalling, to say the least. Following its irrational custom, the Common Entrance Test for the BBA course of 2008 was held twice  in June and July. While the technical colleges affiliated to other universities have already begun the admissions to start the classes in August, the process at WBUT lags behind by a month. Candidates now pay hefty amounts for admissions at non-WBUT colleges and if better offers come from the WBUT afterwards, the choice will be between wasting the earlier payment and rejecting the better offer. However, this is not all. Some WBUT-colleges such as the Heritage Academy, have started selling their seats for thousands of rupees in the name of provisional admission on the basis of pass marks in the CET, the results of which are pending still. The low cut-off is attracting a large number of students to reserve seats for cash. But as a matter of fact, the candidates will get seats in colleges in the order of merit only after WBUTs counselling, when many of them will be thrown out. The WBUT should immediately speed up its admissions so that candidates are not exploited by academic degree-sellers.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Many meritorious students are victimized by the messy system of admissions in technical colleges. My son, who ranked 2047 (B.Arch.) in the All India Engineering Entrance Examination, 2008, was allotted a seat in the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Jammu and Kashmir. It was his 12th option among the 17 in the priority list, filled up online in Form-1. But later we found that at least five students with lower ranks had got seats in NIT, Patna, which had been my sons eighth and fourth choice in Form-1 and Form-2 respectively. The Central Counselling Board, Allahabad, has justified this arbitrariness by blaming my son for mentioning the names of institutions he did not prefer, though they appeared near the end of the list as provisional options. It is not the applicants preferences but the whims of the authorities which are given greater importance.          
	Yours faithfully,

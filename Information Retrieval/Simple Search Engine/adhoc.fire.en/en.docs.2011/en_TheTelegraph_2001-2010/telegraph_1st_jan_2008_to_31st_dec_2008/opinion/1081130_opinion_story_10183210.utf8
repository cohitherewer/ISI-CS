                            Here comes the attack    What after Mumbai? For Shivraj Patil, that is. His Congress colleagues had thus far refrained from criticizing him in public, for fear of incurring the wrath of Patils very influential benefactor in the party. But the Congresss UPA allies had no such fear when the cabinet met urgently to discuss Mumbai on Thursday. As Sharad Pawar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan tore into Patils rather flimsy defence of having no advance intelligence on the terror attacks, no one rose to his aid. And reports suggest that the home minister didnt help his case by failing to provide details of the attack to the cabinet. Finally, however, the PM bailed out Mr Protocol (as Patil is called by a few of his colleagues) by saying that the post-mortem could wait until the terrorists had been neutralized in all the places under siege. It is more or less certain that siege is over at last. As the bodies are being counted, should Patil do a bit of counting  of his days  too?                          
	Few things are more uncomfortable than appearing in public after being expelled from ones party. Margaret Alva must have realized this the day the president released a commemorative stamp in honour of Alvas in-laws, Joachim and Violet, on the birth centenary of the couple. Not a single Congress minister or leader attended the function, not even the minister of state for telecom, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Thankfully, the Union minister in charge of the portfolio, A Raja, is not from the Congress, and, thus, had no problems attending. Other than Raja, and the Himachal Pradesh governor, Prabha Rau, there was one other person who kept Alva company that day. It was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, expelled from the CPI(M) earlier this year. He must have had plenty of notes to exchange with Alva.                        
	 Question: Whos the Union minister in charge of the Northeast?       
	Chances are that nine out of ten people asked this question will say Pass. And some of them might be Congressmen. Mani Shankar Aiyar  the answer to the question, incidentally  has made it known that he doesnt like such paanchvi-fails at all. And that could explain Manmohan Singhs recent circular that no minister should go to the Northeast or take any decision about the region without consulting Aiyar.                             
	 When campaigning ended in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, senior Congress leaders took time off. Naturally. But their styles were quite contrasting. A wheelchair-bound Ajit Jogi went from Chhattisgarh to Madhya Pradesh to campaign. Kamal Nath rushed back to Udyog Bhawan in Delhi to clear a mountain of files and chair a dozen meetings a day. Digvijay Singh decided to avoid coming back to Delhi. One can guess why. After spending a day in his hometown, Raghogarh, he headed for Rajasthan where electioneering is in full swing. The Delhi CM, Sheila Dixit, was spotted in a bookstore in the capitals Khan Market, grabbing titles from the newly arrived shelves.                            
	 Why did the prime minister decide to take charge of the information and broadcasting ministry when he had earlier given Anand Sharma instructions to stand in for the ailing Priya Ranjan Das Munshi till the latter recovered? The PMs decision reportedly came in the wake of Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs, taking too much interest in I amp;B. Among other things, Sharma had reportedly asked a close Das Munshi aide to go home. The gentleman took up the matter with party leaders. What followed could have been pure coincidence. But sources reveal that in Shastri Bhavan, the PMs intervention has been greeted with a sense of relief.                            
	 Milind Deora, MP and son of Murli Deora, got married very quietly a couple of weeks ago. Only a few select friends and Papa Deoras bridge-partners were invited. But word was soon out, followed by demands for a wedding feast. But then the attacks happened, and one of the places hit was the Oberoi Trident, where the wedding had taken place. The couple have now decided to donate the feast money to an appropriate charity.                            
	 Among the few things Shivraj Patil told the media since Wednesday were details of NSGs movement. Many are now wondering if he believes discretion is a part of valour at all.                        
	Before the siege of Mumbai, it had appeared for a brief while that the gulf between the Congress and the BJP was beginning to be bridged. None other than the PM had picked up the phone and dialled LK Advanis number, if only to ask him to hold his thoughts on Malegaon. But this development also showed up an unhappy state of things: the PMOs media management was at an all-time low. Neither the PMO, nor the Congress HQ had any idea about what the prime minister was doing or who he was speaking to. No wonder the journalists in the capital came to know about the phone-call from their BJP sources. They tried to cross-check with the Congress spokesperson and the PMOs media cell, but each sounded as surprised as the other. It was the BJP office again that informed about the PM sending the national security adviser to Advani. The Congress doesnt seem to mind that in both these episodes, it was the BJP version of things that the whole country got to know.

	The London Encyclopaedia By Ben Weinreb, 
  Christopher Hibbert, Julia Keay and John Keay, 
  Macmillan, pound;35  
	It was Charles Lamb who said that he could not sleep at night without the noises of the streets of London. The capital of the British Empire, even after history has forced its fall from that exalted position, continues to exert a fascination on the minds of many people. The litmus test of that rare breed called Coconuts  because they are brown outside and white inside  is how comfortable they are in London and how familiar they are with the streets and landmarks of London. This encyclopaedia is the London lovers delight and his ultimate bedside companion.  
	First, the basic facts about this tome. There are nearly 6,000 entries, arranged alphabetically. These cover every street, park, monument, building and even the liveried companies. There are separate entries on the citys institutions and events. Handbooks about and guides to London have a long history, going back to John Stows Survey of London published in 1598. Significantly, the very first entry in this volume is about how the famous London A to Z guide came into existence: through the labours of Phyllis Pearsall (1906-1996), writer and painter, who got lost in London in 1935, and decided to put together a proper guide with maps.        
	It is a truism that no one reads an encyclopaedia from cover to cover or from A to Z. One dips into an encyclopaedia or looks for information on a specific subject. This project saw the light of day in 1983. This, however, is a completely updated edition since in the 25 years in between, London and knowledge about it have undergone a complete transformation. The Keay couple (editors of the present edition) write in their introduction: Parts of London have changed almost beyond recognition since the 1980s. Dockers are no longer found in the Docklands and three quarters of the current office space in the City is of post-1980 construction. Derelict waterfronts, whether beside the river or the canal basins, have been transformed into sprightly amenities. Multiculturalism has also changed London. Outside of Istanbul, it has two of Europes largest mosques; it has the largest Hindu temple and the largest gurdwara in Europe.        
	The joy of this book lies however in the details. Charing Cross got its name in 1290 when Edward Is wife, Eleanor of Castile, died, and the monarch marked with a cross the 12 places where the funeral cortege rested on its way to Westminster Abbey. The small hamlet of Charing was where the last cross was put. That cross has disappeared. It stood where the statue of Charles I now is. The entry on Soho traces the areas history from the time when it was a royal park during the rule of Henry VIII (hunting took place there, hence the name from the ancient hunting cry So-ho!) to its fame or notoriety as that part of London where good food and good sex could be found. The 1980s saw the cleaning up of the area, resulting, many would say, in the loss of its charm. It is the little tidbits about the houses in various streets, the histories of the areas that make this book an absolutely invaluable treasure trove.

	Will there be time?                  
	Sir  The Metro Railway authorities seem to have decided all of a sudden to run the trains with an interval of eight minutes between them instead of the usual ten. As a result, office-goers like myself are having a hard time reworking our routines, and are ending up missing trains every day by a minute or two. To add to the inconvenience, the eight-minute interval remains operative only at certain times of the day while at others, the trains follow the earlier schedule. Do we have to commit to memory all the new timings if want to reach our offices on time?           
	Yours faithfully,        Anjan Biswas, Calcutta
        
	Beetle mania          
	Sir  The arrest of the renowned Czech entomologist, Petr Svacha, by forest officials of West Bengal has proved the ignorance of state officials yet again (Call to let off beetle scientist, July 6). All of us are well aware of the inefficiency of forest officers. Their job does not end with declaring a forest area protected; they are supposed to ensure that the reserved areas remain free of intruders. Forest officials have proved to be complete failures in this respect. But while they cannot carry out their responsibilities, they tend to become over-zealous if they can catch hold of people without any ill intention. They are also so foolish as not to be able to discern between a scientist gathering beetles for research and a poacher collecting them for profit. It is a shame that scientists whose researches have benefited forest authorities around the world are languishing at the Darjeeling Correctional Home for collecting insects with no market value.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Over 600 scientists have signed a petition asking for the release of Petr Svacha and Emil Kucera. The duo might be world-famous scientists, but they have little idea about law. Or they would not have collected a huge number of beetles, moths and butterflies from a protected area. Their action is bound to come under the scanner, especially at a time when the forests of north Bengal are fast becoming a centre of illegal trade in animals and insects. The report, Foresters catch foreigners with beetle (June 23), had said that According to forest officers, tiger beetle, which is in great demand for traditional medicines in China, Japan and in Latin American countries, fetches between Rs 6,000 and Rs 7,000 in the international market. There is no guarantee that the insects caught by Svacha are commercially useless, as claimed by Max Barclay, a curator at the Natural History Museum of London. The forest officials have every reason to keep the scientists in custody unless they are proved not guilty.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Wrong connection          
	Sir  I had applied for a BSNL broadband connection many weeks ago. Four weeks after the application was sent, BSNL personnel called me up to say that they could not provide me with the service. The reasons cited for their inability were weird. They said that of the 880 flats in Brindavan Gardens, where I stay, the residents of two flats have failed to clear their BSNL bills. The defaulters happen to belong to the Jain community, as my family does too. By some bizarre reasoning, BSNL has deduced that we must be related, and hence the refusal of a broadband connection. I think that BSNL is taking the concept of brotherhood too far. There must be at least 20 Jain families in Brindavan Gardens, but by no stretch of kinship ties can they be said to be related. Meanwhile, the deposit I made to BSNL for the connection has not been returned. Since I urgently need a broadband connection, and other internet providers do not work in this area, I do not know whom to turn to for help.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Agatha Christie: An English Mystery By Laura Thompson, Headline,  20              
	Early in the biography, Laura Thompson establishes that it was the normalness of the evil-doer that fascinated and troubled Agatha Christie right from her childhood. As a 10-year-old she writes: Why, of course, the Gun Man was there...And the awful part of it was, he might be anybody...You looked up in Mummys face  of course it was Mummy  and then you saw the light steely-blue eyes  it was the Gun Man. Not surprisingly then, Christies murderers are not serial killers, deviants or perverts. They are normal, ordinary people who lead unremarkable lives.        
	However dark and troubled her childhood writings might seem, Agatha Miller was a happy young girl, who was never sent to school. She learnt to read and write virtually on her own. Her home was very much a womens domain, with her mother, Clara Miller, being the most significant presence in the household. Thompson uses Christies diaries and letters to show how the relationship between Clara and her two talented daughters, while suffocating at one level, also helped them realize their creative potential. Madge was ten years older than Agatha and more outgoing of the two. She got published first, and initial critical acclaim also came to her first. The sisters were always close, but Agatha could not help but resent her sisters fame.        
	Christies biography takes off, as her literary career did, when her first husband, Archie Christie, demands a divorce almost immediately after her mothers death. No biography of Christie will be complete without the author trying to crack the mystery of her 11 days of disappearance immediately after her husband asked for a split in 1926. Thompson does a great job here. She uses as evidence a few letters written by Christie, eye-witness accounts of those who were at Harrogate where Christie stayed, and a fair bit of imagination to recreate those 11 days as Christie must have lived them. She had written to her brother-in-law before leaving that she would be in a Yorkshire spa. According to Thompson, this points to the fact that all that Christie wanted during this time was to have her husband come and take her back home. It is a believable argument even though it is at odds with the family version, which claims that Christie was suffering from amnesia.         
	These 11 days would eventually break Christies marriage and simultaneously make her the bestselling author of her time. While the jury continues to be divided on whether Christie disappeared for publicitys sake or whether she had had a nervous breakdown, the fact remains that the disappearing act boosted Christies reputation as the queen of mystery.         
	Christie was at her prolific best after the divorce. She married again later but her second marriage was a happier, albeit a long-distance one. Thompson describes Christies relationship with her daughter, Rosalind, at great lengths. Although Christie was aloof towards her daughter when she was a child, the relationship gained in strength in later years, particularly after Rosalinds son was born.         
	In all this, Thompson presents a woman who never really grew into the adult roles of a mother or a wife. She remained her mothers daughter, and kept searching for a nurturing figure throughout her life. Little wonder then that her relationship with Rosalind improved only when the daughter started looking after her ageing mother.         
	Thompson attempts, with limited success, to prove that Christie is an underrated writer who tried to give primacy to her plots and their denouement. Although she does provide some interesting insights into Christies works, she need not have tried so hard to defend the her. Christie hated publicity all her life and never defended herself against those who held her responsible for dumbing down her chosen genre. In fact, when she became Dame Agatha, she cheerfully claimed that it was a victory for the lowbrows. At a time when success is the ultimate barometer of an authors worth, the numerous film adaptations, translations and continuing sales of Christies works are proof enough of her abiding charm.

	World without time                  
	Sir  Before lamenting the passing of the old world, Amit Chaudhuri should have noted that these days we need to keep abreast of events happening across the globe (Doing Busyness, March 9). A famine in Africa, the war in Iraq, or the US stock market crash affects our lives directly. We get stuck in traffic jams every other day. What is the harm if we made gainful use of iPods, laptops and mobile phones during the time we are made to wait? Emails and text messages can also be useful, as they bring us closer to our loved ones.           
	Yours faithfully,         Keron Bhattacharya, Nottingham, UK
          
	Whats in a name?          
	Sir  Most everyone agrees that a princess of Jaipur graced the seraglio of Akbar. The dispute is about her name. Jodhabai or Jodhaabai, whatever you call her, is certainly not Jodhbai. Since her name is lost to history and historians, why deny a populist filmmaker the right to call her what he wills? After all, no historian claims to know what Raja Bihari Mals daughter, who was given in wedding to Akbar, was called. Surely the poor pawn of history deserves a name, even though contemporary records do not give her one?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Partho Datta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The screening of Jodhaa Akbar has led to the outbreak of popular unrest in parts of the country. The Rajputs have been most infuriated because of its historically inaccuracy. According to them, Jodhaabai was not Akbars wife. But period films are made in Bollywood to entertain, not to educate the masses, nor to blight the honour of any particular community. However, makers of such films cannot take a supportive public response for granted. The rise of right-wing politics has endangered communal harmony in India. What is offered as historical fantasy is often misconstrued as affront. And the way to criticize, according to fundamentalists, is to go on a rampage.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Z. Khan, Pune

                
	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee has reason to be irked by the liberties that Jodhaa Akbar takes with history (Case of the missing wife, March 6). But a more serious misrepresentation of facts has happened earlier, and closer home too. In The City of Joy, Dominique Lapierre depicted Calcutta as a place of unimaginable poverty and squalor. But Lapierre projects the book as fact, not fiction. The film based on the book was endorsed by several prominent Bengali intellectuals!           
	The forgotten annals of the 16th century might provide the recipe for a Bollywood potboiler, but the director should have been careful with facts. However dazzling a period romance, it should not lose sight of history.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Aroup Chatterjee, London 

                          
	A gun in the class          
	Sir  In view of the series of campus shootings in American universities, K.P. Nayars article, Shot in the school (Feb 20), makes some pertinent points. Nayar has suggested that the Centre should consider imposing emigration clearance on students going to study in the US, which will pay for the expenses if the student is shot and his body has to be repatriated to India. Appalling as this may sound, such stringent measures need to be put in place.           
	But Nayars other contention, that Americas campus violence makes it impossible for Indian diplomats...in the US to attend to consular work is debatable. Diplomats are not clerks. They are expected to competently handle even the most testing situations. And what message are the thousands of Indian teachers and students in American universities to get from our scared diplomats?                    
	Yours faithfully,

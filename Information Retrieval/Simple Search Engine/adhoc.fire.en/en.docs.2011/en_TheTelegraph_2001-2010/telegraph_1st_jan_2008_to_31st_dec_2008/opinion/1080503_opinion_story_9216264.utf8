The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Three women and their world
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THREE WOMEN AND THEIR WORLD                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	Another group reaches another landmark: Ensemble celebrates its silver jubilee with Mahesh Elkunchwars recent Sonata. Under Sohag Sen, Ensemble has an enviable record of 15 productions in its first 20 years, followed by eight shorter workshop pieces in the last four years. To mark its 25th anniversary, it returns not only to regular drama, but also to the dramatist whose works it has most often, and most memorably, interpreted.        
	The choice is equally appropriate because Sen has repeatedly shown interest in gynocentric plays, and Sonata presents the travails of three single female friends. When Calcutta first saw it under Amal Allanas direction in 2002, the stunning design overwhelmed all other aspects. Sen, however, brings acting to the fore. The three experienced performers give a subtle yet brilliant exposition of the histrionic art without any trace of the negative connotations of excess or theatricality that accompany the word histrionic.        
	Yama Shroff and Anasua Majumdar portray former classmates, now successful professionals, who share a flat as well as a yawning loneliness. Despite the fact that Elkunchwar has typed them as opposites  Shroff the reserved and prudish Marathi college teacher and writer, Majumdar the bubbly Rabindrasangeet-singing Bengali corporate lady  they individualize their parts distinctively. Shroffs studied poker face hides several surprises, as when she joins (unscripted) in Majumdars soulful song, or when she sits down on the sofa uncomfortably between her friends, until they all break out in laughter. In contrast, Majumdar gives her role a charming uninhibitedness alongside uncertainty and vulnerability.        
	The director herself does justice to their sassy, chain-smoking journalist pal with a boyfriend who beats her, but for some strange reason, Sen changes her name to Lily Mendez, racially profiling her without any such sanction from the text. On the other hand, her alteration of Shroffs stage surname from Ranade to Chaturvedi is not problematic at all.        
	Actually, we might go to the extent of stating that this power trio divests the play of some of its obvious masculinity. Yet, the female characters, for all their outward strength, feel incomplete without male company. It could well be argued that they are just three women who do not represent womanhood as a whole, but one wonders whether Elkunchwar sends out the right signals by depicting these women without men (Sens violent partner hardly counts) as pathetically alone. And it may sound presumptuous for a male critic to suggest that a male author hasnt got under the skin of feminine conversation, but the sudden exchange on lesbianism seems forcibly imposed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       GAME FOR CHANGE                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Raju Mukherji                              
	Shah Rukh Khan must be complimented for acknowledging that Twenty20 is not real cricket. It is an entertainment activity that combines cricket with song and dance. But it is equally true that cricket has had many dimensions over the years. There was a time, about 100 years ago, when Test cricket would be played not over five days, but over two days, which was later increased to three days. The three-day Tests gradually became four-day affairs and finally settled down to the current five-day format. Over the years, first-class cricket has been spread over three days and four days and, in some rare cases, up to five days as well.         
	Test matches were once played to a finish without a predetermined time-span. At Durban in 1938-39, South Africa and England played each other for 10 days! The game was finally called off when the captain of the British ship refused to wait any longer for the voyage back home. That match is known as the Timeless Test, though the idea was rejected. Cricket has always experimented with novel ideas, but has been pragmatic enough not to accept those with little appeal.         
	When limited-overs cricket was introduced in the Seventies, some people feared that it would spoil the basic structure of the game. In a decades time, it became more popular than Test cricket. The foundations of cricket are so strong that new ideas cannot disturb its equilibrium. However, T20 is hardly a new concept. Cricket in this format was played in the Fifties among the office teams of Calcutta. It was the brain-child of former Bengal cricketer and Test umpire Santosh Ganguly. Thus Calcutta can rightfully take credit for introducing T20 to cricket.                 
	Fault lines        
	Cricket history is on the side of the promoters of T20 cricket. Cricket has prospered from a rural pastime to an international sport. It has progressed from under-arm bowling to over-arm bowling, seen its popularity spread from continent to continent. Cricket has branched out from class to mass viewing. Now, with India becoming the world champions in T20, the appeal of this shortened version is bound to rope in newer audiences. The young generation wants constant thrills. The concept of T20 has been very successful in England. The motive of T20 is not to replace multi-day Test cricket or the one-day internationals, but to become a worthy addition to the ethos of cricket.         
	The critics of the T20 concept have valid reasons too. They feel, and quite rightly, that the traditional values and techniques of cricket would recede to the background. The temperament and patience of the players would not be tested in the way they are in Tests.         
	The critics also feel disappointed that film stars instead of cricketers would hog the limelight. The system of recruitment has also raised some eyebrows. Many recruits, especially the under-19 players, have not even played a single game of T20. On what basis were they chosen? For these youngsters, earning in crores might not be the best way of learning the values of cricket.         
	Only recently, men like Tendulkar, Dravid and Ganguly were omitted from Indias T20 World Cup team. Within two months, all three have returned to the T20 fold not as ordinary players but as icons! If someone is not good enough for the national team, can he be considered to be an icon?         
	The yardstick of payment is also quite a riddle. The highly successful Ricky Ponting, with thousands of runs in all forms of cricket, is only worth about a crore, while Manoj Tiwari was thought good enough for more than three crore!         
	Hopefully, these minor aberrations will be rectified as T20 matures. Its success would depend entirely on the response of the spectators. The entertainment industry has to work overtime to make the package appealing to the audience. We will have to wait and see if Shah Rukh Khan can add his spice to the cricket pickle.

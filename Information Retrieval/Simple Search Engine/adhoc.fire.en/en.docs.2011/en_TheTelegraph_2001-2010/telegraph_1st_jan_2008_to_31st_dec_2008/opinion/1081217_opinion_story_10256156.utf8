                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BACK IN POWER                                   Fifth Column - Sumanta Sen                              
	A feeling seems to persist in sections of the political establishment, as also in the media, that the Northeast is some sort of an exotic land that has nothing in common with the rest of the country. Even when the people there respond to issues in much the same way as others from the mainland, the common refrain is, the Northeast must be brought within the mainstr- eam of national life. It is only to be hoped that the election results of Mizoram will end, at least for the time being, the pointless suggestion that the Mizos, Nagas and Khasis are not quite Indians in the way the people from the plains are.        
	And this is not just because the Mizos have voted the Congress back into power after being ruled for years by the Mizo National Front. This is also because they have made it clear that they are against all separatist tendencies, which are part of life in the neighbouring states. The Congress fought the election under the leadership of Lalthanhawla. He had given up chief ministership in 1986 to honour a truce with the leader of the MNF, Laldenga, and had thereby ensured that Mizorams days of strife were over. The election results show that the Mizos did not forget the past. They decided that it was time to bring the 66-year old leader back to counter fissiparous tendencies in their state.         
	The Mizos felt that if, in the past, Lalthanhawla had ensured peace and unity by quitting in favour of the rebel, Laldenga, then it was time he held the reins once again, what with terrorism from across the border becoming very much a reality in the Northeast too. The previous chief minister, Zoramthanga, of the MNF had betrayed their confidence. And Brigadier Thengpunga Sailo of the Mizoram Peoples Conference, although highly respected, is too old now to inspire the people, particularly the younger generation.                 
	Difficult days        
	As the results were announced, there was a widespread feeling that the verdict was one against corruption. This is correct, but only partially. As with politicians in the rest of the country, corruption has eaten its way into most Mizo leaders too (even Lalthanhawla had faced serious allegation towards the end of his earlier stint in office). The church had to come up with strict rules against unfair practices during the campaigning for the elections. So when the Mizos voted so overwhelmingly for the Congress, it was not so much with hopes of a squeaky clean administration as of stability in a neighbourhood getting increasingly disturbed.         
	Results in Mizoram are almost always decisive. On earlier occasions, Sailo and Lalthanhawla have had thumping victories. The Mizos clearly do not believe in fractured mandates, unlike the Assamese and Manipuris who in the recent past also voted the Congress to power but in a hesitant manner, causing the party to seek the help of others. Perhaps the common bond of Christianity among the Mizos has something to do with this.        
	Lalthanhawla has romped home but there are serious problems ahead. The bamboo has flowered, the rodents have been out for some time and the crops have to be protected. The Zoramthanga administration had allegedly filched a large share of the Central funds released for assistance during the rodent-induced famine. The Congress will have to prove itself to be different in this regard.         
	Then there is the growing insistence on a larger role for the youth, and women in particular, in the administration. On the issue of cleanliness in public life, the church is bound to keep a close watch through the Mizoram Peoples Forum. For how long will the new rulers like to live with keen watchdogs monitoring every move of theirs? After all, the attractions of office in Aizawl are the same as they are in Guwahati, Imphal or elsewhere.

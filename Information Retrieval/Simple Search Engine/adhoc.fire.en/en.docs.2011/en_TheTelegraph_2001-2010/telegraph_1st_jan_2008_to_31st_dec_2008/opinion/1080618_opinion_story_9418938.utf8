	Easy rider                  
	nSir  It is not only surprising but also shocking and quite unbelievable that a person of the stature of former president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, a man known for his impeccable integrity, should have requested the government to provide him with a personal aircraft at public expense for his tours, knowing full well that he was not ordinarily entitled to such benefits now that he was not in office any more (Kalams plane plea crashlands, June 14). Kalam is said to have borne the entire expenses of his family and relatives during their stay at Rashtrapati Bhavan himself, and was known for his simple lifestyle. If Kalam had indeed made the impudent request, the government was absolutely right in deciding not to comply with it, since making an exception for him could lead to other former heads of State asking for similar favours. Given that Kalam has been a role model for leaders in the country, it should be verified whether he had indeed made such demands. If he did, then he has let down a large number of his admirers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	nSir  In India, perks, benefits, entitlements and endowments come naturally to administrative heads in government organizations. But A.P.J. Abdul Kalam no longer has a right to these privileges now that his tenure as president is over. The centre has been quite right in turning down his plea for a personal aircraft from among the defence fleet. The problem lies in the warped, feudal mindset of our politicians and leaders, who seem to have no scruples about putting public property to personal use. In fact, these privileges are one of the prime reasons why people aspire to such high offices. Kalams stature as an eminent scientist and his busy schedule notwithstanding, his use of a private jet, the expenses of which would be met by the public exchequer, would surely tarnish his image as an upright man. There is no doubt that his request will put the prime ministers office in a spot of bother at a time when he has urged his cabinet colleagues to go on an austerity drive.           
	Yours faithfully,

	High price to pay          
	nSir  Inflationary pressure has sent the ruling party into a tizzy, especially since the rise in prices comes just before the elections. With the global food crisis intensifying because of rapid industrialization and unchecked population growth, there is hardly any chance that the graph of domestic price rise will be reversed. Though inflation is at an all-time high now, the economist prime minister and his finance minister can only offer empty consolations. This is ironic, because at the time of coming to power, Manmohan Singh had assured the people that price stability was his governments highest priority. It is strange that the government is not questioning the findings of the Abhijit Sen panel, which could not come up with evidence to show that futures trading in agricultural products affected prices. Mainstream economists believe that high rates of inflation are caused by huge increases in money supply. Inflation can be controlled through fiscal measures such as reducing unnecessary government expenditure, increasing personal and commodity taxes, and having a surplus budget. It can also be controlled through monetary measures such as credit control, demonetization of currencies of higher denomination, increasing production of essential goods, rationing and price control. It is recognized that inflation in India is a structural as well as a monetary phenomenon. However, the situation is unlikely to change until global prices of oil, food and other articles come down. That is something that the United Progressive Alliance government has little control over. But it may yet have to pay the price for inflation in an election year.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta

                
	nSir  A section of the media has justified the fuel price rise in India as the only practicable answer to the global oil crisis. But the fact is that the government has been a complete failure in its fiscal planning, having known that such a crisis was looming large. India being a very large importer of crude oil, even a 10 per cent drop in national consumption would have had a significant impact on international prices. But the government has made no efforts thus far to optimally utilize energy sources in the country. There is no fuel policy to speak of. The government has failed to take forward the jatropha biodiesel projects and has lost valuable time and opportunity. Even now, the government has not come up with an alternative plan for another rise in global oil prices.           
	The European Union has cut down crude oil consumption by opting for biofuels wherever possible. There is no reason why India cannot do the same. Unfortunately, a government obsessed with the nuclear deal has no time for such immediate concerns.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	nSir  The logic behind the steep increase in the prices of petroleum products by the Centre and the subsequent reduction in sales taxes on these by certain states, is unclear. Most of these states have limited sources of revenue and a few cannot even pay the salaries of their employees. Thus it does not make much sense to expect the poor states to offer relief against the fuel price rise. The Centre, however, could soften the blow by taxing other segments. It could raise corporate tax, tax on incomes beyond Rs 25 lakh, and excise duty on liquor, diesel cars and other luxury items, thus affecting the wealthy but saving the poor.           
	Yours faithfully,

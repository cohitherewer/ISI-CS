	The war of words between the Congress-led government and the Left over the contentious Indo-US nuclear deal has led to intense speculation about the future of the deal and its implications for India. Other countries, especially those that are members of the International Atomic Energy Associations Board of Governors as well as those in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, must be watching the drama with interest. Among these countries is Indias largest neighbour, China. It will be intriguing to see what stand China takes in the IAEA, and, subsequently, in the NSG. The question is important because Chinas position on the deal has, so far, been non-committal.         
	The United States of America, France, Russia and Great Britain, reportedly, have been working hard to secure the passage of the nuclear deal through the IAEA and the NSG. Beijing, however, has reacted cautiously to the Indo-US nuclear agreement, hoping that the co-operation of relevant countries...conforms to the regulations of the international non-proliferation regime and their own international obligations.         
	Chinas lack of enthusiasm for the deal is obvious. Yet, Chinese government spokespersons, unlike the State-controlled media, have not been openly critical thus far. Beijing has sought to justify its lack of enthusiasm on the ground that the special waiver to India, which has not signed the NPT or given up its military nuclear ambitions, could weaken the global non-proliferation architecture. Before President Hu Jintaos maiden visit to India, assistant Chinese foreign minister, Cui Tiankai, remarked that countries could carry out peaceful nuclear energy co-operation as long as they were conducive to the maintenance of the non-proliferation regime in the international community.                 
	Ripples underneath        
	The issue of non-proliferation is only the tip of the iceberg. Chinas reservations about the deal should be viewed in the overall perspective of the marked improvement in Indo-US ties. Beijing and Washington have stated that they seek a mutually constructive and cooperative engagement. Beneath the surface though lies an undercurrent of tension arising out of mutual distrust. Beijing suspects that the US is looking to forge a new alignment of forces in the Asia Pacific region. Significantly, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, is a strong supporter of a policy to contain China.        
	Sino-Indian ties are also a factor that influences Chinas position on the deal. India has been trying to reassure Beijing that the mutual containment theory, as regards India and China, is untenable. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has said that a strengthening of ties with the US will not be at the cost of a relationship with China. But whether all this will allay Chinese fears remains to be seen.         
	Beijing has opened doors for nuclear-energy cooperation with India, but without endorsing the Indo-US nuclear deal or committing to push Indias case in the NSG. Earlier, China had harped on the issue of guarding against the weakening of the non-proliferation regime and had repeatedly mentioned this in the context of the Indo-US nuclear deal. China has also demanded to see the details of Indias safeguards agreement with the UN atomic watchdog to ensure that non-proliferation norms are not violated. If China does not oppose the deal, it would risk angering its ally, Pakistan. At the same time, it will want its relations with India to improve. Therefore, it is likely that China will express its reservations about the nuclear deal but its criticisms will be muted, and that it will allow other countries to be more vocal in their censure.         
	Shortly before leaving office, earlier this year, Nicholas Burns, the American pointman for the Indo-US nuclear deal, sounded optimistic about Chinas stand. It remains to be seen whether China belies Burnss hopes or not.

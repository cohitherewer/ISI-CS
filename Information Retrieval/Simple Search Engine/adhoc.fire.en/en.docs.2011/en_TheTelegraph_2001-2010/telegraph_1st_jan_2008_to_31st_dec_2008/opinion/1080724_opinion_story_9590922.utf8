The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Best seat in the House
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE                          - The confidence vote had all the elements of epic theatre					 					      Mukul Kesavan                                                      
	When the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, announced the result of the trust vote, he did it with a finely judged perfunctoriness. The ayes have it, he said wearily, the ayes have it. He then jumped to his feet as if to head off any further prolongation of the session and said tiredly to no one in particular, Vande Mataram. I realized it was a cue, not a greeting, when the national song began playing and the members of parliament got to their feet and heard it out in silence. It was the first moment of order and decorum in that parliamentary session and you could see why the Speaker wanted it to end.         
	Just as Achla Sachdev and Durga Khote were born to be filmi mothers, Somnath Chatterjee, as any follower of Hindi movies will tell you, was born to be cast as Speaker. Hes large, gruff and you only have to look at him to know that hes fundamentally benign. In our turbulent Lower House, hes perfectly equipped to play the vital role of an exasperated, admonitory uncle and he performs the role with a belief and conviction that would have done Marlon Brando credit. No wonder he doesnt want to resign. If you had the chance of playing the role of a lifetime, for a lifetime, would you? Its remarkable and ironic that the Communist Left in India should produce pattern-cards of parliamentary propriety like Somnath Chatterjee and Indrajit Gupta, given its rhetorical contempt for the sham that is bourgeois democracy.         
	If parliamentary proceedings are a form of theatre, watching the trust vote it was clear that Indias version of Westminster democracy had long discarded the obsolete conventions of proscenium drama. In the House of Commons, while members of parliament are nominally dramatis personae, the rules of the House confine the action to the front of the House, the stage as it were. Not so in the Lok Sabha.               
	The Lok Sabha is best understood as a Brechtian arena, where the play is staged in the round, where the script (if there is one) serves as an invitation to improvise, where the actors are autonomous beings who creatively subvert the directors authority. They dream up their own props, for example, sometimes astounding the nominal director (the Speaker) with their imagination, timing and sense of occasion. Consider the sacks of bundled currency that one bunch of MPs produced. A crore of rupees! And the genius of it, the master twist was that it wasnt Monopoly money, it was the real thing. As a cynic said the day after the trust vote, If theres any evidence of my corruption, Ill resign from private life and join politics.         
	Unlike the House of Commons, there are no bit roles in the Lok Sabha. Westminster-style democracy is hierarchical, procedural and increasingly antediluvian. The voting public is no longer impressed by point scoring in parliamentary debates and watching men in suits being clever feels about as contemporary as watching a revival of The Winslow Boy. In the Lok Sabha, theres no such thing as an obscure back-bencher. Think of those MPs producing fistfuls of currency: in ten spectacular minutes, they were stars. And such was their sense of occasion, their commitment to the play (which must go on) that they gave the money away instead of succumbing to the natural human impulse to hang on to it.         
	Equally, think of the MPs who entered the Lok Sabha with their party fellows, mingled with them, and then, when the Speaker asked the House to vote, pushed the wrong button or abstained or scribbled their turncoat vote on a slip of paper. They must have had stage fright, butterflies in the stomach, but also the delicious knowledge that they possibly held the balance of power in their hands, that for a crucial passage of time the nations politics turned on the fulcrum of their disloyalty.         
	No, this was epic theatre, filled with the kind of excitement that Westminster can only dream of. Off stage, just outside parliament, Amar Singh, accused by the BJP of bribing its MPs, seized the opportunity to pad out his part. He improvised a splendid speech in which he reminded Mr Advani of the BJPs own encounters with bundled currency, challenged him to produce proof and spoke with such a fine blend of relish and indignation that, regardless of party affiliation, you wanted to cheer.         
	The prime minister, on the other hand, didnt get to make his speech at all, despite having written a long one with lots of crisp and combative lines. This is the magic of desi political theatre. Here he was, the star of this matinee show and the extras didnt allow him a speaking role! And there was Amar Singh, accused of being a bad man (on account of allegedly being a bagman) who stole the show.         
	The truest and most wounding lines of the evening came from the CPI(M)s Robespierre, the austere Prakash Karat. Asked about the bribery scandal, Karat said that while the CPI(M) MPs werent offered money because everyone knew that they couldnt be bought, all the partys allies had been approached. This sounded remarkably as if Karat was suggesting that it was common knowledge that his allies were corruptible. Now this may even be true, but it seems impolitic to actually say so in public. A comedian is allowed to say If theres any evidence of my corruption Ill resign from private life and become a public man, but not active politicians.               
	It is worth taking the first part of Karats statement seriously. Its true that of all the actors on Indias parliamentary stage, the communists are the least likely to be bought. Isnt it odd that a political party whose organizational structure is designed for an authoritarian, one-party State, is the only party in the country that functions with the discipline, the financial integrity and the political consistency that pundits think are the characteristics of parties in a stable parliamentary system?         
	You dont have to like the CPI(M) to wonder if Indian political parties worth the name are doomed to be run by humourless, cadre-based organizations. Impressionistically, it also seems to be the case that at the national level, the CPI(M)s leaders seem, for want of a better term, bhadralok, the sort of people whom you might meet in a bookshop or Handloom House. How is a party, capable of all manner of violence and coercion at the provincial level (as we saw in Nandigram), represented at the national level with leaders who epitomize bourgeois respectability. Its very puzzling.         
	Still, it was a great day for parliamentary politics. The Congress and the CPI(M) precipitated the crisis over a disagreement about public policy, a difference of opinion based on ideological conviction, and the Congress won. The BJP contributed to the excitement by smudging the vote with the taint of corruption. Somnath Chatterjee presided over the drama with avuncular tact and despite his theme song of plaintive reproach when MPs disregarded his instructions, he obviously loved having the best seat in the house. The CPI (M) shouldnt have created a fuss about his remaining the Speaker. Because who else can we cast as Uncle?       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

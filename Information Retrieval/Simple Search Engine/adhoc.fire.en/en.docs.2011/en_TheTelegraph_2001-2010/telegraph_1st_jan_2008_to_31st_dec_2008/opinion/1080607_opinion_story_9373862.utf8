	It was a welcome gesture on the part of West Bengal Dance Group Federation to organize a three-day programme at Rabindra Sadan (May 22-24) that featured young talents in the field of classical dance. Titled Stars of Tomorrow, the show presented a number of dance performances in Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Manipuri and Odissi within a limited span of time. However, the repeated offerings of vandana, pallavi, jatiswaram and abhinaya by the 20 participants made the programme repetitive and slow.         
	Rituparna Giri, with her supple grace, delivered a pleasing Bharatnatyam recital. Sreya Bose was also earnest in her Odissi presentation. It was encouraging to see four Manipuri dancers in the line-up, especially as this particular genre of dance is less popular compared to the other classical forms. Angira Chakraborty (Odissi), Sudeshna Mukherjee (Kathak), Anuradha Roy (Bharatnatyam) and Harikamal Majumder (Kathakali) exhibited their mastery over their chosen idioms. Ramyani, Harikamal, Poulami, Debojit, Deepankar, Sraboni, Arnita, Debanjana, Deepsikha, Rajasree and Amrita were the best performers of the evening.

	DISMAL DUO        
	Three extracts from Speaking of Art by Nandalal Bose (may his soul rest in peace), blighted by typographical errors, introduced Text Beyond Text, an exhibition of paintings by Susanta Chowdhury and Subrata Saha (Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery, May 13-20). The rest of the show lived up to this dismal preface.         
	Saha works primarily with acrylic and manages to produce squiggles and blotches  which he considers as art worth putting on public display. He leaves them untitled for reasons quite obvious  one can only come up with a blank when faced with the sheer vacuousness of these images. Underwater creatures seem to be wriggling on the canvas, but they could equally be anything else  from a tentacular octopus to flabby hands. There is a serious lack of thinking, and the clumsy technique does not help matters much.        
	Chowdhury puts photographs and acrylic to better use. Fish depicts a sour-faced fish peering out of one corner of the canvas, while a red-eyed dancer with a painted face looks out from the other. The ruined edifices of Old Calcutta, with cartoonish babus suspended in mid-air, make one pause awhile. But the appeal is too flimsy to be more enduring.

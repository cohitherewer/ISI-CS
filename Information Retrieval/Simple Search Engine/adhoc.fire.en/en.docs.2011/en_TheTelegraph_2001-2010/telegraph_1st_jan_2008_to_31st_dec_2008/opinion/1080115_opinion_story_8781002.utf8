                 MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh
               
	Another political farce is keeping us entertained through the early days of January  the frenetic lobbying for the Bharat Ratna award. This honour too has been reduced to an unpalatable level  where it is probably better to go without it than to have ones name bandied about in an unsavoury manner. 
    
	First of all, to name a politician for this prestigious award is a contradiction in terms, since the personal and professional attributes necessary to ensure that he is the right choice, who will set a benchmark for integrity, are not found in contemporary Indian politicians. 
    
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a good prime minister, with many positive attributes as well as many negative ones, with successes and failures, all of which are expected on the job. However, there was nothing truly extraordinary in his tenure  such as the cleansing the administration of corruption, or compelling governance to be inclusive, or even the damning of the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the Gujarat riots  to make him truly stand apart. 
    
	Then, quick on the heels of L.K. Advanis suggestion of Vajpayees name, came Mayavatis demand of the Bharat Ratna for Kanshi Ram. Perhaps the next name will be that of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
    
	Why then, does the government not deliver some posthumous Ratnas to MGR, NTR, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Tantia Topi, Laxmi Bai, Tipu Sultan and others as well? It is all becoming a bit of a joke from a bunch of amateur jokers, and we, the citizens of India, are observing this charade in wide-eyed disbelief. 
    
	This is the right time to formulate an unconventional list of criteria for State honours, one of which would disqualify politicians and administrators from being eligible. 
        
	Questionable intent
    
	It is the easy-option syndrome that has overwhelmed Indians in positions of power. Nobody feels the need to exercise the mind. There is no reaching out, no attempt to generate and pool new and creative ideas, no desire to step beyond the obvious. Actually, those who propose the names of probable recipients lack the intellectual agility needed to correctly assess the merits of candidates who do step beyond their personal domains to break barriers and change the course of history. 
    
	Politicians who have done their jobs well  something they are mandated to do  do not merit the Bharat Ratna. And if there is no suitable candidate this year, so be it. It is better to hold the Bharat Ratna in abeyance than to dishonour it. Politicians must cease to usurp all that comes their way in order to celebrate themselves and their populist leaders. Honours are not meant for those who have failed to govern this country and to alleviate its poverty and degradation. 
    
	The government must learn to look beyond its political, administrative and public- sector portals. It must begin to give, and not just keep taking. It must shed its arrogance, which has muddied the atmosphere in the public domain. It should begin to acknowledge and reward real achievement by identifying the best and brightest across all disciplines. Such actions would set a new standard for the Bharat Ratna. 
    
	These small changes could become essential elements in the conscious patterning of a contemporary fabric, with clean motifs and symbols. India could easily change its course and enter a dynamic period where dishonesty, corruption, intellectual lethargy, exclusive and insular politics would become things of the past. 
    
	A government that allows itself to be buffeted about because its partners are jockeying for bits of largesse or because its adversaries are desperate to embarrass it, is seen as weak and, therefore, not fit to govern one billion people of such diversity. Did Advani suggest the name of Vajpayee, his old rival, only to ensure a rejection?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Torn between loathing and liking
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TORN BETWEEN LOATHING AND LIKING                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                                
	Viewers will be torn between revulsion and admiration when they visit Gallery Sanskriti where the recent works of Shuvaprasanna are being exhibited (Beyond the dark, till November 29). There can be no doubt about the technical accomplishments of this 60-plus artist who, of late, has been in the news for his political activism, and earlier, for getting on the wrong side of the law  he was picked up by the police from Nandan at the last film festival  although he was not entirely to blame for it. But the way in which he uses his skills and projects them can certainly be called to question.        
	His realistic drawings of human figures are of a superior quality. But he is equally capable of producing the most banal paintings and sculptures, if they deserve that description, that make viewers cringe. His fat, waxy flowers, resembling pudenda, grow out of vases on structures suggestive of the female pelvic region and on a creeper. A large butterfly is attracted to it, and at the end of the sinuous creeper are the fruits in the voluptuous form of mammary glands. It could have emerged from the heated dreams of any post-pubertal male. This is not erotic, it is just masturbatory.        
	His painting of similar flowers in livid pink and of grey butterflies is also surprisingly amateurish, and viewers will be even more puzzled when they realize that the same Shuvaprasanna is capable of creating figurative art of a high order. His portrait of the aged lawyer in his black gown, his eyes looking dim behind their thick lenses, his mouth open as if to make an utterance, is an honest and true-to-life depiction of a man whose character is inseparable from his career (picture). At the back looms the tower of Calcutta high court, inscrutable behind a mist.        
	Equally powerful is his painting of the man with grey hair and a wide, vacant mouth. He is swathed in a grey wrapper and his exposed fingers are locked together. The corpse wrapped in a white sheet surrounded by a group of mourners is rescued from sentimentality by the dignity with which the men, child and woman hold themselves. They are like figures in a tragic tale, and this impression is heightened by the facility with which Shuvaprasanna uses a charcoal stick. He did the same in his evocation of the chequerboard terraces of Calcutta in the 1990s. There is an example of such a painting complete with crows in this exhibition too. This is not to say that they are great pieces of experimental or cutting-edge art. They are good within the limits of academic practice. He is an artist who plays safe and is wary of pushing the limits of his art.        
	But one cannot say the same of all the other drawings. His cats, both black and white, have a distinctly posterish quality. They resemble the cat in the promotional material for the 19th- century cabaret called Le Chat Noir that was popular in Montmarte. His golden yellow Sri Chaitanya, blue Krishna and Christ are fashionably lean, but however saleable such commodities may be buyers should know that such images have been done to death.        
	On the other hand, his sweeping view of gauntly-shaped high-rise buildings growing out of a sprawling shanty town is a remarkably real depiction of the urban nightmare that Calcutta and similar big cities are turning into. His bronze goat and owl also contain this vitality, although it is true that their physical features have been exaggerated to a great extent to create the desired effect of heavy pregnancy and prehensility, as the case may be. Shuvaprasanna seems to be slowly edging towards a state where he mindlessly churns out works without a thought for quality. Which is why this exhibition is such a disastrous medley of works lumped together. Both Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde reside within Shuvaprasanna.

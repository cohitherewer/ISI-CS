	Chintz: Indian Textiles for the West (V amp;A and Mapin, Rs 2,000) by Rosemary Crill brings,     for the first time in colour, the Victoria and Albert Museums collection of Indian chintz made for the Western market. Although the Portuguese, who were the first to discover this patterned textile in India, called it pintado (meaning spotted), the name chintz  probably derived from the Hindi word, chint, meaning to sprinkle or spray  became more popular.        
	Like so many other things, the floral printed fabrics, which instantly remind one of drawing rooms in British period films, originated in India. A coverlet from the Golconda Court (1625-50), decorated with scenes from royal life, shows that mordanting and resist-dyeing techniques had existed in India for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans. And yet, as Crill points out, Europeans have tried to claim some of the printing and dyeing techniques as their own. Take for instance the debate over a particular kind of chintz with small areas of indigo dye that appeared to have been applied directly on to the surface of the cloth rather than being resist-dyed. It was claimed that the technology to do this came into being with the invention of the orpiment vat in Europe in the 18th century. But there is clear evidence that indigo painting on the surface with a brush existed in India long before that.        
	Crill explains in great detail the traditional chintz-making process, with its bleaching, mordanting, resist-dyeing and kalamkari, with a series of photographs illustrating the various stages in the production (picture, left). From buffalo milk to alum to beeswax, the tools in the chintz-makers kit were varied and unusual. Perhaps these contributed to the fact that once finished, the fabrics not only boasted an extraordinary fastness of colour but the colours also seemed to get brighter with washing.        
	When Indian chintz first reached European shores, East India Company directors sent their recommendations to adapt the textiles better to the British market. These included more white ground, and the flowers and branch...in colours in the middle. Among the exhibits from V amp;A, photographed here by Ian Thomas, the original Indian style, and the later European patterns can be discerned. First used as bed-curtains and wall-hangings, chintz retains its utility as furnishing material. But its popularity in the West as fashionable wear  which reached its peak in the late 17th century  is a thing of the past. It is in the fitness of things, perhaps, that kalamkari has made a comeback in Indian fashion.        
	Bottom left and middle are detail from a dress (1700-25), and a petticoat (1750) respectively. Bottom right is a fragment of dress or furnishing fabric (1720-30), and on top is a typical chintz wall-hanging (early 18th century). In this well-produced and well-researched book, the one thing that shocks is the repeated misspelling of myrobalan (the plum, and a dyeing agent in chintz-making) as myrabolan.

	The administrators of the International Cricket Council have been spending some very restive waking hours over the last few months. Sunil Manohar Gavaskars exemplary courage has exposed their failings in no uncertain manner.        
	Gavaskar in his columns and over the microphone has criticized the palpably wrong decisions of ICC-appointed umpires. He has been critical of the ICC-appointed match referees (Mike Proctor) handling of the sledging controversy involving Harbhajan Singh, Andrew Symonds and Matthew Hayden. He has accused the Aussies of terrible behaviour and foul language on the ground. More than any of the above, what really rankled the ICC administrators was the proposed appointment of I.S. Bindra as the CEO of ICC. Many from the Australian and the English media opposed the idea. Their contention was that since Sharad Pawar would become the next ICC president, the appointment of another Indian to a top position would make India too powerful in world cricket administration.        
	Gavaskar promptly took up the cudgels and declared that in the recent past, two Aussies  Malcolm Gray and Malcolm Speed  had held the two most prominent positions in the ICC at the same time and nobody had thought it improper. Very rightly, Gavaskar protested, saying that this reeked of the racial bias of the white press, which was, in effect, questioning the integrity of Indians.         
	It goes without saying that SMG has yet again hit one of his impeccable straight drives, making the ICC mandarins realize that they themselves have not been above reproach on questions of racial prejudice.                
	In black and white        
	Over the years, SMG has never hesitated to tell the white nations that he would be the last to accept their holier-than-thou attitude. The readers would surely remember that once he even gave up the highly-prized MCC honorary life membership just because he was insulted at the Lords cricket ground by a parking attendant.        
	SMG carries his patriotism in his heart. He is not one to take an insult to his nation lying down. Any gesture or comment from any quarter, no matter how high, against his race or colour would make him see red. He would not rest till he has the opponent on the mat.        
	The only thing to say in defence of the ICC is that no organization would like its own member to publicly criticize its policy. SMG was still the ICCs cricket committee chairman at the time. Hence there can be a case for the ICC asking Gavaskar to resign.        
	I personally feel that SMG would resign with total satisfaction. His innings as the head of ICC cricket committee was not fruitful enough. Some ridiculous decisions were formulated and executed which did no credit to either SMG or to the cricket committee headed by him. The hilarious concept of the super-sub has thankfully been shelved after some very awkward moments. The other idea of power-play has still not convinced many. And the strange idea of allowing bowlers to bend their elbow upto14 degrees (whatever that means) has made a mockery of the law on throw bowling.         
	Gavaskars interests lie in resigning from the ICC. He stands to benefit in every possible way. For one, the resignation would make him a martyr in the eyes of the cricket world. He would now be free from the restrictive ways of the ICC. He would also be able to use his pen and his authoritative voice without any fear or favour. He can reside in his own orbit away from the humdrum administrative responsibilities.        
	In recent years, his articles have been too straightforward, tending to repeat his pet grouses. Now he can write more freely, and we can receive some genuine cricket wisdom from him. This is one cricket partnership he should not mind breaking by retiring.                            [THE PIECE WAS WRITTEN BEFORE GAVASKAR RESIGNED HIS ICC POST]

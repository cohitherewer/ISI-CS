	Perfect pitch                  
	Sir  India thrashed South Africa by eight wickets in the final Test match to square the series in Kanpur (Senior gifts Test to junior, April 14). The victory means that Indias unbeaten Test record at the venue since 1984 remains intact. Much of the credit for the fantastic win must go to the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who led his side from the front. The dust bowl at Green Park may have suited the Indians better than the Proteas, but the Indian spinners used the conditions better than their South African counterparts. The batting performance of the visitors was even more disappointing: they were bundled out for a paltry score in their second innings, gifting the match to India.           
	Instead of blaming the pitch, Graeme Smith and his boys should have learnt how to come to terms with the difficult track from Sourav Ganguly. Ganguly batted gallantly for his 80-odd runs, and he must be disappointed with missing out on another century. Amidst all the talk about Dhonis captaincy and Gangulys batsmanship, one must not forget the contributions of S. Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma. The two tailenders put up some useful runs for the last wicket during Indias first innings to seal South Africas fate.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  M.S. Dhoni must thank the seniors for the win in Kanpur. Had it not been for the contributions of Sourav Ganguly, Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag, the South Africans, who were leading the series, would have gone home undefeated. Gangulys match-winning knock might have earned him praise from Dhoni, but he should not take Dhonis support for granted. If he were to fail in a couple of knocks, the younger man would not hesitate to drop him from the Test side as well. Hopefully, Gangulys strong showing in Kanpur would help him stage yet another comeback to the one-day international team.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The real hero of the Kanpur Test is not Sourav Ganguly or M.S. Dhoni, but the Green Park pitch. The under-prepared wicket, unfortunately, has taken the sheen off Indias triumph. It is a pity that Indians continues to prepare square turners as they are incapable of winning on fast, bouncy pitches. Many Indian cricket fans seem to believe that their team is now well on course to becoming the best team in the world. This certainly isnt true. India cannot hope to become the best in the business unless it puts a stop to winning matches on doctored pitches at home.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sourav Ganguly is certainly the second-best batsman after Sachin Tendulkar in the Indian team today. One only has to look at the way Ganguly batted on a difficult Kanpur wicket to realize the wisdom behind these words. Such was Gangulys class that even the opposition captain, Graeme Smith, could not help but admire his knock. Despite his sterling performance, one still hears murmurs of Ganguly being dropped from the team every time the selectors meet to pick a squad. The truth is that Ganguly deserves a place both in Tests and ODIs. He is a proven match winner, and, like Australias Steve Waugh, comes good whenever his team is in a spot of bother.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Test series between South Africa and India has indeed ended on a happy note for both the teams. Even the fans wouldnt mind the drawn series. Remarkably, there were very few untoward incidents on the field and the players from both sides played the game in the right spirit. This was certainly a welcome change, after the ugly episodes during Indias tour of Australia.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Why did M.S. Dhoni have to reward the curator of the Kanpur pitch with cash? Gestures like these give the game a bad name, and fuel speculations that cricket has not yet freed itself from the web of corruption.          
	Yours faithfully,

	King in pain          
	At the Guwahati zoo, I heard a lot of people complaining about not being able to see the lion in its enclosure. When I asked a zookeeper what the matter was, he pointed at a corner which was covered with a blue cloth. What I saw next broke my heart. The lion was being kept in a cage so small that it was impossible for the animal to stand or even lie down properly. How can the authorities allow an animal to suffer like this? I hope animal lovers would take up this matter at the earliest.           
	Yours faithfully,

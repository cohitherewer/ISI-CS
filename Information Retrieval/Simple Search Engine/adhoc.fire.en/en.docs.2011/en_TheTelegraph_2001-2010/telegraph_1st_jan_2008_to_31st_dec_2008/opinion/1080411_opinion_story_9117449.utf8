	Loss of face                  
	Sir  Indian cricket is at a crossroads. Commercially it may be at an all-time high, but when it comes to the actual affair with the bat and ball, it is proving to be shaky and incapable of withstanding the rigours of the professional game. One day they play like heroes and next day they collapse in a heap. The second Test against South Africa in Ahmedabad, coming after the run-scoring extravaganza in Chennai, illustrates this point. Batsman after batsman committed hara-kiri chasing wide balls, senior players refused to run singles and rotate the strike, all the batsmen seemed unable to find gaps and gave fielding practice to the opponents. The Indian bowlers in this Test would not even have made a club side proud. Indians seemed to have forgotten the basics of the game  that a bowler must come back to his bowling end to receive throws and attempt run outs. The fielders were not diving and chasing, but waiting for the ball to come to them. Were they scared that their flannels, splashed with precious endorsements, would get sullied? If senior players may be taken after reviewing past records, I feel it would be a better bet to include the likes of Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar in the place of the non-performers of the current side. And yes, a gag order must be issued on the performance of Bhangra and Kathakali and other dance forms, since the players need to behave like professionals and save energy for fielding.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The outcome of the Ahmedabad Test was perhaps decided in the first session of day one, when a jittery Indian batting line-up was bundled out for a paltry 76 by the incisive South African pace attack (India lose inside three days, April 6). It was the hosts seventh lowest total ever and second lowest at home. It would still have been some consolation if the South Africans could be restricted at a modest total. But to make India look even smaller, the Proteas posted a huge total of 494 for 7 and comprehensively beat India by an innings and 90 runs in less than three days. There can be no denying that Anil Kumbles boys looked a bit complacent going into the second Test. This was reflected in the way the batsmen threw caution to the wind even before they had read the pitch. After such an ignominious defeat, India had better play up to their potential in the last Test in Kanpur.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It looks like India has not seen the last of racist attacks on the cricket pitch. In the Ahmedabad Test, Sourav Ganguly clearly was not out when, batting at 87, he was given caught behind in the second innings. Top order Indian batsmen have repeatedly been victims of such blatantly incorrect decisions. Even after the snickometer clearly showed that the noise was made by the contact of the bat with the ground and not with the ball, former South African skipper Kepler Wessels maintained that Ganguly had snicked the ball. He went on to criticize Ganguly for expressing disappointment. What would you call that? Is this not an instance of racism? First Wessels refused to believe clear technological evidence, thereby misleading viewers, and then cast aspersions on Gangulys character. Indians will not forget this in a hurry.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Poor returns          
	Sir  The story of Dilip Ghosh illustrates how the Real India runs (PM gifts a lakh, village stops food, March 24). The moment the prime minister offered assistance to the visually challenged man from the remote Bengal village who toiled hard so that his daughter could go to school, the villagers and the local administration turned against him. Ghoshs panchayat not only refused to consider his handicap, but also denied his rightful share of foodgrain and pension. It is easy to imagine what happens to funds under schemes like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme when it falls into the hands of the local panchayats. Most of these schemes languish or fail miserably because of village-level politics. Agencies entrusted with implementing and monitoring at the state level are powerless against local netas. The state administration should seek monthly progress reports from the local bodies on behalf of the Central government so that people like Dilip Ghosh can live a life of peace and dignity.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has spun a mile-long yarn out of farmer misery for catching votes, but the Opposition is letting him get away without revealing where the money is going to come from. Are the lending public sector banks going to bear the burden, or will the government make a mid-term budgetary provision? He has not been forced to admit that the figure of Rs 60,000 crore is just notional, as it includes the aggregate of principal amounts together with interest on interest. Calculations will show that at a typical compound interest rate of 14 per cent and default duration of 10 years, the aggregate principal amount is around Rs 16,000 crore.           
	Public sector banks, under government orders, have waived loans worth hundreds of crores of rupees to big businesses in the past. The government itself has dealt out a few thousand crores to tax evaders through amnesty schemes. But poor farmers do not donate to party funds, so no benevolence for them.                    
	Yours faithfully,

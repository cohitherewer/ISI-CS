                              Comfort seat      
	 You could attribute it to the sense of humour of somebody very high up, that in the latest cabinet reshuffle, a Maharaja has been put under A Raja. Yes, Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Maharaja of Gwalior, is the new telecom and information technology minister of state under DMKs A Raja, and, irony of ironies, only the non-royal gets to be called raja (It is my name, argues the senior minister). True as that may be, neither Scindia nor Raja is worried about any royal confusion in the discharge of ministerial duties. If morning is any indication of the rest of the day, then each is sure to fiercely guard his turf and keep a tab on things. In the tourism department, on the other hand, Ambika Soni is having a tough time with her minister of state, RJDs Kanti Singh. Kanti, it seems, was given to understand (surely not by her mentor Laloo-ji?) that her job was to tour the world (tourism ministry, you see!) and spread the glory of India. Soni, of course, has quickly disabused her of the notion, and Kanti has been left blaming it all on her party being smaller than Sonis. Lesson of the story: Big Brother should always have the crumbs  or at least pretend!  and let the smaller allies have the cake.                  
	 Guess whos the new comeback kid on the block? It is Uma Bharti, and you must give it to her that she held out for pretty long. But as they say, you can take her out of the BJP but you cant take the BJP out of her. There are still some, like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Venkaiah Naidu, who are putting in their best to stall her return, but trust the fiery lady to be back under the sign of the blooming lotus soon. Dont worry if you are far away, her voice travels a mean distance. As Jeeves would have said, well done, old gal!                            
	 It isnt the waiver but the wave that has been sending Congress leaders in a tizzy these days. Ever since their crown prince, Rahul Gandhi, was spotted waving to a lady before he got up to speak on the budget in the Lok Sabha, the party members have been going round in circles trying to find out who she is. Rumours are abuzz that she is associated with a lifestyle magazine and has now been taken into his inner circle of friends. It is a curious turn of events when gossip columnists become the subjects of their own columns.                             
	 The exercise that keeps journalists busy after every cabinet reshuffle is counting the number of disgruntled individuals and groups. This time, the journos have a problem of plenty. Every second person in the Congress fold seems to be unhappy with the way the new ministries have been disbursed. The Gujjars of Rajasthan are unhappy that Sachin Pilot did not get a berth, while a moneybag like Santosh Bagrodia did  and he can hardly be said to represent the state, with his business interests in Calcutta. Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are unhappy because, with MS Gill grabbing the sports ministry, Punjabi Congressmen (both resident and non-resident) hold six cabinet positions with only two Lok Sabha seats. The north Indian Brahmin lobby is not appeased in the least with the cabinet appointment of Jitin Prasada. The Brahmin lobby reasons that Prasada comes from a mixed lineage of Brahmins and Thakurs. Had it not been for the induction of Bihars Raghunath Jha, the Hindi-belt Brahmin leaders would have had to be content being represented by Bangali-babu Pranab Mukherjee, and Tamilian Mani Shankar Aiyar. There is a chance that the mercies may turn out to be too small for the ruling partys comfort.                            
	 To each his slight. While most party leaders are happy nursing their grudges in the company of their trusted ones, some choose to go the extra mile. Take Congress MP Akhilesh Das, for example. To him should go the prize for innovation in protest, even in this season of protests. The heavily loaded Rajya Sabha MP from Lucknow, who was dropped from the cabinet in the recent reshuffle, has floated a forum called Akhilesh Das Vichar Manch and launched an extensive publicity campaign to promote it. Pictures of the Gandhi mother-and-son are significantly absent from his campaign. Rumours have it that Das has been speaking to the BSP and the BJP as well. For fairer vichar, we assume.                            
	 Whatever vile people may say about the babalog, the young uns cant be accused of disrespecting elders  say journos who watched Jitin Prasada call in the SAIL chairman promptly, rather than making him wait while he finished with the scribes.      
	Footnote
            
	 While Mani Shankar Aiyar has lost his workstation along with the sports ministry  he used to discharge his duties as panchayati raj minister and minister in charge of the Northeast from the sports ministers room in Shastri Bhavan  Jairam Ramesh has shifted his. Rameshs new room in the power ministry witnesses less powerplay than his earlier chambers in the commerce ministry, where he had an ongoing tussle with the industries minister, Ashwini Kumar. But it doesnt give the minister a sense of transparency that he so craves. And so the wooden door has been made to give way for a glass affair, through which Ramesh can look far and wide. So far that he has allegedly started advocating a change in guard in Maharashtra. Rumour has it that Maharashtra CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh, will be replaced by Sushil Kumar Shinde. And Shinde is Rameshs current boss. Now thats called an idea.

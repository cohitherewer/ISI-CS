	Broken land                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has spelt out a terrible truth about the long-cherished notion of national integrity of India (A country, not a nation, Sept 12). It seems that the states have attained greater importance than the nation as Indians have started prioritizing their regional identities over their national citizenship. Those staying outside Bihar are indifferent to the Kosis devastation there. Similarly, the speculations on Ratan Tatas exit from West Bengal will not be looked upon as a grave loss unless one hails from Bengal. In fact, there seems to be a subtle rivalry among the political leaders from different states to enter into an agreement with the Tatas if they were to leave Bengal.           
	The fact is that people are not concerned about something unless it affects their lives and interests. States were created for administrative convenience, and partly to distinguish one linguistic group from another. But parochial sentiments are now threatening Indias unity and diversity. Regionalism is perhaps a natural outcome of a federal arrangement, but in our country it has made us insensitive towards the plight of the others. I know for certain that beneath the veneer of shallow sympathy for the flood-victims of Bihar, many Bengalis have nothing but contempt for Biharis.We must not forget that the divide and rule strategy adopted by the British did irreparable damage to our country. Even if we fail to identify with the people from different cultures and are unable to forge an idealistic fraternity, we should at least refrain from indulging in hostilities with our brethren, something that politicians like Raj Thackeray are provoking people to do with their jihad against outsiders.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While reading Ashok Mitras article, I could not help notice the irony that however divided we are in reality, we always try to conceal these fissures by loftily swearing that we are all Indians. One of the popular reality shows that is being telecast for a few years now purportedly seeks to discover an India idol. But in reality, all it does is select singers from different states and then chooses the winner with the help of different methods, including SMS polls that strongly reflect our parochial sentiments. As a result, competent contestants are thrown out when a large number of votes are cast for a contestant from some other region. Another case in point was the BCCI organized IPL matches during which provincial pride and emotions were celebrated with great pomp and show. In the process, Indias unity was further eroded while the celebrity owners minted money. The sad fact is that our once-glorious republic is now mired in regional divisions.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias cultural and linguistic diversity has created a pervasive mood of secession, and there seems to be no solution at hand to resolve this problem. Ashok Mitra fails to offer any cure, preferring instead to cite examples of widespread divisiveness in India. Kashmir and the northeastern states are all demanding a separate existence, thereby subverting the myth of a united and diverse India. The faulty policies adhered to by successive governments are to be blamed for this. Nation-building agendas have often been based on exclusionist strategies and people of particular regions, and particular languages, have been given undue preference.           
	The decisions to shift the capital to Delhi, a north Indian state, and make Hindi, a north Indian language, the national language were controversial. Imposing one language on an entire nation infuriated those pushed to the periphery and incited the latter to break away from the mother-country. The only way to combat secessionist tendencies is to render proper recognition to each and every culture and absorbing them into the cauldron of the nation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sreetama Biswas, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is a well-known fact that secessionism has infiltrated into the core of Indias republican ethos today. But Ashok Mitra does little else other than cite instances of separatism. He does not even say what can be done to stem the tide. Since we are already aware of the plague of secession that threatens our nation, it was disappointing to note that Mitras article failed to say anything else other than the obvious.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.C. Kapoor, Noida

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra blames everyone, including our gallant army and paramilitary forces, for breaking the country to bits. But, surprisingly, he shies away from proferring a method to contain this madness. It would be worth remembering that during his long career in public life, Mitras contributions to resolve the crises of secessionism were nothing worth mentioning. Worse, Mitras plaintive tone made this particular piece boring. Mitra should remember that it is always easier to assume an accusatory tone than to offer solutions to grave problems.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Dirty tricks
         
	Sir  The report, Kick and make up (Jan 9), justly summed up the unsportsman-like attitude of the Australian cricket team. The goings-on during the Sydney Test, especially the allegations of racism against Harbhajan Singh, suggest a conspiracy on the part of the Aussies to maintain their winning streak. The ugliest part of it all was the attempt made by Australian players to make the umpires side with them. Ricky Ponting and his team have thus sullied the name of cricket before the entire sporting fraternity. The proposal to ban Harbhajan cannot be condoned. This is because even the umpires were uncertain as to whether Harbhajan had racially abused Andrew Symonds. Despite the International Cricket Council pledging to hear Indias appeal against the proposed ban, it should not be forgotten that the match referee, Mike Procter, had ordered it without taking into consideration Harbhajans fervent denial. If Ponting is a man of integrity, so is Harbhajan. Little do the Aussies realize that the precedent they have set will be replicated in other countries much to the discomfort of the touring Australians.

	Sir  This has not been the first time that India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka have had to put up with umpires clearly favouring their Australian opponents. It is not enough for the ICC to drop Steve Bucknor for the rest of Indias tour Down Under. Bucknor and Mark Benson should be labelled as cheats and banned from officiating in cricket matches for good. The ICC Hall of Fame for umpires should also be purged of Bucknors name. A senior and respected umpire like Bucknor cannot be excused for consistently making erroneous judgments, and that too against only one team. Either his eyesight and hearing are bad, or else he is making a fortune via Cricket Australia. The ICC should also declare the result of the Sydney Test null and void. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is amazing that a spat between two players can provoke such an emotional and illogical reaction from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The media as well as Indian fans are equally to blame, for making a mountain of a molehill. Harbhajan Singh, too, should be held responsible for the mess. He beckoned Andrew Symonds and gave him a mouthful, as was evident from the television footage. Moreover, bantering on the field is a common feature of cricket in Australia, and the Indians should have been briefed to keep their cool. The only point of contention in the entire controversy is the biased umpiring by both Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson during the match. There were several poor decisions, and most of them went against the visitors. Poor umpiring cost India the match and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Bucknor should be made to retire immediately. But, at the same time, calling off the tour will be an absurd step to take. Now that the two umpires have been replaced for the remaining Tests, India should concentrate on beating the Aussies. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was under the impression that the Australian cricketers are arrogant champions. Now I know that they can cheat as well, that too in full view of the public. In Sydney, Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson made some errors that cost India dear. Even the third umpire turned down a clear stumping decision, adding to the Indians misery. Lodging complaints and getting umpires removed are not enough; the Indian team should fly back home. The Man of The Match award should go to Steve Bucknor, who helped Australia win in Sydney. 
          
	Yours faithfully,
   
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The higher a man climbs, the fewer the mistakes one expects of him. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case with Steve Bucknor. One of the most respected umpires internationally, Bucknor has disgraced himself by repeatedly erring in judgment. To add insult to Indias injury, there is now talk of a humiliating three-Test ban against Harbhajan Singh for an alleged racist remark. The Indian cricket team should pack its bags and leave for home. The Indian board should also flex its muscles and push Australia into a corner within the ICC. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
C.K. Sharma, Gurgaon

        
	Sir  The proposed ban against Harbhajan Singh can be accepted if only a similar step is taken against some of the Aussies who are known to employ every dirty trick in the book to intimidate their opponents. The ICC needs to explain why Australians manage to get away with such tactics every time, while only players from the subcontinent are victimized. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampur

	Grey market                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras paranoia about social decay is thoroughly confusing (Bunker Hill, July 21). Unfortunately, the moral utopia whose loss he laments has never been a part of history or reality. He moralizes the notion of ideology and resents that ideology has been thrown into the dust heap of history. But, while projecting his romanticized vision, he fails to realize that ideology has always been a politicized entity. His longing for the morality of the past is therefore an elusive trope.           
	The present situation, characterized by dubious transactions between political and industrial parties, may seem immoral to Mitra. But what the author claims as shenanigans must appear judicious for those who use them. Competition is the life of business, and corporate goings-on often take recourse to such tactics. Moreover, there are laws in place to ensure fairness and order. So Mitra has no business vituperating against power, business and politics as they form the very basis of our social existence. All the big companies are doing well within the framework of healthy competition. The government firms are losing out not because of unscrupulous means adopted by the corporate world but because of their own lackadaisical approach. Mitras staunch support for a competition-free business environment can breed unprofessionalism in the ranks.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The claim by Ashok Mitra that in the corporate goings-on, the shadiest means are deployed to choke competition in the market and eliminate ones adversaries is quite true. This is evident from the way corporate giants are trying to monopolize the Indian retail market by weeding out smaller competitors. With increasing standards of living, the rate of consumption among Indian citizens, especially the middle class, has gone up. This has made retail a profitable business. Multinational companies can thus easily oust a kirana store from competition with the help of money power. The buyers too prefer the comforts of swanky retail stores that offer them a greater choice of products than ordinary stores. But little do they realize that their indulgence in this unbridled freedom of choice may result in impulsive purchases.           
	Retail giants have reportedly assured that farmers would get better returns from them. But again, there is no guarantee that farmers will be able to sell their products to them as the quality of their products may not meet the stringent standards imposed by elite retailers. In the absence of an alternative market, farmers will end up being exploited by big retailers. Even in the West where retailing has been refined to a state of art, there is now a longing for the small retail store of yore. Sadly, racks and trolleys of steel seem to have taken the place of shops that once prided on personal warmth than cold market research.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Cruel joke          
	Sir  Every academic session all over India begins with horrific incidents of ragging (Adult offence, July 21). At a premier university in the city, a fresher was reportedly forced by a group of seniors to smoke marijuana. The idea presumably was to continue with the valorized tradition of welcoming juniors, unmindful of the consequences of such acts on young students. Every year, there are similar incidents that take place in our educational institutions, sometimes with tragic consequences. This shows that the preventive measures taken by the authorities to control ragging have been ineffective, to say the least.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.K. Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is obvious that the Centre and the states have failed to implement the apex courts directives to prevent ragging in institutes of higher learning. Only a few days back, a girl student of Jadavpur University fell prey to some rowdy elements who forced her to consume marijuana. Anti-ragging committees constituted in most of the colleges have proved to be remarkably inefficient. What is more shocking is the insensitive behaviour of the seniors in such premier institutions. It is a shame that admonitory notices have to be put up on rather obtrusively placed bill boards in the lush green campus of Jadavpur University to remind the students of their social responsibilities. The university authorities may have ordered a probe, but no one can guarantee that similar episodes will not take place in the future. However, it must be remembered that a campus should be a safe haven for all students and the authorities must encourage free and healthy interaction instead of secluding freshers in the name of protection.           
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan            
	Parting shot    
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a veteran Congressman like Somen Mitra had to quit the party (Somen splits Cong for Mamata, July 20). His departure can be explained as his reaction to the discrimination that he faced within the Congress. Mitras dedication to his work, to my mind, was selfless. Politicians like him have the potential to save the state from the harsh Left Front regime.           
	Moreover, the ruling party in West Bengal would never have dared commit the unprecedented massacre in Nandigram without the tacit approval of the Central Congress leadership. Somen Mitra was perhaps the only state Congress leader who spoke out against the carnage at Nandigram with some feeling. Ironically, Mitra was eclipsed by Central ministers and their cronies who crowed to gain politically. Mitras recent tie-up with Mamata Banerjee is a healthy sign of his overcoming the challenge thrown at him by petty leaders of the Congress.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

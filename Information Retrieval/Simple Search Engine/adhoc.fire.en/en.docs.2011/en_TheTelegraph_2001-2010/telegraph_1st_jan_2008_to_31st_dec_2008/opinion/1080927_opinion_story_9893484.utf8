	Way back in 1967, Sony introduced Portapak, the first portable video-recording device, and this greatly facilitated the development of video art as these video recorders, their weight notwithstanding, could be carried by a single person and were relatively cheap. Thus, almost overnight, one did not need a fortune to experiment with moving images, which could be instantly replayed and the film did not need processing.         
	One of the first artists to use this portable video-recording device was Nam June Paik from South Korea, who is widely regarded as the father of this medium. At the University of Tokyo, his doctoral thesis was on the composer, Arnold Schoenberg. At Munich University, where he was studying history of music, his meeting with the composers, Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage, and the conceptual artists, Joseph Beuys and Wolf Vostell, catalysed his experiments in the field of electronic art.        
	The exhibition, 40YEARSVIDEOART.DE, Video Art in Germany 1963-2003 (September 1-10), celebrated, as its title makes clear, four decades of this ephemeral medium, for like flesh and unlike the DVD or the hard disc video tape is vulnerable to the vagaries of age and wear and tear. The declared intention of this German project was to rescue, preserve and disseminate the cultural heritage of video art. Thus the exhibition, organized jointly by Goethe-Institut and Khoj Kolkata, had shown 12 DVDs containing 59 works by well-known video artists, from Joseph Beuys to Rebecca Horn and Rosemarie Trockel, and included Video-Theorie 1-4, Remix, Interview, by Dellbrugge amp; De Moll, highlighting the role of theory and discourse.         
	While the project was no doubt well intentioned, watching 12 DVDs at a stretch can be a drag, particularly when their total running time is 25 hours! One whole day and more! Max Mueller Bhavans earlier exhibition of video art at CIMA Gallery was a lot more viewer-friendly. However, this time, watching the continuous welter of images on multiple screens installed on all three floors of Max Mueller Bhavan, apart from being an overwhelming experience, underscored the lack of a straightforward narrative and dialogue in video art. Samplings were all that one could afford to take in.        
	Snows, ectoplasmic blurs, found images  clips from pre-existing footage, matter-of-fact interviews, performances, documentation  video art embraces all this and more, but it has an ineffable quality, which distinguishes it from cinema. For one thing is clear, the viewer has to be nimble-minded enough to grasp the occasional visual traps, twists and turns through which the barrage of images is constantly being manipulated by the artist. It could be something as simple as Joseph Beuys sitting in front of a television set with a piece of felt stuck on the screen. Another sheet of felt, a pair of boxing gloves, and a blood sausage are also part of the prop. It is intended to subvert the purpose of the television as he boxes with the screen.        
	The band Malaria! (picture), featured in Geld, zeroes in on life in Berlin during the days of the German Democratic Republic. This music video, with its constantly mutating imagery, its aesthetic of menacing light and shadows, and its accompanying score of the voice that is a muffled growl beats classification. Phoenix Tapes, by Christoph Giradet and Matthias Mueller, exploits Hitchcocks obsessive use of certain repeated movements to create a Niagara of moving images in a way that the master would have approved. The viewer is left hanging from a cliff every other moment.        
	Nam June Paiks Good Morning, Mr Orwell explored his vision of television as a universal, democratic medium as it broadcast live on January 1, 1984, a New Years eve gala. Optimism and present-day anxieties are set against each other here. It was in this video that he came out with his famous line: There is no rewind button on the Betamax of life.        
	The frenzied, compulsive head-shaking in Sweet Heart by the performer, Akemi Takeya, is seen side by side with the documentary film Tehran 1380, where the Iranian style of architecture is examined, and Rosemarie Trockels Buffalo Billy + Milly, with its dreamlike parade of creatures as in a masquerade. At the end of it all, the nature of video art remains as elusive as ever. It makes no distinction between high and low technology, using both in a manner that questions our accepted notions of hierarchy.

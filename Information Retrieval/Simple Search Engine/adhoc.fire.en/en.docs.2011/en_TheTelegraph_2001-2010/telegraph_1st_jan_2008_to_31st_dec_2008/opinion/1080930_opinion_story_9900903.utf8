The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Right to Murder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             RIGHT TO MURDER                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Another explosion in Delhi. Another set of speculative responses. Another day of repetitive media coverage with the same faces mouthing the same predictable sentences. Another nail in the coffin of the home minister, who, along with his ministry, pontificates endlessly about what should be done but is unable to take any strong, definitive positions and action, or even make sure that he calms the public of India by giving them a sense of confidence in his leadership. No one believes that Shivraj Patil is in complete command, aware of the reasons behind the rapidly unfolding and continuing assault upon our cities and towns by faceless, anonymous terrorists who are creating havoc in the lives of ordinary, innocent, god-fearing men, women and children who have done nothing to deserve the gruesome, mindless attacks. Playing failed policies against one another, using the fragile emotion of faith to generate hatred in the name of god and much more  all in an effort to compete for that extra set of votes at the hustings  Patil has made India a playground for violence and revenge.        
	The initiators of such vote bank politics and the perpetrators of the same  who turn a blind eye to everything, hoping that the many carnages will be forgotten as they rapaciously use their positions of power to exploit the system for their own personal ends  need to be dealt with severely and be put to pasture. The people who are desperately looking for excuses to shield themselves from the many fiascos, miscarriages, non-performance and the bankruptcy of alternatives must be replaced. An example  the finance minister, P. Chidambaram  a man with a sharp intellect and an acute legal mind, a minister with a track record of having delivered the goods in general, who can combat with the ramifications of the degradation of civil society, life and living that has become endemic to this country, should be made minister for home affairs and internal security. C. Rangarajan could be made the finance minister. India must be put beyond petty politicking for the government to deal with the horrors engulfing us.                
	New mandate        
	While we are on the issue of people who need to be removed from their exalted jobs and returned to the district for all their misdeeds and corrupted governance that have reduced India to this terrible reality  the chief minister of Maharashtra needs to be given marching orders if the Congress wants to retain some credibility as a party that is capable of good governance. Instead of finding a remedy to stall the degradation of the fraying social fabric, the chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, has condoned the many alarming and offensive attacks on human freedom and civil society, indulged in by hooligans on the streets who have taken the law into their hands, who seem to have the assurance that they will come to no harm. Is this what the Congress stands for? Is divisive politics what the Congress manifesto preaches? Has the Congress decided to support the balkanization of India?        
	Finally, there is on record a criminal statement by Oscar Fernandes  who happens to be a cabinet minister and a general secretary of the Congress but a man without a constituency  condoning the brutal public murder of the CEO of an international company by striking workers. He says that this murder should be a warning for all CEOs and companies to make them give in to workers or get killed! Does the Congress intend to govern India by applauding illegal murders and killings then? By not sacking Fernandes, the United Progressive Alliance government is condoning the view of right to murder. Our faith is getting corroded by the day and only if immediate correctives are put in place, voters will be reassured.

	Killer instinct                  
	Sir  The editorial, Just to kill (Sept 15), is full of the usual sense of dj vu and helplessness that follows every bomb blast or terrorist attack these days. India has become the favourite target practice for terrorist groups growing in different corners of Pakistan and Bangladesh. After every strike our netas spout their standard rhetoric of condemnation, expecting the people to remain calm even after losing their next of kin. The foreign hand is duly blamed by ministers who also promise to revamp the intelligence system. Nothing changes, except maybe the security of our politicians. It is strange that even after so many innocent citizens have lost their lives, the Indian government has not mustered enough courage to take a strong stand against the countries where the terrorists receive their schooling in the destructive acts.          
	Yours faithfully,       
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  There cannot be any respite from terrorism unless we decide to fight it jointly  politicians, intelligence establishments, the liberal intelligentsia and the common people  and strike back at the terrorists. Indeed, our political leadership, for its compromising attitude towards terrorists, deserves most of the blame for the serial blasts in the different parts of India. It is unfortunate that despite being on the terror radar for almost two decades, India is still debating the need for an anti-terror law. If the United Progressive Alliance government has problems in reintroducing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, it can choose to enact some other law which will not have the objectionable clauses of the Pota, but will be stringent enough to curb the menace of terrorism.           
	Whenever terrorists strike, we start blaming the intelligence community without realizing that their ultimate job is to report to the political establishment, and unless the governments, whether state or Central, take actions, these agencies are as helpless as the people on the streets. In Indias fight against terrorism, support should also come from the liberals, including the leftists, who have different strategies to deal with aggressive majority and minority communities.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Rajesh Kumar Sharma, Kankinara, North 24 Parganas 

                
	Sir  Savagery in men has become more evident now than ever before. After the Jaipur blasts three months ago and then in Ahmedabad and Bangalore, and now in Delhi, there is no doubt that a long-term sinister plan has been hatched somewhere to destabilize the social and religious structure of India. One has an uncanny feeling, courtesy our sluggish intelligence agencies, that is not the last we have seen of such blasts. Apart from routine relief work and half-hearted efforts to arrest the perpetrators, the ruling party is too scared to upset some section of its vote bank or the other to take draconian measures to bring the masterminds to book.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Salil Gewali, Shillong

                
	Sir  Every time Islamic terrorists kill civilians, the government sheds crocodile tears. Instead of implementing strong anti-terror laws, the government is sitting idle even after repeated blasts. It is afraid of taking any measure that might reduce its Muslim vote bank. This is giving the terrorists a licence to kill with impunity. As the Muslim population in India swells, there will more attacks every week and month. Since the majority of Muslims are very poor, they become easy targets for terror outfits that brainwash them into killing kafirs. The porous borders of India also allow Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to cross over to India easily. Once here, our politicians help them get voter ID cards and passports instead of sending them back immediately. This has a lot to do with the situation going out of control.          
	If a minister or politician or their family members fall victim to one of the attacks by terrorists, it might help the apathetic lot experience the agony of losing near-and-dear ones and perhaps inspire them into taking some serious action.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Tuneer Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The recent spate of bomb blasts in Delhi and other parts of the country is unfortunate. Equally unfortunate is the predictable activity of picking up Muslim youths that follows each such attack. It is alarming that the investigative agencies of India seem to link the entire Muslim community with terrorism. When the Gujarat riots took place in 2002, a section of the society was pained for the victimized Muslims. But the way the atmosphere has been vitiated today, any torture upon Muslims will no longer generate much sympathy. The Indian State is increasingly becoming a police state and it is State versus Muslims now with most common people siding with the police. Thanks to biased reports in the media, Muslims have been marginalized and demonized in India in a frightening way.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Not quite          
	Sir  In the article, Made in China (Sept 18), Neha Sahay says, Of course food-safety officials were involved, but so was the Chinese search engine, Baidu. Last month, it offered the producer of the contaminated powder, San Lu, a complete black-out of negative references to it in return for a payment of three million yuan. It also suggested that to prevent punitive action, San Lu should threaten to reveal the secret that all milk powder manufacturers in China use melamine and that they buy out victims to silence them. This allegation is baseless.           
	The truth is that Baidu was approached by San Lu but it refused to screen out the negative reports. Suggestions of Baidus involvement in the melamine controversy came from a forged letter by San Lus supposed PR company, advising San Lu to approach Baidu, that surfaced on the internet. Several reputed news services have written on the issue and dismissed the letter as forged.          
	Yours faithfully,

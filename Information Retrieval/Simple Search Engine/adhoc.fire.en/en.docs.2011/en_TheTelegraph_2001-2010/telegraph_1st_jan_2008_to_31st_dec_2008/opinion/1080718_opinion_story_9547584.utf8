	Dissent apparent                  
	Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjee deserves to be applauded for his brilliant take on Prakash Karat and his cronies (Castle that comrades built, July 13). There is little reasoned argument in the Lefts trenchant hatred of America and its so-called interference in Indian foreign policy. The Marxists have always preferred rhetoric to reality. It is likely that they are not against the nuclear deal as such, but are objecting to it because they could not ink the deal themselves. Even China has signed nuclear deals with America and is now reaping their profits. Russia has also joined the league. Indias sovereignty was threatened when the American battleship, INS Jalashwa, anchored in Chennai with permission from our government, but the Left did not raise much hue and cry then. But then, Chinas claim on Arunachal Pradesh does not ruffle the Reds as much as a sensible civilian nuclear deal with the worlds most powerful nation does.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Anti-Americanism was alright in the Sixties, but today it is not  is that what Rudrangshu Mukherjee believes? The US did not think twice before attacking Iraq on the strength of the unsubstantiated theory of weapons of mass destruction in the possession of Saddam Hussein. Syria and Iran are threatened on a regular basis ever since they made their military and nuclear ambitions public. The run-up to the nomination of the Democrat candidate for the presidential election shows that the Americans are not happy with their countrys role in contemporary world politics. The communists in India are certainly not above criticism. But they cannot be accused of not evolving with time. They have moved into the folds of democratic politics, choosing electoral politics as a means of social change over the revolutionary ideal. In Bengal particularly, the Marxists challenged the feudal set-up and thus protected the state from communal, regional and casteist politics that has engulfed most of India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjees arguments in Castle that comrades built are self-contradictory. He recognizes that in a communist party, before a final decision is arrived at, rigorous discussions are held at various levels with individual members freely airing their views. However, after a party line is decided upon, individual opinions cease to matter and the comrades surrender their identity to the party. There is not a single non-Left party where things are any different, except that in these parties, the party line is often decided without taking the bulk of the members into confidence. It is not only the communist who resorts to ideology. The free market ideology is espoused by several neo-liberal political scientists and economists, who steadfastly refuse to acknowledge the disastrous effects that the opening up of the Indian economy in 1991 has had on the vulnerable sections of the society. They are no less dogmatic than the communists whom they accuse to be anti-market and out of touch with reality. Finally, if anyone claims to have been concerned about US actions in Vietnam in the Sixties, he should be much more concerned now, because Americas tendency to unilaterally violate existing international laws to go to war at the slightest pretext and on manipulated intelligence has only increased. If we claim to be enlightened individuals we cannot afford to overlook the miseries that Americas actions have brought upon the world, not just upon Afghanistan and Iraq. If we criticize Stalinism, we have to condemn in the same breath, McCarthyism or the more recent Bushism.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Never before has the world been more opposed to American imperial politics as now. Yet Rudrangshu Mukherjee suggests that it was only in the Sixties that anti-Americanism had some relevance. The US has invaded, occupied or controls over 170 nations without any approval from any of its own legal and parliamentary institutions. With thousands of soldiers and civilians dead or injured, never before has a US president been so thoroughly discredited. George W. Bush makes Nixon look like Mary Poppins. Mukherjee could have analysed the hypocritical and opportunist policies of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its disjunction from the changing times, whether in Latin America or in Nepal or the Philippines. But instead he has chosen to go ahead with his anti-communist agenda, while sparing the US the criticism it deserves.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rana Bose, Calcutta. 

                
	Sir It does not require great intelligence to see that Rudrangshu Mukherjee dislikes communists. However, he draws certain conclusions based on wrong premises. No party, whether leftist or not, allows its members to express personal opinions that run contrary to the party line. In India, it is the communists who have contacts with the grassroots, never mind what Mukherjee thinks. The biggest proof of this lies in the observation that from the late Nineties the communists repeatedly cautioned us about the impending distress in the agricultural sector. The crisis is well upon us though no time was lost back then to brand the Lefts anxiety as unrealistic. People who stand up for the inconvenient truth have always faced the most flak. The nuclear deal crisis and the branding of communists as outdated are no exceptions to the trend.           
	Yours faithfully,

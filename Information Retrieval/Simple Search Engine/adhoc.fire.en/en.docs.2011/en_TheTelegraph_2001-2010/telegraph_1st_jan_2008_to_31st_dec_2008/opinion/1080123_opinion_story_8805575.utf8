	Forgotten land 
         
	Sir  In Damage control, (Jan 10), J.J. Singh writes about the natural resources and unparalleled beauty of Indias Northeast. Singh also states that the decreasing importance of the Northeast has to do with the rise of militancy in that region. This, however, is not true. India has always had a stepmotherly attitude towards the northeastern states. In fact, this is one of the reasons as to why terrorist outfits have demanded the separation of the northeastern states from the rest of India. Moreover, the national and international business firms that have set up their plantations in the region are only intersted in exploiting its natural resources. They have seldom used the money generated to develop the Northeast. 
     
	The rulers in New Delhi must realize that the Northeast is not an Indian colony, but an Indian state. As such, this part of the country needs as much attention as any other part of India. The process of damage control on the part of the government can only start when the people of the mainland change their attitude towards the Northeast. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Atiqur Rahman, Guwahati

        
	Sir  J.J. Singh righteously exhorts the people of the Northeast to combat terrorism. In the process, he ignores the real issue that is at stake here. More and more people of the Northeast are joining terrorist organizations because they are disappointed with the Union governments policies. The Centre refuses to grant them equal rights with the rest of India. The army too has failed to protect the lives of the people and arrest the miscreants. Worse, it is guilty of perpetrating violence and bloodshed. In fact, in 2004, several women stripped themselves in front of the army headquarters in Manipur to protest against the rape and murder of a woman by army men. The aggrieved women had held up a banner with the telling phrase, Indian Army, Rape Us. Before asking the people to restore peace, the former army chief should try and undo the damage in this part of India. 
          
	Yours faithfully,
   
Amit Sengupta, Port Blair

        
	Blame game
     
	Sir  It seems that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is keen on springing nasty surprises on Calcuttans. First, the residents of a housing complex were told that the pond in their locality was not a pond at all! Then, citizens were informed that the Nandaram complex in Burrabazar is actually a phantom building since the CMC can neither trace the plan of the original building nor say who owns the highrise (Nandaram is nobodys baby, Jan 16). The building has existed for nearly 22 years, even after it was declared illegal by the Supreme Court in 1986. But the people of Calcutta will hardly be surprised by the goings-on. After all, a visit to any of the municipal offices is enough to show that rules are seldom followed in these premises. Here, the officers sleep during working hours, waking up occasionally to take bribes,while the mayor himself spends more time in attending to his private practice than in doing his duty as Calcuttas first citizen. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  I think that much is being made about the illegality of Nandaram market in order to deflect public attention from the fire brigades failure to douse the flames on time. Thanks to the pathetic fire-fighting skills of the firemen, businessmen have lost crores of money. 
     
	And now the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has ruled out the possibility of any reconstruction activity since the Supreme Court declared as the structure illegal. This means that the traders will not get any recompense and that they would also lose the place from which they conducted their business. I am sure that the corrupt CMC officials are in collusion with rich realtors who want to build new high-rises on the spot. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Rohit Rathi, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It would be wrong to blame the CMC entirely for allowing the Nandaram complex to stand despite the court ruling. The shop-owners of the complex are as culpable as the CMC in this case. They enjoyed municipal services such as water and electric supply for years without paying property taxes. One must realize that the CMC cannot possibly demolish every illegal structure in the city. Authorities can educate citizens and frame regulations to protect their rights. But the people should learn to ensure their own safety as well. The traders there had allowed electrical wires to dangle dangerously at every corner and hoarded litres of diesel on one of the floors. Driven by the desire to maximize profit, they have behaved irresponsibly. The fire is something that they brought upon themselves by their own negligence.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ajit Kundu, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It is difficult to believe that CMC officials stopped work after bringing down just seven floors of the 21-storey Nandaram building when it was pronounced illegal. Actually, by that time, they must have fattened their coffers sufficiently to lose their zeal for carrying out the rest of the task. The devastating fire at Nandaram market is the result of the CMCs dishonest practices. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  Now that it has been revealed that the CMC has allowed an illegal building to stand for years, officials are blaming Nandarams traders for failing to take precautions against fire. If the municipal corporation had done its work on time, the tragedy could have been averted. But do the mayor and his men care?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S.K. Biswas, Calcutta

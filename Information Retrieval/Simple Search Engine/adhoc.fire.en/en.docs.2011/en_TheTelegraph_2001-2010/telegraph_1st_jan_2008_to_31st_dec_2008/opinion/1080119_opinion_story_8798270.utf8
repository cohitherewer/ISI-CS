	Joseph Banowetz, a skilled pianist, gave Calcuttas music lovers a treat to remember at the Calcutta School of Music on January 6. Banowetz has been heard as a recitalist and orchestral soloist in over 30 countries, and has recently been nominated in the Best Chamber Music category for the forthcoming Grammy Awards. He has won a nomination for his performance in the recording of Thirty Songs of the Russian People in the Toccata series CD, titled Balakirev and Russian Folksong.
    
	Making changes in the programme and preceding each piece with succinct explanations laced with flashes of humour, Banowetz began with a transcription of Bachs Organ Prelude by the Russian composer, Siloti. Banowetzs delicate use of pedalling brought out the layered organ effects on the piano. (He is the author of the internationally acclaimed Pianists Guide to Pedalling). This was followed by Beethovens 32 variations on a theme in C-minor and one of Schuberts last compositions, the poignant Allegretto in C minor, which was played with subtle and beautiful phrasing. Schuberts Sonata in A minor Op. 143 and the Dumba by Tchaikovsky ended the first part of the recital.
    
	After the short interval, he resumed with Liszts transcriptions of Chopins songs, two more transcriptions of Liszts own compositions, the Petraceli Sonetto 104 and the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 3, all introduced by brief, witty and informative anecdotes.Banowetz generously offered a workshop the next morning and invited pianists wishing to play to inform him of their repertoire. 
    
	Musical workshops, in recent times, have become a curious phenomenon. Teachers are conspicuous by their absence, and not everyone seems to understand the spectator-performer aspect. Those presenting a piece seem to expect a one-on-one lesson on stage, and, consequently, miss the entire meaning of the academic and analytical discussion. The talks may include style, phrasing, use of instrumental facilities, era, compositional history et al. The few who turn up as the audience seem to be merely waiting for their turn to take the stage and pay little or no attention to the work at hand. In the course of the discussion, the professor/pianist is often met with a basilisk stare and little or no response. This is indeed unfortunate, especially when the person happens to be someone like Banowetz who is not only an immensely gifted teacher, but also an articulate, knowledgeable and charismatic person. 
    
	The workshop on Jan 7 began late. (Why are we not surprised?). It started with a performance by Gaurab Dutta, a 19-year-old, who played Beethovens Sonata in F minor Opus. 2 No. 1. Dutta played all 4 movements from memory, having correctly handed the tattered remnants of his score to Banowetz. The comments addressed issues such as editions (this was essentially interesting and useful); phrasing, technical corrections and style, all of which were discussed by the performer and his audience. 
    
	This was followed by the following performances  Priyadarshini Chatterjee presented a newly-learnt Solfeggietto by CPE Bach, (comments on accent and flow); Mayuk Mukhopadhyas rendering of Chopins Waltz in C-minor was rather eccentric.He hadnt quite got the gist of tempo guisto and was inattentive towards notational accuracy. However, young Alistair Quadros performance of Gillocks New Orleans Nightfall showed a lot of promise. Finally, Avijit Kundu impressed while playing tude No. 1 by Chopin and Schuberts Impromptu in Gb. 
    
	The discussion here was on the necessity to bring out melodic lines and shape phrases. Technical advice on difficulties in this followed, during which Banowetz repeatedly emphasized the importance of singing the melody. In many cases, he said, such a request is met with animosity and resistance. 
    
	Banowetzs aim seemed to be one of achieving articulacy, the use of correct editions, an understanding of phrasing and modern legato pedalling techniques, and everything else that is needed to put up a completely musical and aesthetic performance.
    
	Musicians and teachers alike would do well to accompany their students to such workshops. This would not only give them an opportunity to present a piece they are working on, but also enable them to glean as much information as possible from different styles of repertory. One can only thank Joseph Banowetz for his generosity and patience.

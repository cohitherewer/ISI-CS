	Unhappy journeys                  
	Sir  The Union railway minister, Lalu Prasad, looked very happy flagging off Jammu and Kashmirs first ever train at Nowgam (First train chugs into Kashmir, Oct 12). While Lalu Prasad is contented inaugurating new trains, has he looked into the condition of the trains already plying? I, along with my family, happened to travel by the Bagh Express during the pujas. Despite being in a first class coach, we found cockroaches, even rats, in the compartment. Some cleaners did come in occasionally to tidy the compartment and squirt an insect repellent, but the spray only caused the insects to crawl out of the woodwork. The fact that there is no pantry car in the train, which travels a long distance, adds to the woes of the passengers. And the train just crawls through the stations in Bihar. This might be for the expediency of passengers from the railway ministers home state, but it certainly causes much inconvenience to the general passenger.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Kavita Y.K., Calcutta

                
	Sir  I had booked a waitlisted ticket in the Darjeeling Mail for October 12. Since the reservation was not confirmed, I went to the ticket-booking centre at Gholsapur in Behala for a refund on October 13. After standing for about 2 hours in the queue, I was told that my ticket can be cancelled only from Sealdah as the train leaves from that station. What is the purpose of having the local booking outlets if a person has to go all the way to a major station like Sealdah or Howrah to get a ticket cancelled?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although the Indian Railways had discontinued the third class in trains long ago, it appears that it continues to treat the passengers of the Kharagpur-Jhargram-Chakulia section of the South Eastern Railway as third class travellers. The passengers are tired of complaining to the authorities of several problems that never get redressed. For instance, the Kharagpur-Dhalbhumgarh Passenger almost always runs late. The train leaves Kharagpur 10-15 minutes later than the scheduled departure time everyday and on most days takes 30-40 minutes to travel the mere seven or eight kilometres to Kalikunda. Delayed further in subsequent stations, it habitually reaches Jhargram or Gidhni 45-50 minutes late.           
	Repeated letters about such hitches to the divisional railway manager of Kharagpur, which is one of the chief stations in the southeastern zone, have been of no avail. It is also a fact that Kharagpur is a poorly maintained station. The pay-and-use toilets here are never cleaned properly, the lightbulbs are missing and the men in charge of the lavatories often overcharge the users. Will the authorities ever wake up to the passengers misery?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prasenjit Bhakat, Jhargram

                
	Sir  Most of the education institutions of Pune remain closed during Diwali. My children, who study in Pune, wanted to come home for a few days during the leave to attend the festivities. But they did not get any reservation in the Azad Hind Express even under the Tatkal scheme. The Azad Hind Express is the only direct train running between Howrah and Pune. As a result, the demand for reservation in this particular train reaches a peak during holidays. The problem can be solved if the railway authorities add a few more coaches to the train or run special trains during the festive season.           
	Yours faith fully,

	Sir  I was travelling from Muri in Jharkhand to Howrah by the Shatabdi Express on October 4. I had purchased my ticket well in advance in the executive class. However, when I boarded the train, I was surprised to find that the Travelling Ticket Examiner had allotted my seat to somebody else. After much confusion, I was given back my original seat but then, I did not get the meals on board to which I am entitled. When I contacted the catering manager, I was told that the pantry was in short supply because of the Durga Puja rush. There were at least a dozen passengers like me, including women and children, who went hungry on the train that day.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Indian Railways abruptly cancelled a number of trains to eastern India and terminated a few at the wayside in the wake of the violence in Bihar. This caused undue suffering to passengers stranded in various stations all over India. The authorities could have easily avoided the fiasco by diverting the trains travelling through Bihar along alternative routes.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was travelling from Patna to New Delhi in the Poorva Express on October 11. As soon as I took my seat, I detected a strong smell of LPG coming from under the berth. Apprehensive that some passenger might have kept a leaking LPG cylinder somewhere, I contacted the TTE ,who was in the adjacent compartment. After much coaxing, he relented to come but told me that the smell was coming not from a cylinder but from the burning brake fluids of the train. When I insisted that the smell was definitely of LPG, the TTE challenged me to search out the cylinder.           
	What is the use of issuing warnings about the hazards of carrying cylinders in trains if the officials are so lackadaisical about their duty? Little wonder that train accidents are so frequent in India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	It is not just in Wonderland that the Queen of Heart rules. Her Off with his head!  first heard by Alice on a croquet-ground  has now been heard in the far less enchanting world of Indian hockey. It was beginning to look as if heads might roll in the Indian Hockey Federation. But things have taken a more drastic turn now. Not only has the IHF chief, K.P.S. Gill, been forced out of the office he had held with increasing disrepute for 15 years, but the IHF itself has also been suspended, in order to be replaced by an ad hoc committee. One does not have to be passionate about Indian hockey to feel somewhat relieved by the end of such a long and demoralizing reign. But the way this end came about makes one feel more alarmed for the future of sports bodies in India than reassured about the fate of Indian hockey. The queens dread command has been heard quite clearly in the course of these events. The Central sports ministry headed by the new sports minister, M.S. Gill, has been the primary agent in bringing about this transition, although acting through the mediation of the Indian Olympic Association, supported unanimously by 40-odd sports bodies.        
	Whatever the nature of the pressure put by the International Hockey Federation for the resignation of Mr K.P.S Gill and suspension of the IHF, the entire episode is a rather blatant example of the intervention of the State in a sphere that should be allowed to regulate itself autonomously. Even without denying the corruption and mismanagement in the IHF over the years, it is perfectly in form to argue for the independence of sports bodies and of their heads from the meddlesome heavy-handedness of the Centre and its mediating agents. The government can, at the most, act as a catalyst for reform, but it should not make the authority of, say, the IOA an extension of the authority of the sports ministry. Severe checks and punishments should be in place for corruption and abuse of power within these bodies, but their implementation must remain independent of political and bureaucratic systems. As in culture and in education, the State must know not only when to oversee or facilitate, but also when and how not to meddle beyond its legitimate purview. Ministers for sports, culture, and information and broadcasting are best regarded as anachronisms in a modern democracy.

	Desperately seeking change 
   
	Theatre of the streets: the jana natya manch experience (Jana Natya Manch, Rs 120) edited by Sudhanva Deshpande is a collection of writings and interviews by activists, writers, directors and academics associated with the Jana Natya Manch (Janam). The prized pieces include an article by Safdar Hashmi, Janams leader, who was killed during a performance in Delhi in 1989, and an interview with him. Theatre of the Streets will be a valuable guide to scholars interested in the relationship between theatre and politics. The publication of this book may seem ironic since Janam has never believed in an instruction kit on street theatre. However, the editor claims that the current academic interest in political theatre and the fact that Janam has entered its 35th year (when the average amateur group lasts five years to a decade) merited a volume on Janams work. Included in this informative little book are also an essay by Habib Tanvir and an interview with Govind Deshpande. 
            
	Lunatic in my Head (Penguin, Rs 295) by Anjum Hasan is set in Shillong in the Nineties and connects the lives of three characters intricately and, often, invisibly. There is Firdaus Ansari, a college lecturer, who wants to finish her thesis, break up with her boyfriend and then get out of Shillong. Aman Moondy, an IAS aspirant, is seeking Lady Love and Lady Luck. And Sophie Das, who learns about her adoption at the age of eight. Lyrical, introspective and humorous, Hasans first novel uses Shillong as not only the context but also the main protagonist  a small town that has created the characters and bound them to mundane destinies they desperately try to change.
    
	Songs of the Survivors (Goa 1556, Rs 295) edited by Yvonne Vaz Ezdani compiles narratives of the Goan diaspora in Myanmar that was caught in the Japanese bombings during World War II. This relatively unknown chapter of history comes to life in the vivid recollections of those Goan migrants who survived the war. Together, these accounts reconstruct how the war devastated peaceful lives and how some managed to escape to India. Sometimes a story, based on mere memory, such as Kevin Pintos Wartime Shepherds, may come without exact dates but it would be none the poorer in portraying immigrant Goan life in Myanmar. 
            
	Shall we dance Mr. Koshy? (Frog, Rs 345) by Thangasurabi Bright Raj comes with its second-hand grasp on English well-exposed in the language of the blurb. Candace Selvakumari Jones of Chennai is pissed off with [her] lifeless life because she constantly works her butt off while Abe E. Koshy of Bangalore is 26 but thinks like a 50-year-old, lacking the fun gene in his system. Koshys perfect life is disrupted by the arrival of Candace in it. Perhaps the cover alone gives this book a semblance of the dignity deserved even by a chick-lit novel.
                
	Guru English: South Asian Religion in a Cosmopolitan Language (Penguin, Rs 395) by Srinivas Aravamudan analyses the language of religious discourse in south Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Aravamudan shows how the transmission and transformation of Eastern religious discourses through the English language have generated a global idiom that challenges Western ideas of cosmopolitanism and produces a unique cosmopolitan discourse. The author studies the religious overtones of Romanticism, nationalism, postmodernism and so on and connects Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi and Deepak Chopra with Kipling, Joyce, Oppenheimer and Rushdie.

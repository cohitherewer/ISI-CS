	In his book, Joy Baba Felunath, Satyajit Ray gives a wonderful account of the sights and smells of Benaras. The ancient, ornate houses with tiny figures in bright paint on their walls, the serpentine lanes, the briskness of life on the ghats, and a strange scent  a mixture of incense, river water, cowdung, sweat, squalor and sweetmeats  that hangs for ever, like an invisible cloak, on the city. Remarkably, Ray refused to view Benaras through the prisms of spirituality and mysticism only.        
	Many people, especially wide-eyed Westerners, share Rays fascination with Benaras. But unlike the maestro, their minds eye is clogged with visual clichs. Tim Halls exhibition of photographs, Pilgrimage (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, until July 19), belongs to this set. Benaras, for Hall, is a very rich picking ground for capturing the essence of India... where reality and myth seem totally blurred. It is a pity that Hall, his vision entirely furnished with the ready-made iconography of Benaras, can see little else other than holy men, wrestlers, mystics, devotees and bathers.        
	Halls work in colour has an abstract, fluid quality, the result of his fondness for painterly photographs. Walking in the Ganges shows five women, their backs turned to the camera, wading in knee-deep water towards a film of mist, as if wanting to disappear. The use of a muted tone is repeated in some other images as well  Praying in the Ganges, Meditation, Sweeper, Bathing in the Ganges. Everywhere, there is stillness, silence and the interplay of myth and mystery. The stills convey the impression of a beguiled visitors modest photographic attempt to capture Benarass timeless, ethereal quality.         
	The monotony is broken when Halls camera moves away from the river, into the city, adopting a more documentary approach. But Hall is no William Gedney. In his Varanasi Back-street, we see a narrow lane, hemmed in by dilapidated buildings, wires hang like spider-webs from their roofs and balconies. There is an old man too, who is walking towards the camera, as if wanting to step out of the frame. A pretty picture, but only in a frothy, soulless way. Our hopes are further dimmed when Hall adopts a more stylized approach and attempts to create simple, beautiful images of ordinary people in black and white. Here too, Hall refuses to break new ground. His subjects  wrestlers, sadhus and village belles  remain quite as unoriginal. Wrestlers (top right) features three men in front of a white screen  two young men and an older man in the middle. The youngsters, in their loincloth, have muscular, hairless bodies. Their heads are slightly tilted, and their faces convey an expression of boredom. The potbellied old man has rolls of sagging flesh and appears to have puffed his body up to look menacing. But he ends up looking comical instead. This photograph touches upon the issue of Otherness in the photographers skewed relationship with his subject. It might generate interest, because Halls style here is perilously close to that adopted by anthropologists working in colonies.         
	The other exhibition sharing the premises displays two different sets of work by Swapan Nayak. Nowhere People is about men and women who live on the temporary char areas on the Brahmaputra in Assam, while Refugees In Their Own Land documents the lives of the indigenous tribes in the strife-torn Northeast. Nayaks work is refreshingly political, and, unlike Halls, weaves in hard realities  disenfranchisement, alienation, marginalized people, poverty and so on. He resists a digital camera and his robust, documentary style is at once humane and compelling.         
	Thematically, a kind of hopelessness joins Nayaks two different series. In Salvage (left), Nayak shows two men pulling a boat to the shore. He has an eye for detail and effortlessly captures the swirl of grey, foaming water and the taut muscles on the mens hands. There is also the suggestion of a cruel denial of peoples rights in the photograph of an empty school whose skeletal benches and chairs speak of unforgivable abandonment. Yet, despite the odds, there is a willingness to go on with life. It is evident in the way a young man strums his guitar in the Song Of Lost Soil ( bottom right) or in the eyes of the Nowhere Shopkeeper, a young boy with his ridiculously ill-equipped tea stall on an almost deserted riverbank, who stares unselfconsciously. In that stare, there lies strength and hope.

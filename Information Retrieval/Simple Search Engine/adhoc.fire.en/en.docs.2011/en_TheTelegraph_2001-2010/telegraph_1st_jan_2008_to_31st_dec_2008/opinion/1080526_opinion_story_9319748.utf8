	It looks like a particularly unfortunate case of history repeating itself. But the deadlock in Rajasthan led by the Gujjars, with the number of deaths well over 30 now, is likely to carry this history forward indefinitely into the future. At the core of this crisis is a broken promise. But between the previous agitation in May last year and this one, that perceived betrayal has also been doubled. The Vasundhara Raje government has broken its original promise, made to the Gujjars in 2003, of recommending the community for scheduled tribes status. Now it seems to have let them down yet again by failing in its promised efforts to look into the matter by setting up a committee that would review the situation and report in three months. Last year, it was this assurance from Ms Raje that had made the Gujjars withdraw their agitation. The committee submitted a report questioning the criteria for determining ST status. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Rajasthan sent this report to Delhi and put the ball in the Centres court. The latest round of agitation by the Gujjars was the result of their re-organizing themselves in reaction to what they saw as delaying tactics on the part of Ms Rajes government.        
	Bizarrely, almost all the features of this agitation mirror those of the one last year. Perhaps Kirori Singh Bainslas following has grown since the last unrest, with armed dacoits and their men joining in support. Talks with the government had seemed within the range of possibilities in 2007. But the Gujjars stand has hardened too, with nothing other than the recommendation letter for ST status as their absolute demand. Ms Raje has also begun to strike a tough-talking enough-is-enough note. But this crisis is the inevitable consequence of political opportunism, which locks governments and communities in impossible, no-win spirals that neither dialogue nor violence seems to be able to resolve.

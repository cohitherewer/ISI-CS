The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Young adults having fun on the stage
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       YOUNG ADULTS HAVING FUN ON THE STAGE                              Theatre      Ananda Lal                                                
	Time for our periodic round-up of action in childrens theatre, which has developed so extensively in Calcutta over the last few years that it has virtually taken on the dimensions of a movement. Many schools and troupes routinely support and conduct theatre-in-education projects so frequently nowadays that it becomes impossible to keep track of them all, or even to devote a fair amount of review space to those that one does manage to see. It is difficult to believe that, not too long ago, only a handful in either category persevered with childrens theatre, and that adults looked down upon it as a decidedly inferior sub-genre, not really worth the time spent on it.        
	Its social benefits and value education have finally taken root, even though most of the productions fall into one of the two time-tested patterns of packaging material for young audiences: the fairy-tale fantasy and moral-lesson reality. A more recent variation on the latter theme has emerged: the damages inflicted by our education system.         
	This, for instance, formed the subject of the somewhat disorganized Patton-Padatik Competition this year in which twelve schools participated. The realistic ills grew so dreary with every institution repeating them that one prayed for some aesthetic relief. The script evaluators should have encouraged higher flights of imagination.        
	The Fifth National Childrens Theatre Festival held by Eso Natak Shikhi made up in quantity for what fell short in quality. It must have been a logistical feat to shepherd the large casts of sixteen plays from as far away as Bangladesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam, Delhi  not to mention Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal  into a tight three-day schedule. But precisely because of this geographical range and national scope, the organizers should have exercised better judgment not to alienate their guests with long speeches and announcements in Bengali.        
	On the first evening, Sishunatyams Jogyi Khoka (from Narsingdi, Bangladesh) exemplified the folk archetype of a boy who fights natural and supernatural odds to bring a remote medical herb to cure his mother, while Akhila Kerala Balajanasabhyams Namaste Guruji (Malappuram, Kerala) and the hosts Jantrana fitted the new theme of reforming education, the former positing some of the virtues of traditional gurukuls. Jantrana, written and directed by Tapas Das, had a novel concept: parents pressurize a child toward technology so much that his blood vessels turn into optic fibres and brain cells into microchips, making him a suitable commodity for export to the US. Amity International Schools Budhi Kaki (Noida) belonged to the morality category, adapting Premchands story about an old grandaunt neglected during a family celebration.        
	Meanwhile, Nehru Childrens Museum continues its activities with its pupils on Saraswati Samipeshu, written and directed by Ramaprasad Banik. As the title suggests, this full-length drama is a no-holds-barred indictment of local education, but as usual Banik attempts so exhaustive a coverage of all items under the sun that it seems too forced. One has mixed feelings about his techniques as well. On the one hand, he imparts some essential ingredients of acting (now increasingly lost) to the students, especially how to throw the voice. On the other, this sometimes results in loud melodrama. In general, it becomes transparent that he constructed the play in TV-soap manner, plotting a series of contrived episodes, each of which climaxes in emotional excess before the next one begins.        
	Blank Verse has a double bill of childrens plays, scripted and directed by Raja Bhattacharya and presented by Niva Arts at Tapan Theatre. Juta Abishkar, c/o R.N. Tagore, as the logo creatively puts it, dramatizes Tagores fanciful poem about the invention of shoes for a king. Its colourful method recalls the groups previous work in a similar vein, Phurut.         
	More original, therefore, is the groups treatment of another childrens story  Kanaichand Paloyan  about a dullard at school compelled by his father to join the army as his only employment option, where he becomes a war hero and, ultimately, a martyr. Bhattacharya innovatively subverts expectations by casting kids as the adults and himself as the teenage hero, leading to much fun as the junior actors revel in imitating parents and teachers, as one can make out from the picture.

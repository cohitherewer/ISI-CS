             - Two books on Gandhis life and work
                           
	A FRANK FRIENDSHIP: GANDHI AND BENGAL: A DESCRIPTIVE CHRONOLOGY Edited by Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Seagull, Rs 950
 
	THE OXFORD INDIA GANDHI Edited by Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Rs 850
 
	Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was shot dead by a Hindu fanatic sixty years ago. He was then one year short of eighty. His work had transformed politics and society in South Africa and India. But apart from his work, he was also a prolific writer whose collected writings run into more than a hundred volumes. These are an embarrassment of riches for the Gandhi scholar, but for the intelligent person interested in reading Gandhi in his own words, ploughing through the Collected Works is a daunting, if not a forbidding, task. The two books under review here seek to make Gandhi a little more accessible to readers.
    
	Both volumes are edited by a grandson of Gandhi. Gopalkrishna Gandhi is the youngest son of Devadas, the youngest son of the Mahatma. In West Bengal, Gopal Gandhi is known as the states most popular governor, ever. But, before he accepted the gubernatorial position, he was a member of the Indian Administrative Service. He was the founder-director of the Nehru Centre in London, and the holder of some important diplomatic assignments. These pieces of Gopal Gandhis curriculum vitae are well-known. What is not common knowledge is that he is a novelist and a playwright, as well as a translator, who, among other works, translated Vikram Seths A Suitable Boy into Hindi.
    
	These two volumes reveal another remarkable facet of Gopal Gandhi: he is a meticulous editor and annotator. His research is detailed and his notes always informative and never prolix. The Mahatma, who always wrote with care and precision, would have specially blessed this grandson of his for the care he has taken in producing these books. They are indispensable to all who are interested in Gandhi.
    
	The two books are very different in terms of what they want to convey. A Frank Friendship is explicitly a chronicle of a rather tortured relationship. The editor makes no claims to provide an analysis. He lets what he calls a descriptive chronology and the rare photographs that he has selected for this volume do the talking. The editor enters the chronicle only to introduce the personalities when they enter the story. The editorial restraint is enviable.
    
	Apart from the Mahatma himself, the two obvious figures of importance in this book are Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose. Both were close to Gandhi, and both were at various points strong critics of Gandhi, his views and his methods. While Tagores differences with Gandhi remained at the level of arguments, those between Gandhi and Bose were very stormy and resulted in a complete political break. This break contributed to many Bengalis disliking Gandhi, since Bose remains, somewhat inexplicably, the ultimate Bengali icon.
    
	Whatever dislike some Bengalis felt about Gandhi, or may continue to harbour, Bengal provided the backdrop for the passion of his life. During the communal riots of 1946-47, he rushed to Bengal, shunning the negotiations concerning the transfer of power, to restore Hindu-Muslim amity. Those months in Bengal gave even to his life a poignant dimension and significance. On August 15, 1947, Gandhi chose to stay in Calcutta, praying in a ramshackle house in east Calcutta. Bengal and Bengalis cannot  and should not  forget these months of Gandhis life since they created a unique and unbreakable relationship that went far beyond a frank friendship.
    
	The other book presents a selection from Gandhis writings. Most existing compilations of this kind  the most important of these is perhaps the three volumes edited by Raghavan Iyer and published by OUP in 1993  present Gandhis ideas thematically. Gopal Gandhi, however, takes the chronological route. The volume has such an excellent index that it is easy to plot Gandhis thinking on various themes.
    
	Gandhi has been the victim of endless clichs and misquotations. Gopal Gandhis selection aims to rescue Gandhi from this plight. One striking example of misquotation that the editor mentions in the introduction is the Mahatmas description of the Cripps offer being a post-dated cheque on a crashing bank. 
    
	Gopal Gandhis source for all quotations and all the pieces that he has selected for this volume is the Collected Works. He sees this volume as Gandhis posthumous autobiography which will help complete his story in his own words from where he had left it in The Story of My Experiments with Truth. The claim that this is a posthumous autobiography will, of course, be contested. An autobiography is inevitably, and almost by definition, something more than a selection and compilation of writings. In India, one need only to look at Gandhis own autobiography and that of Jawaharlal Nehru as illustrations of how rich an autobiography can be. This is not to detract from the richness of this volume, but only to point to its difference from an autobiography.
    
	While this volume undoubtedly provides a glimpse into Gandhis life, it provides a valuable entry into Gandhis mind and its development. Isaiah Berlin once memorably divided thinkers between those that were like a hedgehog and those that were like a fox. The hedgehog knows one truth and remains curled up around it. The fox is perennially running after different versions of the truth. Gandhi was the archetypal hedgehog: he knew his truth, but he sought to experiment with it. He was the hedgehog that appeared to be a fox. Because Gopal Gandhis selection traces Gandhis thought chronologically, it is possible to begin to understand Gandhis truth as well as his inherent restlessness.
    
	Gopal Gandhi has put all of us irredeemably in his debt by his profound tribute to his grandfather because he allows us to come close to the Mahatma.

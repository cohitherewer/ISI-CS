                 CULTURE INTO STONE
   The principles behind the restoration of the gardens and area around Humayuns tomb in Delhi
                         
	It is undeniable that the template for a modern India was established by the colonial regime. The British built up the infrastructure for modernization by ushering in industrial and scientific revolutions. Based on these developments, knowledge systems became increasingly sophisticated in independent India. But beyond sustained technological advancement, to what extent have the legacies of colonial modernity lived on? Can it be claimed that a consciousness of modernity also develops alongside the progress in science and technology? 
    
	Technical expertise in historical conservation has been updated over the years, but how much of conservation has actually entered everyday behaviour and attitudes? The preservation of culture cannot take place independent of the public sphere. There is a fundamental disconnect between the people and the monuments, as Shobita Punja, art historian and conservationist, puts it. For this reason, Punja believes in envisioning the role of the ASI in more holistic terms. From excavation work, the ASI has to make the transition to the maintenance and management of the sites. And these activities would become meaningful only if awareness-raising  through guided tours, audio-visual media and public-interest activism  is carried on in tandem. 
    
	The restoration of the gardens of Humayuns tomb  through the joint efforts of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the ASI, under the aegis of the National Culture Fund  initiated a major shift in the working principles of conservation. Completed in 2003, it was the first private-public partnership project of a World Heritage Site in India. Its objective was to revitalize the gardens, pathways, fountains and water-channels of the chhar-bgh  the four-part paradise garden surrounding the tomb  according to the original plans.
    
	The revitalization was conceived of in comprehensive terms. The focus of conservation work, while remaining on the garden itself, also included issues of public interest. For instance, wheelchair access  seldom seen anywhere in the country  was introduced. Keeping in mind the needs of the physically challenged, bridges were built across the water-channels. Workshops were organized with children not only to make them aware of the historical significance of the tomb itself, but also to explain the idea behind the conservation work.
    
	Following on this venture, the AKTC, in association with the ASI, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Central public works department and the Aga Khan Foundation, have undertaken an urban-renewal project for the area made up by Humayuns Tomb, Nizamuddin Basti and Sundar Nursery. Ratish Nanda, conservation architect for the project, spoke to The Telegraph about this. An excerpt:
       
	What makes the restoration of Humayuns tomb, and now the urban renewal project, unique in the history of Indian conservation?
       
	RN: Both projects have a multidisciplinary approach and depend heavily on master craftsmen. People from various disciplines  conservation architects, landscape architects, archaeologists, botanists, art historians, urban historians, civil engineers, hydrological engineers, geologists, material conservators, graphic designers  participated in the garden project. The project we are embarking on will include professionals trained in health, education, community development and so on.
        
	It has been said that conservation has moved away from the question of authenticity. How have the principles changed over the years?
       
	RN: The Western concept of authenticity cannot be blindly transferred to the Indian context. Very few heritage structures, such as the Taj Mahal, Ajanta caves, Khajuraho temples, are akin to paintings and deserve to be treated with principles that govern art conservation. In case of other buildings, such as the Humayuns Tomb, the original stone pattern could be said to be more valuable for its cultural significance than the stone itself; in a case such as this, authenticity, would mean ensuring that the pattern is not disturbed. 
       
	What is the idea behind a conservation area in relation to the urban-renewal project?
       
	RN: Conservation areas in historic cities are neighbourhoods of a special architectural or aesthetic interest, the character of which is desirable to preserve. These areas need to be the focus of special conservation-oriented development plans. 
    
	The urban-renewal project intends to have a positive impact well beyond conservation  promoting good governance, employment generation, growth of civil society, a rise in incomes and economic opportunities, greater respect for human rights and better stewardship of the environment. 
       
	How can conservation projects be made relevant to public life? 
       
	RN: We need to shed the elitist image of conservation. Such projects, if well executed, can fulfil several government objectives. Conservation is labour-intensive and hence generates employment, while using traditional materials which are sustainable and environment-friendly. Historic buildings are cheaper to convert into schools or vocational womens centres than new, ugly buildings. Conservation allows a better understanding of others cultures, and encourages communal harmony and tourism.

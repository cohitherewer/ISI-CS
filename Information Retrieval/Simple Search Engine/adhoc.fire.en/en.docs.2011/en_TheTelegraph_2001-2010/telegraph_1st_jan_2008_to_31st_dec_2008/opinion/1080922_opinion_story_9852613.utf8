	The good news is that the president of the United States of America, George W. Bush, is not going to invade Iran before he leaves office. The bad news is that he is attacking Pakistan instead.        
	Last year, the US intelligence services deliberately undercut his case for war against Iran by releasing a joint assessment concluding that Tehran had stopped its nuclear-weapons programme in 2004. That killed Bushs hopes of getting the American public to back an attack on Iran. Even the prospect of getting Russia to go along with sanctions against the Iranians pretty well died after the imbroglio in Georgia in August.        
	So the White House has gone entirely silent on Iran. But about two months ago, according to information that was leaked just last week, Bush authorized US military attacks against suspected supporters of the Taliban and al Qaida on Pakistani soil  without the permission of the Pakistani government.         
	The latest incident, just after midnight on Monday morning, began when seven US helicopter gunships and two troop-carrying Chinook helicopters landed near the Pakistani border in the Afghan province of Pakhtia. US troops got out and tried to cross the border into Pakistan, presumably in search of some terrorist target. According to local officials, Pakistani paramilitary troops manning a check-point fired into the air to warn off the Americans while local tribesmen took up defensive positions. On this occasion, the US soldiers stopped. With nobody around to stop them, however, another American ground force attacked a target in Pakistans South Waziristan province on September 4 and, according to local witnesses, killed about twenty people including women and children.         
	The local witnesses may be exaggerating, but the fact that American troops carried out an act of war on Pakistans territory without informing Islamabad, let alone getting its permission, is not disputed. And there have been other recent American attacks, involving missiles fired from the air at suspected terrorist targets, in which innocent Pakistani civilians have unquestionably been killed.                 
	Consolation prize        
	Pakistans economy is tottering, its new democracy is shaky, and it has not done a very impressive job of keeping the Taliban supporters in the provinces bordering Afghanistan under control. (On the other hand, the US has not done a very convincing job of beating the Taliban in Afghanistan, either.) But Pakistan is still a major regional power: it has twice as many people as Iran, and it definitely has nuclear weapons. Using US troops in Pakistan without permission is simply begging for trouble. The White House may be hoping that the newly elected president, Asif Ali Zardari, will be pliable enough to let such things happen, but even if he were, the Pakistani army simply would not allow it.        
	The new Bush policy is stupid and futile: how can using US troops on Pakistani soil do anything but drive more local people into the arms of the militants and turn the Pakistani government into Americas enemy? But it is of a piece with the larger Bush doctrine which decrees that the best way to deal with terrorism is to attack the countries where the terrorists live with military force. The senior officers who now command the US armed forces should know that this is not just wrong but hugely counter-productive. They were all taught in staff college that the best way to counter terrorism is by police work, intelligence gathering, and defensive security measures. Using military force just plays into the terrorists hands. Indeed, its the reaction that the terrorists are usually hoping for.        
	There is one consolation. Bush will be gone from office in four more months, so he probably doesnt have enough time left to turn Pakistan into a full-fledged enemy of the US.

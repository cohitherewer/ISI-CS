	Many famous men have had dates with history. Jyoti Basu, West Bengals chief minister for over two decades, and the man who would have become Indias first communist prime minister if his party had allowed him, seems to be having an intermittent tryst with the word historical. He had dubbed the decision of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) taken in mid-May 1996 not to join a non-Bharatiya Janata Party government, a historical blunder. This fateful decision by the CPI(M), it will be recalled, had prevented Mr Basu from becoming the prime minister of India although he had emerged as the consensus candidate of all the coalition partners. The decision had obviously rankled with Mr Basu, and he had articulated his disapproval of the partys decision in explicit and unambiguous terms. More recently, he admitted that he had violated party discipline when he had publicly supported the candidature of Subhas Chakraborty to the partys state secretariat and the central committee. He did not exactly say he was sorry, but it will not be unfair to construe what he said to be an apology. A historical apology has thus followed a historical blunder. The blunder was by the party, the apology was by the individual.        
	The use of the word historical and the pairing of the individual and the party are both deliberate. Mr Basu, for the better part of his adult life, has been a loyal member of the communist party of India, first of the united party, and, from 1964, of the CPI(M). The discipline and protocol of the party are not unknown to him. On the contrary, that discipline has become part of his life and his being. He knows that a member of a communist party cannot have in public any personal/private views and opinions. Members are free to express their views in party fora, but once the party takes a decision or adopts a line, all private-personal views become irrelevant. The transgression of this simple rule by a veteran communist like Mr Basu is an item of history. He suddenly, albeit briefly, made the individual more important than the party. As soon as the latter reacted, the individual retracted and retreated into the shell of party discipline.        
	It will be an error to see this lapse on Mr Basus part as a function of his age. The lapse occurs because Mr Basu is rather uniquely situated in the twilight zone between retirement and non-retirement. There are reasons to believe that Mr Basu is complicit in the confusion. He wants to retire, but the party will not allow him to. By expressing himself on party matters, Mr Basu does not convey the impression that he sincerely wants to retire from the party and its affairs. Like an old habit, Mr Basu cannot give up the party, and the latter finds in him a convenient symbol of continuity. The individual and the party are thus caught in a vicious dialectic which does neither any good.

	While the world waited for it to move its fist, Pakistan has moved its finger. Almost a week after the Mumbai siege, followed by diplomatic and damage-control efforts worldwide, Pakistan has responded to the crisis by raiding Lashkar-e-Toiba camps and putting its commander, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, under house arrest. Throughout the exercise, the Pakistani establishment has been frothing at the mouth to insist that this is wholly a Pakistani initiative, for which it is neither beholden nor accountable to its Western friends or to India. The measure has forced an uncomfortable silence on the Indian establishment, and caused much relief in the American quarters. Although Pakistan has not yet indicated with what severity it wishes to deal with the arrested, the United States of America has already expressed its happiness with the move and announced the military establishments historic ties with the LeT to be a thing of the past. The US anxiety to get things going and yet cap the rising tension between the neighbours is palpable. Its operation in Afghanistan hinges on Pakistans cooperation  with men, supplies, and the territory through which they pass.        
	For the civilian establishment in Pakistan, the least action recourse was the best way it could come out of a sticky domestic situation. The controversial land and drone attacks by the US on Pakistani soil had pushed the military  by virtue of its much-publicized jingoistic defence of Pakistans sovereignty  a notch higher than the civilian leadership in patriotism when the Mumbai attacks happened. The international pressure on Pakistan saw not only the countrys civil society behind the military to pledge its support against the perceived Indian injustice, but also the mujahids bury the hatchet and express their willingness to join forces in Pakistans defence. The belated and reluctant arrests and the attendant statements are the governments efforts to show that Pakistan is not under siege. Unfortunately, it is  not by its neighbours or by Western powers, but by forces within, the LeT being just one of them. Pakistan continues to turn a blind eye to the activities of organizations like the LeT because it still believes in their efficacy in its supposed war against both India and Afghanistan. Pakistan has to come out of this mentality first if it wants to be saved from the terrorism that President Asif Ali Zardari has been warning the world about. It must stop being the perpetual victim.

	Dogs and other gods              
	SARAMA AND HER CHILDREN (Penguin, Rs 350) by Bibek Debroy is a fascinating book about dogs in Indian and world mythology, history and literature. Dogs have somehow been associated with death in almost all ancient cultures. We think of Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding hell in Greek mythology, the Egyptian Anubis, the dog-faced god of death and afterlife, and the dog who accompanied the Pandavas on their least journey, who was actually Dharma in disguise. The association has sometimes caused dogs to be revered and at others, to be looked upon with fear or disgust. Debroy sifts through the Vedas, Puranas, folk tales, Dharmashastras and epics to register the changes in the attitude towards dogs. The penultimate chapter is about dogs in Indian, especially Bengali, literature, from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay to Taslima Nasreen. In the chapter on the dogs in contemporary India, even the Hutch/Vodafone pug gets a mention. Debroy writes in the Preface that he enjoyed writing the book. His enjoyment is evident in every page of his work and this makes the reading immensely pleasurable too.                         
	MY FAMILY AND OTHER SAINTS (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Kirin Narayan is a trip back to the Seventies, when people were beginning to discover gurus, godseyes, and yoga. In 1969, Narayans big brother, Rahoul, decided to drop out of school and live with a guru. In preparation for his new life, he grew his hair into a curly halo like Bob Dylans and read the books by Aldous Huxley... and others. While his Indian father mocked him by calling gurus urugs, his American mother found his obsession charming. Narayans book is as much about her loony brother as about the colourful generation of which he was a part. The photographs from Narayans family album bring a lost period back to life.                                
	I WITNESS: PARTIAL OBSERVATIONS (Roli, Rs 295) by Kapil Sibal has a unique distinction for which it will surely stand out, if for nothing else  most of the poems were written on Sibals cell phone. If the purpose of poetry is to educate and entertain, then this collection can be said to achieve its aim well. There are helpful poems on the ways of becoming a good judge, winning elections and one on the Eightfold Path to be followed by a Noble politician. As to the entertainment value of the poems, well, lines such as Inflated stomach,/ belching concern,/ requires visiting/ an intern (Inflation), are enough to brighten many a gloomy day.

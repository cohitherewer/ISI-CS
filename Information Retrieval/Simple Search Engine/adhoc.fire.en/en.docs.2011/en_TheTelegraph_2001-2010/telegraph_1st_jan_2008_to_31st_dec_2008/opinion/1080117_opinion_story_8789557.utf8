	Disasters and misfortunes do not necessarily make governments  or the people  wiser. Absolutely nothing may change if the disaster-struck people refuse to learn their lessons. The fire at the Nandaram market was not the first wake-up call nor would it be the last, if large parts of Burrabazar continue to remain out of bounds for the civic laws. Traders in the area, the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have their shares of guilt for the colossal losses that the fire caused. Worse still, all of them know that they have done things that were both illegal and potentially dangerous. So it is not that the fire has revealed something that lay hidden from them. It has been an open secret that many of the buildings in the markets at Burrabazar had illegal structures. The dubious role of money in getting such structures cleared by the CMC is also widely known. The involvement of politicians in all this is also a familiar story. The mayor of Calcutta, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, admitted as much when he blamed democracy for the corporations inability to demolish unauthorized or illegal structures. But his statement also seems to suggest a defeatist attitude. The problem is that this attitude can be an excuse for not doing anything about the dangerous lack of basic civic and safety norms in the area and elsewhere in the city. 
    
	Logically, the authorities should use the fire in order to not only rebuild the market but also rethink civic and safety measures in Calcutta. Encroachments on the citys roads and other facilities have turned many parts of the city into a motorists nightmare. Sidewalks have been taken over by an ever-increasing horde of hawkers, forcing pedestrians to use the roads at the risk of their lives. Mr Bhattacharyyas argument about democracy thwarting the rule of law has been applied before to failed attempts at evicting hawkers from important roads. The citizens expect the mayor and the government to do better than throw up their hands in despair. There is no reason why the people should suffer because the authorities would not punish offenders with political links. The state government has set up two committees  one to inquire into the causes of the fire and the other to look into the legality of the structures in two markets there. But a clean-up of Burrabazar, which is long overdue, is ultimately a test of the governments political will.

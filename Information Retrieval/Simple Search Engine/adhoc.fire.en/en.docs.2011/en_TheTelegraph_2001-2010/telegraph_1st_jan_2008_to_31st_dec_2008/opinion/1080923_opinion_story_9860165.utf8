	Sinister gameplan                  
	Sir  The government of Orissa has been rightly threatened by the Union home ministry with Article 355, for failing to stop the attack on Christians by Hindu extremists (Rap for church attacks, Sept 20). The police appears to be clueless about how to control the growing law and order crisis, as Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister, remains busy campaigning for the civic elections, having little time for anything else. Nothing short of a strict constitutional remedy would be able to contain the volatile situation in Kandhamal. While the missionaries rally for the right to religious freedom, the saffronites accuse them of carrying out forcible conversions by luring the poor with money. Under these circumstances, the government should enforce the existing laws on conversion. At present, these laws are wantonly and egregiously flouted by district administrations, while the state government watches like a disinterested spectator.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bikash Mohapatra, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  It is difficult to figure out what the Bharatiya Janata Party would gain by sparking off communal tension in a state it rules, that too right before the general elections. The Constitution guarantees the freedom to practise any religion, and the sangh parivar has no right to curb this liberty by using violence or by invoking anti-conversion laws. Instead of attacking people willing to convert, it could try to find out the reasons behind their choice. Most of the converts are tribals, living on the fringes of society, neglected by the so-called welfare State. It is important for the Centre to understand the deeper motives rather than give knee-jerk reactions.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The authorities would do well to pay heed to Mukul Kesavans argument in Without qualification (Sept 18). True conversion to Christianity cannot take place through coercion or inducements. It can only happen when one accepts the message of Jesus Christ, and this must come from within. Are the people of India not free to choose what religion they want to belong to without fear of reprisal? If religious institutions provide monetary or material wealth, then this should not be misinterpreted as an inducement, but rather considered to be a sharing of the wealth of the church. This has been a feature of Christianity all along. We are called to share and help those in need. Are not Hindus called to do the same? Perhaps those who are so ready to attack, kill and rape local Christians should refrain from accepting Christian aid the next time there happens to be a natural disaster, whether it be in Orissa or anywhere else, and turn instead to their true brethren.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Richard Saviel, Highgate, Australia 

                
	Sir  At the core of the communal violence in Orissa and Karnataka lies religious conversion. It is difficult to take the missionaries seriously when they claim that they never indulge in forcible conversions. Such activities have been going on for years without ever being openly challenged. It was only when the BJP came to power at the Centre that a serious resistance to conversion began, only to go out of hand owing to the violence unleashed by the partys militant wing. The inherent inequity of the socio-cultural fabric of India has also led to a large number of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes opting for conversion to avoid persecution. The Hindu leaders may rave and rant against Christian missionaries, but we are yet to hear even one of them suggesting a way to end untouchability.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjan Das, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  The attacks on churches in Karnataka, after similar ones in Orissa, have given the Congress a chance to berate the BJP for promoting communalism. This is quite usual, the Congress labelling the BJP communal while the latter accuses the former of being soft on terrorism. But the BJP at least has a twisted case in defending Karnataka and Orissa as mob reaction to aggressive conversion, whereas the Congress has no grounds left to justify its position on terrorism.           
	Whenever there is public dissatisfaction with the ham-handed way in which the Centre has dealt with internal security so far, the Congress tries to do some roughshod damage control. Last week, when the partys spokesmen congratulated the Delhi police for taking action against terrorist attacks by defusing two bombs, it revealed the extent to which it has moved away from the people.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Soumyajit Mohanty, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  While the media are going berserk over the recent blasts in Delhi, the sustained communal violence in Orissa and Karnataka has not caused a comparable stir. From the last three census reports (1981, 1991 and 2001) it can be established that over time, the Christian population has not increased, but declined in India. The real reason for attacking Christians and their institutions is that their work with the downtrodden and marginalized sections has secured for an oppressed people the benefits of healthcare, literacy and economic independence. Certain political parties perceive a double-edged threat in this. Improved living conditions and greater awareness may encourage the underprivileged to break out of their caste shackles. This could also strike at the heart of vote-bank politics.          
	Yours faithfully,        Augustine K Raj, Trichy, Tamil Nadu              
	Sir  Nobody in his right mind would buy the BJPs theory that members of a community comprising only a fraction of the countrys population, are forcibly converting those in the majority. The organized violence in Orissa has its roots in the BJP agenda to communalize the Hindus there, just as it did in Gujarat.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Varghese, Kochi 

                
	Sir  That the Naveen Patnaik government has proved its unworthiness on every front is all too evident. Orissa remains one of the poorest states of India. Patnaik has no vision of what needs to be done if he gets an extended tenure. To allow him carry on for one term more will be a great electoral folly.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Prafulla Moharathy, Bhubaneswar

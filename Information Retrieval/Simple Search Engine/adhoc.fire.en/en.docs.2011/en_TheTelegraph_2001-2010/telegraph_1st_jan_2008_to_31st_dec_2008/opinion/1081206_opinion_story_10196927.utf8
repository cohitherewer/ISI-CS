	Unequal partners                  
	Sir  The Bengal government is indifferent to many things, including the plight of landlords in Calcutta. Those who rent out their homes often suffer at the hands of unscrupulous tenants. For instance, many tenants continue to pay meagre sums as rent that was agreed upon decades ago. The laws seem to be heavily in favour of the tenant and the slow pace of the legal machinery means that a judgement is passed after years of dispute. The state government must amend existing tenancy laws so that they treat both landlords and tenants equally.           
	Yours faithfully,        Soutiman Das Gupta, Navi Mumbai 
                  
	Collateral damage          
	Sir  The Mumbai terror attack has claimed many ordinary lives and a few heads have rolled in the corridors of power as well (Chidambaram replaces Patil, PM to look after finance, Dec 1). Natty dresser and former home minister, Shivraj Patil, was unceremoniously removed from his post. The Maharashtra deputy chief minister, R.R. Patil, who described the carnage as a small incident, resigned as well. When we have men like the two Patils holding important posts, do we really need foreign enemies? What India lacks are competent men to run the country. Barack Obama may have asked the world to stand by India in its war against terror, but we cannot expect others to fight our battles. Today, India is suffering because the Centre is soft on terror. The only choice left for Indians is to vote for an assertive government which is committed to crush Indias enemies.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Suryatmaj T., Mumbai 

                
	Sir  We may have got rid of Shivraj Patil but the time has come for citizens to demand a political system that will make politicians more accountable. It may be difficult to predict when terrorists will strike, but the people have a right to know what the security officials were doing after receiving inputs about an impending terror strike in the financial capital of India.           
	Yours faithfully,      
H. Jayantkumar Singh, Silchar 

                
	Sir  Confronted by an outraged nation following the Mumbai attacks and amid fears of reversal in an election season, a rattled Union government has gone into damage-control mode.The home minister, Shivraj Patil, and a few other leaders have resigned. Patil, unlike the others, was left with very little choice. Isolated by his party colleagues and pilloried by opponents for his continuing poor performance, he had to give up on the chair he so loved.           
	Yours faithfully,         J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad 
                
	Sir  Shivraj Patil deserved to be shown the door. Vilasrao Deshmukh and his deputy, R.R. Patil, should have been summarily dismissed instead of being allowed to resign. Those responsible for the intelligence failure should not be spared either.           
	There is now a new man heading the home ministry. The primary challenge facing P. Chidambaram is to ensure greater cooperation between Central and state security agencies. What the country needs is a home minister who will inspire confidence in the people and put down terror with an iron hand. What is also required is not another Pota but a federal agency to root out terror from this land. One only hopes that our corrupt politicians will not create problems while this new organization is being set up. The entire security apparatus needs to be revamped to tackle this new face of terror. What needs to be remembered is that the security system must be allowed to work independently to rule out the chances of a blame game to recur. Terror can only be defeated if citizens and politicians have the nations interests in their minds.          
	Yours faithfully,        B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

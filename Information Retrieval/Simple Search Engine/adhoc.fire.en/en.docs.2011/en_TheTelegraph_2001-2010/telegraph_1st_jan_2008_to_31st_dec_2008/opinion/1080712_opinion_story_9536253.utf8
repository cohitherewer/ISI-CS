	Though the Left Fronts exit  a good riddance for Manmohan Singh  may save the nuclear deal, it alone will not save the government and country from a drift that has forced India down to the bottom of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) league in terms of growth, and prompted foreign investors who invested $19 billion here last year to withdraw $5.5 billion during the first six months of 2008.        
	Now is Manmohan Singhs opportunity to live up to his image of the apolitical economist driven not by party or personal ambition but by the desire to modernize India. He knows better than anyone else that, caught in the excitement of the debate over the nuclear deal and still drunk on yesterdays heady growth figures, we have overlooked Indias sharply swooping international standing. The subprime crisis is partly responsible for the flow of foreign funds drying up and the soaring global price of oil for inflation, but official timidity is really to blame. The prime minister knows that, for all its obduracy, the Left Front would not so easily have got away with blackmail if influential portions of the Congress were not also allergic to drastic economic measures. Some fear the political consequences; others fear the response of business houses whose influence has grown enormously in recent years. The combined effect is that, instead of striking out boldly on promised reforms, the government has been falling back on programmes that bear the propagandist hallmark of garibi hatao. Even now, reports indicate an obsession with the Bharat Nirman, rural job guarantee and supplementary nutrition schemes to curry favour with voters.              
	There is no guarantee that the Samajwadi Party or the hotch-potch members of parliament who are being wooed to make up numbers will be more enlightened than backwoods Congressmen and communists. If these new allies are offered ministerial berths to ensure loyalty, they are even more likely to prefer populist policies to economic pragmatism to spin out their enjoyment of the perks of office for as long as possible. But as horses are traded and heads counted, the prime minister must not forget that the Chinese word for crisis is made up of two ideograms, one standing for danger and the other for opportunity. The danger is self-evident. Though all but diehard loyalists will agree that the fall of one government is never a calamity in a parliamentary democracy, the collapse of the 123 agreement would isolate India in the nuclear wilderness where it can only proceed surreptitiously like Iran or be content with keeping its potency under wraps like Israel. That is a danger that everyone, especially an organization like the Bharatiya Janata Party that wears its nationalism on its sleeve, should want to avoid. But its the opportunity inherent in every crisis that commands attention, for now, at last, Manmohan Singh can push ahead with all the measures that he has been prevented from taking these past four years.        
	There were plans for 30 special economic zones and 1,500 universities, for the disposal of the governments stake in profitable public sector undertakings, for rational labour laws and liberal rules to attract foreign direct investment in the retail trade, insurance and banking. It is gratifying that Canara Bank should open a branch in Shanghai and Reliance Assets Management set up shop in London, but flying the flag abroad feeds Indias ego, not her stomach. Corus, NatSteel and Arcelor have as little bearing on domestic conditions as that one-time boast that the Nizam of Hyderabad was the worlds richest man. His dead money was no different from the expatriate wealth of todays tycoons.        
	The vigorous productivity we need at home demands the enabling economic system that Manmohan Singh visualized when he became finance minister in 1991 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee did much to realize after 1998. Manmohan Singh was expected to carry the process further in 2004 which he did, but not to the extent he wanted and others expected. Employment growth has been almost stagnant, rising to just two per cent in a country where an estimated 14 million youths enter the workforce every year, but just a million get jobs. When West Bengal tried to break the impasse after decades of stagnation, the chief minister found himself caught between the disapproval of his party bosses in Delhi and the turbulence of his followers in Singur and Nandigram.        
	Land acquisition will remain an intractable problem if authority insists on invoking archaic laws meant for a national purpose only to shield businessmen  not peasants  from the price mechanism. That makes a mockery of the free market. It also draws attention to the pitiable state of agriculture. A recent Goldman Sachs report stated that Indias rice yields are a third those of China and half of Vietnams. While 60 per cent of the labour force is employed in agriculture, farming contributes less than one per cent to overall growth. So, why should Ram Vilas Paswan boast of squandering an awesome Rs 50,204 crore on subsidizing fertilizer, or P. Chidambaram take pride in waiving loans of Rs 71,680 crore  the largest ever  for farmers? These colossal outlays yield little except a huge rural constituencys presumed gratitude. Last year when inflation was only three per cent, a Standard amp; Poor report urged New Delhi to start cutting subsidies, which include 60 per cent of the price of fuels like diesel. Even subsidies would be less burdensome if governance improves, educational standards are raised, inflation is controlled, wasteful expenditure reduced, and a ramshackle infrastructure modernized. Japan wants to divert investment from China but is deterred by the appalling state of Indias roads, transport, power, communications and ports.        
	Even the governments Economic Survey for 2007-08 suggests that many import duties should be abolished and export promotion schemes either also abolished or streamlined. It recommends further liberalization of exchange control rules so that companies and individuals do not need Reserve Bank sanction to convert rupees into foreign currency or vice versa. Apart from increasing the inflow of money into India, this will make it easier for local companies to extend operations overseas. It would also help non-resident Indians, who still complain of rules that seem extremely liberal to those of us who grew up with rigorous control as the norm, but are restrictive by world standards. The survey also suggests that trade can be increased by entering into more comprehensive economic cooperation agreements, including with developed countries. Indias only CECA now is with Singapore; it provides Indians with a launching pad for the world, and the world with an entre into India, but would be much more effective in both respects with supportive legislation and generous interpretation.              
	Traditionally, India opposed liberalization because of a distrust of the price mechanism, faith in the ethical efficacy of administrative controls, belief in self-reliance which militated against foreign trade, suspicion of foreign capital, the power of unions and the equally formidable might of crony capitalism. Vested interests and doctrinaire politics killed the start Indira Gandhi made in 1980, Rajiv Gandhis bold experiment in 1985-86 and P.V. Narasimha Raos Look East initiative after 1994. Arun Shouries zeal for privatization as the BJP governments disinvestment minister prompted opponents to accuse him of corrupt practices.         
	But the part the prime minister and Praful Patel played in ending the four-day strike against Delhi airports privatization also showed that firmness pays. Having demonstrated that again over the nuclear agreement, Manmohan Singh needs to seize his chance and keep up the momentum of reform. Its the only way of narrowing the gulf with China, disproving the Merrill Lynch executive who said India has gone from hero to zero in six months and ensuring that growth and not inflation is in double digits. He doesnt have much time left.

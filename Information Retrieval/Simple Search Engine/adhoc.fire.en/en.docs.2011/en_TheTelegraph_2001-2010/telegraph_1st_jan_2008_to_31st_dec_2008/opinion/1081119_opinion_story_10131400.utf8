The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not on firm ground
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             NOT ON FIRM GROUND                                  Though apparently people-friendly, the Land Acquisition (amendment) Bill, 2007, leaves many contentious issues unresolved, finds Shabina Akhtar                          Acres of adversity: The Tata project at Singur was abandoned due to land acquisition issues				                                 
	The acquisition of private land for public purposes has always been fraught with controversy. The recent outcry over the proposed industrial projects in Singur and Nandigram in West Bengal, and in other places in the country where the government plans to set up Special Economic Zones (SEZs), has thrown the issue even more sharply into relief. Last year, the UPA government reacted to the prevailing debate over land acquisition by recommending an amendment to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Land Acquisition (amendment) Bill, 2007, (which was presented along with The Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2007) was sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development for its suggestions. It is now scheduled to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament.        
	Land acquisition refers to the power vested with the government to acquire private property for public purposes. After Independence, the right to property became a fundamental right under Article 31 of the Constitution. But in 1978, a constitutional amendment deleted this as a fundamental right. Instead, it inserted Article 300A, which stated that no person shall be deprived of his property save by the authority of law. This beefed up the already existing law, which conferred upon the central and state governments the right to acquire land for public purposes.        
	The Land Acquisition (amendment) Bill, 2007, proposes to amend the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, by defining the term public purpose as land acquired for defence purposes, infrastructure building or any project that would be beneficial to the general public. It specifies that the government will help acquire 30 per cent of the total land required after the company or the body has purchased 70 per cent of the land from willing sellers.        
	The rationale is that if a company buys the land through private negotiations on a willing seller to willing buyer basis, the government can then negotiate with unwilling landowners to acquire the residual land.         
	The bill also proposes that a social impact assessment study be conducted in case of large-scale displacement of local dwellers. It stipulates that the acquisition costs should include payment for loss, damages and cost related to the resettlement of displaced residents. The bill recommends that the current market price of the land be assessed before deciding on the compensation package for residents. It also makes it mandatory for each state to establish the Land Acquisition Compensation Dispute Settlement Authority (LACDSA).        
	But though the bill has been touted as being people-friendly, not everyone is happy with it. The West Bengal government, human rights activists and many non-governmental organisations feel that the bill needs to be reviewed afresh before tabling it in Parliament.        
	The West Bengal government, for instance, is not happy with the fact that the bill asks the government to acquire 30 per cent of the land needed, leaving industry to purchase 70 per cent of the land directly from sellers. Says the states land and land reform minister, Abdur Rezzak Mullah, We feel that the state should be allowed to acquire cent per cent of the land. This would help in protecting the farmers from land sharks.        
	There is a reason for West Bengal taking issue with the 70-30 ratio of land acquisition. The land reform undertaken in the state in the late seventies resulted in small plots of land being given to the underprivileged. This led to the fragmentation of the land. The owners of these small plots create a problem when the state tries to acquire huge tracts of land for development purposes. Hence, the condition of industrialists purchasing 70 per cent of the land and then seeking the governments aid to get the residual 30 per cent will definitely create problems, says Anshunath Banerjee, senior government advocate, West Bengal.        
	Many investors feel the same way. The percentage specification shouldnt be mandatory. It should be left to the state authority to acquire the land. Getting the land from owners could be problematic as it involves tackling land sharks, small-time politicians or individuals wanting to sell land at a price higher than the market value, says Rajendra Pratap Singh, chief executive officer, Jindal South West Steel Ltd, Jharkhand.        
	However, not all industrialists share the view that the state should be vested with cent per cent acquisition rights. If we can get 70 per cent of the land, then why cant we get the entire plot of land? Besides, if we encounter any resistance, we can always approach the government. I personally feel that this specification of percentage would create a problem, says Arun Nanda, executive director, Mahindra and Mahindra. Incidentally, the company has managed to get cent percent land on its own for its SEZs in Chennai and Jaipur.        
	While industrialists are unhappy with the proposed system for land acquisition, many activists feel that the Act is inherently flawed. The law needs to specify the compensation package for those being displaced. Cent percent rehabilitation of those being displaced by the application of this Act is what we want, says an agitated Guman Singh, co-ordinator, Himalayan Policy Campaign Committee, Himachal Pradesh, which has been campaigning for those displaced by hydel power projects in the state.        
	Others demand that the law should ban development projects on agricultural land. Sujato Bhadra, a senior activist of the Calcutta-based NGO, Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights (APDR), says, We want the existing law to be modified in such a way that industrialists or the government dont seize agricultural tracts. And even if it does, it should do so with the informed consent of those being affected. That apart, instead of a one time monetary compensation, they should be given adequate job opportunities and rehabilitation.         
	Of course, rehabilitation itself is a highly contentious issue. Says Banerjee, One needs to understand that seeking cent per cent rehabilitation is impractical. Take the example of Damodar Valley Corporation. A lot of the displaced were rehabilitated. But there are so many cases still pending.        
	Banerjee also foresees problems in getting the LACDSA to sort out compensation disputes. The bill states that the LACDSA staff need not have any judicial qualification, meaning that the officials may not be lawyers or judges. I feel that the competence of such a body in handling these issues is questionable.        
	Evidently, this is one contentious bill that will be debated furiously before it is passed.

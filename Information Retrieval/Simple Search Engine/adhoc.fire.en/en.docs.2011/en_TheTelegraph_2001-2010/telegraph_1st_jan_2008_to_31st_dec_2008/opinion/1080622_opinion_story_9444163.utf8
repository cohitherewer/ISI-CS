The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | twas a famous victory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TWAS A FAMOUS VICTORY                                                          
	If any follower of cricket were to be asked to locate the high noon of Indian cricket, the answer would inevitably be the Indian teams victory in the World Cup in 1983. Even those purists who scoff at the one-day variety of the game will not disagree with this verdict. As the silver jubilee of that famous victory nears, it is not free of a dash of incredibility. For one thing, no one gave India a chance when the tournament began. Even when India went to the finals, the common opinion  save that of the die-hard Indian patriot  was that Clive Lloyds juggernaut  then the best cricket team in the world in any form of the game  would ride over the Indian side without a show of pity or mercy. Such predictions seemed to be confirmed when India was dismissed for a paltry 183 runs. The Caribbeans seemed destined to romp home, much to the delight of the bookies. The Indian team under Kapil Dev proved just about everyone wrong.        
	Was it a fluke? Most historians of cricket would answer the question in the negative. There had been signs in that very World Cup that India might bring about a major upset. Think of Indias victory, thanks to a superlative innings by Kapil Dev, against Zimbabwe after being five down for a mere 17. There were other performances by the Indian side in the course of that tournament which were also outstanding. What is most important is that on that fateful afternoon at Lords, when it mattered most, India played better cricket than Lloyds men, who were somewhat over-confident on that occasion. As the underdog and the under-performer (with only 183 runs to defend), India bowled and fielded flawlessly. West Indian arrogance and Indian excellence have been memorialized in that contemptuous pull shot of Vivian Richards, which sent a Madan Lal delivery high over midwicket, and Kapil Dev went back to take the catch running full tilt. It was the catch of a lifetime, which won India the World Cup and the respect of the entire cricketing world.        
	The legacy of that victory is incalculable. It conveyed the message that Indians could win, and could do so against the best and against all odds. Looking back, this confidence was derived also from the achievements of two Indian cricketers  Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, both of whom have earned their place among the all-time greats of cricket. This is not to take away from the team effort that produced the World Cup triumph, but to place it in a different and a slightly long-term context. The players in 1983 were not pampered as todays cricketers are, and did not enjoy the kind of media hype and public frenzy that is prevalent today. In fact, in this regard too, the 1983 win set a trend.        
	The silver anniversary is an occasion to salute the heroes of that victory, and to recall some of them who are languishing in oblivion.

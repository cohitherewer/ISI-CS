	Investment, John Maynard Keynes memorably said, is an act of faith. This confidence to put ones money in a business venture located in a particular country is determined by a number of factors. One such factor is a sense of security. This might appear, at first glance, to mean something that is too intangible, but can in fact be substantiated in terms of perceived threats to property and capital. The stability of a political dispensation is a measure of the safety of property and the prospects of growth of capital. A recent study shows that India faces the highest political and social risk among Asia-Pacific countries in 2009. The main reason for this is the looming shadow of internal instability. Indias risk score was 6.87 on a scale of 10. Thailand with a score of 6.28 is a second, with Malayasia bringing up a third. Not surprisingly, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia were ranked most stable in terms of political regimes and therefore low in political risk for 2009.        
	There are a number of significant points in this study. For one thing, those countries that are considered low risk are not taken to be immune from the ongoing global economic crisis. Despite the crisis, these countries are considered to be politically and internally stable. India is not considered thus for one principal reason: fears over Pakistan. The study put forward the proposition that uncertainty over Indias relationship with Pakistan would adversely affect the climate of investment in India. The failure to resolve the Indo-Pak problem, and the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism in Pakistan could hinder businessmen from investing in India. Another point to note is the projected date of the study: 2009. It is the year general elections are due in India. This inevitably raises the spectre of change in political regimes. Given the prevailing political circumstances in India, the prospect of change cannot be denied as something utterly unreal. The study takes into account two other factors that are very relevant for India: one is social activism and the other the possibility of policy changes by a new government. Mamata Banerjees agitation against the Nano plant in Singur revealed the dangers of social activism; and the continued presence of Left rhetoric in Indian politics suggests that all aspects of liberalization cannot be taken as a fait accompli in India. India is still now not a stable investment destination.

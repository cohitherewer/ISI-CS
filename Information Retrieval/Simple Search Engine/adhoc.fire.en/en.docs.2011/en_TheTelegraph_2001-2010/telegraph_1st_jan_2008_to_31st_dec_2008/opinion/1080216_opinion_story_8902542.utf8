	Visa power, or the lack of it                  
	Sir  There is nothing out of the ordinary in the government of India telling a visa applicant that she should not do anything that either affects our relations with other countries or causes hurt to our secular ethos (Taslima visa with caution, Feb 15). Doesnt this go without saying  not just for India but for most countries? If it is true that only Taslima Nasreen was told this, does it imply that the others who are granted Indian visa can get away with hurting our secular ideals? It is a matter of greater concern that Nasreen has been asked to stay put in Delhi.          
	Yours faithfully,        Shonali Sengupta, Calcutta
        
	Spare the child          
	Sir  One should learn from Meenakshy Kutty how to deal with erring children. Instead of taking recourse to corporal punishment, a popular means of disciplining children, she caned herself ruthlessly until the culprit owned up (Teacher canes herself, kids confess, Feb 1). She has chosen to lead by example. For most of us, torturing the suspect is the most convenient option. To put ourselves in the shoes of the accused, and punish ourselves for a crime committed by someone else is unthinkable for us.           
	But Meenakshy Kutty dared to be different. After this incident, it might be possible for her to banish corporal punishment from her school altogether. In sharp contrast to Kuttys act, a young child was stripped and thrashed for petty theft in Behrampore in Bengal (Little thief, Feb 4). What purpose does such humiliation serve? If anything, such a beating would provoke the child to become a rebel. Justice was the end in each of these two cases, but the means to achieving it were starkly different.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Barnali Roy, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Meenakshy Kutty, headmistress of the Government Model Residential School in Idukki, has laid the foundations of a punishment-free school. Her behaviour should be emulated by teachers across the country. Law alone is not sufficient to stop cruelty towards children in schools. An atmosphere of compassion and mutual understanding has to be created by the teachers themselves.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                          
	No place on board          
	Sir  Recently, I went on a holiday with my family to the Andaman and Nicobar islands. From Port Blair, we travelled to Havelock Island. We had confirmed tickets on the ship named MV Dering. For the return journey from Havelock to Port Blair on February 10, we made our reservations in advance from Port Blair, on the ship MV Wandoor. But on reaching the jetty, we found that port employees were letting unauthorized passengers board the ship in exchange for money. There were about 130 people on the jetty although the ship had a seating capacity of only 100. The officials could not care less whether the persons boarding the ship had valid tickets or not.           
	Once 100 passengers were on board, an official rudely informed that he would not take in any more as the ships capacity was full. We, and a few others with advance reservation, were made to stand on the jetty. There being no other mode of transport to Port Blair and on account of our booked flight the very next day, we pleaded for half an hour with the ships captain to let us board. Finally we were given permission. But I cannot forgive or forget the harassment and humiliation that I was subjected to (I had my septuagenarian parents and three-year-old daughter with me) for half an hour by the thoroughly corrupt and whimsical officials of the Havelock port and M.V. Wandoor. I want to warn all tourists to the Andamans about the dangers posed by these dishonest officers while visiting the enchanting islands.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Basu, Durgapur

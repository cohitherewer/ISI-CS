	For Jharkhand, stability has always seemed peculiarly elusive. It is not enough that the state was born out of a long, blood-soaked struggle, the aspirations of its people are still a long way from achieving some kind of fulfilment. Betrayals, mini-coups and constant competition for power and money among its politicians have repeatedly stalled the process of development. The Maoists have not helped. Now it is the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha president, Shibu Soren, who has decided it is time he had a big piece of the pie. Having failed to continue as chief minister for more than nine days the last time, he is determined that Madhu Koda, the present chief minister and an independent, should make way for him. Mr Soren seems to think somehow that this is the least he deserves after having supported the United Progressive Alliance government at its moment of crisis. So the Congress, he feels, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, both of which make up the coalition with the JMM and independents to govern Jharkhand, should support him in his bid for the unbudgeable Mr Kodas chair.        
	Mr Soren has chosen a good time to throw his tantrum. By trying to put the UPA on the back foot the Communist Party of India (Marxist) may not have got what it wanted, but it has certainly encouraged an escalation of pressure tactics and unscrupulous haggling. The Congress has so far managed to keep its composure, suggesting that it will support Mr Soren if he wins the other independent candidates to his side. Mr Soren has failed so far. It is not clear whether the ministerial berth waiting for Mr Soren at the Centre should he fail to get into the chief ministers chair is a palliative, a secret promise, or a figment of Mr Sorens over-excited imagination. If nothing works, and both Mr Koda and Mr Soren mess up their numbers, presidents rule with fresh assembly elections will be the only sensible, and the cleanest, solution. But these dramatics have made more obvious than ever before the tremendous price that the people pay for their leaders irresponsibility and greed. Investments amounting to Rs 60,000 crore were at last becoming a possibility for the state, with the new resettlement and rehabilitation policy having taken shape. With politicians once again engaged in pulling the carpets from beneath one anothers feet, the people will have to wait longer for development to happen.

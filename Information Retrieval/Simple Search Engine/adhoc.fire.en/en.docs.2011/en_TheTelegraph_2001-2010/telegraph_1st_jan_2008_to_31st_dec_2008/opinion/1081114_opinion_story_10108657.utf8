The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A euphoria of hype
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A EUPHORIA OF HYPE                          - Obama is naturally elitist, and therefore naturally liberal        Swapan Dasgupta                                                  
	In his tribute to Jawaharlal Nehru a few days after his death in May 1964, the former British prime minister, Clement Atlee, wrote that the Indian leader understood power and he understood poetry but what he didnt see was where one began and the other left off. As President-elect Barack Obama prepares to assume responsibility as the next head of State of the worlds most powerful country, it is pertinent to ask whether in four or eight years from now contemporaries will equate him with a Roosevelt or Reagan, or charge him with transforming a euphoria of hope into a euphoria of hype.        
	In many ways, Obamas spectacular victory on November 4 owed much to both poetry and a shrewd grasp of power politics. In his election rallies that increasingly came to resemble rock concerts, Obamas appeal was inspirational, to the point of being messianic. With three simple words, Yes we can, he unleashed the untapped energies of the affluent enlightened and the liberal campuses, and blended it with the most symbolic of black American aspirations. The sheer headiness of Obama-mania even prompted the historian, Simon Schama, to identify the moment American democracy came back from the dead.        
	Obama bolstered his natural oratory and way with words with an innovative election-machine built on small donations and hyper-enthusiasm. Superimposed on the traditional Democratic vote, he crafted a winning coalition that could well be as path-breaking as the one that ensured three successive terms for the Republicans from 1980.              
	Obama has undoubtedly galvanized the United States of America, inspired Europeans and broken the glass ceiling of gushiness in the English-speaking world. To therefore suggest that he has turned the power structure of the US upside down and shown a new light to the all the oppressed peoples  Manmohan Singhs anodyne remark during the grudging telephone call from Chicago  is letting hyperbolism prevail over cold realism. Never mind his invocation of the civil rights movement and his antecedents in a church that he had to subsequently disown; Obamas proximity to black power politics is only nominally more profound than that of, say, Condoleezza Rice. As a full-time politician from a humble background Obama certainly has more of the common touch than the aloof and cerebral Rice. But neither is politically wedded to ethnicity. Celebrating the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King no longer has the same polarizing effect it did during the Sixties and Seventies; they are part of the American consensus.        
	The projection of Obama as a revolutionary on account of his blackness is a caricatured version of an America that persists in strange places  the unreconstructed quarters of Dixieland and among radical anti-imperialists in the third world. America, like any other place, still nurtures prejudices, but it is empirically difficult to sustain the argument that race overwhelms everything else politically. If that was the case, it is difficult to imagine the conservative Bobby Jindal holding his own in the electoral jungle of Louisiana. Indeed, the last time race assumed some importance in the US presidential election was in 1968 when the Alabama governor, George Wallace, fought as a white candidate and won five southern states. If Obama had projected himself as a black version of Wallace  as some innocents abroad seem to believe  his success would have been limited to the district of Columbia.        
	It is interesting that during the long campaign that began with the primaries, Obama came under serious fire on two occasions. The first, centred on his membership of a church with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a radical black pastor, was serious enough for him to leave the congregation as a form of damage limitation. Fortunately for him, this evasive action proved adequate and his gentlemanly Republican rival chose not to make an issue of Obamas dubious association.        
	The second controversy was more revealing. In a speech on small-town attitudes in Pennsylvania on April 11, Obama thought it not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy towards people who arent like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to express their frustrations. What is interesting about this speech, delivered in a rare moment of unguarded frustration, is that it articulates what most seemingly enlightened liberals in cosmopolitan surroundings actually think about Rednecks, Hillbillies and other unfamiliar provincials. It comes remarkably close to Nehrus frequent outbursts against businessmen, Hindus, the American way and other aesthetic pinpricks on his rarefied sensibilities. Obama may arguably say Yo brother to a fellow black. He may even agonize over the puzzle of being a black man in his autobiography. But just as Nehru occasionally bowed to Indian spirituality and conjured images of the timelessness of India, these are affectations that make for good politics.        
	As befits his education and political inclinations, Obama is naturally elitist (an attribute that must not be confused with privilege), naturally superior in a very Boston Brahmin sort of way and, therefore, naturally liberal. His appeal also matches his self-image. As the British Tory commentator, Charles Moore, wrote sarcastically, If you are black, obviously Obama interests you. If you are white and feel unthreatened, successful and like to think of yourself as open-minded, he is your man.        
	It is no accident that the greatest adulation for Obama outside the US was in Europe  omit the boisterous celebration in a Kikuyu village in Kenya. It is the liberal cosmopolitanism of the president-elect that captivated the crowds at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin earlier in the summer. They who could never come to terms with President George W. Bushs Texan provincialism and the hard-nosed realism of Dick Cheney wanted to repose faith in a modern European version of the American dream  that which stressed the cultural alienation of the enemy, that which abjured exceptionalism for multilateralism and that which seemingly upheld the post-War generations rejection of national histories.              
	Europeans have chosen to paint Obama in their own image but, at the end of the day, the president-elect is an American committed to the belief that he could happen only in America. If he chooses multilateralism over Bush-Cheney patriotism, it is because it suits an exhausted America that no longer has the grit and determination to shoulder the global burden by itself. Actually, even Bush realized this  a reason why he was so anxious to outsource some of its Asian obligations to a rising India, even if that meant bending the global nuclear rules.        
	Obamas imperialism is different. Like many of those in the Bill Clinton administration who are bound to be accommodated in the new dispensation, he wants a world-order based on pooled sovereignty and international agreements on trade, climate change and non-proliferation. Presided over, naturally, by the US, this multilateral vision appeals to countries in the European Union that have transcended the nation-state. Unfortunately, it is likely to meet with resistance from rising powers such as Russia, Iran, China and India who believe that freezing the status quo will subvert the cycle of history. In a tug-of-war between nationalism and post-nationalism, Obama is unlikely to be as flexible and accommodating as President Bush. India is aware of this, which is why the thrust of Indian diplomacy in the coming months will be on educating Obama.         
	This may well be an exercise in futility. Politician Obama will not be able to renege on the impulses of those who nurtured and sustained his journey to the White House. Not in his first term.

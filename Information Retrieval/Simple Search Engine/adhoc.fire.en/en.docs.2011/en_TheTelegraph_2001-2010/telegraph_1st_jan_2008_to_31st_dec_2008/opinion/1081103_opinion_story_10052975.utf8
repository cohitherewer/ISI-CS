	Maldivians are fast learners. Equipped with the political tools their three-decade-old ruler, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, conceded only about three years ago after prolonged public protests, they have dealt him a severe blow. In a historic runoff that followed the inconclusive elections in early October, Maldivians replaced Mr Gayoom with Mohammed Nasheed, a former political prisoner of the Gayoom regime, as the arbiter of their destiny. The change has not happened in a vacuum. The opposition to Mr Gayooms rule, extended repeatedly by self-election, was built up by a carefully constructed movement. It not only shaped public opinion powerfully against the autocratic regime, but also sustained international pressure through the media against the regimes human rights violations. Mr Nasheed has been the face of this movement. His battle against the regime despite his political incarceration has inspired comparisons with Nelson Mandela. The popular verdict in Maldives is also an expression of the immense trust placed in Mr Nasheed and the belief in his ability to steer the country towards a better future.         
	Although one of the strongest motivators of the political change in Maldives, this could prove to be the bane of its nascent democracy if Maldivians let their emotions get the better of them. The economic transformation of Maldives, the fruits of which benefit 60 per cent of its people, resulted from the hard-nosed policies of the former regime. To keep that going while combating Maldives problems with drug addiction and inequitable distribution of wealth will be a tough call for Mr Nasheed, who lacks Mr Gayooms political experience. He will also have to deal with the vested interests that have accumulated in the last 30 years. Mr Gayoom, generously conceding defeat, is perhaps banking on Mr Nasheeds possible failure to reclaim his authority. Mr Nasheed has to stay true to the fundamentals of democracy to stave off that fate. And Maldivians have to ensure that he does.

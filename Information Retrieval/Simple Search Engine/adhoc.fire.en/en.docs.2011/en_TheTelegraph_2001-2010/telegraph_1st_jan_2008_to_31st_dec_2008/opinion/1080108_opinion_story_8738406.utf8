	Discussion first
         
	Sir  Amartya Sen advocates high-cost rapid industrialization for the reduction of poverty in West Bengal (Developments in West Bengal, Dec 29 and 30). He also cites the example of Cuba, with its modest to moderate investment in the agriculture and service sectors, as a more desirable alternative to the Chinese model. With the export of predominantly agricultural merchandise, the per capita gross domestic product of Cubans rose from $3,100 in 1997 to $6,000 in 2005 in terms of purchasing power parity. Rapid industrialization, as we have seen in China, entails a large human cost  something that West Bengal does not seem ready to pay. In any case, the state is not prepared yet for industrialization in terms of the human resources required (even by Indian standards). The states share in the number of students in engineering and post-graduate science courses is still below 6 per cent of the all-India figures, even though it accounts for 8 per cent of the population. 
     
	Also, it may take decades to reduce the large workforce in agriculture and allied sectors through industrialization. During this time, there is no option but to depend on the agricultural sector  maybe in the way Cuba has done  for the uplift of the rural people. After all, World Bank emphasizes that GDP growth generated in agriculture has large benefits for the poor and is twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth generated by other sectors.

	Sir  Some very valid points have been raised by Amartya Sen in his two-part essay. But it is difficult to understand why he keeps mum on the arbitrariness of and complete lack of transparency in land-acquisition deals as in Singur. The principal opposition party, Sen has claimed, seems keener on shutting down the town of Singur than on finding a way out of the impasse. But the ruling neo-Left is not an example of government by discussion either. The trouble in Nandigram broke out when an overzealous Communist Party of India (Marxist) member of parliament issued a technically faulty and legally unenforcable writ ordering acquisitions; he is yet to apologize for his high-handedness. It is actions like this which create the impression that violence is the only way to get ones message across in todays Bengal. Acquisitions in Nandigram stopped only when met with violent resistance. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There is almost nothing in Amartya Sens back-to-back articles with which one can seriously disagree. I am more concerned about things Sen has not addressed, such as certain important issues relating to Singur. Land was acquired in Singur with considerable government money and then leased out to the Tatas at a much subsidized rate. Other than this, a lot of subsidies have been offered in the form of VAT waiver, electricity duty exemption and loan at 1 per cent interest. Does the Tata group need this kind of government support at a time when they are acquiring global giants like Corus with their own funds? 
     
	Second, paying subsidy to an industry where the pricing is controlled by the government is one thing (for instance, the pharmaceutical industry or a hospital). But subsidizing an automobile manufacturer is just not done. The automobile market is hugely competitive. If the West Bengal government showers such benefits on the Tatas, doesnt it put the others like Hyundai or Maruti at a comparative disadvantage? Why should a state government help Tata fight its competitors? These subsidies will after all reduce the total capital outlay of the Tatas and consequently bring down their interest burden substantially. This will reduce cost of production. But will Tata then reduce the price of its car? Unlikely. It will increase its profit. If this improves the groups financial position, then the West Bengal government will have to be given all the credit. This, I presume, is not a desirable state of affairs. One feels sad to see the Tatas, which even in the heady days of subsidy and socialism never cared about government blessings, reduced to this.
     
	Of course, Amartya Sen is right. It is necessary to shift from agriculture to industry, and a group like the Tatas can help. Remember that a railway station came up in Hind Motor on the strength of a single automobile industry. But the government must stop at being a facilitator.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Amartya Sen feels that government by discussion is one of the basic foundations of a democratic set-up, and that the Left Front government has been found wanting in this while going about its industrialization programme. I have some questions here.
     
	One, in Singur, about ten meetings were called by the district administration so that the political parties could reach a consensus at the local level. Trinamul Congress, the main opposition party, and one or two others boycotted these meetings. The Trinamul chief, Mamata Banerjee, declined repeated offers of dialogue from the chief minister. What would Sen suggest be done in situations like this?
     
	Two, in Nandigram, the location of the now-aborted chemical hub was not chosen arbitrarily, but on the recommendations of a multi-party committee, some of whose members later washed their hands of it. Can Amartya Sen suggest ways to handle an opposition which refuses to take responsibility for its actions? 
     
	Yours faithfully,

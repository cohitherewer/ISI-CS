                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NUMBERED TO PERFECTION                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - Khushwant Singh      
	At times, I marvel at my navet. I read the morning papers carefully but find nothing very amusing in the news items. But no sooner the same item is reproduced in the Funny Old World column of the Private Eye magazine, coming out of London, I see its funny side. This one was on the prevalence of belief in numerology in India. Numerology is one of those hocus pocus superstitions like astrology, Vastu, Feng Shui, gemology and many others, which have many takers even among the highly educated. They believe that if you change the number of your house, or add an extra letter or two to your name, your fortunes will take an upward swing. I have two names in mind: Jayalalitha added an extra a to her name to become Jayalalithaa; so did Shobha De, to become Shobhaa. There is no evidence of their benefiting by the additional as. Perhaps it improved their digestion and reduced gas in their bellies; only they can tell. But this news item, which appeared in The Hindustan Times on September 18 this year, is about belief in numerology in Bollywood, which is singularly asinine in its belief in the occult. It reads:        
	Its true there is no scientific proof whatsoever that numerology actually works, film producer Vipul Amrutlal Shah admitted to reporters at a studio in Mumbai. But it is a vital science here in Bollywood. Every studio now-a-days employs numerologists to add, subtract, or rearrange the letters in film titles, and in the names of actors, so that they are astrologically sound, because this is a high-risk business with millions of dollars at stake. Thats why I support plans for Bollywood to open an official school of numerology to train practitioners, just as we train our directors, actors and film-makers.        
	Numerologist Sanjay B. Jumaani then explained how the science works. I was recently asked to advise on the title of a film called Singh is King and told them to add an extra n so the letters added up to a lucky number. They did so, and Singh is Kinng grossed $15 million in its opening week. I also had success by adding an extra r in Krrish and two extra ys in Heyy Babyy, so my record speaks for itself. Yet incredibly, there are no schools devoted to numerology, and training currently all depends on personal experience. So you see, it is not madness. My success rate with movies is over 80 per cent, and while my scientific expertise cannot turn a bad film into a box office hit, I can at least guarantee to reduce losses.                
	A dancer with a cause                
	About seven years ago, R.K. Hegde asked me over for dinner at his MPs bungalow in Delhi. I had enjoyed his hospitality in Bangalore when he was the chief minister of Karnataka. I held him in high esteem and felt that he would one day become the prime minister of India; I was eager to keep up with him.         
	We were having our first drink when a young lady with her little twins glided in. The boys seemed to know their way round the house and trotted off indoors. Hegde introduced me to the lady  Pratibha Prahlad, Bharatnatyam dancer. I had seen her pictures in the papers and read about her performances in India and abroad. Hegde didnt have to say anything more about her; I got the unspoken message  he wanted me to write about her in my columns.        
	I saw Pratibha dance in the India International Centre. She was one of a troupe  so I could not gauge the quality of her performance. Thereafter, I saw her a few times with her sons in the Lodhi Gardens. When age made me homebound, I lost track of her. Now she has re-emerged on my horizon as the dancer-cum-organizer of the Delhi International Arts Festival. She is the founder president of Prasiddha, which will coordinate dance, music and stage performances for three weeks in December at different venues of the city. She has managed to get about 50 countries to send artists to participate in the celebrations. It is a huge undertaking needing a staff of co-ordinators, cooperation of the state government, the ministry of tourism, cultural organizations like the ICCR, the Akademies, foreign embassies, hotels and patrons of arts. And lots of money.        
	It is sad to see that though India has taken giant strides in developing its economy and in scientific research, it does not have a modern theatre exclusively meant to stage plays or orchestral performances, which need the latest acoustic equipment. We have to make do with auditoriums meant for hosting lectures and showing films. I hope Pratibha Prahlad will also become the pioneer of permanent theatres in the country.                          Answered prayers       
	Unlikely believers                
	In a small town in India, a person decided to open a bar right opposite to a temple. The temple and its congregation started a campaign to block the bar from opening, and prayed daily against the business. Work progressed. However, when it was almost complete and was about to open in a few days time, a strong lightening struck the bar and it was burnt to the ground. The temple folks were rather smug in their outlook after that, till the bar owner sued the temple authorities on the grounds that the temple, through its congregation and prayers, was ultimately responsible for the demise of his bar shop, either through direct or indirect means.        
	In its reply to the court, the temple authorities vehemently denied all responsibility, or any connection that their prayers might have with the bars demise. As the case made its way into the court, the judge looked over the paperwork at the hearing and commented, I dont know how Im going to decide this case, but it appears from the paperwork, we have a bar owner who believes in the power of prayer and we have an entire temple and its devotees that dont.

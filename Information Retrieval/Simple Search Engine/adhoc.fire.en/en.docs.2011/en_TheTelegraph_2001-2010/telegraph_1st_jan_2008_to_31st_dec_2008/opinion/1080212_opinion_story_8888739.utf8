                                                                                                              WHEN NOTHING MOVES                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The American election should teach us important lessons about reaching out and communicating, about the determination to win with no other agenda except to take the oath of office. We too are just a year away from a general election. But there is no sense of a fresh agenda, any combative debate, or a semblance of passion to deliver a better alternative to the people of India. Our political discourse in the realms of power and the visible political action are embarrassing, to say the least, but more importantly hopelessly inept both in ideas and commitment.         
	Our elected representatives do not represent the energy and entrepreneurship of our people but are public symbols of all that has gone wrong with India. Chaotic urban planning, administrative mismanagement and corruption in law enforcement have turned living in India into a nightmare. Honest individuals are compelled to behave and operate abnormally to make a failed system work, and yet try, within its confines, to be honest and nurture a new generation.         
	With every election, new and younger leaders are thrown up but they never seem to be given the responsibility that they deserve. This is clearly because the older leaders, men and women with no other expertise, who have been sitting at the top, isolated and incapacitated, hang on for dear life, manipulating and intriguing against each other and the top leadership. All of this is to ensure that no new people are empowered and nothing but the status quo maintained. These people need to be sent to pasture immediately. And pasture means retirement, not governorship.         
	The new generation of politicians need to swamp the television networks and enthuse the people of India with the distant possibility of ordered but rapid change  where nepotism has no place, where laws are simple, where the maze of addenda to existing laws ceases to confuse and to contribute to corruption, where honest work and living are celebrated.                
	The white ants        
	The oral tradition of communication is intrinsic to our cultures. Expertise and philosophies have thus been passed down through millennia. Television is the modern tool of this tradition, and needs to be used sensibly by those who govern us, as well as by those who intend to rule in the future. We need to comprehend their ideas on all issues that affect us. Only then can citizens responsibly join the exercise of nation-building with their elected representatives. The segregation of the citizens from the rulers and administrators is not democratic. It is dictatorial, verging on the colonial.        
	We are witnessing the deepening rot in our society each passing day, triggered and endorsed by parochial politics. The equality of Indian citizens is being openly challenged by some leaders who are inciting regional passions while the Union government, the election commission, the president and others remain stonily silent. This is frightening since it seems to smack of endorsement. Had Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi been around, they would have publicly damned such damaging rhetoric.         
	The ruling dispensation at the Centre, led by the Congress, needs to wake up and face the societal horror that is inching forward to soon overwhelm us. The problem is that 24 Akbar Road, the headquarters of the Congress, is infested with white ants that are nibbling into its body politic, destroying its foundation, allowing endless earthworms to weaken the soil and make the edifice fall. We, the larger public, know well who the worms and the ants in this game are. Why are these pests not swept away by the householder? There will never be any empirical evidence for the illegalities. Therefore, those who have had their innings should be dispensed with, and the party cleansed of the white ants to prepare for the polls.

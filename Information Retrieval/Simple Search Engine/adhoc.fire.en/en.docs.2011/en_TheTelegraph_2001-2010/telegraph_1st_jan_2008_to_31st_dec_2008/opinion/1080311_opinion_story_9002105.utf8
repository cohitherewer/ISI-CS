                                                                                                                 OF DIFFERENCES                                                    
	The spectacle of two rival formations claiming the right to form a government may seem to be the sign of a healthy democracy. But in Meghalaya the post-poll contest between the Congress, the single largest party to emerge from the assembly elections, and the non-Congress front being determinedly navigated by the Nationalist Congress Party leader, P.A. Sangma, is more a sign of unhealthy rivalries among politicians rather than a symptom of the divergent voices of the people. The governors invitation to D.D. Lapang to form the government and prove that he has majority support in the house is the beginning of a fresh spate of negotiations rather than a conclusion. That is hardly unexpected, since the elections were fought over issues different from those which touch the people most nearly in their everyday lives, including, among others, infiltration over the border and, paradoxically, the suffering caused to Meghalayas border population by fencing, as well as the threatening militant presence, especially in the Garo hills. The issue that professedly divided the Congress from its Opposition was the erstwhile governments agreement with private companies for power projects and its decision to allow uranium mining. The Congress had its own former allies fighting against it on grounds of corruption. The resignations and shifts of loyalty just before the polls may have been normal for a state in which the government has changed six times since 1998, but it cannot be fun for a people sitting tentatively on problems that could escalate at any time.        
	The Congress has obviously been unable to make hay in Nagaland, even after the Naga Peoples Front-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland had to let go of its government when presidents rule was imposed on the state in January. There is, equally obviously, a completely different dimension to the Nagaland polls, a sense of a routine democratic exercise, while the Naga people await the resolution of the Union governments peace talks with Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). So for Neiphiu Rio, as chief minister a second time at the head of the NPF, the challenge would be to encourage the atmosphere of peace, and not let either the politicking within the government  DAN has as members both the NCP and the Bharatiya Janata Party  or the friction among different Naga outfits disrupt the already difficult process of the peace talks.

	Indian men seldom have complimentary things said about them. Upon assessment, usually by intellectually advanced, resentful, sabre-tongued women, they begin to look like adult Georgie-Porgies, slightly absurd perhaps, cuddly on the rare occasion, but not really funny. And if they are visualized as a gang, Indian Men, or The Indian Male, the potential cuddliness vanishes rapidly in the mists of might-have-been. Instead, they are seen as either evil or cowardly, or a bit of both, depending on how one responds to the nursery rhyme of the boy who kissed the girls and ran away when the boys appeared. The Indian male, observes the writer of a recent book, grovels at the hem of the powerful woman. This is the same male that does not think twice about giving the little woman at home six of the best if she so much as hints at a mind of her own. There he is lord of the manor, with, sometimes, a carefully preserved throne above him for his mother. He is the meekest of meek sons if his mother has been wise enough to acquire the trappings of domestic power. Otherwise of course, she can be dumped too.        
	Women who make it to the top know how to work a simple truth  bullies are scared of bigger bullies. Since the best models for boorish bullies are men  look at Attila the Hun, George W. Bush, or Idi Amin, to take a minuscule sample  these women, like Lady Macbeth, unsex themselves efficiently to lead parties and nations. So J. Jayalalithaa may have greybeards rolling in the mud at her feet in tribute to her power, or Mayavati have the entire bureaucracy jumping through flaming hoops at her command. Whatever men can do women do better. Naturally, then, women are unmatched in the naked display of power once they have got the hang of it. In their different worlds, Indira Gandhi knew this as thoroughly as did Margaret Thatcher.        
	Women like being powerful just as much as men do. Probably more, because they feel their own uniqueness in a class of powerless sisters, and nothing makes the vital juices flow more abundantly. The trembling politicians and hangers-on who accompany women leaders are visible proof of the effect of this shining sense of power. In India, the devotion they enjoy may partly be a carry-over from the cults of female killer-deities. But the Georgie-Porgie principle works at home too. The trick is to acquire, quietly and ruthlessly, the accoutrements of power  be it a foghorn-like voice, or the gift of an unstoppable stream of words or tears, the wordless turning away at a moment of ardour, the ability to create a very rocky mountain out of thin air, the genius of turning each occasion into the spouses fault, the control over money or property inherited from the natal family, or even a politician father  any one or some of these can turn husbands into meek followers. Like charity, power begins at home too.

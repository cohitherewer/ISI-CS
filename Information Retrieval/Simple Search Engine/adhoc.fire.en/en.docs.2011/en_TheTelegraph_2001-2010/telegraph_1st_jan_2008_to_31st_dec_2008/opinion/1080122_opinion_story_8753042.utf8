             - Those who keep the home fires burning even as they are on the move
										
   A DAY IN THE LIFE OF
                        
	Shantu Pandey of the Great Royal circus could have been born in the ring. Her mother, Dolly Guha, had been a circus artist, as had been her late father. After retiring, Dolly bequeathed the tricks of her trade to Shantu, who now works as a gymnast and a trapeze artist. Her husband does the motorbike stunt in the globe. Dolly and Shantus tent looks startlingly clean, with separate sections allotted for dressing, sleeping, cooking and praying. I am taken aback by the quaint homeliness of the living quarters of these itinerant people. 
    
	Inside her makeshift home, Shantu, all made-up, and with a kaftan pulled over her stage costume, eagerly updates herself on the latest developments of a K-serial on the television in between acts. She informs me that she will know when she is wanted on stage by the changes in the tune of the band. She treats her job at the circus with a matter-of-factness that is quite fascinating, considering the perils it involves. But Shantu says unequivocally that she would like her child, when it comes, to receive proper education so that it can have the freedom to choose its profession. Life at the circus has its attractions, yet education can provide opportunities for a better life, think both Shantu and her mother.
    
	Their thoughts are echoed by Ram Bilas and Seema Mahto of Nataraj circus. Originally from Motihari in Bihar, Ram Bilas grew up in the circus, learning the skills from the circus-owner. His wife, Seema, stopped performing after the birth of their son. The boy, who is now ten, is studying at a residential school in Munger. Seema and Ram Bilas visit him when they can get time off from the circus. Seema wants her son to be an engineer when he grows up. 
    
	Unlike Ram Bilas, who has the consolation of having his son a few train rides away, Emille, Jemma and Alexander are separated from their family by thousands of miles. They are from Uzbekistan and have been performing in India for quite some time now. While Emille and Alexander make a Laurel-Hardy duo, Jemmas act involves swinging and dancing in the air while tied to a rope. My stomach churns as I catch Jemma twirling gracefully like a sylph in mid-air. Down in the ring, Alexander is watching her intently with a look of such concern that I deduce that they must be related. My hunch is confirmed when I catch the three at their dinner  Alexander and Jemma have been married for four years. 
    
	Talking with the three performers in their tent, I cannot help but steal a glance into their dented bowls. They seem to be eating what looks like boiled rice floating in a reddish juice. They graciously offer me tea and Alexander declares that the Uzbeks are a tea-drinking race. Does this feature of his culture make it somewhat easier for him to relate to the Indians? I wonder. For sitting in the fly-infested tent, I find it difficult to imagine any reason that these foreigners might have for touring all over India, working even in remote villages in the summer heat or the monsoon rains. 
    
	But Alexander and Emille say emphatically that they are happy here. They keep a busy schedule  practising in the morning and then performing from afternoon till about ten in the night. But they love the work and the people. I ask them whether they miss their country. Jemma grows wistful and says she misses her mother. I also miss the snow, Jemma adds, gesturing with her hands to suggest the falling flakes.

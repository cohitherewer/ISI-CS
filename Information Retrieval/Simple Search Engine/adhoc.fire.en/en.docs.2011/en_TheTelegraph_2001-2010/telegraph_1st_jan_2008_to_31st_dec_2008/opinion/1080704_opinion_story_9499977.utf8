	Does the Communist Party of India (Marxist) hope to improve its credibility among the minority community by opposing the Indo-US nuclear deal? That would argue an assumption on its part that Muslims in India are against the deal, an assumption untimely voiced by the CPI(M) politburo member, M.K. Pandhe, and repeated as a warning by the Bahujan Samaj Party chief and Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mayawati. Given the gradually visible failures of the CPI(M) as far as the minority community is concerned in states such as West Bengal, it seems hardly likely that the party knows what the Muslims are thinking. That Ms Mayawati should know it too seems equally mysterious. Whatever Indian Muslims spread over the country might be thinking, there is certainly no indication that they have chosen Mr Pandhe or Ms Mayawati as their spokespersons. The CPI(M) was embarrassed enough to shrug off responsibility for Mr Pandhes remark. But the UP chief minister remains unembarrassed, as aggressively ready as ever to rattle the Congress and her greatest enemy, Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party.        
	What is being taken for granted is a stereotype of the minority community that is convenient for politicking. Muslims all over the world distrust George W. Bush and the United States of America, hence in India they would find the civilian nuclear deal unacceptable. The flip side of this assumption is that the minority community is not thinking of its own country. It may be that many Muslims, together with many Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, have arguments against the agreement, it may also be that Muslim members of parliament, representing their respective constituencies within a political party, even the Samajwadi Party, feel the need to speak up against it. Or for it. In a democracy, everyone is free to speak up. That would not mean he is voicing the opinion of the religious community he belongs to. This reasoning is usually accepted, the only exception being in the case of the minority community. Politicians use this trick of deliberate identification because the easiest way to mess up an issue is to communalize it. Once a community has been invoked, even if on imaginary grounds, it is very difficult to argue against the principle of such reasoning without using community-identifying terms. Lack of scruple in politics is also the surest way to distance a community, perpetuating a cycle of division that keeps damaging the secular fabric of the country.

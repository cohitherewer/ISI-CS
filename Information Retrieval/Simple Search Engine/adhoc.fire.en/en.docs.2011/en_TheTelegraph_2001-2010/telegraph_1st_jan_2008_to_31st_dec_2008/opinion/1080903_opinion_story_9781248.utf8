	A father rsquo;s duty   
	A father denied maintenance to his unmarried daughter as she had attained adulthood. According to Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he had committed no offence, as it required a person with sufficient means to maintain his wife and minor children only. The Allahabad High Court, however, held that the provision could be harsh on daughters who hadnt completed their education or were awaiting marriage. It said that the provision was contrary to the directive principle of the Constitution requiring the state to enact laws for the welfare of women and children. The court felt that the provision needed to be amended and directed that notices be issued to the Attorney General of India and Advocate General of Uttar Pradesh to discuss its legal validity. (Raj Kumari Awasthi vs. the State of U.P.)   
	Persistence pays        
	 In a case concerning a cheque being dishonoured, the complainant died. His heirs applied for substitution or the right to fight the case in the complainants name. But the application was objected to by the accused. As the heirs did not pursue the application, the magistrate acquitted the accused. The Andhra Pradesh High Court set aside the order. But the Supreme Court held that since the matter had remained pending for five years during which the heirs had remained absent while the accused attended court on about 20 occasions, the magistrate was right in using his discretion. The court also observed that the respondents did not seem to be very interested in the case. (S. Ramakrishna vs. S. Rami Reddy [deceased by Legal Representatives] and others)        
	Matter of time              
	 The director of a company was held as the accused when a cheque issued by it was dishonoured. But the Bombay High Court held that he could not be charged merely because he happened to be a director of the company. It said that according to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, a person who was in charge of the affairs of a company at the time of the commission of the offence could be held guilty. As the cheques were issued in 2004, and the accused had resigned as early as 2003, he could not be held responsible for the offence, the court said. (Vinod Hingorani vs. State of Maharashtra and another)

	Stagflation is a term coined by economists to describe the coexistence of recession (or stagnation) and inflation in an economy. The coinage became necessary in the Seventies when OPEC-induced sharp hikes in oil prices precipitated the worst possible combination of rising inflation and rising unemployment. This was different from the textbook model of inflationary situations which are usually associated with a booming economy and falling unemployment.         
	The global economy is witnessing another new development. According to The Economist, food prices in the global markets fell by about 75 per cent in real terms over the period 1974-2005. But this trend is now being reversed. Since 2005, global food prices in real terms have gone up by 75 per cent. Another new term, agflation, is now creeping into the lexicon of economics. It refers to this inflation caused by the rise in global agricultural prices.         
	Although agricultural prices have always been more volatile than industrial prices, over the last thirty years there has been a fall in the relative (or real) price of agricultural products. What could have caused a reversal of this trend?        
	Analysts point to several factors. First, the rising prosperity of populous countries like China and India  causing a gradual shift in food habits from grains to meat. At the same time, the fall in the global price of grains  relative to the prices of fruits, flowers and vegetables  has induced farmers in many parts of the world to switch from the production of grains to more remunerative alternatives. The demand for grains has thus tended to outstrip the supply, causing grain prices to shoot up.         
	The second factor is the rising price of oil. This is making alternative energy sources like bio-fuels more attractive  especially ethanol, made from sugar cane or corn. Ethanol is mixed with petrol for running cars. As a result, the demand for sugar cane and corn has got a boost, leading to a rise in their prices. Further, as their production became more profitable, farmers would divert land from other crops to them, leading to the rise in the prices of other agricultural products.                
	No more subsidies        
	In the course of time, more investment and technological development in agriculture may take care of the problem by increasing supply, but not in the next few years.         
	For any price rise, the producer gains and the consumer loses. So, farmers will benefit and bigger farmers will benefit more. The losers will be the consumers of farm products. The hardest hit would be the urban poor and the rural landless labourers who do not produce any food. The standard of living of consumers in developing countries would be affected more than that in developed countries since the percentage of expenditure on food in the budget of a typical consumer is higher in developing countries. By the same logic, poorer urban consumers would feel the pinch more than their more affluent neighbours.        
	Agriculture is almost synonymous with import and export restrictions, which are meant to protect inefficient domestic farmers against cheaper imports. Artificially higher prices for farmers (through production and export subsidies) encourage overproduction, which in turn depresses world market prices. This particularly hurts poor farmers in poor countries whose governments cannot afford to pay comparable subsidies to them.         
	The recent rising trend in agricultural prices gives rich countries a chance to get rid of some of the current farm subsidies and import restrictions. If farmers get higher prices through market forces, the governments may feel less compelled to subsidize them. This would benefit poor farmers in many poor countries. The question is: would the governments be able to muster enough political will to bring about the much-needed changes in their policies?

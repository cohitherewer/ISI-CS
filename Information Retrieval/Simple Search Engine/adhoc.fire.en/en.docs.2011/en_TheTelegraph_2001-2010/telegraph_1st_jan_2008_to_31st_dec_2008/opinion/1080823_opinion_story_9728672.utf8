	Dakshinee presented Tagores Tasher Desh at Kala Mandir on July 25, 2008 as part of its diamond-jubilee-year celebrations. A farce full of lyricism and spectacle, Tasher Desh is always entertaining. Dakshinees offering was rich in its singers. It was good to have the open-voiced verve of Samik Pal, the picturesquely attired prince, beginning with the excitement of Jaboi ami jaboi and deepening to the dreamy longing of He nobina in the first scene.         
	But lightning and stormy skies projected on the backdrop in a play that ridicules literalness from a playwright who once furiously rejected realistic props were rather disconcerting. The costumes of the card characters were imaginatively conceived, and the characters themselves funny in their stiffness and touching in their subsequent awakening, doing an excellent job of impossible songs like Tolon namon. Individual singers, like Arijita Bandopadhyay as Haratani, expressed themselves best in their songs, for the dances and acting were uneven, with an excess of school-elocution gestures at crucial moments. The only convincing actor was Sutirtha Bedagya, playing the princes friend. Except in the choric scenes, the performers seemed unable to use the stage space. Only when Tekkani, played by Srovonti Bandopadhyay, broke into song did the space seem to fill up, resounding with the moving notes of Balo sakhi and her memorably rendered Keno nayan.

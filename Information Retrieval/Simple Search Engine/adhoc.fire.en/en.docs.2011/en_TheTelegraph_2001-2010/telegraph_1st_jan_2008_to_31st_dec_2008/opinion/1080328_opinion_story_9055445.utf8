	It was so typical  the pay commission continuing the perks that should have been removed, and the salary hike for the non-performing civil service that has, over the years, become lax, failing to respond to a changing world. Here peoples aspirations and their demands from the State have taken on a completely different dimension where accountability is called for. In this context, a radical cleaning up of unnecessary minions from top to bottom is called for. Such a test needs to be conducted in order to ensure the survival of the best and the brightest, the well-educated and the experienced in various government positions. Only such people can deliver efficiently on the mandate in hand. India does not need extraneous, parasitical, non-performing babus to walk the corridors with another junior babu carrying his briefcase, to use the most ridiculous out of a plethora of available examples!        
	Rather, the government should double the new salary scale for a dramatically reduced number of employees, introduce hire-and-fire based on the norms of the competitive private sector, and make the babus accountable to the public  make them go into the market and rent barsatis and small homes like middle-level professionals in India, compel them to buy their own cars, pay their own electricity bills, hire domestic help and pay them at least the minimum wage, instead of letting out their quarters in the rear of the state bungalows in lieu of work delivered in their private home, paying them a marginal wage, if at all, and more. All these would be more welcome than this complicated, inadequate and short-term revised wage scheme.        
	I have often said that if the grand babu had to fend for himself he would quickly comprehend the skewed policies that he inflicts on the public he is mandated to serve. The determined and continued exploitation of the silent majority of Indians will cease.                 
	Solitary voice        
	A reality check of this kind would help discard the endless irrelevant and archaic norms of governance and infuse purpose and energy into those who govern us. Needless to say, this would jolt the status quo and the regressive administration. Social turmoil would ensue, but a corrective would be on the way for the future. Has any leader got the guts to do this at the cost of losing his gaddi for the sake of the country?        
	Even the oldest political party of India, the Congress, representing the plurality of this land  a consortium that should have been bubbling with the vitality that comes from having to deal with diversity  fell into the trap of becoming a bureaucratic, dysfunctional machine. After a long time, there is a sense that the inaction is being disturbed by a comparatively unaggressive but determined leader who has decided to break the diseased status quo. Rahul Gandhi has begun to assert himself and speak his mind regardless of the support of the leaders at the helm of the party management. They have been forced to react. They are sharp and know well that the young man is no fool, no novice and no walkover. This has rattled them and their cosy comfort. It has activated their tried-and-tested devious machinations to consciously ensure that the young mans plans are scuttled at the base. Whispers have begun about his inexperience and how party loyalists have to suffer him being imposed upon them.        
	Wherever Rahul Gandhi begins to break new ground, speaks a fresh language, all those trusted men close to the traditional power centre  living off it, feeding half truths to it, consorting with the opposition in the various states, destroying the credibility with their opportunism  feel threatened. Those few trusted lieutenants, recognizing the new narrative, have begun a silent internal campaign against him, hoping to kill the possible rejuvenation.

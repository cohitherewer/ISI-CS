The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | change in the air
                                                                                                                 CHANGE IN THE AIR                                                    
	When it came to clean air, Calcuttans had begun to give up on the necessary conversions  dangerous fuel into healthy ones, and an equally dangerous transport minister into one with some sort of a conscience. In Subhas Chakraborty, Bengal has probably seen embodied one of the most damaging forms of cussedness and ignorance. He and his colleagues in the transport department, with the implicit support of his bosses in the Writers Buildings, have, for years, denied and delayed any sort of action that the judiciary had demanded regarding the matter. There was also a complete lack of anything remotely resembling a political will in trying to implement the freezing of illegal vehicles, setting up proper emission testing centres, arranging for supply of clean fuel, and cleaning up the massive web of deceit and corruption that was making any change in the situation impossible. So what has changed now? Has the entire pollution control machinery in the state suddenly been miraculously transformed into an epitome of efficiency or scruple? Or has the judiciary done anything radically new in wanting to know clearly how Delhi had done the job years ago?         
	So what is it that has suddenly made Calcuttans more hopeful that if they manage not to be crushed under the wheels of a killer-bus, they are going to be spared the slower death by poison air? Mr Chakraborty now seems to have seen sense, and has publicly made a declaration of sorts that he sees air pollution as a lethal problem in Calcutta. Yet, an entire system of interconnected departments, processes and people will have to be motivated, and then kept at it, in order to make a significant difference for the city. And, apart from putting together and maintaining the physical infrastructure, a whole set of political, civic and popular attitudes will have to change at a fundamental level of everyday life in the city. Is it possible for a seemingly converted minister to make this enormous difference, and then keep making it until it becomes a matter of course?

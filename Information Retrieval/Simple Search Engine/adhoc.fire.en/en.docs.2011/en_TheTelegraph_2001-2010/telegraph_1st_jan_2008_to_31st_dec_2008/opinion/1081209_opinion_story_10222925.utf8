	Sheila Dikshit, a third time winner and a clear Congress candidate for chief minister of Delhi, has bucked the platitudes that are constantly flung at us both by failed politicians, who parade about in the Congress Party corridors with their know-all pontificating, and those self-appointed political pundits intellectualizing on the small screen in high-pitched voices, as if declaiming from public podiums about the anti-incumbency factor and caste equations. These have become the obvious analyses we are fed with. They judged it wrong. Sheila Dikshit, on the other hand, has proved that straight speaking, competent governance, standing with her head held high works  even when being wrongly blamed repeatedly by her own detractors in the party, by the armchair upper classes of Delhi, and by the press looking for a sensational story and for the endless goof-ups in areas determined by the offices of the lieutenant governor, home and urban affairs ministries, that are not her direct responsibility. Sheila Dikshit has unequivocally established her popularity, she has pulled off a coup.        
	Now, hopefully, the high command at 24 Akbar Road will order the scavengers to lay off Sheila Dikshit. Some key general secretaries, who we all know, have been digging their knives into her as they indulged in much wheeling and dealing with various mafiosi and money-bags, tirelessly working against her by filling the ears of those who matter with all manners of nonsense, as they themselves indulged in self-aggrandizement. She should be celebrated today for having managed to fend off those men and their strong-arm tactics. Those in charge today must go if the Congress wants to prepare itself for a better future. Heads must roll fast so that the campaign for the next round can be in the hands of people and leaders who believe in the Congress and its ethos, and not in the hands of self-serving traitors of the cause who claim to be loyalists. Discard vote-bank politics and compete for a non-divisive political space, and I am sure a new Congress will gain ground.                
	Way to go        
	Most intellectual observers had written the Congress off in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, predicting sweeps against it, and in Mizoram, they had said, it would be tough. How wrong they were because, in all the states, with the exception of MP, the Congress has fought hard and well, managing to keep the fight neck to neck and in Mizoram they have won decisively. With this result, one thing is for sure, that the Congress high command needs to get rid of its in-fighting, politicking general secretaries and senior leaders, all of whom have clearly brought upon the clear defeat in MP and earlier, in Gujarat and Karnataka. They must be put away or sent back, away from Delhi and deals, to wrest power back in May. As Sheila Dikshit led Delhi, Kamal Nath should have been asked to lead MP and he may have pulled it off. The Congress needs to replace the Arjun and Digvijay Singhs with the Naths and Scindias!        
	Here is another opportunity for the Congress to regroup and go for the kill by being ruthless about its candidates who cannot win, by removing the horrendously out-of-synch advisors from their positions of power. Psephologists have made the point that voting percentages of the under-50 age group are swinging towards the Congress. Rahul Gandhi should begin the purge within the Congress and risk going to the hustings, calling all out to vote for a new leadership across all strata.        
	Sheila Dikshit is the star of these elections and has debunked the dreary drone of anti-incumbency despite humongous odds! Shame on the un-electable Ahmad Patels, Digvijay Singhs and other general supervisors and their arrogance. Surely their time to retire has come?

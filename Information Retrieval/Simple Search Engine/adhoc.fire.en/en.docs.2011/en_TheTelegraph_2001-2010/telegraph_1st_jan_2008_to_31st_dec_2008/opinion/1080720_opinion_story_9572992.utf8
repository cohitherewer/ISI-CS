	 With the trust vote a couple of days away, dont be surprised if the frowns have turned into smiles in the Congress camp. For Priyada, who had missed much of the recent political action due to ill health, has arrived to do battle. Das Munshi is considered an expert in cobbling up numbers during a crisis such as this, and his partymen are hoping that he will use his magic wand to save the government the blushes. Understandably, Das Munshis prolonged absence had given Congress floor managers sleepless nights earlier. And it didnt help matters that Vayalar Ravi, the man who had been deputed to ensure that all goes well on D-Day, was once found watching a Malayalam movie instead of attending to more pressing matters. Like all good politicians, Ravi, however, was ready with an excuse for his conduct. When pressed for an explanation, Ravi, reportedly, informed his baffled colleagues that there is nothing like a good movie to beat the stress.                 
	 Ardhendu Bhushan Bardhan may not have been looking for it, but hes just got himself a brilliant piece of information to back up his Rs 25-crore theory. A casual query with a few banks revealed that, almost overnight, currency notes of the denomination of Rs 1,000 are in short supply. Ardhendubabu may well want to check if the notes went out of the till in neat bunches of 250,000. Hes claiming, however, that he arrived at the 25-crore number by combining the current rate of inflation with the last going rate of MPs  Rs 1 crore during the Narasimha Rao regime. But a little birdie tells us that the information was shared by Mayavati with Prakash Karat, who cleverly made AB-babu share it with the rest of India.                            
	 What is Mayavatiji doing when shes not disclosing to Left leaders how much her party MPs have been offered by the Congress? Shes eyeing the chairmanship of the UNPA. Desperately wooed by the Left, Behenji may soon beat Chadrababu Naidu to the kursi. And what a lovely feat of social engineering India will witness then, as class and caste have-nots come together to be stirred in the same cauldron by Messrs Karat and Mayavati. On Mayavatis side, the credit for the recipe will have to go to Satish Mishra, Behenjis most important brotherji from Uttar Pradesh.                            
	 Pranab Mukherjee has been burning the midnight oil to save the government. And all his hard work seems to have paid off, now that Madam has honoured him as her deputy in the AICCs campaign committee for the next Lok Sabha polls. Whats more, in this committee, Mukherjee finds himself a notch higher than even the PM, also a member. Ambika Soni has been rewarded with a place in this club as well. The newly elevated Soni, some say, is now itching to settle scores with a few party gen-secs but is unlikely to get very far. For some people, hard work nearly never pays enough.                            
	 Its all in the stars...and stripes. If that sounds too cryptic, just take a look at all the people who came back from a trip to the US of A to support PM Manmohan Singh on the nuclear deal. When Amar Singh went to the US to get some medical advice some time back, he was breathing fire against the deal. The American doctors must have cured him, because he came back all praise for the civilian nuclear agreement. Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh has also been to the US recently. The UPA is banking heavily on his support on July 22. Sukhbir Badal, the son of the Punjab CM and Akali Dal leader, has promised to vote against the UPA, but has added that he would not issue a whip on his party MPs to do the same. Need we mention that he returned from Amrika only a few weeks back? The PDP chief, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, may have brought down the Ghulam Nabi Azad government in Kashmir, but it is to be noted that he left for the US in the midst of the Kashmir crisis. The result: his daughter, Mehbooba Mufti, has pledged her support to the UPA on the nuke deal. Shouldnt the NDA do a quick check to see if any of its leaders or MPs have been to see Uncle Sam in recent times?                            
	 While the will-he-wont-he game continues around Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee, heres the truth about the letter he wrote to Prakash Karat on voting with the BJP. It was not an official letter, and was written on plain paper, long before the controversy over his resignation broke out. In fact, the questions raised in the letter were discussed in last months politburo meeting.                  
	 All eyes were on Katrina Kaif at her birthday bash in Mumbai, but only for a moment. Soon the two Khans  Shah Rukh and Salman  made sure that they had all the attention  for all the wrong reasons. Salman, apparently, was in a chirpy mood, till he saw Shah Rukh walk into the party. It turns out that Salman bore Shah Rukh a grudge. Sallu had appeared in Kaun Banega Crorepati (the one hosted by SRK, obviously), even shaken a leg in Om Shanti Om, but Shah Rukh had only done a wee bit role in Salman-brother Sohail Khans production. A miffed Sallu chose to get even with Shah Rukh by saying nasty things about Paanchvi Pass. Shah Rukh, one hears, bore the jibes for a while, but soon the two stars were looking daggers at each other. Thank heavens for the fact that looks dont kill in real life; and for Gauri Khan, who cooled things down between the two just in the nick of time.

	Terror, together with the war against it, is globalizations strangest fruit. It works across the boundaries that separate nation-states, forging axes of evil as well as coalitions of the willing. It aligns different peoples to create an Us, which, in turn, aligns another set of peoples to create a corresponding Them. But a closer look at such undifferentiated forms of the Other reveals crucial differences that break the global up into more particular, localized units of experience. Mohammed Haneef and Aftab Alam Ansari have had  perhaps continue to have  parallel nightmares. Both are Muslim men who have suffered harrowing forms of injustice simply for the fact of their being Muslim. The machinery of the War on Terror has worked upon both of them with a sort of uncanny similarity. Yet, fighting the war in Brisbane and doing so in Baranagar are proving to be very different struggles for Messrs Haneef and Ansari respectively. And that difference lies along the crucial faultline dividing the circumstances and prospects of the two men.        
	Mr Haneef is now preparing, with his lawyer, to seek compensation from the Australian government. As a well-regarded doctor whose life spans two continents (he can afford to travel by air from one to the other), it is possible for Mr Haneef to redeem the loss of reputation and earnings that the entire episode meant for him. The contrast with Mr Ansari, a CESC technician in outer Calcutta, cannot be starker. Tortured and traumatized, he is too poor and broken to contemplate legal action. Economic disadvantage, in his case, becomes a form of radical powerlessness when he has to battle the State. In a poor country like India, the backwardness and segregation of the minority community, so sharply brought out in the Sachar report, give to the War on Terror a particularly sinister and brutal form. What the State, especially the police, has at its disposal in such societies, is a world of impoverished, powerless people, with limited access to the justice system, whose lives are of too little value to most, and often to themselves, for their mysterious disappearances to matter to anybody. Arrest, torture and encounter deaths need a constant supply of poor, faceless people who have never seen a lawyer in their lives. It is easier to pick them up in Baranagar than in Brisbane.

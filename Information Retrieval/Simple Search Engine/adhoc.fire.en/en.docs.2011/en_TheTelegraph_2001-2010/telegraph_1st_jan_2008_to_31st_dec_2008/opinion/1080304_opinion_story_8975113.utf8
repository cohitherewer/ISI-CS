                                                                                                                                    TIMELY VISIT
                          
	Everything that George W. Bush does, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does better. Iran may deny this base instinct having anything to do with its presidents recent visit to Iraq, the first ever by a head of state of Iran. But it will still have trouble explaining why Mr Ahmadinejads foray into the Arab world had to begin immediately after that of the president of the United States of America, who visited several Gulf states in January this year. Mr Bush tried convincing autocratic regimes there about Mr Ahmadinejads villainy, although one doubts if he had to try too hard. Mr Ahmadinejad, on his part, did much the same in Iraq, blaming Mr Bush and the unwanted US preoccupation with Iraq as the reason behind the continuing disquiet and violence in the region. The muscle-flexing on the part of either state is now an established behavioural trait. Even a national intelligence estimate from 16 American intelligence agencies in December 2007  which indicated that Iran had discontinued with an active nuclear programme way back in 2003  has not helped the US shake off its ugly habit of doggedly pursuing its case against Iran. It has managed to persuade the United Nations security council to seriously consider a third round of sanctions against Iran, and the international community, despite questioning the wisdom of the need for such measures, may find itself being forced to see these implemented soon.
    
	In that case, Mr Ahmadinejad may indeed find himself doing better than Mr Bush. The president is about to face a difficult parliamentary election this month. His failed experiments with the economy and his growing unpopularity both among his core support group, that is the poor, and among the clergy whom he has tried to unsuccessfully control, are unlikely to help him. But, as before, he may depend on Mr Bush to see him through this bad patch. The last time the Iran president had debunked the UN sanctions, he had found himself trounced in the local council elections. Mr Ahmadinejad may use the sanctions and US belligerence once again to either vastly improve his chances in the forthcoming elections or make light of an adverse performance. Jingoism has never served anyone better. And so long as America continues to push its foolhardy confrontationist policy on Iran in order to make a success of its other engagement in Iraq, Mr Ahmadinejad is destined to run away with all the prizes.

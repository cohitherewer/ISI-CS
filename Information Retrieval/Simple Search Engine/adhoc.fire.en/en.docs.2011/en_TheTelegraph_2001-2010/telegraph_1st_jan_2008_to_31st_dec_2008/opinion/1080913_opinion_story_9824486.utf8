	The most distinguished work being shown in Concepts amp; Ideas 2008 (CIMA, until today) are by two artists, in their early fifties, based outside Bengal. Both have chosen to reflect on how art might be created out of certain precisely willed, yet seemingly random, movements in time and space. Kabir Mohanty and Rm. Palaniappan combine medium and intellect, making and thinking, with an understated sophistication that compels us to ponder anew the role of concepts and ideas in the visual arts. Mohanty creates a silent and darkened sanctum at one end of the gallery in which he places a long, wooden work-table supported by a bridge-like metal frame; four high bar-stools stand alongside the table. On it are four 4-inch monitors, three of them with single-ear headphones, and playing on these monitors, on a loop, are four short digital-video studies.         
	Mohanty calls this installation handheld, a word that gradually becomes rich with implications as one watches the videos and then starts thinking about them. All four studies counterpoint the stillness or movement of the camera with a whole range of other movements and rhythms  of human bodies, of light-sources, of shadows, of chimes and curtains hanging in an open window, of the restless on-off of highly self-conscious editing.         
	The clich of the handheld documentary camera is continually overturned in these studies as the realities recorded by Mohantys camera are scrupulously emptied of informative, narrative or illustrative content. Each is a study, then, of how the camera moves, making the eye of the artist and of the viewer move with it as it tracks other moving elements in the external world. These movements, in turn, become inseparably linked with the works inner content, with the movement of the mind, of thoughts and of feelings, the rhythms of which are partially captured in the way each film is edited and put together.         
	In the three videos that come with sound, what we hear is everyday noise: talk, traffic, train, crows, children, chimes. This mingles with what we can hear in the gallery to create a strange confusion of place. It begins to feel as if we are holding a little window in our hands that is also a little screen and a little framed picture. Each monitor allows us to handle its own fragment of visuality, turn it around, inspect its inner mechanism, somewhat nervously feel its electric warmth, press its everyday sounds to our ear, and then make our own connections among the separate studies. Sometimes the 4-inch frame contains distances, darkness and mountains, or the glare from a window, or a room broken up into jagged shapes and angles by a neurotic camera. Yet these continual variations in scale, rhythm and point of view are held, simply and strictly, in four identical little boxes, which let us scrutinize or meditate on them as they repeat themselves endlessly.        
	Video resembles a pencil, Mohanty writes in a brief note on his own practice, Can one draw and write and straddle both those realms of perception? The two realms he is talking about here are the sense organs and the mind, and Palaniappans series, Way of the Warrior, I and II, are like intensely cerebral answers to Mohantys question  but in a different medium. In Palaniappan, what is handheld is not a camera or monitor, but a piece of conte crayon  Mohantys pencil  that becomes the instrument for joining mind, hand and paper, for bringing together writing and drawing. Each of the drawings in the two series is called a movement and presents us with a pattern of lines that seems to chart the random motions of differently coloured points  rather like the movements of the camera in Mohantys study called shape. Each cluster of lines is then placed within a grid of numbers, letters and compass points, and surrounded by streams of stipple-like marks that resemble currents of water.         
	These difficult visual riddles, some bearing elaborate sub-titles, are like maps that depict on a two-dimensional plane the movements of what Mohanty calls inner content as they are transmitted to the paper through the artists hand. The drawings become, in turn, templates for the viewers inner content as they are read, singly or connectedly, like a kind of writing that can be understood only with the eyes mind, as distinct from just the mind. In Palaniappans earlier work of 2007, so mischievously reminiscent of Paul Klees Angel sketches of 1939, it is possible for the eye to pick up hints of the human figure and face. But the two 2008 series take the inner play of random doodling to a level of abstraction that brings drawing very close to the condition of pure thought.

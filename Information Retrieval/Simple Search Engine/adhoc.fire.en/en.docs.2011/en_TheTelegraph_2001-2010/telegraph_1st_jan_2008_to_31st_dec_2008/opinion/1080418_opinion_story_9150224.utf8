                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SAME OLD WORD GAMES                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Arjun Singh, the near-infirm, old Central minister, who has survived many a government and countless cabinets, is bad news at the best of times. His deliberate spouting of an irrelevancy, about the Congress Partys future prime ministerial candidate, is typical of his strategy to demean the Gandhi family by suggesting through innuendo his closeness to 10 Janpath, putting words into their mouths and then feigning innocence, and, most importantly, by raising issues prematurely to kill the possibility of any change for as long as it can be helped. This hugely intelligent and shrewd politician has schemed for decades and his manipulations have, more often than not, been directed at embarrassing the Gandhi clan through the generations. Why is he permitted to play these games?        
	In the Manmohan Singh era, all the Congressmen who could not pip him to the post they yearned for have been miffed with his appointment. They have been singularly indifferent to him as well as to the larger policies, choosing to follow their individual political agendas instead. Not having the guts to take on the top leadership, they have whispered with abandon, and permitted unnecessarily personalized negative campaigns against him by working tirelessly from behind the purdah. They have not worked as a cohesive, committed team. These failed, weak, insecure plotters should have no place in the echelons of power today, where high risks and initiatives for radical change need to be the active endeavours of a government committed to delivering the promises it has made to the people. We have had enough loose talk and predictable politicking.                
	True service        
	The senior bureaucracy, having well understood this conscious isolation of the prime minister by his Congress colleagues, has seen the writing on the wall. They have joined the gang of Iagos and are equally non-committal on issues that need debate and urgent decisions. Status quo and delay tactics have dogged this government. Some crucial, sensible and important political decisions have been diluted with severe, often partisan, non-action. This has worked against the ruling United Progressive Alliance government. An ominously silent Opposition, led by disgruntled, tired old men who do not want to rock their little escape boats by speaking out lest they lose their profitable offices, has damaged the tenure of a good and clearthinking leader, who could have put us on a fresh trajectory of energy and change.        
	We need affirmative action in the cabinet, first! We need reservation in age limits for active cabinet members. We do not need the experienced players of the past who have failed, over 60 long years, to deliver the basic dignities of life. That experience needs to be junked. Whether rich or poor, living in urban and rural India is undignified. The politician and the administrator, particularly over the last two decades, have successfully destroyed the strengths of an economically poor nation. Intellectual incompetence and personal aspiration have come together in a lethal combination, setting us back in time, keeping us away from competing in a fast-changing world where a new discourse is grappling with solutions to rectify the mistakes of the last century. India can leap-frog out of making the same mindless errors and save itself from being mutilated if only those who rule have the wherewithal to comprehend a larger, more substantial, reality.        
	This is, in fact, an appropriate moment to drop the Arjun Singhs out of the cabinet  all the participants in that mournful chorus take their devils march seriously  force them to abide by their word, eject them from power and decision-making. Let them serve India they claim to love from outside the government without the perks of office.

	Given the plunging standards of the annual musical tribute to Tagore in the Rabindra Sadan complex, and the bazaar ambience around it, the performance of 37 first-timers on the morning of May 18 (within the civilized confines of the auditorium) was a relief.        
	It was a big stage (though with a handful of listeners) and each singer had just one song to prove his or her mettle. Under the circumstances, the best performances came from Smita Pramanik, Anindita Sengupta, Ritasree Bhattacharjee, Suparna Chatterjee, Sreedhara Gupta, Doyel Pramanik, Ritapa Mukherjee, Ruma Das, Jewel Rudra Pal, Nanda Basu and Dipanjan Ray. Sanjay De and Anindita Das Biswas avoided rhythm-bound songs at the risk of sounding under-prepared.        
	Sumana Ray, Krishna Basu Mitra, Shankar Ganguly, Ranjana Banerjee, Shampa Mishra, Zinia Bhattacharya and Sanchari Banerjee left the mark of good training through their correct, unembellished singing. Few were adventurous in song-selection, though Madhumita Bhattacharyas Ke uthe daki, ideally an evening song, sounded just as good in the morning.        
	A few, like Mamata Ganguly, Manish De, Srabani Bhattacharya, Sujata Das and Aparajita Ghosh, were either overpowered by the occasion or were plain weak. It will be interesting to hear this crop of singers again next year, when, hopefully, more male voices will join the fray.

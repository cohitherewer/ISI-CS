	Neighbours agony
         
	Sir  Since the makers of South City love to advertise their creation only in superlatives, they might feel proud about the fact that it has created the longest traffic jam in the area because of their lack of vision in planning the mall. The horrific traffic jams that have become a daily affair would make the most ardent mall-hoppers run away from South City if a solution is not found soon. A flyover could be a solution, but it would take at least five years to complete. Maybe the authorities should consider making Prince Anwar Shah Road open to one-way traffic. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Soma D. Mukherjee, Calcutta

        
	Honour at stake
     
	Sir  Some weeks back the Bharat Ratna had sparked political controversy after L.K. Advani proposed the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the highest civilian award. Every year, similar claims flood government offices before the awards season, burying the very idea of distinction in public services. The way politics is casting its shadow on the honours  meant as recognition of an individuals service to the nation  does not augur well at all. The government should frame a policy in order to ensure that no part of the selection process involves politicians. The members of the selection committee should be distinguished personalities from various fields. The government of the day always leaves its imprint on the nominees list for the national awards. The nomination of the defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, for the Padma Vibhushan this time is surely a reward for his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty (Pranab blooms in Padma pond, Jan 26). Politics today is no more than a family business where questions of public good had better not be asked. Such a blatantly self-aggrandizing class does not deserve the nations acknowledgment.
          
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

        
	Sir  To confer the Padma Vibhushan on Pranab Mukherjee, that too along with a few entrepreneurs and entertainers, is to undermine the role played by the veteran politician. Mukherjee has contributed in a big way over the last four decades to the countrys overall progress, particularly in its economic development, foreign policy initiatives and measures to maintain political stability. These simply cannot be compared to the achievements of the entrepreneurs and entertainers whose activities are connected with earning a livelihood, if not making profits. As an exemplary statesman, Mukherjee deserves better  perhaps the Bharat Ratna.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Mukut Nandy, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It is really a sad day for the nation when a politician like Pranab Mukherjee is equated with icons like Sachin Tendulkar, Vishwanathan Anand and Asha Bhonsle. Mukherjee, though a committed Congressman, won the Lok Sabha election amidst allegations of covert Left Front support. Are we going to see a string of favoured Congress politicians (say, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) getting the highest national honours as long as the party wields power at the Centre?
          
	Yours faithfully,
   
V.S. Giri, Calcutta

             
	Parting shot
     
	Sir  It is strange that The Telegraph thinks that Yuvraj Singh is a dashing right-hander, when most of us see him wielding the bat with his left hand (Yuvraj ruled out of 1st ODI, Jan 31). But perhaps the report was not speaking of Yuvrajs batting and bowling at all. Maybe he uses his right hand for other activities. But in case his cricketing arm was in question, the phrase was quite a bloomer. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S.K. Niyogi, Calcutta

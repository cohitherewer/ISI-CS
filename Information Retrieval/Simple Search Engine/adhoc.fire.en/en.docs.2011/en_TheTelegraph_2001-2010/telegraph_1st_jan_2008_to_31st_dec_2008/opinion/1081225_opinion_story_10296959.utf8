	Populist noises notwithstanding, the principal aim of higher education is the pursuit of excellence. Research degrees, like doctorate in philosophy (PhD), cannot be produced by the assembly line method. To be honest, neither should degrees at the bachelors level, but college education has gone beyond repair in India. The standard of research degrees may still be salvaged with adequate steps. The Centre is proposing to introduce stricter regulations to ensure that the research produced by students aspiring for a PhD meets certain standards. It is amazing, of course, that it has taken the government so long to wake up and take cognizance of prevailing standards at the research level. It is assumed, in practically all Indian universities, that anyone who has a masters degree should be eligible for working towards a PhD. There are two delusions involved here. One is that a masters degree in India adequately prepares a student to conduct independent research. The other is that no special skill or aptitude is required for conducting research. There are many universities in India which do not possess the resources and infrastructure necessary for students to undertake research. What relevance will the guidelines have for these universities? The government is trying to bolt the door after the horse of excellence has bolted.        
	Under Jawaharlal Nehru, when India was pursuing a policy of industrialization, there was a demand for professional managers and engineers. To meet this demand, the IITs and IIMs were set up in parts of India as centres of excellence. There is no denying that these institutes served their purpose and continue to do so. Indira Gandhi and her education minister, S. Nurul Hasan, extended this notion to the social sciences and encouraged the establishment of social science research centres. What was ignored, however, was that during this period, all the well-known universities in India were moving further and further away from the pursuit of excellence in teaching and research. This plummeting of the university system was the direct outcome of a kind of educational populism that saw the quest for excellence to be elitist. The latest example of this is the Centres rejection of a proposal to create an elite faculty post of professor of eminence in universities. The Centre wants higher standards for PhDs but does not want men of eminence to guide and inspire the research students.

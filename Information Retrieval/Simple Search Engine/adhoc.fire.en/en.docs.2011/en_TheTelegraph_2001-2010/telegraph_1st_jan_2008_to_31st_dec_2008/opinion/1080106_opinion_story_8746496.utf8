The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | partner and protocol
                                                                                                              PARTNER AND PROTOCOL                                                          
	Protocol is always a demanding taskmaster. But when protocol comes to be braided with puritanism, the results can be bizarre. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is coming to India on a State visit. The protocol section of the ministry of external affairs has no problems with that since it has handled innumerable such State visits and knows the relevant drill probably by heart. There is, however, a fly in the ointment. Mr Sarkozy is bringing with him his girlfriend, Carla Bruni, who is a model when she is not with the French president. This has thrown the protocol section into a tizzy. It does not quite know how to deal with her. How should she be treated? What status should she be accorded? Girlfriend is not a term that the protocol lexicon recognizes. It knows wife, and it knows spouse, but girlfriend?  heaven forbid  how can the president of a country travel with such an entity?        
	It will be interesting to see how this protocol problem resolves itself, and what status is accorded to the love of Mr Sarkozys life. Will they be allowed to stay in the same room? Will she be invited to the formal banquets? If yes, where will she be seated, below the salt or next to the president? How will she be addressed? A new chapter on how to treat the girlfriends of heads of State will have to be written and inserted into the book of protocol, and a new drill introduced. One can imagine sincere officers belonging to Indias elite service scurrying from the office of one government of India dignitary to another trying to explain to them the intricacies involved in behaving with the girlfriend of the French president. It is reminiscent of that famous episode in Yes, Prime Minister in which a French president declared his intentions of presenting a Labrador puppy to Her Majesty, the Queen. The British foreign office, according to that episode, went into a catatonic fit because the rules stated that the animal would first have to be in quarantine before gracing the royal kennel. But such a step would be construed as a snub by the French. Ms Bruni cannot be put into quarantine in India, but the government of India does not look kindly upon the girlfriend of a head of State.        
	There need not have been this hullabaloo. There should have been a perfect fit between the French, the best-known lovers of the world, and the Indians, who gave the world that locus classicus of erotic literature, the Kama Sutra. The shadow of protocol falls over the visit of the French president to create a diplomatic issue where actually none should exist. When Jacqueline Kennedy, during her visit to India, had expressed a desire to visit Khajuraho, there was the query about the propriety of her seeing erotic sculpture. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Bruni will cause no such embarrassment since they will only visit that monument of love, the Taj Mahal.

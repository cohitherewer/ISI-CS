The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Seasons melodies amid sound and fury
                                                                                                                 SEASONS MELODIES AMID SOUND AND FURY                              Sreyashi Dastidar      Music                                                
	When Indo-Occidental Symbiosis conceptualized an evening of Tagores songs of spring, the idea must have been to create a musical extravaganza. When the show, titled Basante Aj Dharar Chitta, got under way at Kala Mandir on February 24, the musical instruments present on stage were sitar, flute, guitar, violin, harmonium, mandira, tabla, khol, and as many as three keyboards. (Surprisingly, Tagores favourite accompanying instrument, the esraj, was absent, but it is perhaps just as well, for it would have been quite a misfit in this curious ensemble.) What was irretrievably lost in the sound and fury was the tranquil charm of Tagores songs.        
	The first singer of the evening, Sounak Chatterjee, put in a promising performance, but always seemed a little too mindful of the preludes and interludes. He faltered in the very first song, Aji kamala-mukul-dal khulilo, though he was quite impressive in later songs like Basante ki shudhu kebal and Kakhan je basanta gelo. His rendition of Ebar ujaarh kore would have made a far greater impact without the flute prelude, which had no resemblance whatsoever with the chalan of the song. At least one song, Nishitha raater praan, would have sounded better if the octave was lowered by half a note. But then, this is a common problem when singing to music which demands that the singer follows it rather than the other way round.        
	Shreya Guhathakurta (picture) not only handled the orchestra better, but also gave a performance that was close to flawless. The drama in O amar chander alo, the vocal modulation in Aji dakkhina-pabane dola lagilo, the intelligent scansion of Ektuku chhowan laagey, the use of restraint in Tumi kichhu diye jao, the sheer vocal range in Labonye purna praan, or the masterful execution of Basanti hey bhubanomohini  Shreya combined the best of traditional Rabindrasangeet gayaki with the smartness of her times. The only time she seemed constrained by the music was in Dheere dheere dheere bawo; the songs languorous appeal was lost because the orchestra was constantly urging the singer to hurry up.        
	Sushanta Mukherjee was the third singer of the evening  quite advanced in years compared to the other two, and belonging to the old, long-out-of-fashion school of singers who would like their baritone to make up for the imperfections in their singing. The imperfections were many  jyosna in place of jyotsna in Mamo antaro udashe, the inaudible last r of ronger in Jharo-jharo-jharo-jharo jhare ronger jharna, the annoying penchant for singing after, rather than with the beat of the tabla. There was also little justification for singing rhythm-bound songs such as Shei bhalo shei bhalo (Shreyas Jodi taare nai chini go too) without the percussion, accompanied only by the keyboard in piano-mode. And in any case, the prelude to Shreyas Jodi taare could easily have been played with George Bensons popular Nothings gonna change my love for you.

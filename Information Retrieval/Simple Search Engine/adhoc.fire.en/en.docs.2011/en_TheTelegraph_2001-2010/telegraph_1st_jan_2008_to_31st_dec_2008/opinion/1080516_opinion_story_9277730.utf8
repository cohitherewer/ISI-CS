	A Social history of the Deccan, 1300-1761   Eight Indian Lives   By Richard M. Eaton,   Cambridge, Rs 695
    Richard Eaton, arguably the best historian of medieval India  together with Irfan Habib and Muzaffar Alam  takes an innovative approach in this book. He attempts to capture the social history of the Deccan, over four and a half centuries, through the biographies of eight figures. There are two novelties involved here. One is the emphasis on biography, a genre that has suffered a remarkable eclipse in Indian historiography because of the predominant tendency among Indian historians to look at structures, rather than at individuals. It is considered unfashionable, probably because of the influence of a very vulgar Marxism, to study individuals. The other is the focus on the Deccan. Most Indian historians tend to concentrate on the area lying north of the Vindhayas, and the Deccan in a reflection of the northern mirror. Eatons book is an impressive breakthrough in both directions.        
	Eaton notes that the Deccan has no master narrative of its own. Yet between the 14th and the 18th centuries, north India became a sort of alter-ego for societies south of the Narmada river. Individuals, communities, and whole states defined their identity with respect to this colossus of the north, sometimes in opposition to it, sometimes in imitation of it. The books chronological limits are defined by two important events in the history of north India that had a profound impact on the history of the Deccan. The book begins with the ascendancy of the Delhi Sultanate, and closes with the defeat of the Marathas in the hands of Ahmad Shah Abdali in the Third Battle of Panipat.        
	The interior plateau of the Deccan was settled by pioneering cultivators who displaced pastoral groups. The first chapter looks at this process through the figure of Pratapa Rudra (1289-1323), the last of the Kakatiya kings, whose submission to Delhi inaugurated a new era in the history of the Deccan. In the 14th century, the Deccan felt the impact of Muhammad bin Tughluqs attempts to colonize it with immigrants transplanted from Delhi. Eaton analyses how Sufi sheikhs, especially Saiyid Muhammad Gisu Daraz (1321-1422), helped the process of indigenization and stabilization of Indo-Muslim polity in the Deccan.        
	In a third chapter, through the figure of Mahmud Gawan ( 1411-1481), Eaton examines the incorporation of the Deccan into the global regimes of commerce in the 15th century, especially with the networks of trade in Iran. Focusing on Rama Raya (1484-1565) of Vijayanagara, Eaton questions the notion of Vijayanagara being a Hindu bulwark against Muslim conquests. On the contrary, Rama Raya represented elite mobility that was enabled through the diffusion of Persian culture in the region.        
	Tracing the career of Malik Ambar (1548-1626), Eaton shows how an Ethiopian slave rose to become a Nizam Shahi sultan. This allows him to look at the problem of African slave labour from India. In Chapter 6, the life of Tukaram (1608-1649) is the entry point for studying the social base of non-Brahmin devotional cults and vernacular literature that laid the groundwork for the rise of Maratha power under Shivaji.        
	In Telengana, the career of a low caste toddy tapper, Papadu (circa 1695-1710), shows social banditry as a modality of subaltern resistance to larger regimes of power. Finally, Eaton traces the rise of coastal Brahmins within the institutions of the Maratha state, but he does this through the figure of a woman, Tarabai (1675-1761).        
	Eaton has thus chosen a maharaja, a Sufi sheikh, a merchant, a general, a slave, a poet, a low-caste rebel and a dowager to illustrate various facets of the social history of the Deccan: colonization, factionalism, elite mobility, slavery, caste relations, resistance and gender. The result is a remarkable book, written in a style accessible to anyone interested in history. Like Eatons previous works, this is a landmark achievement in medieval Indian historiography.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When the Board becomes a computer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHEN THE BOARD BECOMES A COMPUTER                                  RESULTS OUT      What does a printed-out marksheet mean to students in a Bengal village?                                                  
	Apart from the outcome of the local panchayat elections, there were two other results being talked about excitedly by the boys in Koronjoli. This was the last week of May. The Uchcha Madhyamik results were out and the students had just got the marksheets; the Madhyamik results were expected in a few days.         
	Koronjoli is a beautiful village in South 24-Parganas, about two hours by train from Calcutta. It was sweltering when I reached just before noon. But the drop-in centre run by a Calcutta NGO, where I was sitting with the boys, was deep inside the village, surrounded by lush farmland stretching as far as the eye could see, and the breeze was calming us down. The talk all the way from Calcutta was about Trinamul winning just about everything there was to win in the area. But while the aroma of an almost-cooked lunch wafted in from the kitchen, a single scrap of paper was flying about from hand to hand among the boys, like a fragile kite that brought out a tender playfulness.         
	This was Ronojits HS marksheet, and what his younger friends found most wonderful was that it was a computer print-out. It had reached their world from another star, from where I too had come. So they wanted to share with me the thrill, and anticipation, of producing something by hand  their exam scripts  that would then be taken somewhere else and fed into a Computer, eventually emerging from it as scientifically computed Results. In this mysterious process, they wondered aloud, how did human beings  the examiners  figure? Was the Board human? If so, then at what stage did it turn into a computer? And how would the latter tell a good essay from a bad one?         
	Only one of the schools the boys went to has just got a computer, and many of the boys could not afford the extra bit they had to pay in order to learn to use it. There was perhaps just one cybercaf nearby, recently opened, which didnt always work because of power cuts or a bad connection. They also wondered whether once everybody could afford computer classes at school, their scripts could be fed directly into the machines, perhaps by the boys themselves, and whether what emerged afterwards would be the Results too, but somehow magically bettered. Most worrying of all, how would the Computer read Bengali? Would it be better then to study English medium? Another detail worried them. They had heard somewhere that now they could demand to see their marked scripts if the fairness of the marking was in doubt. Was that really possible? How can computers be unfair? Can machines be wrong or prejudiced?         
	It struck me then that these results were the boys first contact with the public sphere, or even the State, whose distant impersonality, somehow embodied by the computer, was suddenly felt to be involved in the shaping of their lives henceforth. But beyond that, their imaginations drew a blank  a thrilling but frightening blank. This blank was surrounded by a shimmering penumbra of fears  the acute and irrational fear of having to travel to the city (something that even the smartest of the boys secretly nurtured), the fear of having to function in English, the teaching of which was hideously inadequate in their schools, as I found out soon, even when the other subjects were being taught astonishingly well.        
	The boys could figure out the local elections  whos in, whos out  from what was happening around them. But that was where politics began and ended for them. They took me, just before evening fell, to the riverbank. Across the sea-like stretch of water they pointed out to me the distant lights and flares of Haldia and the harbour, and told me about the ships that pass in the night.        
	Aveek Sen

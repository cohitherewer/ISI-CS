	Kind of a bellwether  as the Lok Sabha polls near, theres a sudden gush of full-blown insertions in the media by this or that Central ministry tom-tomming its achievements. The specific pretext hardly matters. It could be a random event like the dedication to the nation of a new project or the completion of an irrigation dam or the opening of a new rail track or the celebration of a day set aside by the United Nations for taking a pledge to eradicate the evil of smoking. The principal party ruling at the Centre wants to be re-elected in office, a most exceptionable aspiration. It is also within the four corners of propriety for a ministry to spend money on public relations. What redounds to the credit of the ministry and the government as a whole can be expected to get reflected on the fortunes of the political party constituting the government. It is a reasonable hope that, as sequel to the continuous hammering on the sensibility of the public mind by the advertisements, the electorate would scamper toward the direction of the polling booths and endorse the ruling partys desire to enjoy another term.        
	A cultural norm has emerged over the years. The advertisements carry photo images of the prime minister, the cabinet minister presiding over the ministry concerned and junior ministers attached to the ministry. In the eye of some cynics, these images are a version of the rogues gallery and do not deserve wasting time on. One persons poison is, however, another persons meat. If the ministers are particular that official advertisements extolling the doings of their ministries must include the images of their mugs, so be it. Even were the general opinion to be that carrying such photos is a waste of public money and does not impress the lay voters, expenditure of this nature cannot quite be deemed as illegitimate.              
	Tranquillity is nonetheless disturbed by another development. These advertisements have of late begun to carry, in addition to pictures of ministers, the image of an individual who happens to be chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance. The alliance is a post-2004 election phenomenon. With its constituents claiming majority support in the Lok Sabha, the alliance was invited by the president to form the new government in 2004. The alliance nominated the ministers who form the government, but it is not itself the government. Its chairperson too, it follows, is not a component of the government; she has not signed either an oath of office or an oath of secrecy which is mandatory on the part of a minister on assumption of office. Her photographic image in a government advertisement is clearly in breach of law, since spending public money for a private cause in this case, glorifying a private individual  is in breach law. It is as reprehensible as the use of official stationery by a government servant for private communications.         
	Our media carry every day sickening stories of how far gone the country is in the matter of corruption. A bank officer is caught embezzling funds, a customs or excise inspector is trapped while accepting a bribe, a railway booking clerk is arrested for selling counterfeit tickets, a university lecturer is found to have plagiarized the text of his PhD dissertation from a book published by another author. Even members of parliament are discovered to have accepted money to ask questions on the floor of the house or to vote in a particular manner. Many similar stories of rampant corruption keep spreading rapidly by word of mouth. People have by now almost got inured to such tales of venality at high and low levels.        
	Despite its recent proliferation, corruption is not exactly an innocent parlour game. It affects societys moral fabric. Since standards of ethics are undergoing rapid transformation, deviations from a given framework of morality are conceivably no longer taken seriously by wide sections of the community. It would still be difficult to deny the intensely close relationship between a nations stability and growth and the degree of venality it is prone to. If the philosophy of you-satisfy-me-and-I-will-satisfy-you proceeds to any great length, to cite just one genre of possibilities, rail bridges and river dams and flyovers and multiplexes will come crashing down every day, for contractors would cut corners in providing the necessary materiel after having propitiated the gods at appropriate levels.        
	A deficiency in the human psyche: it cannot always distinguish between quantity and quality. It tends to be absent-minded when teeny-weeny instances of corruption assume in course of time the shape of gross indiscretions. Which is why it is important to take issue with that smuggled image of the chairperson of the UPA in official advertisements. The Congress is a dynasty-based party, the head of the dynasty is the head of the party and ex officio chairperson of the UPA of which the Congress is the principal constituent. Nothing can be more natural to the thought-processes of the present generation of Congressmen than the idea that every opportunity be availed of to extol the greatness of its presiding priestess. The partys ministers are party cronies and have to follow, unswervingly, the party line. They must have issued detailed instructions to officials of their respective ministries that no publicity material on ministerial achievements must leave out reference to the chairperson; the chairperson is lifes breath.              
	Sycophancy  and if not sycophancy, servility  has entered the soul. Reservations should have been expressed within the government itself against such a breach of propriety. Each ministry, for example, has a financial adviser; it should have been the duty of him or her to draw the attention of the minister that carrying an advertisement which is a hymnal to the chairperson of the UPA is impermissible under the rules. The secretary of the ministry, necessarily a seasoned civil servant, should have had the guts to convey the same message to his or her minister. The office of the comptroller and auditor general of India could have taken notice of the practice and offered a public reprimand, thereby allowing an opportunity to Parliament and the general public to wake up to the issue. Unfortunately, no protests have emanated from any quarter. Not even any political party, otherwise ferociously opposed to the UPA, has bothered over the matter, conceivably because it would itself follow a similar culture should it come to occupy office. No newspaper has commented adversely on the contents of these advertisements; the media presumably are more than happy at the burgeoning flow of advertisement revenue from government sources. No maverick of a citizen has stirred himself or herself to file a public interest litigation in a high court or the Supreme Court either. It is being taken for granted that cutting corners of this nature is an integral part of the national ethos.         
	It is an inexorable process though. Little corruption progresses to middle-level corruption, middle-level corruption graduates into scams of an explosive kind. The analogy may at first blush seem grotesque, but the inferno engulfing the world in the wake of the sub-prime scandal in the United States of America has left a grim lesson behind; small-scale avarice feeds upon itself and, over time, its tentacles spread so deep and wide in the system that everything begins to crumble, not just in the near neighbourhood, but across oceans and seas. This may sound like hyperbole, but the mug photo of the chairperson of the UPA carried in government advertisements has implications that could be earth-shaking.

	Stability, even in appearance, goes a long way in the troubled states of the Northeast. The simplest explanation of the Left Fronts fourth consecutive win in Tripura, with Manik Sarkar poised to become the chief minister for the third time, seems to be the gradual lessening of violence in the deeply divided state. Peace and development were the keywords that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) projected in its campaign, and it has been rewarded with a dazzling 46 seats out of a total of 60  last time it had 38  with its allies adding another three to the Left Front total. That it is a vote against violence is confirmed by the Congresss defeat, given its opportunistic alliance with the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura in a bid to draw the tribal vote. The Congress has lost three seats from the 2003 count, and the INPT has lost all but one of its six seats. Its association with violence has deprived it of the trust of its own constituency of tribal people. The CPI(M) in Tripura is remarkably efficient, since the root cause of violence in the state remains unchanged. The frustrated aspirations of the indigenous tribes caused by the overwhelming increase of the non-tribal population, mainly through the influx from Bangladesh in this hilly state of limited resources, have not yet been adequately addressed. But without an acceptance that violence is not the way, the Left Front could not have drawn the tribal vote. The tribal population now is, of course, in a minority.        
	Peace and development might be vote-winning slogans, but the trick lies in battle-ready alertness on the part of the states security forces, and rapid culling of suspected militants. The drive for stability would be successful if the promised development can palliate some of the feelings of betrayal in the tribal population. The CPI(M) in West Bengal is crowing over the Tripura results. It is a bit restrained about the additional delight the complete defeat of the Forward Bloc in Tripura. The erstwhile Left ally had gone a separate way in that state after a squabble over the number of seats. It has chosen to do the same in West Bengal, although for reasons of principle. This is a lesson in favour of Left Front unity, according to the West Bengal CPI(M), just as the Tripura results are a mandate for development. That is a convenient change of emphasis: the realities in Tripura are strikingly different from those in West Bengal.

	Bilkis Bano has been an unforgettable face of the Gujarat riots of 2002 ever since the world came to know of the horrific crime perpetrated against her and her family. Now that face, apart from being a reminder of the remorseless cruelty man can inflict on another, will also stand testimony to what courage and dogged determination can achieve. The judgment of the special Mumbai sessions court, which convicted 12 of the suspects and gave life term to 11, is based primarily on the evidence given by Ms Bano. In providing the court this evidence, Ms Bano has had to battle not only an overwhelming personal tragedy that drove her to the verge of insanity, but also life threats and, above all, the unsettling lure of money and safety that has derailed the Best Bakery case. In replacing the other well-known face associated with the riots  that of Zahira Sheikh  in public memory by virtue of her unwavering resolve to see the guilty punished, Ms Bano does a profound service to the cause of justice. The Bilkis Bano case is bound to rekindle dying hopes inside Gujarat and beyond. 
    
	It is not Ms Banos grit and dedication alone that helped her case. The judiciarys response to the aftermath of the Gujarat carnage and its understanding of the plight of the riot victims have been exemplary. The Supreme Court had taken it upon itself to order the review, and even the reopening, of closed cases, following petitions from human rights bodies and organizations in 2004. It also ordered the transfer of the cases to the Mumbai court when the environment in Gujarat appeared ill-suited to the search for justice. While doing so, it was unsparing in its criticism of the Narendra Modi government. The ruling of the Mumbai sessions court in the Bilkis Bano case, and the clear indication it provides of the complicity of the administration in suppressing and distorting evidence, and its indifference to the sufferings of its citizens, is unlikely to improve the image of the Gujarat government. In fact, the Bilkis Bano case may retrain the spotlight on the crime that the Gujarat government is trying hard to hide behind the veneer of a caring, flourishing state. The resilience of Bilkis Bano, the organizations that help the fight of victims like her, and judicial activism will bear fruit when they, together, force the state authorities to look the crime in the face.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time To Change The OLD ORDER
                                                                                                                 TIME TO CHANGE THE OLD ORDER                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	It is All Fools Day and I am about to describe the first day of the Congress conclave in Kanpur where the party was busy mouthing exactly the same lines against Mayavati as it had done against Mulayam Singh Yadav and his government some months ago. There was not even a change of words, adjectives or sentences, because that would require the use of mind or some exercise of the thought process.The Congress has been unable to rally workers and supporters to involve themselves in real and contentious problems of the marginal communities of Uttar Pradesh. Senior leaders making banal statements to the effect that they would consider alliances with any party that is opposed to communal forces, sound putrid and reminds one of the voice of Prakash Karat.        
	Last year, the prime enemy of the Congress was the Samajwadi Party and its leaders. Mayavati, shrewd as ever, decided to go without the paraphernalia of the press and its insincere reportages, and then surprised all with her clear victory. As far as the Congress was concerned, the meagre seats it won, revealed the party as being disconnected with the real condition of a state they had ruled for decades. Its failure to change the face of Uttar Pradesh, to modernize it, to bring industry and entrepreneurship there to rejuvenate and restore a great past, has compromised the credibility of the party considerably. The complacency of its leaders is part of this truth. The sight of the same old leaders on the manch, draped in green, white, and saffron striped angravastras, looking tired, worn out and remote, can only lose the party votes. And to hear their predictable sound bites is nauseating.                
	Theme song        
	In contrast, the visit of Rahul Gandhi to parts of Karnataka augured a vibrant future for the party  a future that would materialize only if the Congress allows the dynamics of the next generation to take over. Experience or maturity cannot be taken seriously because experienced Congress leaders have only transformed the party to a group for which debate, discourse, fresh ideas or approaches and radical initiatives are all anathema.         
	This attitude has to change if the Congress is to revive. Rahul Gandhi seems to be the only leader out there who is looking, hearing and reacting. The others  the traditional lot on the manch  are feeling nervous and threatened. Concerned only with ways to hold on to their shaky seats, to retain the proximity to the ear of the boss, to tell half-truths surreptitiously, sometimes hesitantly, even against Rahul Gandhi, using the theme song of inexperience, these people are now beginning to scurry for cover, playing games and lying, as sycophantic functionaries have done throughout history.        
	There has been no change in the rhetoric and the position of the Samajwadi Party, except that it has worked hard to regain some ground it lost in the last election. Senior leaders of the Congress in UP are praising Mulayam Singh Yadav today. Why were they then so vociferous in their attack on him last year? What have they noticed in Mulayam Singh Yadav now that was invisible then? Has the Congress lost all sense of discretion? Has it taken a concerted decision to sell itself to any bidder to stay in the game at any cost?         
	When Congress members grouse about diktats from the high command, use these as an excuse for their inability to deliver, one has only to scratch the surface to find that it is a grand lie. Those men and women who stand mute, with folded hands, unable to counter or contradict, debate or discuss, do so because they are incompetent, intellectually limited and unsure about their positions. They have emasculated themselves. They are the problem.

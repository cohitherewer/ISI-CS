	The Delhi government does not give much time to Indias neighbours. It has bigger fish to pursue; a budding superpower swims with America and China, not with small fry like Pakistan and Bangladesh. But unnoticed by it, the governments of both countries have found some use for India. The long construction boom in India has brought cement shortages and high prices. P. Chidambaram tried to tame cement manufacturers with a differential excise duty in the last budget; if they charged consumers more, he would charge them more. They were tamed for four months; then they thumbed their noses at him and raised prices. Their prosperity, however, has been shared by a new competitor: Pakistan has been making hay exporting cement to India. The quantities have been small; but Pakistani exporters have nevertheless made a tidy packet.         
	At the other end of the country, the cyclone in October destroyed the growing aus crop in Bangladesh. India donated 50,000 tons. But that was not nearly enough for its rice-eating neighbour; it asked to be allowed to import another half million tons. It made little difference to India, for this country has a surplus of 5-10 million tons every year; but it made all the difference to Bangladesh. While all three countries refuse to normalize trade relations, they invariably turn to their neighbours to relieve occasional shortages. There was a time when India was short of sugar; Nawaz Sharif, then Pakistans prime minister, was one of those who made good money by exporting to India. Now, of course, India has such a mountain of sugar that it could bury its neighbours.        
	If this is good trade on occasions of shortage, it would be good trade on all occasions. Sugar and cement are important commodities; their shortages make political waves. There must be many other less important commodities where freer trade would relieve shortages and bring welcome profits to producers. And such profits make friends; Nawaz Sharif has been the least hostile to India amongst the rulers of Pakistan. Maybe that is why he did not last. But Pervez Musharraf has lasted despite all odds and errors; and he is on the way to overcoming his manly belligerence. If India got some friends amongst the industrialists and traders of Pakistan, they would only help in taming Musharraf. So trade is a good thing whatever India may think of its neighbours governments; it should promote trade in the national interest. To do so, the first thing to do is to get trade out of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation; collective trade agreements proceed at the speed of the slowest  which is usually India. The next thing to do is to allow imports of bulk commodities such as foodgrains, sugar and cement duty-free, and assure neighbours that this policy will continue forever as long as they are at peace with India. Trade needs to be given a chance.

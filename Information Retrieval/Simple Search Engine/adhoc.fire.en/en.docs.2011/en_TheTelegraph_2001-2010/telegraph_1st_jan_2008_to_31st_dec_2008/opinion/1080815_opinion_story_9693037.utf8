	A dangerous Liaison By Carole Seymour-Jones, Century, 13        
	In 2000, as President Chirac became embroiled in corruption, Bernard-Henri Lvy, who had led the Nouvelle Philosophie movement of the Seventies against left-wing intellectuals, resurrected the once-vilified Jean-Paul Sartre as the man of the century in his La Sicle de Sartre. At the turn of the long 20th century, France was caught in an ideological limbo, having stepped out of Miterrands socialism into Chiracs opportunism (he was nicknamed The Weathervane), but still several years away from Sarkozys neo-conservatism. But the spectre of Old Europe and a new world order were already coming together in a bizarre synthesis. Derrida celebrated liberal internationalism in On Hospitality (2000), as if in a prophetic anticipation of 9/11. Godards loge de lamour, also released months before the twin towers fell, was an acerbic criticism of American hegemony in relation to the Nazi Occupation of Paris in 1940-44. History was catching up with the present; soon the Vichy Syndrome would dissolve into another kind of trauma in the Age of Terror.         
	Lvys revival of Sartre (once accused of dangerous intellectual promiscuity) as the national icon was not just a simple righting of past wrongs, but a deliberate return to the great debate of les trahisons des clercs  the betrayal of the intellectuals  that followed the Liberation. France would once again be divided over the question of complicity as America and the Islamic world became locked in the war on terror the following year. Carole Seymour-Jones makes Lvys retraction, and its reception in France by historians like Ingrid Galster and Gilbert Joseph, the basis of her revelatory new biography of Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre. This searingly honest account not only exposes the nightmare couple lurking beneath the veneer of a golden twinship, but also gestures towards the ethical debates on the role of the public intellectual in an era of geopolitical unrest.         
	Both Sartre and de Beauvoir, in their intensely autobiographical fiction and fictitiously self-serving memoirs, left generous hints about the difficult nature of their relationship. Behind their pact of essential love in a morganatic marriage they allowed each other reciprocal liberties to have contingent affairs. Yet both of them were prone to murderous fits of jealousy, psychosomatic maladies, to having affairs on the rebound and abject self-humiliation. Seymour-Jones takes us patiently through the traumatic childhoods (Sartres incurably oedipal disposition, Simones infatuation with her father), complicated adolescences and screwed-up adult lives. Sartres horror of his own ugliness left him dithering between self-hatred and sadomasochism (I should have liked to eat beauty and incorporate it). Afraid of losing her little husband, Simone seduced her young students at the lyce, before passing them on to the Kobra. These exploitative, self-harming relationships have been written about extensively, especially since the publication of Simones letters to Sartre by her literary executor, partner and adopted-daughter, Sylvie le Bon de Beauvoir, brought out the full measure of their creepiness. The Sartrean clique reminded Jean Cocteau of dogs who gnaw at bones, who take turns to piss on the same lamp post, who bite and sniff one anothers bottoms.        
	Seymour-Jones adds some shattering details to the crumbling myth of twinned perfection. Until the bombing of Guernica, as she shows, both Sartre and de Beauvoir kept themselves scrupulously apart from politics. Sartre failed to note even the stirrings of Nazism when he visited Berlin in 1933, the same autumn when Christopher Isherwood fled the city sensing something going horribly wrong. Even the author of The Second Sex remained indifferent to womens suffrage well into the Forties. The couples wilful myopia would eventually turn into their nemesis, validating their subversive existence and giving them their favourite weapon against real life  denial.        
	Free manipulation and fabrication of facts, the shifting of allegiances with ruthless alacrity, playing hopscotch with different causes for self-advancement: these were the defining templates of their being. The Existentialist journey from Being to Nothingness would be conveniently reversed in Sartres careerism. After the Liberation, he would project himself unabashedly as the great hero of the Resistance. In reality, unlike Camus unflinching commitment to the movement, Sartre played an insidiously shifty role during the Vichy years.         
	While de Beauvoir worked for Radio Vichy in Paris, Sartre became a close associate of the official censor, Gerhard Heller, and went on to benefit from the racial laws that allowed him to replace Henri Dreyfus-le-Foyer (great-nephew of Alfred Dreyfus of the infamous Dreyfus affair) as the prestigious professeur de khgne at Lyce Condorcet in 1941. The virulent anti-Semitism in Occupied France absorbed the two of them into its fold. In 1933, Simone had comforted her Russian-Jewish lover, Olga Kosackiewicz: There are no such things as Jews; there are only human beings. By 1939, she and Sartre had disowned another Jewess, Bianca Bienenfeld, the latest addition to their harem, sneering at Biancas hysterical fear of persecution. In The Prime of Life, Simone failed to mention the deportation of 13,000 French Jews to Auschwitz in 1942. Although just about 0.5 per cent of Parisians genuinely resisted, and despite their symbiotic relationship with the Germans, Sartre and de Beauvoir signed a petition demanding the execution of Robert Brasillach, an active collaborator. This was when the French intelligentsia was largely in favour of pardoning the writer.        
	After making a career out of opposing leftwing thinkers, Sartres conversion to communism shocked his contemporaries and, as he confessed, cost him his last good friend, Camus. Together with de Beauvoir, he dutifully sat at the feet of Kruschev, Castro, Che, Mao, Ben Bella and Nasser. Blinded by his lust for Lena Zonina, his Russian interpreter who was probably a KGB double agent, Sartre returned to Moscow as often as possible. In 1936, on his visit to Moscow to attend Gorkys funeral, Gide had taken barely 24 hours to realize the terrors of Stalinism. Simone de Beauvoir admitted of Stalins gulags as well but decided that they were rehabilitation centres. In her feminism, too, she remained ambiguous: an advocate of lesbianism in theory, she decided to disown her bisexuality in public. Liberal feminists scorned her irrational antipathy to marriage and maternity.         
	Seymour-Jones writes agreeably, but her delight in the bawdy (Simones Kant and kisses sessions with her little nymphs) might appear, at times, a bit forced. She could have written a shorter book, since much of what she reveals about the innumerable love-interests of Sartre and de Beauvoir is public knowledge, recently chronicled in Hazel Rowleys deliciously written, Tte--tte (2006). Although A Dangerous Liaison makes a sincere attempt to move beyond life-writing to a history of the present, what stays with the readers is the endless talk between this impossible couple. For all their claims of spiritual oneness, what triumphs in the end is the intellectual core of their love: His death separates us, Simone de Beauvoir said in her final adieux to Sartre, My death will not reunite us.

	A paperless world is a dream many publishers, booksellers and librarians have had since computers and display technologies arrived in the 1960s. Because there was less physical space to accommodate the avalanche of books, many felt that some room should be made for CDs and hard discs for easier dissemination of and access to texts through the electronic medium. For a while it worked: more and more manuscripts were stored in floppies. The internet also made it possible for research papers to be published online. But even then, the consumption of paper has increased exponentially in the last decade as more books are being published than ever before. Why?        
	First, digital technology has made printing cheaper and easier: it is possible today to print a 250-page book  including designing, proof-reading, preparation of an index and transmission of the final copy for the authors approval  within three weeks compared to three months in the 1980s. Digital technology can also use many tricks even in the final stages of printing. Not only can you chop and change at the touch of a button (many Indian authors make last-minute changes), but you can even turn the manuscript upside down.         
	Second, authors working on computers find it much easier to prepare a copy, to edit and format it according to the requirements of publishers. Because of this enhanced author-publisher interface, many now submit a near-perfect press copy to their publishers. Quite often all the publisher is required to do is prepare the printing schedules, tell the author to stand by for the receipt of proofs with a schedule to turn them around. (There is much greater awareness of maintaining production schedules today.)        
	Third, because of the ease with which manuscripts can be prepared, many authors suffer from a disease that publishers call word-itis. They write much more than it is required. But it is word-itis that spawns a vast number of manuscripts. With international literary awards, writing books and papers have become a lucrative affair, and almost everyone with literary pretension is trying to get his works published, even if it means bearing the production costs. It doesnt matter if the books sell or not; they only aspire to see their names in print.        
	Also, there are many elderly readers who are uncomfortable with electronic texts. Print versions are made available if the possible number of such readers is high. It is also a marketing strategy to have both electronic and print editions: it is easier for the publisher to market the print copy than its electronic edition.        
	A sociological shift is taking place among readers. The new generation which has grown up with e-mails and word processors feels less of a need for printed texts. After all, these readers would much rather see than read, and they would not do the latter any more than is strictly necessary.

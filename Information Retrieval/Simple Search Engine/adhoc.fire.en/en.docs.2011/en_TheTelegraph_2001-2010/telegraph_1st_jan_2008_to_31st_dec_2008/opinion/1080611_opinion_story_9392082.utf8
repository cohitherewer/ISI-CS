	Is HIV/AIDS as much of a threat to India as it is given out to be? After carefully looking at the latest evidence and information, the World Health Organization seems keen to bring about a shift in the perception of the epidemic in India and China. WHO thinks it is unlikely that there will be a heterosexual pandemic in other countries outside Africa, where the situation remains just as grim. The operative difference between Africa and India is that in the former, the epidemic is likely to spread among the general population, while in the latter only those people whose behaviour is high-risk are likely to be affected. This re-interpretation of reality will certainly result in a restructuring of priorities at the national level. Instead of most of the money going to HIV/AIDS, the prevention and treatment of other potentially dangerous diseases will get more funding and attention.        
	Second, identifying high-risk segments of the population, and then targeting the prevention and treatment programmes accurately to reach them will have to be done more efficiently. There is no reason at all to feel complacent on this count as a result of the new message from WHO. Men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, and sex-workers and their clients are the high-risk groups. The work  often with socially revolutionary consequences  that HIV/AIDS awareness-raising has made an imperative in all sections of Indian society must go on, and must be done better. To think of these groups as somehow not part of the general heterosexual population is a dodgy way of looking at Indian realities. Given the prevalence of sexual double standards and fluidity among men of all classes in India, there can be all kinds of overlap among these categories. Besides, sustained efforts still have to be made to remove the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS. Doctors, nurses and other medical personnel, together with the lay population, will have to be trained not only about safe behaviour but also about how to treat people living with HIV/AIDS in hospitals and in the community. The targeting of high-risk groups can also lead to their stigmatization. Male homosexuality remains an ambiguously criminal offence in the Indian Penal Code, and a bizarre form of judicial deferral marks any attempt to reform this law. The need for targeted awareness-raising makes such reform even more crucial now.

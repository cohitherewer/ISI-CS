	From the manger to the mall                  
	Sir  It is sad to see Christmas being glamorized by the world of entertainment and commercials. Even the word, Christmas has been reduced to X-Mas, though X (as a sign of crossing out) has a negative connotation. In todays commercialized environment, Christ has been all but removed from Christmas, and the festival has come to reside in shopping malls and arcades, restaurants and clubs. Before it becomes just another day of merry-making and dancing, maybe we should remember once that Jesus was born of poor parents in a humble manger.           
	Yours faithfully,         Cajetan Peter DSouza, Mumbai
                  
	Border line          
	Sir  Aveek Sen has painted the tale of Khukuli Khatun with a lot of emotion, but not enough facts. Our deepest sympathies are with the family of Khukuli Khatun, who unknowingly became part of the mob of 50-odd men, women and children, who were trying to free an arrested person from the clutches of a lone BSF jawan. The heckling and beating of an armed jawan led to a situation where, in the jostle, his weapon accidentally went off. The mob managed to set free the arrested thrower, but Khukuli Khatun accidentally paid with her life. There was no intention whatsoever on the part of the jawan and he did not know her either. He was there to perform his legal duty. The untimely loss of a young life has left us disturbed and we, the soldiers of democratic India, stand beside her family.          
	The village is one of the worst affected by smuggling of foodgrains, fertilizers and other commodities by women and children who carry headloads or throw them over the border fencing. The seizure in this area from August to November 2008 has been 51,998 kgs, valued at Rs 9,97,685.          
	The BSF is working in adverse conditions on the border. It does not perform the role of the police, as Sen has suggested, and its actions fall under the scrutiny of law. The BSF is a very transparent force and is mandated by the government to be on the border to create a sense of security among the people living in the region. A number of people in the border region earn their living by indulging in illegal trans-border activity. Their objective is at variance with the BSFs, and this is the cause of conflict.          
	Ironically, the border has many stakeholders in the illegal trade involving billions of rupees. Only a corrupt and demoralized force on the border would provide cover to these stakeholders. I dont know what purpose the author has served by blaming the BSF for all the ills of the border areas, from marriage, to oppression to rape.          
	I would request Sen to compare the transparent functioning of the BSF and its commitment to fair administration to any organization that he deems worthy. I invite him to spend a few days with us and then say whether the force is full of rapists or individuals who are performing a Herculean task with utmost sincerity.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vikash Chandra, Deputy Inspector General, FTR HQ BSF SB, Calcutta

                          
	Good cheer          
	Sir  These are troubled times for our country, and we need some news to cheer us up. I found one on the front page of The Telegraph on December 18, in the form of Tata strikes deal with Ferrari. The news that Tatas logo will be exhibited on the Ferrari F1 car in the 2009 season brought on a smile.           
	True, this is not as great an achievement for India as it is for the Tatas. The industrial house has suffered a lot this year, both financially and otherwise, and this is a big win for the Tatas. Many would debate the wisdom of putting this news on the front page, but I feel this is a better way of generating feel-good than using the face of a filmstar.                     
	Yours faithfully       
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

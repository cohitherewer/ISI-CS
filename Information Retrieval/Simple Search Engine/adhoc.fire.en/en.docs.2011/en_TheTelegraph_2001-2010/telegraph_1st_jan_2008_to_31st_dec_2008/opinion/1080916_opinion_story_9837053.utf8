	Embarrassment often leads to meaningless statements. The Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, may not be feeling too sharp after the Delhi blasts. Perhaps that is why he has suddenly excavated the idea of kotwals, using the word in the sense of civilian informers in villages. He envisages groups of citizens who will be the eyes and ears of the government, informing local police stations about the activities in their villages. That would help the 14,000 police stations looking after 6.5 lakh villages. Given that the context is the terrorist attack in Delhi, following those in Jaipur, Bangalore and Ahmedabad, it is difficult to say what the home minister is thinking of. What has emerged from the recent attacks, and the list of suspects the police are putting out, is that even if the bombs are simple and cheap and easily put together, the individuals behind them  wherever they might have been born  move about in cities and towns and are experts in the sending of anonymous emails, allegedly from different places in Mumbai. Village informers could imaginably have been helpful in tracking violent political groups, but Indias experience of that has not been too successful.        
	Mr Patil, perhaps talking to show that there is no dearth of bright ideas, has proposed something that is also potentially dangerous. His little idea may not imply Salwa Judum-like violence, but it certainly suggests the creation of small power groups in villages already delicately poised on the dividing lines of caste, class and religious identities. Neighbourhood watches in the style of the West, which Mr Patil seems to be partially evoking, are all very well, only they would have to be adapted to the social and political realities of Indian villages, realities that differ from region to region. Mr Patil cannot be unaware of the cultural, ideological and material involvement of the members of the local police with the power tussles within the villages they look after. No neighbourhood watch can work impartially in such situations. Mr Patil is a Union minister; people expect his remarks to bear the stamp of thought.

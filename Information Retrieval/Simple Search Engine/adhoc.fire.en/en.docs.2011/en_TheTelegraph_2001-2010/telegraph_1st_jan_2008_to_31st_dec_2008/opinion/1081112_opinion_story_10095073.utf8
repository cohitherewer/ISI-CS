	The quitting game                  
	Sir  The attack on Bihari migrants by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has united Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan with their archrival, Nitish Kumar. All of them have accused the Maharashtra government of being lax towards curbing the violence against innocent migrant labourers. Interestingly, all three Bihari politicians have held the railways portfolio in some cabinet or the other: Paswan was railways minister from 1996 to 1998, Nitish Kumar from 1998 to 99 and again from 2002 to 2004, while Lalu Prasad holds the chair in the present Manmohan Singh cabinet. Paswan was also Lalu Prasads rival for the post during the formation of the United Progressive Alliance government. Since politics in India is all about appeasing specific vote banks, it is not surprising that Indian Railways recruited a large number of Biharis during the tenures of these three ministers. Any railways employee will vouch for the predominance of Biharis in the organization. This is a result of no less a chauvinistic practice than that of the MNS. If Lalu Prasad, Paswan and Nitish Kumar, and their supporters too, were all to resign from their respective posts, it might pass for protest, but that would not absolve these politicians of their wrongs.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Biswajit Parija, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  It was good to see that Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and Nitish Kumar, along with their followers have decided to quit Parliament to protest against the MNSs attack on north Indians (Lalu lobs quit dare at Nitish, Nov 3). In contrast, the chief Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has remained conspicuously silent. It has blamed the UPA for failing to contain violence, but has not uttered a word against the MNS. The Lok Sabha elections are round the corner and the BJP, understandably, does not want to fall out with the regional saffron parties. The regional vote bank is, after all, more important for them than ensuring the safety of a few thousand people. The resignation of the Janata Dal (United) members of parliament was, for a change, an act of selfless sacrifice.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Leela Pradhan, Bangalore

                
	Sir  With the general elections barely a few months away, it is perhaps quite late for the MPs of the Rashtriya Janata Dal to use their resignation (if and when that happens) to gain electoral advantage. These MPs have already enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and high payments on the taxpayers money for almost the whole of their tenure. Missing these benefits for a few months will not be a huge loss for them. Also, Lalu Prasad has quite cleverly scheduled the date for submitting the resignation letters of his MPs on November 15, so that he has enough time to plan his moves to counter the actions of his main adversary, Nitish Kumar. Five of the latters MPs have already resigned and Lalu Prasad has now challenged Nitish Kumar himself, as the leader of the JD(U), to relinquish the chief ministers chair in Bihar. But the RJD MPs have still not given up their parliamentary seats. In the end, the protest against the attack on Biharis is nothing more than Lalu Prasads cheap ploy to snatch away Bihar from his rival.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Amrita Mukherjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is commendable that the MLAs and MPs of the RJD have decided to resign in protest against MNS atrocities on migrant labourers from Bihar. M. Karunanidhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam had adopted the same means to show his partys support for the Sri Lankan Tamils, ultimately forcing the Centre to put pressure on the Sri Lankan government to protect the Tamils in the country.           
	However, the proposed submission of resignation letters of the Bihari MPs now seems to be motivated by narrow political interests. Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, and Nitish Kumar are exploiting this crisis to reinforce their electoral bases in Bihar. While the victims of Raj Thackerays insane politics await justice, the Bihari threesome are busy mouthing words of assurance and protest. It was shocking to see Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar challenging each other over the resignation issue as if to show who had greater sympathy for the victims. The drama around the resignation has defeated the real purpose of the protest.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Guwahati

                
	Sir  The railways minister was silent when the migrant labourers from Bihar were assaulted by the MNS earlier. But now, the forthcoming elections have raised the levels of his concern. He knows that it is all right to quit, with only a few months to go before the polls. But Nitish Kumar has almost two years of his tenure as the Bihar chief minister left, and thus would be hit by a resignation. Whatever the collateral damages, the game of one-upmanship must go on.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mahesh Singh, Katpadi, Vellore

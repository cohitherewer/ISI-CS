	Why do you have to bust your brain before you can find a book of your choice? And how do you go about finding it, even if it means having to settle for a used book? Is there much difference in price and quality between the new and the second-hand editions?         
	To begin with, here are three facts about the book world today. First, given the flood of new titles and reprints of steady sellers, publishers and distributors are terribly cramped for space to stock and display their books. They have to turnover stocks at least twice a year, not merely to make money but also to create room for new titles. Second, the shelf life of first-time authors is down to just 17 days in the American market, and it isnt any different in Britain and elsewhere. Third, many libraries discard stocks regularly for the lack of space.         
	If you put these three facts together, you will realize why a new book doesnt remain on the shelves for more than a fortnight if the initial response isnt encouraging; that is, it hasnt moved more than 200 copies from the publishers warehouse and 10 copies from each of the retailers. Neither the publisher, the retailer nor the librarian can afford to hang on to slow-moving stock: they must create space for the newer entrants. Till about a decade ago, all these remainders were returned to the publishers or paper mills to be recycled. But not all copies of discards are wasted now. The jobbers  huge retail chains  buy over the whole lot to set up used retail electronic stores. This has happened because of the rapid rise of telecommunications and e-business and the spread of credit cards.         
	Goods, particularly books and magazines, can be ordered online. Used or out-of-date books, which are not easily available, can be ordered and payment made by credit cards.The great advantage of e-ordering is that you get them at bargain prices that are a fraction of the original price. Different prices are quoted from different suppliers (usually they are individuals who have listed their stock and prices) and the physical condition of the book is clearly specified  binding, quality of paper, cover jacket and so on. The total cost of the book, freight and handling is given and you punch in your credit card details. If the book is shipped out from the UK, it takes about 10-15 days to reach you. Here are two sites this correspondent has used often with very satisfactory results: www.abebooks and www.daedalusbooks.com. These sites are specifically for used books, unlike www.amazon.com, which handles only new hardback titles and charges higher freight and handling rates.         
	There may be other sites that a Google search could throw up, but both Abebooks and Daedalus have huge stocks because they have networked with libraries and individuals who want to get rid of stocks. Rarely has a search not yielded results. For a start, try Abebooks. I looked for three titles, published a long time ago. All were available. Even if you were to add airmail freight costs, it works out much cheaper than what you could hope for. Now you cant complain that books are expensive.

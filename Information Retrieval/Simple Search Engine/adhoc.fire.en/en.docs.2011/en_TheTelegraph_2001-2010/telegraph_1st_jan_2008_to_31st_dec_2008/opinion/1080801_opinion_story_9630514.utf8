	Given the grisly affairs in the nations capital, where do we go from here? Or, rather, do we deserve to go anywhere? Each and every person has no doubt a pride stored within himself. For quite a few, this pride has been reduced to a single content: their acumen for making money and yet more money. Sticking to power helps to pile money. Therefore their pride concentrates on stratagems and artifices which ensure durability in power. To talk of principles and ideological convictions in this climate is to invite horse laugh.         
	No point in trying to separate the wheat from the chaff, all political parties have painted themselves by the same garishly black brush. Their determination to stay in, or acquire, power makes them immune to the compulsion of logic. The spokesman of a particular party has gone on record: offering a cabinet post at the Centre to a person and the position of deputy chief minister in a state administration to his son in order to induce the former to vote in a particular manner does not constitute bribery. After such wisdom, there can only be deathly silence.        
	Not quite render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar. The Left have been the only non-participants in the lurid drama of what is called national politics. Not a finger can be raised, and has been raised, against the Left on the issue of horse-trading. But that is only a subsidiary point. Of much greater significance, the Left have, in the recent goings-on, stuck to their principles and have not wavered for a moment from the position they adopted the moment the prime ministers nuclear deal with the US president was announced. The weeks preceding the confidence vote in parliament witnessed a sustained campaign in the media against the Left. They had the guts to ignore the slings and arrows hurled in their direction.               
	Now that the vote is over and done with, the Left, the media are convinced, would henceforth be totally isolated in the countrys affairs. If this isolation refers to their refusal to participate in the current sports of reducing politics to the buying and selling of conscience, such isolation is worth its weight in gold. Where, even on official reckoning, three-fourths of the nation live in abject poverty, the space for radical thought and endeavours cannot get forfeited because of ukase handed down by the establishment.         
	The Left can therefore afford to hold their heads high even though they were demolished in the confidence vote. This testimonial however needs to be subjected to one important caveat: hail the Left for their integrity, but pity them too for their navet. Have not they long nursed unforgivably wild illusions about the Congress? The class composition of the party that happens to be the pocket bureau of the Nehru-Gandhis is no different from that of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Any number of instances can be quoted where disgruntled Congressmen have walked into the BJP, treating it as a gussakhana, and have as easily walked back. Itchy-footed members of the BJP have acted in identically reciprocal fashion.         
	And on this business of secularism, why forget the non-implementation of the pledge of the Congress prime minister, on the very evening that the Babri mosque was brought down, to re-build it on the same site, or the failure of successive Congress regimes to take any action at all on the basis of the Sri Krishna Commissions recommendations? That apart, the new generation of the political breed crowding the flanks of the BJP as well as the Congress cherishes the same outlook on life and living. Ever since 1991, the two parties have consistently voted together in parliament on all legislations which seriously compromise the nations sovereignty. It is no different on the matter of strategic partnership with the United States of America.         
	The Left could have demonstrated much greater manoeuvrability if, in the aftermath of the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, it had maintained an equal distance from the two major parties. They had more than two years following the signing of the accord between the US president and the Indian prime minister. They could have put their foot down and served an ultimatum on the Congress in 2005 itself. Instead, they assumed the political set-up to be a frozen datum. They kept piling warning upon warning on the Congress: proceed only this far and no further; they never once advanced beyond the stage of barren admonitions. The ruling party took full advantage of this ineptness of the Left. It began after-hours negotiations with the Samajwadi Party. Once the bell for the final confrontation was sounded, the Left found the ground already cut under their feet. They had vowed not to sup with the devil. But even that commitment unto themselves had to go astray. In any case, was it not always a question of supping with Devil A or Devil B? In retrospect, it is awfully difficult to claim that preferring one devil to the other was not a one hundred per cent irrational decision.        
	True, there is no point crying over spilt milk. On the other hand, if they are not to abandon altogether the political line of the parliamentary path, the Left have to have enough weight in the legislative bodies so as to ensure their relevance. And it will be incumbent on them to focus on their prospects in the not-too-far-away Lok Sabha elections  prospects of the party which is their principal corpus, particularly in the states where its main strength lay till now, Kerala and West Bengal.               
	While in Kerala the Left could face some little local difficulties the party could tide over, the situation is a bit more dicey in the eastern state. The partys regime in West Bengal chose to defy the ideological constraints, forsake the commitment made thirty years ago to show a Left alternative, and has gone a considerable way to embrace the tenets of capitalist development. The consequences have been near-calamitous. The Left Front had won an astoundingly famous victory in the assembly polls in May 2006. The prestige of the Fronts major constituent was then at its zenith. Much of that has been frittered away by the misadventures of the past two years. The shift in policy had little positive impact on the state of being of the working people and the middle class. On the contrary, large sections of the lower peasantry are deeply alienated from the party; the urban hinterland of support is equally disenchanted. An additional cause for concern is the infiltration into the party at some levels of time-servers and similar specimens.         
	Such then is the challenge for the central leadership of the party which forms the bulwark of the Left. Their principled stand on the 123 Agreement has to an extent restored the faith of much of their wavering base of support amongst the masses. What is perhaps called for though is a total repudiation of the growth strategy espoused by the states misguided ministerial team.         
	Making a further point will not be out of order. One or two recent electoral reverses are no extraordinary occurrences in parliamentary existence. But, as the days pass, there could be increasingly wide appreciations of the Left as standard-bearers of principle and integrity in the arid desert of amoral India. To-days scoffers might then turn into tomorrows lusty cheerleaders.

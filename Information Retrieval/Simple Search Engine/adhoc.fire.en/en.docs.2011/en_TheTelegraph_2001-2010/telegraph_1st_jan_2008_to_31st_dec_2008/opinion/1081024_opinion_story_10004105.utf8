The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Silence That Shatters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A SILENCE THAT SHATTERS                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Mobs and their illegal rampaging have begun to rule the streets and public spaces of our cities, destroying the very core of civil society, brutally tearing to shreds a dignified code of conduct that was the hallmark of our society, where protest was never violent but a quiet, often silent, civil disobedience. The lumpen invasive force, mouthing combative threats that forewarn the authority of violent retaliation if it raises its voice against the abuse of the tenets enshrined in the Constitution, gets away with murder. Such parochial and divisive political groups continually provoke and needle, assault and brutalize ordinary people. Unfortunately, such criminal activities often appear to be endorsed and silently supported by those mandated to ensure law, order and protection to people and their property.        
	We see this phenomenon displaying its poisonous fangs in many parts of the country. Some bands of such terrorists have built their pogrom on a warped belief based on a strange religiosity that has nothing to do with religion, god or faith. There are others, growing rapidly in number, who are desperately attempting to divide India by consciously killing its inherent strength of plurality and diversity, its many identities and cultural layers, by creating different creed, community, class and caste ghettos. Instead of being mature and civilized, these leaders are determined to balkanize India. They have no clue about what their posturings could let loose on our soil.        
	Take the example of present-day Mumbai, where Raj Thackeray has been active and where it appears that the chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, is endorsing the ongoing street violence because he feels it will divide the larger ideological base of the Shiv Sena and benefit his political alliance, even though it will be at the cost of Indian unity and integrity.                 
	Running amok        
	The chief minister appears to have the silent, tacit support of the Nationalist Congress Party, his partner in governance, that has not damned the regular mob action. Sharad Pawar is silent. It is an ominous silence that has shattered glass ceilings, floors and walls. Another modern day Bhindranwale is being created by the ruling dispensation in the state and Maharashtra will soon go the way Punjab went. This is home- grown terrorism with political backing. The mob is breaking the law, running amok, killing, looting, destroying everything that stands in the way of its ideology. The horror is that these men are getting away with their criminality and the limbs of our society are getting amputated as a consequence.        
	Citizens of India are looking for decisive action and abhor the political pussy-footing of many a minister and chief minister. Indians are sick to death with the manner in which politics has divided the rich and the poor and all communities, faiths and castes. Such elected representatives have betrayed their oath of office, and assaulted India for their personal gain.        
	Deshmukh must go. He has presided over the creation of a socio-political monster, one that the Central government will be unable to control and tame. Deshmukh is inconsequential and irrelevant to India but the Congress is not. Therefore, the committed and consistent destruction of the Congress by opportunistic leaders in Maharashtra, led by Deshmukh, must be stopped immediately.        
	With Rahul Gandhis firm and convincing denunciation of Raj Thackeray and his divisive politics, there is hope on the horizon. Finally, we have a strong statement with no grey areas. It is time for the political manipulation of the past decades to give way to honest and humane, open and inclusive actions. The old breed of Congress leaders need to be put to pasture!

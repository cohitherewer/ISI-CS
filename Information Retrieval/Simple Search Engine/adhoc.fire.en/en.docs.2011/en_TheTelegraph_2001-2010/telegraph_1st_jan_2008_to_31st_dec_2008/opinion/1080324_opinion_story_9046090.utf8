	Their god, our god                  
	Sir  Last Friday was indeed a special day, not only for the pious but also for those who are not spiritually inclined. A holiday on Friday is always welcome for working men and women. But now that the celebrations  Holi, Good Friday, Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham and Jamshedi Navroze (as Cyrus J. Madan pointed out in his Parting shot on March 21)  are over, one thing is worth pondering. If the three (or four) holidays had fallen on three working days of the same week, ending with Good Friday, public life and work in the country would have suffered as a result. So, perhaps, this was a cosmic design meant to improve work culture in India.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kushal Kumar Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Cyrus J. Madan must be thanked for pointing out that March 21 is not only a festive day for Hindus, Muslims and Christians, but also for the Parsis. Iranis and Parsis worldwide celebrate the joyous onset of life-affirming spring on this day. It has been named Jamshedi Navroze (or Noruz) after the golden age of the legendary Persian king, Jamshed, when suffering was unknown and happiness was the order of the day.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although Shams Afif Siddiqi claims that Christians seem to feel comfortable in Muslim-dominated areas, my experience suggests otherwise (Why we call this Friday good, March 20). Christians living in the Muslim-dominated areas in Egypt, Arab countries, Afghanistan, and Europe (especially the Balkan countries) are also likely to disagree with Siddiqi. In Calcutta, the Bengali Christians I know are always aware of their difference in Muslim-dominated areas. In the days of the raj, white Anglo-Indians enjoyed a fairly good relationship with their Muslim dependants, but most of them have left the city, while many have shifted to other areas. Perhaps Siddiqi could throw light upon the reasons behind this, or tell me if I have gone wrong somewhere.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prophet Mohammed was not amused when Muslims were linking the death of his infant son, Ibrahim, and the solar eclipse on that day. He asserted, The sun and the moon are signs of God. They are eclipsed neither for the death nor birth of any man. As Voltaire has said: Superstition is to religion what astrology is to astronomy. They are the mad daughters of sensible mothers.           
	The rejoicing at the confluence of different festivals is all very well, but one can imagine our law-keepers spending sleepless nights thinking about strategies to maintain peace and order on the day. We cannot leave everything to cosmic blessings and cosmetic unity. We have to practice what we preach. If we honestly believe in the unity of god, we should sometimes try to replace one name with the other in our private prayers. Most of us are brought up on a daily dose of their god, our god since childhood. Once we learn to unlearn this and understand the common ancestry of all men, a lot of our problems will be solved.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Holi is a joyous festival. But some revellers take things a bit too far on this day. The practice of throwing water balloons at passers-by from the refuge of ones home, for instance, goes against all norms of civility and democracy. Parents are sometimes seen encouraging their children in this. This is no way to teach manners to children. The Mumbai police have acted wisely by stationing their vans in major areas to help the victims of Holi balloons.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Tourists and VIPs flock to Santiniketan around the Basantotsab week. This has become a menace for the residents of this university town. As I approached the boom gate opposite the VIP guest house the other day, a motorcade of ten vehicles blocked my cars approach. I braked and let the busy vehicles pass, considering discretion to be the better part of valour. But then another big car drove down my side of the street at so great a speed that had I not veered left quickly, my Maruti van would have been in ruins, not to mention what would have remained of me in the mangled car. I stopped at the gate and asked the guard why he did not ask the car to slow down (since the speed limit on this stretch is 20 kmph). He said he could not, since it was a VIP car. When I asked if there were two sets of rules, one for the VIPs and another for us, he gave me a glance suggesting that I was nave to ask such questions. How long can these go unasked and unanswered?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyan Chatterjee, Santiniketan

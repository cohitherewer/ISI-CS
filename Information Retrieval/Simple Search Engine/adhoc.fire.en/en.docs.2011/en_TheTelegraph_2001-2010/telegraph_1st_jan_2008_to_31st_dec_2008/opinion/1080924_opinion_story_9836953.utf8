	The road to hell                  
	Sir  The Calcutta Municipal Corporation does not spare a chance to waste the taxpayers money on worthless attempts that are supposed to beautify the city. The latest in the list of the CMCs noble schemes are water-sprayers meant to clean roads. A tanker appears everyday, around seven in the morning and six in the evening, and sprinkles water only on one side of Sarat Bose Road. Such partial wetting of the roads does more harm than good: instead of serving its purpose, it makes the busy intersection with Meghnad Saha Sarani muddy and slippery. The tankers also waste a huge quantity of precious water. It is also funny to see the tankers spraying water even in pouring rain. Now that the pujas have arrived, the CMC has started its seasonal patchwork on the roads again. The repair work is seldom thorough, and gaping craters are hastily covered up making the streets look uglier than ever. Once the festive season is over, the roads will surely be dug up all over again.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Bhubaneswar has lately earned the epithet of crater capital. The potholes on the streets of Bhubaneswar are not only innumerable, but each is also deeper than the last. The primary responsibility of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation is obviously the upkeep of city roads, but it seems that this task is far from a priority. the BMCs obsession with wall painting, tree-plantation drives and decorative lighting on a few select roads leaves it with little time to spare a thought for roads. While the roads in VIP areas hog the BMCs attention, the craters on stretches inhabited by plebeians get bigger by the day.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar 

      
	Sir  Recently, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation introduced a one rupee ride on Vajra buses for four days as a promotional offer. The buses, BMTC and the state government got a fair degree of publicity, thanks to the offer. However, giving unbelievably cheap rides is definitely not the way to promote public transport vehicles. People will have to spend more money to travel in these buses sooner or later, so why lure them now with low fares? Besides, the BMTC must also have suffered huge monetary losses during the four days. It is apparent that the taxpayer will be forced to make up for the loss with his hard-earned money.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Road accidents are frequent in Calcutta, even though the number of policemen controlling traffic continues to rise. Recently, I observed that about 23 crossings in the stretch between Girish Park and Esplanade  a distance of less than 3 kilometres  were each manned by a policeman. Almost all the automatic signals are controlled manually with policemen sitting in a cage-like enclosure at the corner of the crossing. Being seated in a particular position, they are unable to judge the condition of all the roads that converge at the crossing. As a result, no matter how many more traffic personnel are employed, accidents happen regularly and people keep losing their lives.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While walking along the footpath of Sarat Bose Road the other day, I was hit from behind by a car. The car obviously belonged to some rich man who was entering a club nearby. The vehicle had not cared to honk and it seemed to be in a rush. Moreover, the car-owner did not even apologize after the vehicle hit me. It seems that the rich and the powerful can get away with anything  be it flouting traffic rules or injuring unsuspecting pedestrians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I was returning with my family from Mandarmoni via Kolaghat on September 13. We remained caught up for nearly two hours near Kolaghat owing to the half-ruined Kolaghat Bridge. The bridge is in a terrible condition and is crammed with vehicles coming from both ways. When we got on the bridge after several hours, it was shaking horribly. I was shocked to think about the risks taken by the drivers of the trucks that pass through the rickety bridge everyday. I do not think that the government has yet taken any concrete step to repair that bridge. A new bridge standing just beside the old one has been left incomplete for at least two years now.           
	To add to the commuters woes, the traffic police on the highway are an indifferent lot. They stand and watch, even as vehicles speed past them to escape the bottleneck. Travelling through Kolaghat has been a shocking experience for all of us.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I am a young girl who occasionally travels outstation for work. Long-distance trains usually arrive in Howrah at late hours and I often find it difficult to hire a taxi at that time. Even if I do get one, it is reluctant to run on meter and quotes an implausible sum for the short journey. Moreover, there isnt a single policeman around to help. Can the authorities look into this problem please?           
	Yours faithfully,

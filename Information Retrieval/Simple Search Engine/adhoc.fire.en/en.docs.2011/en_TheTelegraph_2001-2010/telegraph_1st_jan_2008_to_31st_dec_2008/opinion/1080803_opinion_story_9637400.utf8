	 She may not have her predecessors charisma...or hairstyle, but Pratibha Patil is no less hard-working. Especially when it comes to staying in the public eye. Lest anyone forget  what with Somnath Chatterjee and Manmohan Singh grabbing all the limelight  that Patil completed a year in the Rashtrapati Bhavan last week, the presidential PR machinery went to work. Most media organizations received a detailed write-up of Patils activities along with a CD containing photographs under the theme, A Caring President. The write-up could put pre-budget economic surveys to shame, it had so many numbers. In her first year in office, the first woman president of India met  or so claimed the note  18,000 persons at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and another 4,000 during her visits to various states, and she has been to three Latin American countries on her maiden trip abroad. That is not all. The presidents website is the second most frequently visited among all the government websites (the first is that of the Central Board of Secondary Education). Patils website has recorded 43,050 hits on an average. Thats not what wed call unpopular  though we can think of a number of people who wouldnt worry about popularity if they got to spend a year in R Bhavan.                
	 Another person whose popularity graph rose last week is Omar Abdullah. After his powerful speech supporting the Indo-US nuke deal in parliament, the suave Kashmiri has gained quite a few friends and some foes too  the latter comprising those who had hoped he would vote with the NDA against the deal. Abdullah mentions in his blog on the National Conference website that he wanted to narrate the incidents that led up to my speech, but he has decided to save them for my book if I ever get down to writing one. The man himself may not be forthcoming, but the grapevine has it that the Congress played a masterstroke by using his brother-in-law, Sachin Pilot, to win over his support. In soccer terms, this would be called clever man-marking. Another unlikely candidate deputed to do the same job was Ghulam Nabi Azad, who got in touch with Omars father, Farooq Abdullah, soon after becoming the Kashmir CM. The friendship paid off during the trust vote, and is all set to get even stronger as the assembly elections close in on the conflict-ridden state of Kashmir.                            
	 The jury is still out on whether anything constructive came out of the trust vote debate, but for the Congress, the real construction began after the dust had settled on the affair. Quite literally speaking, that is. The party headquarters at 24 Akbar Road, a Type VII bungalow in sarkari jargon, is about to be expanded. The building has over 30 rooms now. But the hazards of ruling the country are such that more rooms are needed. The Samajwadi Party looks all set to grab a few ministerial portfolios. When that eventually happens, the administrative blocks will be hard pressed to accommodate the ever-increasing army of ministers. The expansion of the Congress HQ is in anticipation that some of the partys ministers will be forced to set up offices there. Noting the enthusiasm of petroleum minister Murli Deora towards the project, Congress insiders are wondering whether it has anything to do with the chance to spend office hours in the party HQ.                            
	 Journos covering the PMO are in a tizzy. Sanjaya Baru, the PMs media adviser, is busy packing his bags, and there is no sign of a successor. In the absence of an authorized voice, scribes are running from pillar to post and still not getting either a confirmation or denial on the rumoured changes in the cabinet. Will Shibu Soren get coal? Has Amar Singh named the portfolios of his choice? Who knows? No prizes for guessing that the only winners in this round are the rumour mills.                            
	 If its Maharashtra, you must own a newspaper. Well, most of them do. The Thackerays have Saamna, Sharad Pawars family owns one, CM Vilasrao Deshmukh prefers to express his views in Ekmat  and now, Deshmukhs bet noire, Narayan Rane, has launched Prahar. While you ponder over the choice of the name, dont you think the BJP should join the fray before its late?                            
	 LK Advani is in his eighties. Manmohan Singh is 76. And more than two-thirds of Indias voters are below 35. So, if elections were to happen next month, what chance would any of the two have of being projected as the prime ministerial candidate?    
	FOOTNOTE      
	 Rahul Gandhi looking up Vidarbha farmers does not necessarily mean rural India has become fashionable in the Congress. As a matter of fact, panchayati raj  the pet project of Rahuls late father  is a child no Congressman wants to keep, even as he swears by the Dynasty. The Union minister for panchayati raj, Mani Shankar Aiyar, made a valiant attempt to make the party more active in the functioning of grassroots democracy. But he found that there werent enough volunteers to head the partys panchayati raj units in the states. This is where Aiyars long experience came good. He managed to squeeze Rs 18 lakh from the otherwise tight-fisted party treasurer, Motilal Vora. Now the money is being offered to all those partymen who are willing to spread the message of panchayati raj across rural India. We hope Aiyar has an equally effective plan to deal with over-enthusiastic men in Nehru topis.

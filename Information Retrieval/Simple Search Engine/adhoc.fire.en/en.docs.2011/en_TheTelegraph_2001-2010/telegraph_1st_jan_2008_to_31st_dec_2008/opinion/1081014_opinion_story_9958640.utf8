The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too little of a good thing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TOO LITTLE OF A GOOD THING                                  It may not always be the fear of a bomb that turns a peaceful crowd desperate, writes Somak Ghoshal                           Kalighat temple, Calcutta                                  
	On ashtami, I revisited the Kalighat temple after several years. From the time I was a toddler till I left Calcutta for higher studies in my mid-twenties, I would unfailingly accompany my great-grand-aunt to the nearest pandal to offer pushpanjali on the third morning of the Durga Puja, followed by a ritual tour of Kalighat to seek further blessings from Durgas fearsome double.         
	Something more complicated than piety made me endure those two hours of mayhem, first inside the stifling enclosure of the pandal, and then, out in the open, on the temple premises. Despite the urgent press of human bodies, jostling one another for the best portion of divine benediction, each of these spaces would usher me into its very own sociological and emotional field the moment I stepped in.         
	And indeed, one does step across, in more senses than one, an intangible threshold on entering the pandal or the temple. Not only do we relinquish the privacy of home as we venture inside the pandal or the temple, but we also undergo a transition in the world inside our heads: from the headiness of middle-class domesticity we are plunged into the headiness of middle-class spirituality.               
	Inside the pandal, the gentle haze of burning incense, the lugubrious incantations of the priest and the glittering eyes of the goddess filled me, as a child, with a mixture of dread and drowsiness. It was perhaps that naughty glee of being allowed to throw things at the goddess  flowers, in this case  without being roundly rebuked for once that kept me going. Between each round of anjali, the neighbourhood children would wager, in loud whispers, where the next lot of wilted flowers would land  the lions tail, the mahisasuras biceps, the priests nose or perhaps the shining pate in the front row. The gathering crowd gave a nice cover to these juvenile pranks.        
	Much like children playing truant, grown-ups, too, seek out crowds for similar reasons  to get a cover, a convenient alibi, for their actions. A crowd, when united by a common cause and call to action, can either choose to act in good faith or unleash the most unspeakable evil. For this reason, social revolutions that begin with noble intentions often turn into projects of mass-murder.        
	But this either/or model  of willingly choosing to do harm or good  breaks down in the case of people coming together not because of their shared politics but because they are united by a particular emotion. It could be piety, in case of pilgrimages, frivolity in carnivals or grief in funerary processions. Fragile as these feelings are, they have the power to influence gatherings in unpredictable and bizarre ways. It need not be the threat of a bomb lurking nearby that sets off a stampede. Something as trivial as a few angry words, a bit of impatient shoving and pushing, can turn an apparently peaceful assembly dangerously volatile. Coriolanus, the doomed Roman emperor in Shakespeares play, ruined by the treacherous unquietness of his subjects, tellingly described the crowd as the beast with many heads.        
	This analogy of the crowd as an uncontrollable organism becomes vividly real closer home, although in a far more benign context. At the end of the ashtami puja in my perfectly respectable south Calcutta neighbourhood, I would observe a peculiar scene unfold. Men and women, dressed in their festive regalia  the smell of freshly starched dhotis and saris mingling with those of sandalwood soap and talcum powder  would march busily through the rising stench of crushed petals to collect their share of the prasad.         
	Although every packet of sandesh offered to the goddess would be scrupulously labelled with the name and gotra of the devotee, every year some of these sacred identification papers would get misplaced. The spirit of neighbourly bonhomie would instantly dissolve into mutual recriminations. If carnival brings about the suspension of everyday life, then Middle Bengal takes this truism to heart, judging by its hysterical efforts to win divine favours.        
	A few yards away, on the precincts of Kalighat, an uglier form of such a brawl would unfold, something that seems to have become as timeless a feature of the place as the trail of beggars that leads up to the portals of the temple. This year, too, the serpentine queue of devotees was interspersed with beggars, lepers, pimps and the pandas. Lined up along a makeshift bamboo fencing, this sea of freshly-bathed and barefoot humanity seemed to be fused into one indistinguishable whole. Policemen tried their best to keep order, although they seemed oblivious to the openly soliciting pandas.              
	One of the pandas approached me tentatively and offered to sneak me in through the VIP entrance, all for the princely sum of Rs 200. He must have made this offer to many others, yet the hordes gathered outside either could not afford to pay him or else preferred the hard way to salvation. Outside Gate No. 1, a few women were prostrating themselves in prayer, as a cluster of madly intertwined hands and faces fought their way inside. Plunged into this maddening swirl, it is impossible to hold on to an abiding sense of the Self  inhibitions, repressions, every veneer of civility, are shed involuntarily.         
	Even the custodians of law and order matter little: the policemen could barely keep the growing mass from causing full-scale pandemonium, and the metal detectors could do little but bleep sheepishly. In a country of more than a billion, too many are always already fighting for too few resources. And the demand for divine blessing surpasses everything else.

	THE BIOSCOPE MAN By Indrajit Hazra, Penguin, Rs 299        
	Indrajit Hazras third novel, The Bioscope Man, is inspired by the brooding fatalism of film noir. But sadly, it is neither a film nor noir enough. The story, set in the early years of silent movies in Calcutta, unfolds cinematographically  through interludes, flashback, cuts, slow-motion detailing. Given this dynamic structuring, the plot would have better suited the idiom of motion pictures than the printed word. It also appears that Hazra, in the true-blue bioscopic tradition, has taken the pledge of entertaining his readers relentlessly, which, yet again, gives his book the feel of a hearty potboiler.        
	The opening sets out the tone of deadpan wackiness that the rest of the novel huffs and puffs to keep up with. The first ten pages focuses on Tarini Chatterjee (father of the narrator, Abani Chatterjee), chomping an inappropriate number of shingaras just before a train ride at the inauguration of the spanking new Haora Station building  red brick, iron, very neat and English. This self-righteous employee of the East Indian Railway commits a couple of dreadful, life-transforming blunders in quick succession. In a tearing hurry, he hops inadvertently into a Europeans Only carriage and finds himself seated opposite his bosss daughter, the prissily aristocratic, Adela Quested. (This is Hazras wicked nudge-and-wink at the repressed and forever indecisive Ms Quested in Fosters Passage to India.) The more horrifying moment comes shortly after, when Tarini pukes the just-consumed savouries on her. This results in his demotion, descent into drink, depression and abjection, which is further aggravated by his wife Shabitris fortuitous tumble in the bathroom, reducing her into a supine vegetable. Though a minor presence, Mrs Chatterjee is perhaps the most enduringly mysterious character that Hazra creates.        
	Against this backdrop, we encounter the hero, Abani Chatterjee, who grows up in the early turbulent years of 20th-century Calcutta. He spends his childhood in a politically volatile atmosphere, a witness to the shifting of the capital to Delhi, the partition of Bengal and the emerging nationalism. But the ferment does not touch his self-absorbed adolescence. He continues to pee regularly out of the window of his room on to the street, watches the family doctor lick his immobile mother surreptitiously and his father heading determinedly towards ruin. Along the way, he is introduced to theatre and bioscope by his enigmatic Shombhu-mama. Then comes the rags-to-riches moment, when, in an emergency, Abani is asked to play the lead in Prahlad Parameswar, later turned into a bioscope by the veteran director, Horen Roy.        
	This might appear to be a fairly thin summary, but really there is nothing more to the story so far. Hazras prose, though peppered with clever asides, is fond of piling up metaphors  courtship has to be with the determination of an Assam rhino, rumour is that raspy-voiced bird with flapping wings. It seems as if Hazra is fearful not only of losing his reader, but also his own interest in the narrative, which is why he has to keep up a constant stream of forced witticism. With more severe editing  the Intervals punctuating the chapters are more distracting than relevant  the 307 pages could have been reduced at least by a quarter, making the action more taut and engaging.         
	Hazra deserves credit for coming up with an idea that is, if not original, at least susceptible to the energy of his prose. However, a novel is not merely the sum total of wild aphorisms or cleverly concocted situations. Without a credible dramatis personae it does not take off at a human level, however infectious the teasing intellectual energy, range of references, puns, allusions and images. Most of Hazras characters are not fully fleshed out. Even Abani, the novels central consciousness, tends to be a stereotype of a certain kind of doomed hero. He is first the rising star, then the disgraced molester of Adela Quested, the bad omen trailing the Chatterjee family like a shadow. Then he turns to the bottle  the passages on Abanis alcoholic musings are a little over-indulgent  and finally, he reinvents himself riding on the back of the renowned German director, Fritz Monocle Lang, who casts him as Ramlochan Pandit, Sanskrit teacher to William Jones, in the film called The Pandit amp; The Englishman. There is a wealth of material here, but this is the plenitude that stifles, not facilitates, creativity.        
	History is the most generous muse for the novelist, providing an inexhaustible fount of ideas, intrigues, devices and designs. The challenge lies in harnessing this plethora into a shape that does not pall on the eye with its predictability. Hazra is acutely anxious to show us the full range of his research instead of judiciously choosing the essential bits from it. There are just too many tricks in his bag, and most of them not entirely unfamiliar.        
	The presiding genius of this tale is, of course, Lang himself. The transition from silent movies to the talkies that Hazra traces takes place around the arrival of the German master in Calcutta to shoot a life of William Jones. This visit, too, turns out to be another weird moment in Abani Chatterjees forever-shifting destiny. As Lang goes on to make his masterpiece Metropolis in 1927, Abani is left forlorn with a supposedly terrible secret. However, it is difficult, even with the best of intentions, to suspend disbelief and be surprised by this secret. The end is rather abrupt, even a bit pat, with Abani bidding a Dickensian farewell. Hazra certainly has a lot of potential, but he would do well to remember these words from Metropolis: There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as a mediator.

	Appearances can be deceptive, but it would appear that the political shadow that had loomed over the survival of the United Progressive Alliance government has passed. This is due partly to the resolution of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to go ahead with the Indo-US nuclear deal. It is also due to  and the importance of this should not be underestimated  some hardnosed negotiations that may have won over Mulayam Singh Yadav to support the government and thus provide it with the required number in the Lok Sabha if the government were to face a vote. The nature of Mr Yadavs support remains nebulous. The uncertainty comes from the suspicion that he will extract his pound of flesh for his rescue act. Mr Yadavs demands will unfold, but his initial statements have revealed something that might make comrade Prakash Karat rue his decision to withdraw support if the government goes ahead with the deal. It is not as if Mr Yadav does not have reservations about the deal, but he believes that these are not enough to topple the government and thus throw the country into political uncertainty. Mr Yadav is willing to express his reservations and support the government. Mr Karats stand was more absolutist.        
	Mr Karat carried his party with him perhaps without realizing that his stand would lead to the political isolation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). No political formation will any longer trust the CPI(M) as an ally, given its record of obstructionism and inconsideration. At a more practical level, if the government survives without the support of the Left, what happens to Left-run governments in places like West Bengal? Left governments will be left bereft of any bargaining chip. Someone like Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will have to approach the Central government as beggarman rather than as partner. When such a reduction in status takes place, Mr Bhattacharjee will have no one else to blame save the general secretary of his party. Take another and a more extreme scenario: if, despite Mr Yadavs support, the government opts for early polls, the CPI(M) in a state like West Bengal, will find itself on a sticky wicket. Mr Karat could take a lesson or two from Yadav in the art of maximizing the possible. Mr Karat has minimized possibilities for his party.

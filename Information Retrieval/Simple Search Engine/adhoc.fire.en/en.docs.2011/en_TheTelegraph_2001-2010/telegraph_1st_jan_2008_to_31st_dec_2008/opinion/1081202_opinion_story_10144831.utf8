	Demolition man                  
	Sir  It is a pity that the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, chose to withhold his temple-razing drive (Modi halts temple demolition, Nov 23). Nonetheless, he deserves praise for his bold attempt to rid Gandhinagar city of the illegal structures of worship, an endeavour that earned him the title of Aurangzeb from the president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Ashok Singhal. Modis command to demolish the hundreds of unauthorized temples in Gandhinagar proved to be disagreeable even to the affiliates of his own party. Indeed, coming from one of the staunchest supporters of the Hindutva brand of politics, Modis order had been quite startling. He would have proved his point really well had he gone forward with the project even after objections from his party men and Singhal.          
	Taking the cue from Modis initial stance, one hopes that members of the ruling party in West Bengal would do something about the illegal temples in Calcutta. Sprouting anywhere and everywhere in our city, these structures eat up a lot of public space, much to the inconvenience of pedestrians. On special festive days, the spiritual fervour of the devotees spills out of the temples into the streets, causing traffic congestions. Since our communist chief minister presumably has no obligation to ingratiate himself to Hindu radicals, as Modi perhaps has, nothing should stop Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from sanctioning an order to demolish unlawful temples.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In our country, many plans for civic development or beautification fall flat on the face because there are illegal shrines on the roads and self proclaimed religious gurus would not allow them to be flattened. It is unfortunate that Narendra Modi had to give in to pressure from his party and stop the demolition drive.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amlan Dasgupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Although Narendra Modis order to raze the illegal temples in Gandhinagar was retracted later, the order in itself proved the guts of Gujarats chief minister. One can hardly label him a fundamentalist if he could put civic considerations before party ideology. Modi is genuinely concerned about the common man, as his proposal to raze the temples proved. He would rather have a cleaner city and smoother traffic than earn accolades from his party men for playing safe.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Dear departed          
	Sir  Living in these ruthless times, when human lives come cheap, to have the expectation of sincere care from the practising veterinary community admittedly borders on foolishness. Yet one cannot but rest ones trust on the available veterinary doctors if ones pet falls ill. Our pet labrador, Jenny, died an untimely death just because of inefficient doctors. It all started two months ago with, what our vet told us, was to be a simple operation to remove a tumour from Jennys tummy. But the surgery supposedly failed to detect the growth and Jenny was made to go under the knife once again two weeks after the first operation. A week or so went by, the new stitches had almost healed when Jenny developed acute breathing trouble. She had in attendance a senior surgeon attached to the Alipore Zoo, and a group of vet paramedics. Although we repeatedly drew their attention to Jennys persisting discomfort, all that they did by way of treatment was to inject strong antibiotics, all-purpose vitamins and a couple of steroids into her. Jennys agony lasted for three days and then she passed away, leaving us frozen in despair and disbelief. The doctor had paid his visit just an hour prior to Jennys death and had assured us that everything was under control. Our frantic calls to this doctor after Jennys death did not even elicit his apology for having failed to cure her. So beware pet lovers  the next time you walk out of a vets chamber with a lighter pocket and a long prescription, you could well be up against one of the smooth-talking professionals who would not be bothered in the least about the well-being of your dear one.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Breaking down          
	Sir  Ashok Desais article, Misreading the crisis (Nov 25), was a sheer delight. Desai makes three significant analytical points that Indian policy makers appear to be blissfully unaware of. First, he draws our attention to Keyness fundamental insight that aggregate savings in an economy represents output produced but not demanded by households. So, a rise in savings is no cause for jubilation unless it is accompanied by a rise in investment or net exports or some other form of expenditure. The second vital issue he raises takes us back to Evsey Domars celebrated 1946 work, where he observed that a rise in investment implies a corresponding rise in the capacity of production. Recession looms large when the additional capacity is not matched by a commensurate rise in demand. And there is nothing in the free market system that can guarantee simultaneous increases in aggregate demand and production capacity.           
	Finally, Desai points out why a reduction of interest rates and injection of money into the system may not induce banks to lend to investors in the presence of a confidence crisis. As he rightly argues, the public at large may hold on to currency rather than to bank deposits, and not even spend it when the future appears too uncertain. Although Desai does not bring up technical terminology, what he clearly has in mind in this context is the well-known Keynesian liquidity trap. In these circumstances, as every economist worth his salt is realizing today, mindless monetary policy cannot bring succour to our economy and the government must begin to think seriously in terms of demand generation through fiscal policy. Even if such a policy leads to deficit budgets and money creation, it is likely to improve the economys health far more effectively than money management through repo rates and the cash reserve ratio. Indeed, the policies being pursued by the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India at the moment revive memories of a classic Beatles song: You never give me your money/ You only give me your funny paper/ And in the middle of negotiations/ You break down!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A jaguar roves
                                                                                                                 A JAGUAR ROVES                                                    
	It is a measure of the success of the liberalization process in India that Indian companies have the confidence to buy companies abroad, and that too companies with formidable reputations. Time was when Indian companies suffered from a congenital inferiority complex in the international arena. The acquisition by Tata Motors of Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford is a sign of this growing confidence. It is fitting that Ratan Tata should clinch this deal since Jamsetji Tata had brought a motor car to Bombay in as early as 1901. The Tatas have always been a source of great pride for Indians, and men like Jamsetji Tata and J.R.D. Tata had become legends in their lifetimes. Ratan Tata is continuing that tradition based on sound business sense, hard work and a vision. The acquisition of Corus last year and now the buying up of Jaguar and Land Rover are informed by a vision to expand and to improve upon the formidable achievements of the Tata group of companies. Indian industry has come of age and the future can only represent more growth.        
	Looking at the specifics of the triumph that Mr Tata has registered, two points need to be made. Neither Jaguar nor Land Rover any longer belongs to the top end of the automobile market, which has been completely taken over by cars made in Germany. Jaguar may have had a past, it has little or no future as it stands. Those who can, ride or drive a Porsche or a BMW. This may well pose a problem for Tata Motors as it begins to refashion these two brands to meet a new and more competitive environment. The other point concerns what the Tatas can bring to these two cars to make them attractive to a particular section of car buyers. The assumption seems to be that better management alone will enable the two acquisitions to turn around. Here it is reasonable to presume that Mr Tata has not allowed his confidence and optimism to prevail over the fact that the real strength of Tata Motors lies in the efficient production of trucks and cars that provide value for money for consumers. It needs to be remembered that when Mr Tata first mooted the idea of a small car worth Rs 1 lakh, doubters were a dime a dozen. Mr Tata has proved all of them wrong. It will be very unfair to Mr Tata not to believe that he can prove doubters wrong once again. Mr Tata should be allowed to be a rover; he can perhaps make the jaguar run at its very fast speed.

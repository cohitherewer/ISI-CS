The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | to be popular
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TO BE POPULAR                                                    
	Populism is the priority. The victim of this is inevitably governance and development. The best example of this is the statement by the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, that agricultural land for industries and roads would be acquired only after securing the consent of the owners of the land. The immediate effect of this announcement is that a number of important projects will be put on hold, maybe indefinitely. The only plausible conclusion that can be drawn is that Mr Bhattacharjee is uncomfortable with taking and implementing decisions that he or his party fears will be unpopular. The real meaning of unpopular in this context is that the decisions will result in the loss of votes. A priority has been put on votes and popularity over development and governance. Unfortunately for Mr Bhattacharjee, neither governance nor political leadership is about being popular or winning elections. Both are about doing what is right and about setting the agenda. A true leader does not follow the popular will  he makes it.        
	History shows that pioneers and leaders never make a virtue of seeking popularity. If either Rammohun Roy or Iswarchandra Vidyasagar had been concerned with popular opinion and consent, two of the landmark pieces of social engineering in the history of Bengal would have been stillborn. Both the abolition of sati and the introduction of the remarriage of Hindu widows were hugely unpopular in the 19th century. Roy and Vidyasagar were lampooned and ridiculed in their own lifetime, but this did not stop them from carrying out projects that they thought were absolutely essential for the modernization of Indian society. Posterity remembers and respects them for their courage, foresight and the contributions they made. History is not made by those who want to be popular. It is made by those who establish the agenda for their own times.        
	Populism is the commonest affliction of all Indian politicians. Very few have what is required to go against the current. Most, in the name of leadership, fall prey to the quest for votes. Hence all tough, and therefore unpopular, decisions fall by the wayside. However, within this general trend, West Bengal appears as a very special case. The state has been on the populism tide for as long as recent memory serves. It is futile only to blame successive governments for this failure. The people of the state must also take their share of the state of affairs that has made West Bengal economically backward. The people have supported governments that have, out of choice, taken soft and populist decisions. This is a blot on the history of a people who once set the national agenda. The political leadership of West Bengal has been cravenly populist. But people get the leadership they deserve.

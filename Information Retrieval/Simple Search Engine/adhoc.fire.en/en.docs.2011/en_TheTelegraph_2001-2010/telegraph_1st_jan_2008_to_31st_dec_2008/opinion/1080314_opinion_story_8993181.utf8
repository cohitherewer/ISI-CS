	Be very afraid                  
	Sir  It is inexplicable why the officers-in-charge at Lake police station failed to investigate the theft of Rs 70,000 from a trunk in Manju Dass shanty (In police book, poor cant be robbed, March 9). Why should they doubt Manjus intentions simply because she lives in a shanty? She had explained how she came upon the large sum of money, so the police did not really have a ground to delay the enquiry. It is not for the police to draw conclusions about ones truthfulness based on ones economic status. The Lake police station officers knew full well that no culprits could be brought to book on the basis of a general diary. And yet they refused to file an FIR. This was clearly an attempt to save themselves some legwork. There is no doubt that the chief minister is sincerely trying to impress upon the police officers the need to engage with the complaints of the poor, but he has to ensure that his ideas are implemented by those who report to him. He should use Manju Dass case to make the police aware of their dereliction of duty. If the police really get down to business, they can surely retrieve the ladys money within hours.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Telegraph must be applauded for exposing the ways in which our police operate, following their own sweet will. One must learn from Manju Das how to fight for a citizens right to justice. It is highly objectionable that the officer on duty, K.N. Das, did not record Manjus complaint as a first information report. Perhaps officers like K.N. Das are secure in the knowledge that there is no threat to their jobs, as evident from the manner in which high-ranked police personnel involved in the Rizwanur Rahman case got away with departmental transfers and were not punished enough to regret their wrongdoings. The chief ministers strict guidelines for the police to perform their duties are useless if his department is going to spare high-handed and indisciplined officers.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S.A.R. Barkati, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Manju Das can now breathe a sigh of relief, since a proper investigation has finally been started on the complaint of theft lodged by her (After snub, prod to act, March 10). However, had her case not caught the glare of the media, she would still have been doing the rounds of Lake thana, with little hope of redress. Manjus case is not an isolated one of police apathy. In fact, the police have become so arrogant, insensitive and corrupt that they have no qualms in refusing to act for someone who has neither money nor political power. It is ironic that the police force, which has one of the most extensive networks to reach the people, is often found turning away people who come to them after being wronged. The government should rein in the corrupt elements within the force by meting out the harshest of punishments for neglecting ones duty.           
	Yours faithfully,

	End game          
	Sir  The mishap that befell the Basu family on their drive back from a vacation in Santiniketan is an example of killing irresponsibility (Fatal end to family holiday, March 9). The head of the family who was at the wheel of the Santro may have thought rash driving on highways was fun, but he put his life, as well as those of his wife and son, at risk.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  The gruesome car accident near Singur on March 8 happened in broad daylight, when the owner-driven car collided with a stationary truck. The four-lane expressway has separate lanes for inward and outward traffic. This prevents head-on collision. There is also access control in the stretch under toll. But it is surprising how a car could collide with a truck supposedly standing on the slow lane. It needs to be investigated whether the truck was at fault. A year ago, another car had met with a similar accident on this road near Dankuni. On a few occasions that I have driven on this road to Durgapur or Asansol, I have noticed local vehicles plying on the wrong side of the highway, presumably for shortcuts. This has to stop. The straight and long stretches of this relatively hassle-free road may induce a momentary but fatal lapse of concentration in the driver. Mobile healthcare facilities need to be put up along these expressways to meet emergencies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Real champion          
	Sir  Viswanathan Anand repeated last years feat by winning the Morelia-Linares chess championship (Anand makes it 2 in a row, March 9). But with cricket fever all around, who has time for the most consistent performer in Indian sports?           
	Yours faithfully,

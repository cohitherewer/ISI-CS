               Current Australian cricketers are no role models. In fact, they are more at home in narrow racial and anti-social settings, writes Heather Goodall

	Iconic Australian sportspeople, such as Herb Elliot, Rob de Castella, John Bertram, Ron Barassi, Jill McIntosh and Jeff Lawson have been reported expressing their deep concern at the Australian Test teams on-field behaviour. They are the most eminent faces of the unprecedented wave of worried Australians who are overwhelming the press, television and online polling in high numbers (upto 83 per cent in yesterdays Daily Telegraph polling) to express their disappointment in the Australian Test side. I would argue that the Australian publics displeasure stems not only from a growing rejection of this teams well-known style of sledging and other aggressive on-field behaviour, but also from growing anger at the image created by the revenue-raising mechanisms the sport chooses which use cricketers poor on- and off-field behaviour to market socially damaging commercial products. Australians just might be growing sick and tired of both. 
    
	As an Australian parent with a family which loves to play and follow sports including cricket, we watched the Sydney Test like most others on the only available free-to-air broadcaster, the commercial Channel 9. Here viewers get the lot: vision, commentary and all the advertisements in between. Media research demonstrates that it is this overall broadcast pattern, not just the actual programme, which shapes the viewers understanding of what they see. The Channel 9 telecast gave a disturbing portrait of values directly associated with and apparently endorsed by elite Australian cricketers. 
       
	Peter Luck of the Sydney Morning Herald was angered at the cheapening of the Australian teams image by the fried chicken ads which flooded the Channel 9 broadcast, but he did not even mention the sickening beer advertisement that played over and over for the five days of the match, celebrating quite openly the on-field intimidation and the notorious and widely publicized off-field exploits of a famous, recently-retired Aussie spin bowler. The cricketer takes part in the ad in a number of scenes, one in a pub with another Australian cricketer while a voice over says roughly, but in an unmistakable sexual and homophobic reference: X could make almost any body turn, and then one where he is shown with his framed and garlanded genital protector to the voice over: And while now he might have to hang up the box, we can still raise a pint to Australias favourite son.
    
	We can look more closely at the ads and commentary surrounding the commercial vision of the Test to compare them with the claims advanced by Australians that they are seeking to oppose racism in sport. This is an important goal, but where was the racial diversity in the Channel 9 depiction of the Australian cricket-watching public? Where in the food ads or the barbeque scenes could be found the many eager sports fans from across a now-diverse Australian population whose backgrounds lie in cricket-loving but non-European countries, like those of Asia and the rest of the world? Where in the advertising scenes of game crowds and TV-watchers are the aboriginal people whose countrymen led the first Australian cricket tour to the United Kingdom in 1868? The message to viewers on the commercial channel is clear: this is a game enjoyed by Anglo Australians only. The commentators employed by Channel 9 reflected the same narrow racial limits, despite their different nationalities. Only occasionally was an Indian commentator invited onto the program. Yet the public broadcaster, the ABC, was able to employ an authoritative, incisive and entertaining Indian commentator on its radio broadcasts throughout the Test and drew actively on some of the Indian sports journalists travelling with the touring side. Why were non-European and particularly Indian faces and voices so rare on the commercial broadcaster?
    
	Some Australian media are complaining that bullying India is holding cricket to ransom by demanding reasonable standards of behaviour on the field. Yet India is now the major player in world cricket, not only because it has a high audience and therefore high capital investments in the sport, but mainly because eager Indian children, young adults and their families, are lining up in parks across the subcontinent to learn and enjoy a game which continues to inspire them to play to high standards of skill and sportsmanship. 
    
	As a parent in Australia, I can no longer encourage children to take up a sport, which promotes as role models these images of recent top Australian cricket players on and off the field: intimidatory, indisciplined and exploitative publicity-seekers in situations of unrealistic racial homogeneity. There was little evidence of any recognition, let alone invitations for the children of Australias many citizens who have Asian and other non-European backgrounds in cricket-loving cultures. Australia is at present desperately trying to stem the epidemic of obesity afflicting all developed nations by limiting the exposure of children to junk food. Even more urgent has been the national campaign to combat the abuse of drugs and alcohol. A related campaign endorsed by sportspeople aims to change severely high rates of family violence, much of it fuelled by alcohol. No matter how brilliant their cricket or how great their claim to defending racial tolerance, the men of the current and recent Australian teams have no place as role models if they continue to endorse commercial depictions of such deeply anti-social activities in such narrow racial settings. 
       
	Other elite Australian sports, whether amateur or professional, are not advertised in this anti-social and racially distorted way. Take ads for competitions in swimming, hockey, soccer, golf, netball, Australian-rules football. Even the pressure on Rugby League football to advertise with alcohol and junk food products is being challenged by courageous acts like the recent South Sydney Leagues Club decision to revive its club house as a genuine sport- and family-friendly centre. 
    
	Are the Channel 9 broadcasts the image of Australian cricketers that Captain Ponting and the Australian Cricket Board are trying to promote? Or do their high incomes mean that they no longer care? Is this the great Australian sporting tradition we are meant to embrace? When will the Australian cricketing authorities step in to demand a responsible approach from the corporations which are making so much money out of cricket but doing little more than undermine it in return, as the extraordinarily negative public reaction to the Australian team this Test controversy is suggesting?
    
	The few senior cricketers and sports-writers who have defended the values of Australias First XI appear to be in a minority. For the rest of us, the Australian cricket team has long since lost its honour, on and off the field, in a welter of money. The children taking up the game are the ones who are going to vote with their feet. In this respect it is India, not Australia, which will hold the future of the game.

	In the campuses across the state, it is the same scene now: long queues, anxious faces, impatient queries, supplications, tears and smiles. It is the season of college admissions. Soon, a new wave of eager young people will flood the corridors and classrooms. With each year, more boys and girls from rural backward communities are joining in. It is precisely these young people on whom our states current policy of industrialization is hinged. Thousands of boys and girls are enrolling in colleges and universities, our chief minister says time and again. Will they work on farms?        
	Surely they wont, and it is the duty of the government to take initiatives so that jobs are created for them. But these are frenetic times. Although new job opportunities are opening up, unemployment has cast lengthening shadows across traditional sectors. With faster technology and high rate of economic growth on the one hand and, on the other, rising inequality and the evils it breeds, not to mention the globalized job market, the concept of work and employment is being redefined. Gone are the days when a college or university degree could buy a nice, secure job that saw a person through to the placid twilight of retirement. The boys and girls thronging the campuses now will, three to five years on, find themselves in an increasingly different vocational world.        
	How are they preparing for this? How are the institutions equipping them to search out new avenues of employment? Such vague queries evoke, in the mind of one who has served in a number of district colleges, concrete cases.               
	Utpal Mondal is one of them. A weavers son from a remote Nadia village, Utpal aspired to enrol in an English honours course at a college in the district town. But he had neither a special love of literature (the only English book he could name was a novel called Romeo and Juliet by a writer named Mr Macbeth), nor a mastery over the language. His goal was clear: he wanted to learn English to get a job and, if possible, get through the School Service Commission examination. He didnt see any future in the family profession, though his father and two elder brothers were in it. They financed his study and stay in the town. Utpal shared a rented apartment with five fellow students from similar backgrounds.        
	Utpal is not alone. If a survey is conducted among college students in the districts, chances are that nine out of ten of them will be found to have similar goals. For many, becoming a high school teacher is the ceiling of their ambition, the more achievable aspiration being a Junior Basic Training diploma and a job in a primary school. But how many among the few lakh boys and girls who graduate every year from 600-odd colleges and 17 universities in West Bengal can achieve this goal? This year, for example, only around 15,000 have cleared the written test in the SSC examination. Hundreds of thousands of young graduates suffer a rude awakening when they find out that a BA or BSc degree is just a piece of paper that does not translate into a meaningful career option. Many go for expensive diplomas in fly-by-night institutes that make tall promises; others join the burgeoning group of drifters ponderously called sikkhito bekar  the educated unemployed.         
	In the city as well as in the districts, the colleges are responding to this reality by opening more job-oriented courses in subjects like computer applications, fashion technology, microbiology and the like. The relevance of many of these courses in the local contexts, the quality of teaching and infrastructure on offer, are part of another story. Recently, on two occasions, both the finance minister and the higher education minister expressed their doubts about this. But the more obvious fact is that most of these courses are expensive and they absorb a tiny portion of the degree-seekers. In almost all state-aided undergraduate institutions, the traditional courses with outdated curricula and scant technical support still make up the bread and butter of the business of education.         
	When Utpal invited me to their little hostel in a squalid part of the town, I was bemused to meet there a Muslim boy studying Sanskrit (honours), and another Santhal boy studying philosophy. Matin Islam, a landless farmers son and a first-generation college-goer, was from Utpals village. Bishu Hembrams father worked in a colliery in Asansol. For a moment, I was ready to believe that this was part of an exciting new social revolution, until Matin helped me see reason. No, Matin and Bishu were not ardent knowledge-seekers breaking into forbidden brahminical territory. For them, two factors had determined their choice of the subjects: one, the subjects were recognized by the SSC; and two, there were seats available for low-scoring candidates like them. Both were depending on private tuition and cheap, made-easy books to obtain their degree.        
	With around 70 engineering institutes in our state now, the pure science departments in degree colleges are languishing. It is the arts streams (which include humanities and social sciences) that help the colleges break even. Free from the constraints of laboratory-based curricula, these arts departments have turned into great absorbents. In fact, in many rural and district colleges, enrolments often exceed two to three times their capacity. But nobody is complaining.         
	Higher education is big business now. Even within the ambit of the state-aided university-affiliated system, scores of entrepreneurs operate at different levels. Advertisements of college-level text books churned out by local publishers now proliferate on prime-time television, jostling for commercial space with automobile and detergent commercials.              
	What does it all add up to for boys like Utpal, for whom the chief minister is sketching the blueprint of a resurgent, industrialized West Bengal? Well, Utpal passed out of the college four years ago but has not been able to secure a schoolteachers job. He has not returned to his village home. If I go back, Ill have to sit at the family loom, he rues. I cant do that now. Instead, he remains in the town and writes job applications in his atrocious English. Three years of higher education has not been able to teach him the language, or any other skill that can be of any use in getting a job. But that does not deter him from scraping out a living by giving private tuitions to school students. In fact, one finds these tutors among the educated unemployed even in remote villages, spawning a sub-system of basic education.         
	By the time, if ever, West Bengal becomes a resurgent haven of employment, Utpal will be too old to catch the bus. Meanwhile, one wonders, couldnt the three years in college have taught him some tangible skills that would have helped him get a better grip on his destiny? If Utpal could write a proper loan application, could read and understand the fine print of various government schemes, could negotiate with finance agencies, perhaps he could have saved his ailing family business of weaving. If he could trawl the networked world of information for technology and design, if he could make contacts with garment export agencies, perhaps he could have become an entrepreneur. Not very far away from Utpals village, in Shantipur and Fulia, saris worth millions of rupees are exported every year.         
	But these are idle speculations. At least Utpal makes a living as a private tutor. As illiteracy stalks Matins village, there are no takers for his learning. The last time I saw him hanging about the campus, he was wearing the badge of a political students organization. For thousands of boys like him, this is another career option: to become the cannon fodder of political parties. Whether or not there is industrialization in West Bengal, this industry will thrive here as long as there is a steady supply of sikkhito bekar.

This Act provides for a witness to be present when a food inspector is taking samples. No independent witnesses were present when samples were collected from the milkman and the conviction was challenged on this basis. The prosecution argued that witnesses could not be examined as the accused had a cordial relationship with the locals and might exert influence. The Allahabad High Court pointed out that he had no establishment in the locality and was poor so it was unlikely that he would have influence over people. It held that presence of a witness is essential and acquitted the accused (Narendra Kumar vs Nagar Swasth Adhikari).   Show me the money  Departmental proceedings were started against a government servant for acquiring assets disproportionate to his income and a case was lodged under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The officer explained that the assets were actually acquired by his wife, an income tax assessee, with profits from the business she ran with her parents, so the departmental proceedings were dropped. On this basis, the accused petitioned the court to quash the case. Pointing out that it was not known if the accused had obtained permission from the appropriate authorities for his wife to run a business, the Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that a simple statement about the source of income was not sufficient to drop proceedings (N. Vivekananda vs State of AP).   A dog rsquo;s life  In a murder case, the police took the help of the dog squad during investigation but did not include the relevant report while filing the charge sheet. The Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that withholding such evidence would lead to presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act. While the report could not be treated as conclusive evidence, it would have definitely been useful in bolstering the case. Since the police had chosen to avail of such services, the report should have been submitted, especially since the accused was acquitted because of a weak prosecution case (Mangamma vs State of AP).

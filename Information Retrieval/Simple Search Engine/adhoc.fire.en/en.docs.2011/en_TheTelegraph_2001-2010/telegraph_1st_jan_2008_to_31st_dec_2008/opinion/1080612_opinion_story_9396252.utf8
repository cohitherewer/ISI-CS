	After a long time there is something on which the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, can be applauded. Without any dithering he has described as improper the police raid on a room rented by two girls near Jadavpur. This forthrightness on the part of the chief minister stands in sharp contrast to his behaviour last year after the death of Rizwanur Rahman. On that occasion, the chief ministers image had taken a severe beating. From a chief minister with a human and cultured face, he had suddenly become the personification of indifference and a defender of police highhandedness. Mr Bhattacharjee has obviously learnt his lesson. He has realized that as the chief minister of the state, he has to uphold the rule of law. As the chief minister, he must also speak to his home secretary, who seems to believe that the police can flout the law at their will. This is not how a senior member of the Indian Administrative Service should talk. The art of being a bureaucrat is the art of being subtle.        
	There is more to this case than what the chief minister has said. The ostensible reason for the raid was the suspicion that the girls were Maoists or Maoist sympathizers. The most relevant fact of the matter is that Maoist/Naxalite political parties are not outlawed in the state of West Bengal, unlike in some other states. This means that within the laws of the land, any person can hold and propagate Maoist views (however defined). Commitment to such views cannot be regarded as a violation of the law. If the police think that a person or persons upholding such views has/have transgressed the law, there are due processes institutionalized within the Constitution and the legal framework for charging such a person or persons and then bringing him/them to justice. The onus of proof lies always with the police or the accuser. While attempting to raid the place where the girls lived, the police did not follow any of the due processes. They were not even armed with a search warrant. This is actually the most amazing part since getting a search warrant could not have taken the police any time or caused them trouble. They chose to act without the warrant and thus came up against a wall of protest by residents of the locality who seemed to be aware of their fundamental rights. The chief minister must inquire what it is in the police force that makes it act in a highhanded manner time and again.

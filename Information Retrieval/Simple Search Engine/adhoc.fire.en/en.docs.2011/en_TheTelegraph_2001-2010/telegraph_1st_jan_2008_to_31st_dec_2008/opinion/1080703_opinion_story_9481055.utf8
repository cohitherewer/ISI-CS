	Auto-cracy                  
	Sir  Jayanta Basus report on autorickshaws was an excellent piece of investigative journalism (Autorickshaws pay crores to run riot on Calcutta roads, June 29). I had heard unconfirmed rumours even in 2003-04 that every autowallah paid a certain political leader Re 1 everyday  augmenting the mans income. With the drivers enjoying a personal relationship, so to speak, with the men in authority, it is small wonder that they can have a free run on the streets of Calcutta.           
	I often used to travel in share- cars from Sector V in Salt Lake to Ruby hospital back in 2004. I remember an auto driver once coming and threatening the driver of the car with dire consequences if he dares to pick passengers up from Sector V. Such mafia-like behaviour is not unusual of autowallahs. They can threaten drivers of other vehicles, insult passengers or disregard traffic rules because they enjoy the support of influential political leaders.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Shyamal Pain, Missouri, US

                
	Sir  The revelation about autorickshaws using a dangerous mixture of petrol, kerosene and other lubricants, commonly known as katatel, was devastating. Madly racing autos cause a large number of deaths on the streets of Calcutta. Add to this the deaths they are causing indirectly by polluting the atmosphere. As the drivers try all means to increase their profit and Citu unions get richer by the day, the only party that loses out are the hapless passengers. They have to shell out substantial amounts to cover a short distance, breathe in poisonous air and travel under the risk of having their lives cut short any moment.           
	The long-term harm the autorickshaws are causing by spreading pollution is more threatening than the immediate menace posed by the vehicles. The drivers are not only putting our lives, but also those of our children, in jeopardy. The traffic sergeants may not act against the auto drivers because they are afraid of the powerful unions. But what about the West Bengal Pollution Control Board? Does it also have secret link with the Citu? The callousness of every department supposed to enforce the law is truly appalling. Such a dismal situation can prevail only in West Bengal, where the leaders put the lives of the people at risk without compunction.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Surajit Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The report by Jayanta Basu reveals how the citizens of Calcutta are getting robbed  of money as well as fresh air  by the criminal nexus consisting of autorickshaw owners/drivers, party comrades, members of the Citu and the police. The ransom paid by the auto drivers to the Citu unions amounts to about Rs 19.80 crore a year. However, since the payment is unofficial, the money is illegal.          
	While the Rs 19.80 crore is only a rough estimate of the tax collected unlawfully by the Citu, what is more easily measurable is the damage being done to the environment by the drivers use of katatel for their vehicles. There is also the loss incurred by the state exchequer because the auto drivers are not buying petrol or diesel from the authorized retail outlets. At a time when the common man is trying hard to cope with the rise in price of petrol and diesel, the drivers are easily able to bypass the effects of the hike by using the cheaper katatel.           
	It is unfortunate that state ministers, without whose consent the state of affairs would not have reached the stage that it is in now, are beyond the arm of the law. And that is why the public cannot even hope to have any redress in this case. The situation is pathetic all the more because the Opposition is ineffective in West Bengal. While it at least makes a show of protest on every issue affecting the common man, it is significantly silent on the network between autorickshaw drivers and Citu unions. If the ruling party of West Bengal is corrupt, the Opposition is negligent. Caught between the two, the people have lost the chance of ever leading a better life.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Suman S. Dasgupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The unchallenged run of autorickshaws on the streets of Calcutta is proof of the complete collapse of the state administration, which controls the Citu unions. The unions use their clout to extract Rs 5 to Rs 10 every day from the auto drivers. The state transport minister cannot be unaware of this illegal practice. Yet he chooses to do nothing about it, probably because he is one of its indirect beneficiaries. The autorickshaws have a thriving business in Calcutta because of the dismal traffic situation here. When buses and taxis remain caught up in interminable traffic jams for hours, autos make their way through them by taking bylanes. The auto menace can be curbed only with a complete revamping of the state transport system. And this can start only by removing the man at the head of this corrupt structure.          
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There was a time, not very long ago, when newspaper reports indicting the government for its failure in any area would be taken up with the seriousness they deserved and necessary action would be initiated. But those were the days when the media used to be regarded as one of the pillars of democracy. Unfortunately, this is not so anymore. Otherwise, how can the relentless campaign of The Telegraph against the public transport system, and now against the autorickshaws of Calcutta, fail to move the government into action? The governments inaction proves its indifference to the welfare of the people. It has even disregarded the directives of the Calcutta High Court against the polluting autorickshaws. Thanks to the report, Autorickshaws pay crores to run riot on Calcutta roads, we now know why the administration is so benevolent towards the autowallahs. When crores of rupees are flowing into the party coffers, courtesy the auto drivers, the administration is bound to remain in denial of the hazard posed by these vehicles. Unless the CPI(M) is ousted from power, people will remain at the mercy of the reckless auto drivers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

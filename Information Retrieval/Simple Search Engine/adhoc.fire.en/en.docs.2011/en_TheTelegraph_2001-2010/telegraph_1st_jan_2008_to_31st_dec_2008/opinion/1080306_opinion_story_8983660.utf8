                                                                                                                 NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	It wasnt much of a New Year for a group of old men in Beijing. There was no question of them going home. For them, home was a bunch of makeshift street dwellings behind a wall. Even that was demolished recently, leaving them to face Beijings harsh winter in the open.         
	Demolitions have become the order of the day in Beijing, which is set to host the Olympics. Entire old neighbourhoods with priceless heritage value have disappeared. Sometimes, the residents have protested. At other times, they have welcomed the shift into modern buildings. Overall, they have accepted the States right to decide what should go.         
	These old men werent the sort to protest. They were already on the fringes of Chinas bursting market economy, though physically very close to it. Their street dwellings fell in one of Beijings historical shopping districts, now being completely renovated for the Olympics. They were opposite Tiananmen Square, at the back of a wall recently inaugurated by the mayor, and ironically named Wall of harmony and prosperity. At the back of the wall was a cement table, on which flower pots were to be kept on formal occasions, the idea being that the flowers would peep out above the wall to form a pretty picture.         
	These homeless old men had built their shelters beneath the cement table. Throughout January and February, the police would pull them down, but the last time, about a fortnight ago, they did such a thorough job that Mumbais municipal demolition squads would have been proud. Not only were the cardboards and tin sheets all askew, but the old mens meagre and precious belongings were also gone.                 
	Striped courage        
	One man lost 700 yuan, his lifes savings, a princely amount even for middle-class Chinese. Another lost his tape recorder  for years he had been learning English, and without his tape recorder, he felt helpless. The third lost a hard-backed suitcase which contained a 1000-yuan suit. This particular demolition would have caught nobodys eye; the focus today is on Beijings new futuristic buildings. But one of Beijings more prominent bloggers had been interviewing this set of homeless people for his blog, with the result that netizens had started sending donations for them.         
	Calling himself Tiger Temple, the 50-year-old blogger started his blog three years back when he found no response from the police or media to a murder he witnessed in one of Beijings busy streets. Enthused by the response, Tiger Temple went on to blog about the concerns of the ordinary Chinese, calling his blog a one-man newspaper. He toured the poorest provinces of China on a motorcycle, posting interviews and photographs all through his journey. Interestingly, the official media were instructed to ignore his journey.         
	His regular visits to the homeless Beijingers made Tiger Temple the first (and only) person they called late at night after the last demolition. He responded by landing up by the first bus the next morning, and handed out the money that had already been sent to him by sympathetic readers.         
	Furious at the way the old men had been looted by the authorities, including the Chengguan  the new urban management vigilante force that has been created to tackle beggars, hawkers, and other such menaces to law and order  the blogger titled his post: Premier Wen Jiabao, you really ought to come visit your neighbours. The open letter gave the prime minister directions to the wall, and, describing the demolitions as loathsome, inhumane and anti-compatriot things done in the name of the Olympics, hoped that the police and Chengguan stayed true to the law. More help followed this post, but in a few days, the old men were gone.

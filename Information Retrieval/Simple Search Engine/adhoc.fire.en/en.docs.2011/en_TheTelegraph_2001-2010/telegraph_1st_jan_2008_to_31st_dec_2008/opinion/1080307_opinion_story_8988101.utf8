	NEW LIFE: SELECTED STORIES (Penguin, Rs 225) By Vijai Dan Detha has been translated and edited by Mridul Bhasin, Kailash Kabeer and Vandana R. Singh. Dan Dethas stories are based on folktales that can be heard being told in the remote villages of Rajasthan even today. Bhasin says in her Translators Note that the stories are unique in the way they reveal the psyche of rural women whose silence is taken to be ignorance. Village women, muffled so long with the rags of tradition, give voice to their desire, rebel against their lords and set out into the wilderness in search of freedom. The men in their lives are typically ineffectual or insensitive, drunk as they are with the power that comes from being male in a patriarchal society. The space of freedom that the women create for themselves very often involves other women and children, rather than men. But it is also a site of magic that must necessarily remain on the margins of civil society. The happiness that the two women, Teeja and Beeja, find in each other in A New Life can only be sustained with the help of a ghost chieftain, who installs them in an enchanted castle.                                   
	BREATHLESS IN BOMBAY (Picador, Rs 295) By Murzban F. Shroff are tales of Bombay by foot, by train, by taxi, by victoria. It is Bombay as lived in the heads of its people. The protagonists of these tales are the dhobis, barbers, vada-pavwallas, chaiwallas, fisherwomen or the eunuchs who make up the mortal millions of the teeming city. Shroff highlights their daily struggle with the ruthless reality of the streets and the sacrifices they have to make to maintain their toehold here. The stories, written in a simple and unassuming style, have a quiet beauty. However, they have a predictability that might make the reader lose interest midway.                         
	YAYATI: A CLASSIC TALE OF LUST (Orient, Rs 195) By V.S. Khandekar is a retelling of the story of Yayati, Devayani and Sharmishtha from the Mahabharata. Khandekar tries to breathe life into these characters, who are only minor figures in the epic. But it is doubtful as to how far his effort to make complex characters out of them succeeds. Because Devayani has an unhappy conjugal life with Yayati, she must be ambitious and egoistic. Sharmishtha symbolises sacrifice, Khandekar specifies. The work has been translated and abridged from Marathi by Y.P. Kulkarni.

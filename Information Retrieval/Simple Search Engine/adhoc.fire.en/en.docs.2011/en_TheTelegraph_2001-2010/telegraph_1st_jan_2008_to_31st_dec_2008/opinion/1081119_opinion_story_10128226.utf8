	After hesitating for months, Pakistan has finally applied, and been cleared, for a bail-out by the International Monetary Fund. The spiralling inflation and economic crisis had forced the government into an unenviable situation, which it tried to overcome with appeals of aid to both China and Saudi Arabia, its long-trusted allies. With no help forthcoming from Saudi Arabia, and a few billions too little (and too late) from China, it had little option but to look towards the Fund, regarded with great suspicion in the subcontinent, and more so in Pakistan, which sees it as a frontal organization of the United States of America. But it is not just the Funds American associations that matter. Given the dexterity with which the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the government has tried to lay the blame for the current financial crisis on the US, courtesy Pakistans involvement in the war on terror, it is only a matter of time before the country also starts believing in the soundness of the governments the-West-should-pay logic. The discomfort lies elsewhere. The Funds conditionalities are seen to deprive Pakistan of its economic sovereignty, impose great hardships on the poor and force the country into a debt-trap. To quell such worries, the government has already stated that its recent cuts in subsidies on oil, gas and electricity had been decided much before the Fund transactions took place. It has merely agreed to the Funds terms on expanding the tax-base, and it has no plans of regulating either the agriculture sector (which the Fund insists on), or curtailing defence expenditure.         
	But that is precisely the most worrying part. Pakistans defence expenditure has already risen by 40 per cent in a single year, and with the rising engagements of the army in the border areas, there is little chance of expenditures falling any time soon. Although the government has declared its commitment to cutting down its expenditure and increasing the tax flow, there is no guarantee that Pakistan will witness a miracle. The well-entrenched feudal elite in Pakistan loathes being hamstrung by strictures like a taxation policy. There is also little possibility of the government, which has a full-blown cabinet of more than 60 ministers, with promises of more additions, ever learning the benefits of thrift. As the people fear, Pakistan may survive the immediate crisis, but get caught in a vicious economic cycle whose impact will be felt by those who are the most vulnerable, notwithstanding help from the Friends of Democratic Pakistan.

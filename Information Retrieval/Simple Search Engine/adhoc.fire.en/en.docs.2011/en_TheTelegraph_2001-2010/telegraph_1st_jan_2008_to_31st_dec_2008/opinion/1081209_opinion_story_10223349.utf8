The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | vote for work
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       VOTE FOR WORK                                                    
	Psephologists in India will now have to abandon their favourite explanatory category, anti-incumbency, and replace it with the performance factor. Election results from Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh show that the electorate has no hesitation in voting back the same government to power provided the government has done some work and delivered. Going a little further back in time, the same conclusion can be drawn from the election results in Gujarat, where Narendra Modi won. Conversely, where the voters felt that the incumbent government had not performed to expectations, they have had no hesitation in throwing it out of power. Rajasthan is the case in point from the current set of poll results. The election results are thus a warning to political parties and politicians. Voters across states are making it very clear that they will no longer be taken for granted by politicians who only promise but never deliver. People are turning out in larger numbers to cast their ballots, and their voting pattern is showing a strong preference for those who are competent and for those who perform when they have power. This is a measure of the growing maturity of Indian democracy. Indian politicians will have to measure up to this maturity.        
	Before the elections and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist onslaught on Mumbai, the conventional political wisdom was that the Congresss doomsday had arrived. The Bharatiya Janata Party was already seeing itself in power. Such dire predictions were made especially for Delhi, which has been the victim of terrorist attacks in recent memory. The Delhi results have shown that the voters there chose the work done by Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister, over the threat of terrorism. At a time when the country is in the coils of a complex economic crisis, the voters preferred governments who have a record of performance. The combating of terror did not loom very large over voters preferences. The events in Mumbai did not cast any significant shadow on the way people voted in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It is evident that the electorate of these states weighed its options and the issues before it and then pressed the button in favour of that party with the best record of work. Those, like Ms Dikshit, who are back in power will have to be very conscious of the great expectations the voters have of them.

	Unaccustomed Earth 
  By Jhumpa Lahiri, 
  Random House, Rs 450        
	In Jhumpa Lahiris story, Nobodys business, Paul watches the man called Farouk walking away with a woman: There was something curious about the way they were walking, together and yet with a space between them. That space trembles and shimmers, growing wider sometimes and closing unexpectedly, if briefly, between characters who walk together and then go on alone, appearing and passing on in the stories in Lahiris latest collection, Unaccustomed Earth. There is something that happens in their passing, in this drama of a shifting space, that may or may not be a happening one can identify, or hold on to. There is, Lahiri said in an interview, a ruthless, distilled quality in the short story when compared to a novel. She distils the moments of perfectly ordinary experiences, a father visiting his daughter, for example, or a couple taking a weekend off from parenting and from work to be present at an old friends wedding, and chisels out the details of each with a ruthless immaculateness, till the happening has the reader in its mysterious grip. Sudha in the ironically titled Only goodness, for example, is forced to confront her own intricate involvement in her brothers fate when she had thought she could get away with a carefully constructed structure of evasion and tenuous optimism. As the space between them is suddenly and implacably split open, she feels, unexpectedly, the tug of their shared knowledge, while the indefinably wavering connection with her husband is damaged beyond repair.         
	Lahiris art has matured and deepened since her Pulitzer-prize-winning collection, The Interpreter of Maladies; it has also become more self-conscious. The stories in the new collection have as their context the Indian immigrants life in America, the theme of her novel, The Namesake. Yet it would be difficult to pin down exactly where one is to identify the specific features of dislocated Indianness. The points of view, whether male or female, are of the second generation, those of Indian Americans of immigrant parentage. Their loyalties and confusions are very different from those of their parents. Something of what happens to values and identities when people leave one country behind to start anew in another emerges through the conflicts of the younger generation with parents and through the unexpected bondings between them. A transplanting of judgments, identities, and preferences is pivotal to two of the most intense and resonant stories, Unaccustomed earth and Hell-Heaven. At the same time, the drama of values and painful love between parents and offspring is always strange and always familiar, whatever the pre-text proposes. Lahiris memory of feeling slightly outside things everywhere, and her sure touch as an artist, achieve together that combined sense of the immediate and the timeless in human relationships, of ever inadequate communication, making every experience enigmatic, objectively portrayed yet deeply intimate.        
	The collection is in two parts. The first contains five discrete stories. The second, Hema and Kaushik, is a three-part story told first from Hemas point of view, then from Kaushiks, and then partly in the third-person. The story travels in segments from the two characters childhood in a new country, through Kaushiks experience of his fathers second marriage while he is at university, to a last meeting between Hema and Kaushik in Rome, moving up to an unforgettable culmination. It is in this three-part tale that Lahiri reaches her peak, and Years end, the account of Kaushiks encounter with his new mother and two step-sisters, achieves a quality of rich and pure wholeness that can only be the result of inspired conception and tireless care.         
	In India, Hema and Kaushik would have been perceived to be from different backgrounds. But immigration is a great leveller, so as young adults in America they share more than sporadic childhood memories. Most of the partners and lovers in the other stories do not have this connection, for it is just the one partner who is of Indian parentage. When marriages begin to disappear, as Amit says of his own marriage to Megan in A choice of accommodations, once again it is difficult to locate in this disappearance a specifically immigrant element. Lahiri is a disturbingly perceptive artist of marriage, and partnerships founder on the same rock of irredeemable aloneness that haunts all her characters even in their moments of greatest fulfilment. The remorselessly accumulated details of action and environment, although occasionally threatening to weigh the story down, paradoxically open up a sense of huge unending spaces and far horizons, in which the characters may ultimately drift away.         
	The Indian charge of Lahiris stories is more a matter of content than of style, in which she is identifiably Western. Even American, although she said once that she had been most rewarded by her reading of the William Trevor, an Irishman who moved to England, and the Canadian Mavis Gallant, an artist of exile. Lahiris apparently down-to-earth story-telling eschews the usual explanations inherent in trans-cultural writing, making of the immigrant experience a natural inheritance. It also disguises the careful arrangement of her stories, in which physical violence is always deferred, relegated backstage as it were, as in Hell-Heaven or Nobodys business. Otherwise, perhaps, the poised narration required to lay bare the nuances and depths of emotional devastation would be shaken. Such poise has its own dangers, but the richness, intricacy and particularity of the human encounters have so far saved her distinctive voice from monotony. At her height, as in Years end, the tensely measured tone alone can convey the full impact of unexpressed pain and unanticipated violence that leaves in its wake a desolate, distant melancholy.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From Napoleon to Shivaji
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FROM NAPOLEON TO SHIVAJI                                  This Above All - Khushwant Singh                        Violent legacy				                                       
	All Indians are proud of the achievements of Chhatrapati Shivaji, and of the Marathas, who once ruled the subcontinent, their empire extending from Karnataka to Calcutta and up to the Punjab. Not many Indians are proud of the Shiv Sena or of its founder Bal Thackeray, his son, Uddhav, or of nephew, Raj, who claim to have revived Maratha pride. Their methods are crude and unpatriotic, their following mostly drawn from the illiterate and the lumpen elements confined to Maharashtra.         
	I could have said all this in Bombay, where I lived for nine years; I dare not say it today in the Mumbai of their making. I would be roughed up by their hoodlums, my books burnt in public places. (I would not mind that as they would add to my royalties.) If they could destroy the archives of the Bhandarkar Institute, tear up M.F. Hussains paintings and vandalize the offices of The Outlook magazine, mere book-burning would be like celebrating Diwali to them. However, I would hate being bashed up, particularly as I would get no protection from Mumbais constabulary, which is on their side. That is why Mumbaikars who loathe their guts dare not speak against them. And netas of the saffron brigade like Rajnath Singh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party  who ostensibly stands for promoting the national language, Hindi  pay court to the Shiv Sena supreme. Seated on his throne-like chair surrounded by heads of snarling tigers and busts of Shivaji, he insists that in Mumbai everyone must learn Marathi. He also exhorts the new generation of Marathas to devise a Hindu bomb which will target only Muslims. Is this also in the saffron agenda? But one thing is certain that if any of the three aforenamed said what they say in Mumbai in any other part of India, they would get a very rough reception in the hands of thousands of non-Maharashtrians they violently ejected from Maharashtra in recent months.        
	A couple of phrases are frequently used to describe this phenomenon: regional chauvinism and jingoism. These have interesting backgrounds: chauvinism originated from Nicholas Chauvine, a soldier in Napoleons army who made a great display of loyalty to this emperor and became somewhat of a joke. Jingoism came into vogue during the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-78, which roused much passion in England. A song that became very popular ran as follows:         
	We dont want to fight, yet by Jingo if we do,/ Weve got the ships, weve got the men,/ Weve got the money too.        
	Bala Sahib Thackeray, his son and his nephew are chauvinists, ever singing ballads in praise of Shivaji. They are also jingoists, who threaten to take on anyone daring to oppose them. They dont have any ships, but they have plenty of men and, having Indias richest city in their stranglehold, plenty of money too.                
	A stranger on a winter morning                
	Humans can be divided into two categories: one that brazenly or discretely tries to convey its importance, and the other that takes pains to avoid doing so. The first category outnumbers the second noticeably in our country, where most people want others to know they are somebodies who matter. I was fortunate in meeting some from the second category and had to extract information from them or find out later who they were. One such encounter sticks in my mind.         
	When living in London, I often went off for long weekends and stayed in some remote pub in the countryside to be by myself. One such weekend, I chanced upon a small pub, which had a couple of rooms for guests staying overnight. It was deep inside a dense forest with a small pond inhabited by moorhens. Overlooking it was Hever Castle, the residence of the Astors, most of those who came to the pub were farmers or game-keepers of the Astors estate. One day after breakfast I took a long walk in the woods before retiring to my room to read and write. It was winter time. The landlord had a log fire lit in my room.        
	That morning I was sitting in my deep leather arm chair wrapped in shawl with my reference books and scribbling pad in my lap when I heard a gentle knock on the door. Come in, I shouted. The door opened and a tall, grey-haired lady walked in. Forgive me for disturbing you, she said. I heard an Indian was staying here. So I took a chance to exchange a few words. I apologized for not getting up to greet her and simply asked, Have you been to India? Yes, I was there for five years with my father. Where? Mostly in Calcutta, but we travelled a great deal across the country. Was your father in the army? I asked. No, he was a civilian, she replied.        
	I assumed he was either on the ICS or a boxwalah. I asked her. She denied his being one or the other and turned to ask me what had brought me to Hever. I told her I was in the diplomatic service (that sounded important enough) and took weekends off to be with myself. So it went on for a few minutes, I, in my chair, she standing in front.         
	I mustnt waste more of your time, she said finally. Enjoy walking in the woods. But you havent told me what your father was doing in India, I protested.        
	If you must know, she replied, He was the viceroy of India.        
	The publican later told me she was Lady Astor, owner of Hever Castle, daughter of Viceroy Lord Minto.                
	City of love and hate                
	The greatest icon of the country        
	Should naturally beg his mercy        
	Cringe and crawl and virtually shed        
	tears        
	So that the Emperor of Mumbai         
	finally hears.        
	In this most cosmopolitan city        
	Why should anybody speak Hindi         
	And even mention Bihar and UP?        
	And we should congratulate        
	The government of the state        
	For giving a free rein to this         
	campaign of hate         
	And not hurting the sentiment of Thackeray, the great.        
	May Amitabh Bachchan and family,        
	Along with the rest of the country,        
	Gracefully bear this indignity.

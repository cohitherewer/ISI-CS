	Tame the white elephant                  
	Sir  With the belligerent leftists finally off the governments back, Manmohan Singh and Co. can now hasten the disinvestment process of public sector units (Reform doubt in Congress, Aug 3). Enough public money has been wasted already to keep these white elephants on foot. Worse, Indian citizens are having to pay through their nose for the upkeep of a few lucky men in PSU rolls. Contrary to popular belief, there is o such thing as a navaratna PSU. Every single PSU needs to be privatized if it is to turn into a real asset.           
	Yours faithfully,        Abhijit Guha, Ontario, Canada
        
	True believer          
	Sir  Harkishen Singh Surjeet passed away recently after a brief illness (Master of coalition game is no more, Aug 2). The media coverage of Surjeets early life has been extensive. A true patriot, this courageous and determined man had once brought down the Union Jack and hoisted the Tricolour in Jallandhars court premises.           
	Although the media mentioned many interesting aspects of Surjeets political life, they failed to point to a crucial fact: Surjeet, despite being a dedicated communist, had no problems flaunting his religion identity. In this respect, he was an exception among his comrades who believe that religion must be shunned as it is the opium of the masses. Surjeet wore the badge of religiosity with pride  the turban, his flowing beard and the kara. thereby showing that there can be no conflict between religion and political ideology. A practising Sikh and committed leftist, Surjeet rose to the top rungs of an atheist party. Remarkably, none of his comrades forced him to shed his religious markers. They must have known that he was made up of different stuff. Surjeet remained a Sikh and a communist but unfortunately could not quite get Jyotibabu or E.M.S. Namboodiripad to wear a tilak.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Harkishen Singh Surjeet was not only one of the founder-members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) but also someone who was fiercely opposed to communal politics. During the dark days of militancy in Punjab, he had fought tooth and nail against religious orthodoxy and terrorism. People might not agree with Surjeets ideological position but one cannot doubt the fact that they respected this gifted political leader immensely.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Its heartbreaking to read about the fate that has befallen Afia Siddiqui (The torturous life of Bagrams Grey Lady, Aug 2). Siddiqui, a Pakistani doctor, along with her three children, is reportedly suffering in a US prison at Bagram, Afghanistan. The point whether the woman doctor is an agent of al Qaida is a moot point. There is no way one can accept the cruel treatment that has been meted out to her.           
	The international community must condemn the incident and make efforts to release Siddiqui and her children. One worries especially for her children. Instead of leading a normal life of joy and happiness, the three are having to spend their days in a prison cell. One wouldnt be surprised if they eventually die because of hardship. If the charges against Siddiqui are proved in a court of law, she should be punished for her alleged crime.           
	But this is certainly no way to treat a prisoner or even a terrorist. One only hopes that Siddiqui and her children will be able to walk out of prison one day. But before that, the prison officers who are guilty of torturing and abusing her must be punished for their offence.          
	Yours faithfully,

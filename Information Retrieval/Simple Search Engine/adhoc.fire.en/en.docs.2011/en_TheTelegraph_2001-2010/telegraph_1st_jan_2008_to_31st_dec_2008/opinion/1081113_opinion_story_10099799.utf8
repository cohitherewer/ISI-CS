The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Democracy is a sword with two edges
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DEMOCRACY IS A SWORD WITH TWO EDGES                                  A few days before the polls, Uddalak Mukherjee listens to some of the voices of propaganda, dissent and aloofness in Chhattisgarh                                            
	Even if Narendra Modi were not a politician, he would have done well on stage. During his rally in Rajnandgaon (the constituency of Chhattisgarhs present chief minister), six days before the start of the two-phased elections to the 90-member state legislature, I watched Modi at work. As always, he spoke slowly, modulated his voice and poked fun at his opponents while presenting his version of the truth. There wasnt a whiff of Ram or his bridge, or a word against Christians, despite Chhattisgarhs sizeable tribal population. Modi criticized the Congress government for importing both grain and a party president. Invoking the rival party symbols, he suggested that Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, will come to Chhattisgarh not on her hands, nor on an elephant or a bicycle, but she dwells on the lotus. Every word Modi spoke was eagerly applauded by the pracharaks and by some people in the press enclosure where I sat. I was surrounded by men in saffron. Every now and then, drums rolled in the distance, and chants broke out in Modis name.         
	The men and women who had been herded in were small in number but obedient, and clapped when ordered. Only a few thousand had turned up to hear Modi, and before entering the venue, I had seen a BJP worker arguing with a man about his fee to attend the rally. In smaller states like Chhattisgarh, it was perhaps unfair to expect a large turn-out, that too almost a week before elections. (The first phase of polling in Chhattisgarh, scheduled on November 14, will see votes cast in 39 of the 90 seats, including Rajnandgaon.) Just then, a frail journalist enquired where I worked. He did not wait for my answer, introduced himself and explained that the sparse attendance indicated that change was in the air. He had toured Korba, Bastar and Dantewada, he said, and was convinced that the people will return Ajit Jogis Congress to power one more time. I was not surprised by what he said. Indian elections are a complicated affair. Often, it is the periphery  poorer villages and not voters in cities or towns like Rajnandgaon  that makes the victories. The Indian electorate is also notoriously fickle. The last few days, even hours, before polling are crucial, and political parties often bring in stars in the latter half of the campaign. Here, too, Sonia Gandhi was supposed to visit on November 10, and I had heard whispers that L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh would follow. Mayavati, whose Bahujan Samaj Party was contesting all the seats for the first time, had arrived while I was there and Rahul Gandhi addressed a road show attended by 40,000 people in Jagdalpur three days later.         
	Numbers sometimes tell the real story, as do election manifestos. The same morning, I had travelled to dust-caked Durg and met Rajeeb Chaubey at a Congress karyalay in Arun Voras constituency. Chaubey, a young man, lay sprawled on a white sheet on the floor, supported by pillows under a looming statue of Indira Gandhi. He said that the Congress, which had won 37 seats in the last elections as opposed to the Bharatiya Janata Partys 50, will win because the people had realized that it was different from the BJP. I mentioned the Congress manifesto released by the aging Motilal Vora in which the party promised rice at Rs 2 per kilo for all, as against the Rs 3-kilo rice scheme run by the current CM, Raman Singh, for below-poverty-line families. Will the exchequer be able to shoulder an additional burden? Chaubey replied that his party stood for poor farmers, and was not corrupt like the BJP, which had dropped 18 sitting MLAs. I asked him why then had the Congress expelled 15 rebels, but Chaubey only ordered for lassi. The Congress supported the controversial Salwa Judum like the BJP, and was silent about the Maoist problem. Why? Chaubey answered, aggressively, that the Congress did not want to comment on a matter that was sub judice. As for the Salwa Judum, he wagged a finger in my direction and asked why the media were concerned only with alleged human rights violations and not with the spectacular achievements of this spontaneous uprising against deshdrohis? Incidentally, according to independent estimates, the Maoists now held sway in nearly 12,000 square kilometers in Chhattisgarh. A young man with a goatee, sitting beside Chaubey, joined the conversation, quoted Churchills call for eternal vigilance, and added that India should adopt Israels model of a vigilant society. I asked Chaubey about the junior Voras chances. Voras candidacy, many think, would hurt the Congress and reflected the partys dynastic mindset. Chaubey replied glibly that Vora would win by over 10,000 votes. I said that I will call when the results are out on December 8. He looked unhappy, and informed my time was up.        
	On my way back, my mind was cluttered with questions: would the progressive Raman Singh survive? What about Ajit Jogi, who, despite being confined to a wheel-chair, covered more miles canvassing than his peers? Approaching Raipur, I saw the night sky erupt in fireworks. I was told that it was the concluding day of Rajyotsav Saptah (the Chhattisgarh founding week), and a government event was being held to mark the occasion. Later that night, a local TV channel informed that the usually boisterous celebrations had seen a low turnout, leaving the governor disappointed. It occurred to me that the people of Chhattisgarh might just be able to sift through the sops, slogans and speeches without losing sight of the truth.

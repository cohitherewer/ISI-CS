	Holier than thou                  
	Sir  When L.K. Advani expresses outrage over the alleged misbehaviour of the police with Pragya Singh Thakur, one feels that the world has come full-circle (Head over heels, Nov 21). For it is leaders like Advani who feel smug and righteous when members of the minority community are at the receiving end of similar forms of police misbehaviour. It is no secret that the Prevention of Terrorism Act was used by the Bharatiya Janata Party regimes as a weapon to be used exclusively against the minority community. Following the repeal of the Pota, Advani and his ilk are exercised not so much over the loss of a good anti-terror law, but over the fact that any new law might measure terror suspects from the minority and majority communities by the same yardstick.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhat Sen Sarma, Chinsurah

                
	Sir  The nexus between the investigating agencies, the bureaucracy and the political class in our country is widely accepted now. This vile entanglement of politics and administration is causing irreparable damage to the credibility of the non-political functionaries of the government. Witness the BJPs eagerness to give its own verdict on the Malegaon blasts. What is alarming is that the saffron partys attempts at obstructing the avenues of bringing the truth into the public domain are not being thwarted sternly enough.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashwani Sharma, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  It is surprising that Advani sings Sangh tune on sadhvi (Nov 19) at a time when hundreds of terror accused are languishing in various jails of the country. Many are suffering because of the unconstitutional stand of several lawyers forums not to represent them. This stance undermines the very basis of our legal system which states clearly that a person is innocent till he is proven guilty. The BJP not only tacitly supports a decision that is tantamount to prejudging the accused, but also brands those who dare to approach the law as anti-national.           
	Things are a little different, though, when sadhvis feature in the ranks of the accused. Advani did not express shock or outrage when a nun was gangraped and paraded naked in Orissa, but he is willing to take the affidavit of Pragya Singh Thakur, a terror accused, at face value. True, there are umpteen cases of policemen transgressing their limits, but it does not become an aspiring prime minister to wake up to this phenomenon only when a member of a majority religious outfit has allegedly been victimized.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I find it amusing when I read, hear and see maulvis and sadhus alike declaring that their religion does not allow the killing of innocents, as if other religions and civil societies of the world allow such inhuman acts. They also claim that true Hindus and true Muslims cannot be involved in acts of terrorism although most found guilty of such acts claim to be devout individuals themselves. Some justify their acts as revenge for some earlier act. The Malegaon blast was apparently planned to avenge the Mumbai train blasts which was, in turn, an act of revenge against the Gujarat massacre, justified to be the natural answer to the Godhra train deaths. Similarly, most of the killings of innocent men, women and children in Akhshardham, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mumbai or Surat were linked to the Babri Masjid demolition. Now the most important question is: when and why did this chain of revenge begin and when and how will it end? Edicts by a few religious organizations against terrorism will not solve this national problem. Eminent men and women from all walks of life should appeal to the people to stop this revenge hysteria and behave like a responsible civil society.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Iqtedar H. Farooqi, Lucknow 

                
	Sir  I must say that I was much surprised by L.K. Advanis silence for so long on the Malegaon arrests. His recent outburst thus comes as a kind of relief. Advanis support for Pragya Singh Thakur and his close attention to her affidavit have effectively exposed the BJPs double standards on the question of terrorism and also its greed for power. If the sadhvi is a prime suspect in a terror case, then Advani can certainly be said to have ignored the countrys interests for his short-term political ambition. The BJP, which opposes any proposal of leniency towards Afzal Guru, a terror suspect just like the sadhvi, ought to welcome all probes into the Malegaon blasts.           
	The prime minister has done the right thing by sending the national security advisor, M.K. Narayanan, to explain the facts of the Malegaon case to the BJP leaders (Date with Narayanan softens BJP, Nov 22). This sets an excellent precedent of healthy democratic practices.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,

      
	Faridabad                     
	Sir  From where have the media come up with the phrase, Hindu terror? It is being used indiscriminately after the arrest of the sadhvi, Pragya Singh Thakur, and Lieutenant Colonel S.K. Purohit in connection with the Malegaon blasts. It is pointless to link religion with acts of terrorism. There is already enough tension between the Hindus and Muslims in the country than the media need to fuel. This is not to say that it is all right to use phrases like Islamic terror. These create more mistrust among the religious communities than Indias delicate religious and social fabric can stand. How long before we start hearing of Sikh terror, Jain terror, Marathi terror or Bihari terror?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dharam Agarwal, Barbil, Orissa

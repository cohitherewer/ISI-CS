	Beijingers have been flooded with so many instructions on how to behave during the Olympics that it would be understandable if they decide to simply be themselves with a vengeance. That includes not changing their fascinating guttural accent, which makes a difficult language even more difficult to understand, smoking non-stop, and spitting all over  the hallmark of a Chinese.        
	Its not as if Beijingers arent used to foreigners. But the authorities are relentless. Theyve just put up big posters listing the Eight dont asks: Dont ask about income or expenses, dont ask about age, dont ask about love life or marriage, dont ask about health, dont ask about someones home or address, dont ask about personal experience, dont ask about religious beliefs or political views, dont ask what someone does. What should a Beijinger ask then, apart from the foreigners name and nationality? The weather in their country, or their Olympic medal tally, or the usual: do you like China?         
	The Chinese, outside the capital, love chatting up foreigners. But Beijingers arent provincial small-towners, or villagers-turned-cityfolk-overnite. Surely, they must find these instructions insulting. Then, there are the instructions for dealing with the handicapped. Chinese society has its share of such people, and they arent all beggars. You should use polite and standard forms of address for handicapped athletes, says the first instruction. How else would anyone address them, one wonders. The next one is baffling: Try to keep as light as you can with handicapped overtones.                 
	Burden of politeness         
	The remaining would normally occur to anyone with some presence of mind and experience in dealing with people. Pay attention to how you congratulate handicapped athletes, pay attention to avoid taboo subjects, quit using bad platitudes, and do not use insulting or discriminatory, contemptuous or derogatory terms to address the disabled, say things such as, You are amazing, or You are really great, when chatting with the visually impaired, do not say things like Its up ahead, or Its over there, when chatting with athletes who are paraplectic in their upper body, do not say things like Its behind you.         
	China opened up 28 years back. Foreigners have been descending on China for almost 15 years now. Blacks are subject to harassment in small towns; Indians are stared at like exotic animals  but again, in small towns only. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou  the Olympics venues  have long been international cities. Surely their residents dont need to be told all this?         
	May be its the authorities who need training. An earlier guide for Olympic volunteers on how to deal with the disabled was positively insulting to the latter. It said that disabled people show no differences in sensation, reaction, memorisation and thinking mechanism from other people, but they might have unusual personalities because of disfigurement and disability....They can be stubborn and controlling; they may be sensitive and struggle with trust issues. Sometimes they are overly protective of themselves, especially when they are called crippled or paralysed. The furore caused by the instructions forced the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee to withdraw the guide.        
	However, its worth reflecting what would India do in such a situation? Theres no doubt about our insensitivity to the disabled, our littering habits, and our tendency to stare at foreigners. Lets not forget one important quality the Chinese dont have: our mens uncontrollable urge to paw women, specially foreigners. Would we just let our guests be at the mercy of the average Indian, or would we have our own set of instructions  dont use curse words like langda, dont eat paan for two weeks, or, keep your hands to yourself?

	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, when faced with opposition to a special economic zone in Nandigram, sent policemen there. When the local people reacted unfavourably, columns of partymen went in. He addressed a meeting of those who survived and conquered, and announced there would be no SEZ. His counterpart in Goa, Digambar Kamat, when faced with similar opposition, did not bother to instil respect for the State in his people. As soon as a non-governmental organization raised a few flags, he cancelled all SEZs. He obviously does not care for the development of his state  the thousands of jobs SEZs would bring, and with them, the tall chimneys, glass-covered office buildings, rows of cars outside them, the entire paraphernalia of development. But perhaps Mr Kamat thinks of another kind of development  development in which rich foreigners frolic on the beach, stay in coconut-thatched huts, laze around and sip feni under sunshades. Except for good beaches, West Bengal has all that Goa has  beautiful landscape, lush vegetation, plenty of waterbodies  why did not its chief minister think of development in the terms that Goans do?
    
	Maybe because his ideological upbringing has trained him to think of development in different terms. For him, development means restoring West Bengals glory, making it a leading industrial state, watching sweating men quench castings and beat forgings. To someone who does not share that dream, it would seem much inferior to the development Goans have got already  serving food and drinks to tourists for a living, then getting on their motorcycles and going to their own bars. Why, then, can West Bengal not share in the Goan idyll? It would require spreading development to the countryside  but surely that is what everyone wants. It would require Bengalis to speak English  why is English being taught to children if not to speak it? It would require beautifying West Bengals countryside  and, in the long months, when foreign tourists do not come, people who live in West Bengal can enjoy that beauty. 
    
	Serving foreigners, making West Bengal beautiful, enjoying life  somehow it sounds shocking. But it is shocking only to communists who see virtue in toil, or to Protestants who make religion of work. What stops others from pursuing the good life in West Bengal is that Bengalis are brought up to disdain it. But it is all in the mind; and if only the mindset changed, the path to development would be so much smoother, and its end so much more enjoyable. While industrial countries went through the industrial cycle and then left it to the Chinese, envying the Chinese has not stopped. But it need not be so. As the Goans would say, Get a life, man.

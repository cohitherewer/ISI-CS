	Any move away from reservations of any sort is cause for relief. But the Bharatiya Janata Partys decision to withdraw its support from the bill for 33 per cent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and the assemblies is for reasons of practicality rather than of principle. The sum and substance of the partys reasoning, as expressed by Sushma Swaraj, is that it is no use waiting for the deadlock over the bill to break. Instead, the BJP would support the Election Commissions suggestion that all parties give 33 per cent of their tickets to women. If enforced on a state-by-state basis, this would prevent parties from forcing on women the hopeless seats, and there would also be no need to amend the Constitution. 
    
	What the BJP and the other parties do not address is the fundamental issue of reservations. They cannot, because quotas are carrots that all parties hold out to underprivileged groups to consolidate their respective vote bases. But positive discrimination has a certain logic, which calls on specific parameters for specific applications, follow-ups and time frames. Indian politics has long discarded this logic. That quotas go against the very principles of democracy and merit should be the primary consideration when deciding on reservations, perhaps only for historically underprivileged groups for a fixed length of time. But instead of narrowing the focus of reservations over time, as would have been the case had they been applied within this logic, politicians have expanded quotas, thus breeding not only conflict and fragmentation among and within receiving groups, but also greed, dependence, a loss of pride and a surrender of self-sufficiency.
    
	The bill for reserving 33 per cent of seats in the legislatures for women was formulated to redress the gender imbalance in the decision-making strata of political parties, and also as a way to induce more women to engage with politics. The impetus to appear politically correct was as strong in the case of gender as it had been in the case of backward classes and scheduled castes. Reservations based on gender go against the Constitution as it now stands, and the decade-long struggle to get the bill passed has exposed the hollowness of intent behind the appearance. Even then, if the bill is junked, it would be a sign of health. Without it, women will have to fight harder for their positions in politics, and their victory would be more valuable than a space given free. Besides, the facts that the field is not yet level, and that the bill could not be passed, should demonstrate to the government the priority it must accord to womens education and status in society. It is healthy to face facts and seek solutions  the BJPs support for an alternative, although less obvious, form of reservation is not the solution. It may just be a compromise.

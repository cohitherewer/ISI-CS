	Thats no way to treat a good work      
	Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay: An Intellectual Biography By Amiya P. Sen, 
  Oxford, Rs 395        
	Time was when OUP was Indias premier academic publisher. Today it is nowhere near that position not because it has been overtaken by competition, but it has let its own standards fall. Take this book, for example. This is a work of solid scholarship by an acknowledged authority in the field, but OUP allows the book to go into print without an index. What can one say about such a lapse except that it is appalling and a singular disservice to the book and its author.        
	Amiya P. Sen made his mark with a study of Vivekananda in the same series. Here he writes the intellectual biography of the man whom Nirad C. Chaudhuri considered to be the greatest Bengali. Bankimchandra was an outstanding intellectual of great erudition and literary talent. Sen traces his life and his literary achievements. Many will complain that Bankimchandras absolutely brilliant satirical works are not given the attention they perhaps deserve. The strength of this book is the balance it maintains between fiction and non-fiction. A major omission in the bibliography is Partha Chatterjees analysis of Bankims political ideas in Chatterjees now-famous book on nationalist thought.               
	Missing: inside stories              
	An Outsider in Politics By Krishna Bose, 
  Viking, Rs 599        
	Any reader expecting explosive revelations in this book will be disappointed. There are none, not even about Mamata Banerjee though the author was known to be quite close to the Trinamul leader now holding West Bengal at ransom. It will remain a mystery, even after this book, how a lady of Krishna Boses education and accomplishments saw someone like Banerjee as a leader. She never quite explains this. She also quietly evades the question of her exit from politics. She was at one time not an outsider in politics. It might also be pointed out that perhaps she never was an outsider, given the family into which she was born and the one into which she was married. Nonetheless, this is a very readable book and the nature of the writer comes through in the narrative she presents.              
	After the revolt, a deluge              
	The Warner Letters: The Experiences of Two English Brothers During the Indian Rebellion of 1857-1859 By June Bush, 
  Rupa, Rs 395                
	The 150th anniversary of the revolt of 1857 was a bonanza for publishers and writers. All of a sudden in various corners of Great Britain people discovered ancestors who had fought in India in 1857. Some of them left behind their memoirs and letters of their days of hardship and valour in the year when British rule in North India nearly came to an end. Not all these recollections are of equal value. To publish them, the editing and annotating has to be careful; to do this one needs to know the literature on the revolt. Only this will enable a conscientious editor to point where his or her selection is significant and different. Unfortunately, June Bush is not one of those editors. Her bibliography shows that she has read nothing on 1857, not even the magisterial volumes of John Kaye, and certainly not anything by Indian historians. These letters are valuable as record, but there is hardly anything here which is unknown to the historian of 1857.

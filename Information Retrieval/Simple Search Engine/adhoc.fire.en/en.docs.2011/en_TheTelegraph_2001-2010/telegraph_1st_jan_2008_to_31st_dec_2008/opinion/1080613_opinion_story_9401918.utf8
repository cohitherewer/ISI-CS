	Austerity is a difficult concept. But for the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, it is even more difficult to make his people swallow the bitter pill of the rise in fuel prices just before the Lok Sabha polls without a gesture that the government is with them. Setting an example in austerity is perhaps the quickest and the most positive way to get the message across. Mr Singhs personality is easily associated with ideas of restraint and sobriety, so his call for austerity would resonate with more sincerity than would be the case had it come from someone else. It is good to see an immediate response among Mr Singhs ministers, quite a number of whom have cancelled official overseas trips because they were not absolutely necessary. The prime ministers letter to his ministers hints at other measures as well, when he talks of practising the utmost economy in the governments administrations and establishments. Reportedly, he would like to ration the fuel for government cars, and his party may be planning to cut down on its ambitious plans for pre-election publicity.        
	The ministers seem to have seen the sense of Mr Singhs message, but it is impossible to escape the feeling that it is, largely if not wholly, the prime ministers personality and presence that make it meaningful. But is that enough? Mr Singhs decision to reduce his own entourage on official trips matches his sentiments in the letter. Since the people will have to bear some of the financial burden of oil imports, he feels it is the moral duty of the government to reduce unnecessary expenditure. Yet it is not a question of morality in the long run, or of morality alone. The measures should be listed, modulated according to position and official requirement, and carry the neutral weight of policy. The information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, has asked for a status note from the finance ministry that would highlight the areas of non-plan expenditure where, according to Mr Das Munshi, a saving of five per cent can be made this year. It is a concrete start. But the West Bengal finance minister is one step ahead. Asim Dasgupta has a list of austerities already put together, right down to the smallest brass tack  tea and biscuits, at most cashews, at meetings of government officials with private sector organizations. While ministers compete with one another in proclaiming their respective austerities, it will be fascinating to watch what they actually do.

	The path from virus to vaccine marks a movement from science to medicine, from the pure to the applied, from cause to treatment. This years Nobel prize for medicine focuses on this distinction between scientific knowledge and practice. Two French virologists, Franoise Barr-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier, are sharing the Nobel for having discovered the HIV virus with Germanys Harald zur Hausen, who discovered the human papilloma viruses that cause cervical cancer. Both discoveries date back to the early Eighties. In the case of the HPV, science quickly became medicine. Although the discovery of the viruses took almost a decade of gruelling research, Mr zur Hausen immediately followed it up with the cloning of two important strains, and a vaccine for cervical cancer was developed soon after. Some countries, like Britain, have a national programme to vaccinate girls before they become sexually active, which, in turn, has been opposed by some religious groups. Science moves towards medicine, but matters human do not stop at that.        
	Nothing proves this more than HIV/AIDS. In this case, the movement from virus to vaccine is yet to happen. There is still no cure for AIDS, and no sure way of preventing HIV infection. More than 25 million people have died of HIV/AIDS since 1981, and more than 33 million people are living with HIV all over the world. As a global ubiquitous epidemic (the Nobel Foundations words), it has devastated some of the poorest countries of the world and has begun to transform sexual attitudes in some of the most conservative (although the Indian government doggedly refuses to decriminalize homosexuality even under such compulsions). But the absence of a vaccine or cure does not diminish the importance of the discovery of the HIV virus, and of the remarkable quickness of that discovery (which is part of the declared reason for the award), leading to the development of antiretroviral therapy. Yet, with HIV/AIDS, excellence and hard work, rewarded now after more than two decades, still remain under the shadow of human inequality.

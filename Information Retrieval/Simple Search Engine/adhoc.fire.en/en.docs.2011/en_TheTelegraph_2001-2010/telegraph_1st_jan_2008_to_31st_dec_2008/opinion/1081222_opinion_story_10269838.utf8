	The political crisis in Thailand is over, and so is the 10-year experiment with democracy. The rich and the comfortably off have risen in revolt against equal treatment for the poor, and its back to the bad old days of shaky coalitions and bought-and-paid-for politicians. The misleadingly named Peoples Alliance for Democracy has won.        
	The government had to be overthrown by street demonstrations, not by a legitimate vote in parliament, because the People Power Party actually had a majority in parliament. The PPPs crime, in the view of the PAD, the army, the police, the Bangkok middle class, and perhaps even the royal palace, was that the wrong people had voted for it: the rural poor.        
	The PPP was the descendant of Thai Rak Thai, the creation of Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications billionaire who turned to politics in 1998. It was a new style of party for Thailand, appealing directly to the urban poor and the rural majority of voters over the heads of the political bosses who had traditionally bought up their votes.        
	Thai Rak Thai won the 2001 elections, delivering Thaksin to the prime ministers office, and he kept many of his promises. Development funds flowed into the rural areas, his 30-baht scheme for universal health care brought medical aid to remote villages for the first time, and farmers got cheap loans. It alienated the urban elite which had previously got the biggest share of State spending, but Thaksins popularity soared even higher in rural areas.        
	He was the first prime minister ever to complete a four-year term, and, in the 2005 elections, his party won an absolute majority in parliament, another first. The political godfathers who used to buy and sell the rural vote flocked to his banner, giving him a virtually impregnable political position.                
	Failed mission        
	The counter-attack by the old guard came in the form of street demonstrations against Thaksins new government that were used as the excuse for a military coup in 2006. The courts, which have not been exactly impartial in this affair, then ordered Thai Rak Thai disbanded because of alleged election irregularities.        
	Thaksins party was immediately re-founded as the People Power Party, but he was not so easily able to evade a court judgment finding him guilty of conflict of interest over the purchase of land in Bangkok. The amount of money involved was paltry for a man of Thaksins wealth, and other Thai politicians have gone unpunished for far graver offences, but he ended up fleeing Thailand to avoid a jail sentence.        
	The military then reckoned that it was safe to hold another election, but Thaksins renamed PPP won again last year: the poor knew who was on their side. Thaksin stayed in exile, but his close ally, Samak Sundaravej, became prime minister and immediately faced the same legal vendetta. Early this year, the courts got him for moonlighting as the host of a television cooking show. In this struggle, no pretext is too petty.        
	Samak was replaced as prime minister by Thaksins brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat. The PAD then launched non-stop demonstrations that gradually paralysed the government. Three weeks ago, it seized control of both Bangkoks airports, shutting down the tourist trade that accounts for 6 per cent of Thailands economy. And last week, the courts came through for them again, ordering the disbanding of the PPP and two allied parties for electoral fraud.        
	That was the final blow. The regional godfathers, recognizing that Thaksin is finished, have begun selling their services to the old-line Democratic Party again. It is a sad outcome, but not a surprising one. Few Asian countries are openly run as dictatorships nowadays, but the urban elites and the big land-owners still call the tune there. Thaksin had his faults, but he was trying to break Thailand free from that model. Unfortunately, he failed.

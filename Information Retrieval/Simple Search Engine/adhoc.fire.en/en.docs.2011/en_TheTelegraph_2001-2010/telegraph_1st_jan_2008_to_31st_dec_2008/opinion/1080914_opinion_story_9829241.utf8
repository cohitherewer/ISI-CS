	It is a matter of glass houses. The Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, has written to the prime minister requesting his intervention to initiate the impeachment process in Parliament against Soumitra Sen, a judge in the Calcutta High Court. The allegation against Mr Sen is that he deposited money he was in charge of as receiver in a 1993 case in his personal account, retained it after becoming a high court judge in 2003, and returned it only after a court order in 2006. The three-judge committee inquiring into the allegation reportedly found the charge to be just, and Mr Sen was asked to resign or take voluntary retirement. Since he has refused, the CJI has written to the prime minister, indicating how the charge of misappropriation (at least temporary) has been established and also mentioning that the breach of trust implied in appropriating court funds for personal gain cannot be recompensed by the return of funds under the courts orders.        
	Judges must be perceived to be incorruptible; their dignity, moral force and the peoples trust in the judicial process depend on that. Impeachment is rare, because appointment as judge presupposes personal and professional integrity. This occasion is historic in a way, because there has been only one other case of impeachment under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968. The machinery for impeachment is very heavy too. Neither the judiciary nor the government is empowered to begin the process. The notice for it must be signed by either 100 members of the Lok Sabha or 50 of the Rajya Sabha. Then two-thirds of the present and voting members must call for impeachment.         
	There is a fitting dignity and gravity in the procedure for the impeachment of a judge. It is regrettable when it has to be put in motion, but it is also a mark of accountability among those who are empowered to make others accountable. It is particularly significant in a culture that prizes reverence and accepts lack of transparency as normal. Yet, this perceived lack of transparency has been occasionally questioned too. The fact that the CJI has permitted the Central Bureau of Investigation to take over the inquiry into the delivery of cash to a judge in the Punjab and Haryana High Court is a kind of answer to such worries. Moreover, all judges have been asked to declare their assets, although the higher judiciary had not been in favour of this earlier. The system of internal checks and balances of the judicial system is meant to preserve the independence of the judiciary. Its separation from the executive and the legislature has to be marked out, as also its freedom from political pressure. The balance of power among these three arms of democracy is delicate. To maintain it, transparency and accountability are useful principles to follow.

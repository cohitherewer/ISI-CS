	In Mumbai today, town is where the history is. Zero Point Bombay (Roli, Rs 695), edited by Kamala Ganesh, Usha Thakkar and Gita Chadha, takes the reader around the Horniman Circle, the centre of town. According to the editors, the Circle embodies two outstanding, interrelated characteristics of Mumbai: multi-level diversity and a distinct work ethos. Alongside the majestic Asiatic Society and Elphinstone Building (picture, top left) are bookshops like the Strand and old eateries like Jimmy Boy. There are chapters devoted to each important structure and socio-cultural movement born in the area. Significant details are picked up and explained, be it the statuary of the Asiatic Society (statue of soldier-statesman Sir John Malcolm, extreme left), remnants of the Portuguese presence (sundial, bottom) or the stained glass windows of St Thomas Cathedral (top right). This is a book to be read, not just flipped through.

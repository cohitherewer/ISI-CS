The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | As the mercury rises
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             AS THE MERCURY RISES                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The rising mercury in the capital has affected many political leaders in Delhi who seem to be totally out of sorts with everything that needs urgent attention around them. Unable to take decisions in the administrative areas allocated to them, having failed to justify the mandate bestowed upon them, and busy addressing their own little personal agendas and hobby horses, these representatives of the people seem to be in the throes of a mid-summer madness. Coalition partners of the ruling Congress are eager for a change of partner and are in the process of destroying the credibility of Manmohan Singh and his government as we head towards the polls. Some see themselves as leaders of import in a possible rag-tag dispensation next year. They all want to jockey for the best deal at the cost of India.        
	Last year, same time, the Congress was on an all-time high. The party should have gone for a mid-term election if its partners had fallen out. It should not have permitted itself to become a victim of political blackmail, and chances were that it would have gained ground. Rich and poor, urban and rural, Indians want change, respect, good governance. The political farce in the parliament and in the larger public space, enacted with regularity by our rulers, has made a complete mockery of good governance. The posturings of both the political and administrative classes have endorsed the worst features of human behaviour. Life in Delhi is like being part of a tragic-comic, never-ending opera. The valiant attempt to keep a dead coalition alive has only aggravated the damage done to the Congress, whose insidious internal planners are helping the enemy achieve huge brownie points.                
	Knaves and fools        
	Sharad Pawar seems to have lost the plot completely. As the Central minister for the very important, and, at this moment, critical agricultural sector, he only comments on topics such as whether or not Harbhajan Singh should be punished for slapping S. Sreesanth on the field at a time when India is reeling under a seemingly unmanageable price rise. That reality seems to be of no concern to him. It is as though the Nationalist Congress Party, holding this very crucial post in the coalition of the United Progressive Alliance, is determined to ensure that the government suffers profoundly for its non-performance. Once a wily politician, Pawar always had a burning ambition to rule from Delhi as a prime minister. He broke away from the Congress, led a campaign against Sonia Gandhi when it suited him and joined her ranks when it came to participation in the government at the Centre with all the attendant perks. Pawar should have been anointed the sports minister and M.S. Gill should be made the minister for agriculture. That would make Gill the right man in the right post since he has long been associated with Indian agricultural policy and its administration.        
	The grand Left is openly trying to forge another alliance at the Centre that it can hold at ransom and thus stay in the news. We are stalled and stymied by its rhetorical slogan-mongering each time India tries to do anything new. The Union surface transport minister, T.R. Baalu, is tolerated despite his shenanigans that are exposed day in and day out. He is forgiven time and again in order to appease his party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.         
	And finally, the joker in the pack is one failed leader who, from his airconditioned room in New Delhi, far from his roots, makes fun of Rahul Gandhi both for being out there in the field with tribal communities in the dead of summer, and for watching a cricket match! The jaded leader, clinging to power, sees a contradiction there. Foolish that he is, he cannot believe that a young leader can be comfortable in both Bharat and India!

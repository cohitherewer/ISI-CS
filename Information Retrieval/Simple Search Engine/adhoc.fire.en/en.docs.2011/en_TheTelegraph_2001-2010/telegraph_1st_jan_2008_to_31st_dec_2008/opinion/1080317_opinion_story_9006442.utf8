	Downward curve                  
	Sir  I fail to understand why such a hue and cry is being raised over the Indian hockey teams failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics (Britain crush Indias Beijing dream, Mar 11). Can a team be expected to win all the time? Besides, hockey is one of the most neglected sports of India. Even when the team wins, the players hardly get any recognition for their effort. And now that the team has lost, the country has suddenly woken up from its indifference towards the game and flown into a rage at the players for their poor performance in Santiago. If the loss has been shameful, each of us is as responsible for it as the players are. This is the time for us to encourage the players so that they do not give up hope. The government should come forward and provide them with better facilities.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Cajetan Peter DSouza, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Indias loss to Britain in the Olympic hockey qualifiers is indeed disgraceful. India has failed to qualify for the Olympics in hockey for the first time in eighty years. What is even more dreadful is the blame game that began as soon as the team lost. Politicians are criticizing the players for giving a poor performance. But what have the politicians and administrators done in all these years to improve the standard of the game in the country? They are much busier protecting their toadies from censure. The president of the Indian Hockey Federation, K.P.S. Gill, should have taken responsibility for the defeat and resigned. But the Union sports minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, has come to the aid of his friend and said that Gill cannot be made to resign. Truth be told, the downfall of Indian hockey began after Gill took over as the IHF president. Coaches have come and gone in quick succession during the last decade. The players have been too scared and insecure to speak up against Gills autocratic rule. The supercop has sealed the fate of Indian hockey. After the latest debacle, the least Gill could do was show some sign of shame.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Hockey in India has always suffered from paucity of funds. Players who had once represented the country now live in penury. Ironically, even Shah Rukh Khan, who played the coach of the womans hockey team in the film, Chak De! India, turned to cricket when it came to business. It seems that hockey is well on its way to becoming the stuff of legends as the game dies a rapid death. It is no use reprimanding the players for what happened in Chile. It would have happened, sooner or later.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Parakram Paul, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Cricket controversies in India attract more attention than trophies in hockey. Even if the hockey team had qualified for the Olympics, would we have celebrated in the way we do after every win in cricket? When hockey players do not get the esteem they deserve from their countrymen, they have no responsibility to perform well all the time.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Indian hockey squad is somewhat like the West Indies cricket team. Both were undisputed champions once, and both have now fallen from the top. In both cases, the fall is so severe that it will take years to recover, if at all. The men in charge of the West Indian team, like those in control of the Indian hockey team, blame everything under the sun except themselves for the pitiable condition of the sports they are supposed to look after. They pay no attention to promoting the game in schools and colleges or to improving the existing infrastructure. Is it any wonder then that both teams are languishing today?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ramani P. Easwaran, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan, the hero of Chak De! India, can go to Durban and Melbourne to cheer the Indian cricketers and can throw around millions to buy cricket players, but cannot do anything for Indian hockey. The day we start treating every sport equally in India, the performance of the players, whether in hockey or football or golf, is bound to improve.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

                
	Sir  It is shocking that for the first time since hockey made its Olympic debut at Amsterdam in 1928, the Indian hockey team, which won six gold medals between 1928 and 1956, has failed to make it to the Olympics this year. This is what the team that once boasted players like Dhyan Chand has come to. How can one forget that in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Adolf Hitler had made an offer to Dhyan Chand to play for Germany  an offer that the legend had refused politely? Indias loss to Britain, which can hardly be called a top-ranking team, spells the death of hockey in this country.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  A sport needs proper attention and players need inspiration to perform well. As the box entitled Yawning gap revealed, hockey players are indeed treated like stepchildren in India (Hockey in shame, up to its Gill, March 11). Besides, the public is not half as interested in hockey as they are in cricket.           
	Yours faithfully,

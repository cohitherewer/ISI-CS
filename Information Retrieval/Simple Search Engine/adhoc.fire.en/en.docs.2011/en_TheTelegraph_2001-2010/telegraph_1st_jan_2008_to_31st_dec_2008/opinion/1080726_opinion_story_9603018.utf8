	Did you know that if there were no gravity, you would not be able to empty your bowels as you do while you are on Earth? This is confirmed by the experience of an astronaut who in outer space was free of gravitational pull and, as a result, suffered from acute constipation. The South China Morning Post of May 24 2008 carries the following news item:        
	Being an astronaut might seem like a glamorous profession, scientist Jin Xu-Kai told reporters in Guanghua, Sichuan, but there are some embarrassing aspects to life in outer space. Because of zero gravity, astronauts often suffer from constipation, and the traditional method of evacuation has always been to use an air pump. However, air pumps are expensive, bulky and difficult to use. It requires five days of training to learn how to operate one; they have a high failure rate, and the shock to the body can be almost as bad as the constipation itself. Thats why I have spent the past three years developing a safer and more efficient alternative, the Rectal Excavator.        
	This new invention will ease the suffering of astronauts everywhere. Essentially, it features a cylindrical double-screw reamer, which is inserted into the anal cavity, where it excavates and removes the blockage, rather like a more sophisticated version of Archimedes screw. Astronauts would need only five to seven minutes to relieve their constipation with my device, and although I experienced a slight discomfort when I tried it myself, it was nothing compared to the miseries and sufferings of constipation in space. The China National Space Administration has already expressed interest in my invention, and my Rectal Excavator may be carried on future space missions. I am also showing it to hospitals, because it could also be used for medical purposes here on earth.                
	Not for fun                
	In 1923, Maharajah Ripudaman Singh of Nabha was forced to abdicate power and exiled to Kodaikanal. His eldest son was installed on the gaddi. The ex-Maharajah took on a second wife and sired another brood of children with her. So there were two sets of descendants of the royal family. The successor and heir to the family fortunes, like many others of princely tribe, spent his days and nights eating, drinking, fornicating and getting fat. Children of the second branch had to earn their own livelihood. One of the granddaughters married into the Marwari industrialists family of the Khemkas.         
	The Khemka-Nabha union gave birth to the Nabha Foundation. It is a charitable institution running schools, work centres for women, looking after historic buildings and encouraging organic farming. It is patterned after Ela Bhatts Self Empolyed Womens Association based in Ahmedabad. But while SEWA works for making women economically self-reliant while they stay within their homes, has opened a bank operated by them and has become self-sufficient, the Nabha Foundation has limited its operations to one tehsil and works for children of both sexes, as well as for farmers. It still depends on the bounty of the Khemkas.        
	I got this information from Geetanjali Gill, a young attractive divorcee without alimony, who has decided to return to her parents home in Nabha to work for the Foundation. Her family traces its descent from the founder of Nabha. She gave me a detailed account of the work she did. I asked her What do you do for fun?        
	She gave me a broad smile and replied, Nothing. Nabha is not a fun place. During the day I work with women, children and farmers, in the evening I stay at home watching television or listening to recorded music. For fun I have to go to Patiala or Chandigarh. But who wants to drive out on these roads at night?                
	Any regrets?                
	A stock question that most people ask me at the end of any conversation is: Have you any regrets in life? To be honest, I have never drawn a balancesheet of what I did and what I tried but failed to do. I usually fob them off with a quotation from Ghalib:                
	Nakarda gunahon kee bhee hasrat        
	kee miley daad        
	Ya Rab! agar in karda gunahon kee         
	sazaa hai                
	For sins I intended to but did not        
	commit, give me credit        
	Dear God, if you must punish me for         
	those I did commit.                
	The quotation usually prevents my interrogators from probing further. But often I find myself going over my past and asking myself, what if I had been better at my studies, made a successful lawyer, diplomat, civil servant or teacher of myself? I might have done as well for myself as my contemporaries did. However, I did not. But I scored over them by outlasting them and hence got more years to enjoy what the world has to offer. That is no mean achievement.         
	However, when it comes to regrets in ones life, I find myself thinking about the women who attracted me but to whom I could not express my admiration lest they snubbed me. Later in life, I was able to confess my infatuation to them. But by that time, some of them had become grandmothers. Far from taking it ill, my confession cheered them up and their usual response was: Silly ass! Why didnt you tell me then? We might have had some good times together. I found the assurance strangely fulfiling. So no regrets even on that score.                
	Difficult delivery                
	Question: What is common between speech and child birth?        
	Answer: Both are easy to conceive but difficult to deliver.

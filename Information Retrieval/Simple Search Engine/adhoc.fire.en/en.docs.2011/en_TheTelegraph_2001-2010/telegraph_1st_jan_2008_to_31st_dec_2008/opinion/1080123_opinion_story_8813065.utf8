                                                                                                                                    ALL FALL DOWN
                          
	It is no longer a correction, it is a crisis. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index fell by 4,000 points since last Monday, that is, by 19 per cent. On Tuesday, the stock exchanges suspended trading as the indices fell by over 10 per cent before noon. Stock markets in Europe, Asia, South America, the United States of America and Canada also fell precipitously, and there are few signs that the carnage will end soon. The proximate cause: fears of a recession in the US  the worlds largest economy that accounts for nearly a third of global gross domestic product. So much for that decoupling theory. The first crisis that may have set the ball rolling is the one in the US sub-prime mortgage market; the markets in that country were closed on Monday, but people are bracing for the markets to open down on Tuesday. Now, there are worries that the anticipated cuts in interest rates are not likely to bring about the capital flows that emerging markets were expecting.
    
	For India, it is also a liquidity crisis; first the initial public offering market  led by Reliance Powers IPO of Rs 11,000 crore  sucked out nearly Rs 10 lakh crore from the system. Now, the steep fall in markets is forcing banks and other lenders who financed stock-market investment to make margin calls  brokers are expected to maintain a percentage of their positions in cash or securities with the stock exchanges  or square off leveraged positions, chiefly of those investors who have borrowed to fund their investments. This is sending the market spiralling further downwards. The crash of the market has also prompted questions about optimistic stock valuations in investors minds; a crisis of confidence. But stock markets have always been sold on an elegant slogan: stay in for the long haul, and we continue to hear this being stressed, along with an additional line about the strong fundamentals of the India growth story.
    
	This crash has been a few months in the making, and a few individuals have been voicing their concerns fairly frequently. In a speech delivered in Hyderabad on January 3, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Y.V. Reddy, said that the possibility of abrupt changes in sentiments or global liquidity conditions, despite strong underlying fundamentals of the Indian economy could not be excluded. Policymakers and government officials at the senior-most levels are weighing in. The finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has said that adequate liquidity will be provided, but his announcement has been short on detail. The current situation is much more than just a liquidity seizure. So it is important that the cure not be worse than the disease.

	When in the Fifties of the last century, the late Jaipal Singh had launched the movement for a separate Jharkhand, he did not have in mind just a piece of territory that will be governed by tribals themselves. For him, that territory would also be one whose public life would be dominated by a culture different from that of the dikhu or outsider. The hockey-player of repute did not see the birth of Jharkhand and perhaps that was a blessing in disguise. The political culture of Jharkhand is no different from that of the rest of the Hindi heartland and the latest proof of this is the manner in which Shibu Soren managed to grab the chief ministers office.        
	Ever since he was acquitted in the Chirudih massacre case, Soren had been on the lookout for rehabilitation. He thought that he would be given back his coal portfolio but the prime minister was not willing to take him back, and perhaps rightly so. So Soren had to wait, but not for long. The trust vote came along, the ministry was looking for numbers and Soren agreed to bail it out for a price. Poor Madhu Koda had to give way to Soren since he would have lost the job anyway without the support of the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and, of course, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.        
	In the process, no rules were violated. But what about political morality? When the Congress, the RJD and the JMM supported Koda and his group of independents, it had not been said that the support would be withdrawn if somebody else had to be accommodated in the interest of the Central ministry. Yet that is exactly what has happened  Soren had to be kept happy and so Koda had to go. North India, in particular, has witnessed many acts of brazen immorality but this certainly takes the cake.                
	Bleak future        
	The ordinary tribals in Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Giridih or elsewhere cannot be happy with such goings-on. Indeed, in the last election they had made their disgust clear by electing so many independent candidates. Koda was a symbol of their mood and now that he has been pressured out, these people may become even more disgruntled.         
	The Koda ministry lost majority when Soren withdrew support and the only honourable course of action then would have been to impose presidents rule for a few months and then order fresh elections. But that course of action could not be followed out of fear that in such a case the Bharatiya Janata Party may return to power in the state.        
	But what legitimacy does Soren have? He did not win a majority in the last election  just cobbled up an alliance that lasted for only nine days. Yet Guruji goes about pretending that he is the lone messiah of the tribals and browbeats others to nod their assent. And that too when suspicion persists about his involvement in various unpleasant acts.        
	The Soren ministry may last the rest of the five-year term of the assembly or it may not. But that is not important, except perhaps to Soren himself and his backers. The more relevant question concerns the future of Jharkhand. Since its birth, Jharkhand has seen ministries of different hues and none has left any impression on the peoples minds. When the region was a part of Bihar, it was roundly neglected since Patna had interest only in the revenue it yielded. Even now the region continues to be neglected although bhumiputras are in charge, claiming to uphold tribal identity. The chances of Soren turning things around are remote  he seems to be more occupied with populist demands like more areas from other states and shifting the head offices of Coal India and the Damodar Valley Corporation to Ranchi from Calcutta. The dreams of Jaipal Singh of a flourishing tribal economy and culture are going to remain unfulfilled for a long time.

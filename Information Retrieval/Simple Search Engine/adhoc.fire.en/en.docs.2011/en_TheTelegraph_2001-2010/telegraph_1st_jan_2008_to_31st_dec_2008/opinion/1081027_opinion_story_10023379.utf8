	The financial crisis has rulers worried. Apart from the crisis, they have their subjects to worry about. For crisis is contagious. It makes people behave in ways that accentuate it. Rulers try to discourage such behaviour. Amongst them, there are two styles. One entails telling the people what the rulers have done to combat the crisis. The other is to tell people not to worry. The Americans and the British have by and large stuck to the first style. In the United States of America, the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and the chief of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, have generally held themselves back till they had some action to report, and then have confined themselves to announcing and explaining it. In Britain, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the chancellor of the exchequer, Alistair Darling, from the beginning of the Northern Rock crisis spoke to announce action. Executives of businesses in trouble have often made statements to reassure their clients and investors  assurances that were invariably based on lies, since the executives were very familiar with their businesses.        
	Both styles have something to say for them. Action speaks louder than words; if the action makes sense, it will generally carry conviction. On the other hand, governments cannot take action every day; meanwhile, they may feel the need to reassure the public. Both styles are familiar to Indians. The Reserve Bank of India has taken steps to encourage bank lending, and less resolute steps to reduce its cost. But apart from announcing the steps, it has been largely silent. D. Subbarao, the new governor, has made no unscheduled statements; and those he has made (for instance, after the release of the RBIs annual monetary policy) were confined to facts or to the banks reading of them.        
	The finance minister, on the other hand, made two statements, on October 8 and 13. In both he painted a rosy picture of the Indian economy and sought to persuade listeners that it was too robust to be afflicted by such sickness as industrial economies were experiencing. He also assured investors that their investments were safe  after the sensitive index had lost half of its peak value  and advised them to take informed decisions, although he was less specific about the information they should take into account. If it was the information he gave, it was all statistics on the economys past performance, whereas the essence of a crisis is a discontinuity from the past. He asked people to be confident and banish fear. P. Chidambaram is a powerful man and has access to information beyond the ken of the common man. So it behoves the common man to take his reassurance seriously. It may happen that the common mans everyday experiences  falling sales, loss of jobs or failing businesses  would overwhelm the finance ministers assurances. But until they do, his word must rule. Maybe he knows the future better than his counterparts abroad.

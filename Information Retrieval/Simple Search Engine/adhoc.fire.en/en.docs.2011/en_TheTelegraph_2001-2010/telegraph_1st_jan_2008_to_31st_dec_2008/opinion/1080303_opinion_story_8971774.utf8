	All theologies in their orthodox forms are not only sexist but also anti-feminist. But thankfully, the myriad forms of religious belief and practice that make up everyday devotion all over the world have managed to turn this orthodoxy into a kind of rich and inadvertently liberal chaos. So, from time to time, orthodoxies have to make dourly assertive pronouncements, thereby cutting themselves off even more ridiculously from the human medley that every religion must end up as in order to survive in the actual world. This is the spirit in which sensible believers ought to take the latest pronouncement from the Vatican: god must always be recognized as the father, as male, and cannot be addressed in gender-neutral terms. Its immediate context is the use of these terms during the Catholic baptism ceremony. Any baptism invoking a gender-neutral creator, redeemer or sanctifier would be invalid in the eyes of the Catholic Church.        
	But the larger context is the Vaticans shuddering dismissal of that critical heterodoxy within modern Christianity often referred to as feminist theology. From avoiding what the Church of England has recently labelled as the uncritical use of masculine imagery to the ordination of women and the rejection of Biblical misogyny, feminist theologians are attempting, at various levels of belief and practice, to restore gender justice to an essentially illiberal orthodoxy. It is this that Pope Benedict XVI has vehemently distanced himself and his church from, calling it no longer the Christianity we know but another religion. Given the popes frequently aired views on abortion, premarital sex and homosexuality, and given his German right-wing and inquisitorial past, this should come as no surprise. It is not without reason that progressive Catholics have nicknamed him Cardinal No and Gods Rottweiler. God, sensible believers hope, is above such fallen polarities as gender. Perhaps such a god prefers to be catholic, rather than Catholic, in these matters.

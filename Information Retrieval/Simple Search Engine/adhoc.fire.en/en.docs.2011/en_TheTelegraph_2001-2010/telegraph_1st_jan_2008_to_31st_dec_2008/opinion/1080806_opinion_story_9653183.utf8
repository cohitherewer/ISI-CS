    A pump operator in Gas Thermal Civil Subdivision, Baramuda, was made to work overtime but was denied the overtime allowance that was due to him. The company cited Section 64 of the Factories Act, which prohibits more than 50 hours of overtime duty in three months unless the chief inspector appointed under the Act has permitted it. Since the approval of the chief inspector had not been taken, the employer ignored the overtime that the pump operator had put in and hence also the overtime that was due to him. The latter approached the high court, saying that he could not be made to suffer for his employer rsquo;s negligence as obtaining the permission was not his duty. The Gauhati High Court ruled that since the petitioner had actually worked overtime, his allowance could not be denied. (Nepal Chandra Das vs State of Tripura amp; ors)     Club vs industry
    The service of an employee of the Tata Sports Club was terminated on grounds of misconduct and unauthorised absence. The employee approached the Labour Court, which ruled that the case was not under its jurisdiction as a club was not an ldquo;industry rdquo;. The Bombay High Court, however, held that Tata Sports Club was an ldquo;industry rdquo; in accordance with the Industrial Disputes Act. The court added that the club was involved in the production and distribution of goods and services which necessitated the cooperation and coordination between employer 
  and employees. (Tata Sports Club Mumbai vs

    A railway booking clerk was caught while over-charging a decoy passenger at a railway station. At the Bombay High Court, the clerk argued that he should be exonerated as only a small amount of money mdash; Rs 25 mdash; was involved. But the court held that his behaviour was an example of the dishonesty of government servants. It said that while only one person had been trapped, there were many others who indulged in such activities. The judgement said that it was not the quantum of the misappropriation, but the attitude of the employee that would determine the punishment. (Nilesh R Mandra vs Union of India)

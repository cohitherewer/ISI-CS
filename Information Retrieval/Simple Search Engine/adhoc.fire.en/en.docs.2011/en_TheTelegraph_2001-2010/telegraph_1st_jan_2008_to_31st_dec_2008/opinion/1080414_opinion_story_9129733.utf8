	Ungodly conduct                  
	Sir  The West Bengal transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, has likened himself to a great man who doesnt crave for rewards (Great Subhas above craving, April 5). Chakrabortys reaction came after he failed to get a berth in the party central committee, on the day 20 people died in a bus accident. There is no denying Chakrabortys greatness: he is forever boasting about himself instead of doing any real work. As a transport minister, he cannot possibly absolve himself of his responsibilities at a time when scores of people are dying in road accidents in the city. Is it not his duty as the transport minister to ensure that Calcuttans can travel safely on the city streets? Or that traffic rules are not routinely flouted by public transport system workers, many of whom are affiliated to Citu, the CPI(M)s labour wing? Over the years, Chakraborty has done very little apart from hobnobbing with the corrupt. As a result, the traffic situation in the city has deteriorated alarmingly. Accidents and traffic snarls have become alarmingly common. Isnt it time the mahapurush rescued Calcuttans from their woes on the road?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tirthankar Bandyopadhyay, Hounslow, UK 

                
	Sir  Subhas Chakraborty, instead of resigning over his inability to prevent road deaths in Calcutta, is now boasting about himself. Chakrabortys comment comes at a time when road accidents have become regular events in this metropolis. Most of these mishaps take place because of rash driving. The recent tragedy in which a bus fell into the Bagjola canal killing 20 people was a classic example of this. On many occasions, errant drivers and conductors manage to get away with their crimes. Perhaps Chakraborty is unaware of the fact that as a transport minister, and a great man, he is duty-bound to ensure citizens safety. If he fails in his duties, it will not be long before the people bring him down from his lofty perch.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tina Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The passengers who beat up the driver and conductor of a bus for speeding have done a great service to the people of Calcutta (Passengers rough up racing driver amp; crew, April 9). The state transport minister has done nothing to stop the deaths on Calcuttas roads, forcing the people to take the law into their hands to save their own lives. However, assaulting drivers is unlikely to solve the problem of speeding buses. For that to happen, every bus should prominently display the contact number of the concerned police department that monitors rash driving. Most passengers carry mobile phones with them. If a bus driver drives recklessly, they could then inform the police about the incident with the help of the number on display. A second violation on the driver part should result in the permanent cancellation of his driving licence. Further, all drivers, while applying for jobs, should be made to give correct information. A false declaration on the drivers part should result in his dismissal. The owners of vehicles should also get a drivers application checked by the motor vehicles department.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R.S. Sharma, Calcutta

                
	Speak up          
	Sir  First, the government prevents Taslima Nasreen from returning to Calcutta to appease a handful of obscure, minority organizations. Next, it allows the Olympic torch relay to take place in Delhi, despite the calls for a boycott of the event from around the world. Not just that, the defence minister also asked the Dalai Lama not to say anything that would harm Indias ties with China. Is this because the Indian government is scared of the military might of China? Or is it afraid that the Left would withdraw support from the government if it were to displease China? The Congress-led government should not succumb to the blackmailing of the Left. Instead, it should take a principled stand against Chinese atrocities in Tibet.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashim Choudhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Whether or not Tibet is an integral part of China can be debated endlessly, much like the Kashmir issue that continues to be argued over in various parts of the subcontinent. But what is evident is that the Tibetan protests against Chinese occupation of their country at a time when the Beijing Olympics are drawing near has been sparked by external forces. Sport and politics should never be mixed together. It is time for the United Nations to intervene and solve the crisis by appealing to the participant nations to ensure the smooth completion of the Olympics. The Games, after all, symbolize peace and harmony in a world that is increasingly turning into an ugly place to live in.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bhupati Bhattacharya, Calcutta

	Second helping                  
	Sir  A glance at Sachin Tendulkars career would reveal that the Little Master seldom manages to score runs in the second innings of a Test match. He contributed only 15 to Indias second-innings score in Melbourne, and is likely to fail in Sydney too  particularly since he has scored a ton in the first innings. Perhaps the BCCI should find him a sponsor for second-innings centuries. Commercial, if not cricketing interests, one hopes, would help Tendulkar improve his second-innings performance.          
	Yours faithfully,        Agnidev Sharma, Calcutta
        
	Mixed verdict          
	Sir  I was delighted to read Swapan Dasguptas penetrating comparison of Narendra Modi with Mahatma Gandhi (Merchant of victory, Dec 28). Could he please write another piece comparing two other mass killers, Attila the Hun and Chenghiz Khan with Jesus Christ and Gautam Buddha respectively?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Raychaudhuri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Narendra Modis coming to power in Gujarat is a threat to the future of democracy in India (Mighty Maskot, Dec 24). His return to power raises the possibility of renewed communal violence in the state. Not only that, the electoral success of a man responsible for a State-sponsored pogrom and for the rise of right-wing extremist politics would also dent Indias credentials as a secular, pluralist nation. As for the Congress, which performed only marginally better in the polls this time, its failure to wrest power could be explained by the absence of its principled stance against the BJP. The Congresss peddling of soft Hindutva left the electorate with no other choice but to vote for the BJP. Would the secularists within the Congress now introspect on this aspect with greater intent?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Ziyaullah Khan, Pune 

      
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Partys victory in Gujarat would undoubtedly boost the party leadership. The saffron party should now concentrate on winning the Lok Sabha elections, which may not be too far away, given the Lefts unhappiness with the Congress government over the nuclear deal with America. The Congress must also be ruing Sonia Gandhis decision to describe Modi as a merchant of death. This helped Modi mobilize an otherwise fragmented electorate and draw Hindu votes in his favour. This victory would heighten Modis stature by a few notches within his party. It would not be surprising if Modi now begins to dominate national politics too.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  It is time to amend our Constitution so that only permanent bachelors are allowed to become chief ministers and prime ministers. Take the example of Narendra Modi. A bachelor himself, Modi has worked single-mindedly to develop Gujarat during his tenure. For men like Modi, it is the welfare of the state, rather than the family, that comes first. There are only a few other committed politicians like him in India: the names of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mamata Banerjee come to mind in this respect. These are true leaders who, instead of amassing ill-gotten wealth, are more interested in providing good governance to the people.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tuneer Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Indian press is ridiculous at times. Scribes seem to think that Narendra Modi comes, chants Hare Ram, and wins elections. Nothing could be sillier than this. Gujarat under Modi is developing fast. He might be haughty in his demeanour, but he is without doubt an able administrator.          
	Yours faithfully,

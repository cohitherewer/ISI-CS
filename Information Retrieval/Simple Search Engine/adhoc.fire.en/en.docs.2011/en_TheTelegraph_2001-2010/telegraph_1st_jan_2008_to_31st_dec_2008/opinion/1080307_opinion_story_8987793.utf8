	DETECTIVE STORY By Imre Kertsz, Harvill Secker, 8.50        
	Imre Kertszs latest novel, as its narrator Antonio Martens puts it, tells a simple and sickening story. The title, Detective Story, is deceptively trite, for there is no detection here, only a steady unravelling of events, recounted with clinical precision in a fastidiously lucid language. Instead of the breathless excitement of classic crime fiction, this pithy little tale, barely a hundred pages long, evokes bitter apprehension. While thematic continuities with the earlier works are palpable, Kertsz also departs strikingly from his signature style. Detective Story is pervaded by the same bleakness that forms the substance of Liquidation (2003) or Fatelessness (1975). But as a novel, it is structurally less complicated  a thinner book, both physically and metaphysically.         
	This is not to undermine its philosophical moment. Unlike the labyrinthine plot of Liquidation, which immediately preceded Detective Story, Kertsz uses a more direct storyline here. Auschwitz is not the ruling spirit of this work, but is invoked archly, and even then not so much as an omnipotent metaphor as a terrifying homology. In Detective Story, Kertsz revisits the demon of the Communist dictatorship in Fifties Hungary, which was also the subject of his second novel, Fiasco (1988). Having survived two totalitarian regimes, the Nazi state and the Communist Hungary, Kertsz creates a fabular world out of historical transpositions and superimpositions.         
	The setting is Latin America (although it could easily be anywhere in eastern Europe), in an erstwhile dictatorial state, where Martens, a former member of the secret police, is now convicted of the crime of torture. In his prison cell, he wishes to write, not because he feels remorse or guilt, but simply to record how he grasped the logic of his actions. This disinterested wish is projected outside a frame of morality, seeking not pardon, but a purely rational understanding. Martens knew he was only a lowly cog in a big machine, just a garden-variety flatfoot whom the regime has used to achieve its ends. When its time was up, he became redundant, persona non grata. Thus, in a perverse sense, Martens is a survivor  an agent of evil who has outlived the state of evil that had once validated his existence. Having survived this evil, he emerges as a man robbed of destiny, neither tragic nor comic: a person reduced to an unillusioned, disembodied voice.        
	In the newly-liberated nation, a defense lawyer gets him pen and paper, and later undertakes to publish his account, in order to help the captive Martens make sense of his fate. The lawyer misses the essential irony of this philanthropic gesture: condemned of unspeakable crimes, Martens has already been irredeemably hurled into fatelessness. In fact, he had always been without destiny. As the new boy in the Corps, the authorities implicated him in the infamous Salinas affair, and thus saddled him on to a fate that was not his own making: But then what possible influence could a detectives beliefs have had on events here? And it was this brutal determinism that he wanted to document: There was a time beforehand when I understood, and now I have understood again. During ones actions, though, one forgets.        
	Martens is not the archetypal monster, he is all too falteringly human to embrace the full force of evil (Just imagine, a policeman who stutters, jiggles uneasily with his hands, and trails off in the middle of sentences). The contingencies of his existence are apparent to him, but, instead of contesting them, he complies unquestioningly with the autocratic rule that perpetuates these. This is how his half-baked monstrosity operates. His colleagues, Diaz and Rodriguez, are finished, immaculate creatures of evil. While Diaz is the ardent Stalinist who believes that the only revolution is the police revolution, Rodriguez firmly upholds Nazism, he is morbidly obsessed with a miniature model of the deadly Boger Swing (a Nazi torture tool) and rabidly anti-Semitic: Anyone who wants something else is Jewish. This is a daring proposition: a homologous correspondence between the figure of the Rebel and the Jew. It is in this way that Kertsz links Detective Story to the most enduring and unsurpassable moment of his life: Auschwitz.         
	The counterpoint to Martens is Enrique Salinas, son of a rich industrialist, deeply troubled by the timid bourgeois acceptance of political tyranny. Enrique, living a nonexistent existence, is the mirror-image of Martens: he is the rebel, refusing to fall in step with the establishment, thirsty for life, action, friendship and love. Desperate to stand apart from the faceless millions, Enrique slips inadvertently into an insidious trail of false promises, betrayal, police interrogation and, finally, execution.         
	His story is revealed by his persecutor, Martens himself, who had purchased Enriques diary after his death. Martens selects, arranges and comments on critical moments in Enriques sentimental education, leaving strange ellipses, playing god. As a former secret police, Martens has the most comprehensive knowledge of Enriques life. He knows, for instance, that Ramn  Enriques friend and confidante  is a Felix-Krull-like character, an informer with the ardour of a leech. The beautiful Estella Jill, Enriques beloved, prefers to be vilely happy, she does not groan under the iron fist of dictatorship but purr. Martens is even aware of a conversation between Enrique and his father, Federigo, that proved to be dangerous for both men in the end. This exchange between father and son is the closest that Martens comes to an empirical proof of their treason. And this is also the crux of Kertszs plot. However, this exchange, so far breathlessly taut, suddenly dissolves into a mysterious amnesia. Federigo proposes to involve Enrique in the work of the sort of men to whom I belong, hinting, presumably, at some underground revolutionary activity. But this cryptic remark is not decoded any further: I dont remember what he said, says Enrique.        
	It is this gap in the great chain of causality that makes Martenss assertion dubious, that Enrique was innocent...his innocence was intransigent, like a virginity that has been violated. In any event, Enriques innocence did not absolve his father, and, if anything, burdened the Corps with even greater accountability for making illegal arrests. However, Martens feels morally unperturbed, not remotely penitent. This is not because he revels in evil for its own sake, like Diaz or Rodriguez. Rather, he remains stoically resigned to the historical forces that had pried his life loose from the moral superstructure of humanity. History, that great Moloch in Kertszs Nobel lecture, uses only the new boys like Martens as means to a better world.         
	In the end, Martens demands neither condemnation nor acceptance from the reader. He remains ambiguously human, beyond forgiveness and understanding. His life is ruled by inevitable and unavoidable forces: It is always me whom they catch  people like me, I mean.

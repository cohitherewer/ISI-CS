                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             REAL FACTS AGAINST COMMON PREJUDICES                              Extracts from the Sachar Commission Report (2006) on the Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India      DOCUMENT                                                
	The type of educational institution in which children study is an important marker of educational status. This is because the quality and cost of education vary in different types of schools. There does not seem to be any major difference in the choice of educational institutions across socio-religious categories analysed. Both Muslim and other children mostly attend the inexpensive government or government-aided schools; about one-third attend private schools. Many of the government-aided schools may effectively be privately run; an analysis of the proportion of children going to government versus government-aided schools would be instructive. A small proportion (4 per cent) of Muslim children also attend madarsas.        
	It is often believed that a large proportion of Muslim children study in madarsas, mostly to get acquainted with the religious discourse and ensure the continuation of Islamic culture and social life. A persistent belief nurtured, in the absence of statistical data and evidence, is that Muslim parents have a preference for religious education leading to dependence on madarsas. It is also argued that education in madarsas often encourages religious fundamentalism and creates a sense of alienation from the mainstream. In actuality the number of madarsa-attending students is much less than commonly believed. For example, in West Bengal, where Muslims form 25 per cent of the population, the number of madarsa students at 3.41 lakhs is only about 4 per cent of the 7-19 age group. National Council for Applied Economic Rresearch figures indicate that only about 4 per cent of all Muslim students of the school-going age group are enrolled in madarsas. At the all-India level this works out to be about 3 per cent of all Muslim children of school-going age. The NCAER data is supported by estimates made from school-level National Council for Educational Research and Training (provisional) data, which indicate a somewhat lower level of 2.3 per cent of Muslim children aged 7-19 years who study in madarsas. The proportions are higher in rural areas and amongst males.        
	Despite regional variations, the NCERT estimates, in general, are lower than the NCAER ones, except for the Eastern region. Despite wide variations in the two sets of estimates, the importance of madarsas as a source of education is not high in any of the regions, except the Northern one. But even here, according to the higher NCAER estimate, less than 7 per cent children of the school-going age group attend madarsas. One reason for the misconception that the majority of Muslim children is enrolled in madarsas is that people do not distinguish between madarsas and maktabs. While madarsas provide education (religious and/or regular), maktabs are neighbourhood schools, often attached to mosques, that provide religious education to children who attend other schools to get mainstream education. Thus maktabs provide part-time religious education and are complementary to the formal educational institutions.        
	In Kerala, for instance, more than 60,000 Muslim students study in both mainstream institutions and maktabs at the same time. Since private and government-aided schools do not teach Urdu adequately, children have to be taught to read the scriptures at home. Some children are taught to read the Quran by their parents, relatives or by private tutors. In many cases, especially in low and medium income families, parents do not have the time or ability to teach their children themselves. Micro-level studies show that such parents admit their children to maktabs, in addition to secular schools. Based on the NCERT (provisional) data the percentage of Muslim children aged 7-19 years going to the first type of maktabs has been estimated. Even these figures are not very high  only 4 per cent of Muslim children study in them. While this percentage is lower in urban areas, interestingly it is almost the same between boys and girls.        
	When modernization of madarsas is planned, policy-makers should be careful to distinguish between these two types of institutions. The maktabs and residential madarsas are necessarily traditional and meant only for religious education, because their social function is to carry on the Islamic tradition. On the other hand, it is the constitutional obligation (under Article 21A) of the government to provide education to the masses. Aided-madarsas are often the last recourse for Muslims, especially those who lack the economic resources to bear the costs of schooling, or for households located in areas where mainstream educational institutions are inaccessible. The solution in such cases is not only to modernize madarsas, but also to provide good quality, subsidized mainstream education and create an adequate infrastructure for education.         
	Apart from the role madarsas have played in providing religious education, one needs to recognize their contribution towards the education of Muslims in the country. Very often one finds that madarsas have indeed provided schooling to Muslim children where the State has failed them. Many children go to madarsas and thereby acquire some level of literacy/education when there is no school in the neighbourhood. This effort needs to be recognized. This could be done by establishing equivalence to madarsa certificates for subsequent admission into government schools and universities. For this purpose, equivalence between the two systems of education will need to be established at different levels. Many madarsas provide education that is similar to that provided in mainstream schools. This needs to be understood in a transparent manner. Many madarsas have shown an interest in the modernization scheme of the government and are keen to incorporate science, mathematics and other modern/regular subjects in their curriculum and introduce modern methods of pedagogy.         
	In the case of the implementation of the scheme for modernization of madarsas a number of deficiencies were discovered by an evaluation exercise. Some of these were as follows: The number and quality of teachers assigned to madarsas for teaching modern subjects and their remuneration were inadequate. Besides, the important aspect of finding space for modern subjects in the madarsa curriculum appears to have been ignored. The modern stream remained un-supervised at the madarsa level and un- inspected at the state level. A fresh evaluation of the scheme, which may result in its being overhauled, is needed.

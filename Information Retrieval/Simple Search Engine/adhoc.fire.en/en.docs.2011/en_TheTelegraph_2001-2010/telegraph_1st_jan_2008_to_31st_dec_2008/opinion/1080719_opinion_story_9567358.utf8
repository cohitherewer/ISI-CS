	It is a sordid tale. But as told by Moni Mohsin in her novel, The End of Innocence, it is gripping. All the characters come alive, their dialogue, in different forms of Punjabi and English, sounds authentic. Mohsins description of the flora and fauna of the countryside is true to life. Above all, she is objective  she takes no sides on the issue of the Indo-Pak conflict. On the contrary, she punctures the inflated self-esteem, based on martial prowess, of Pakistani soldiers, each of whom boasts that he is capable of taking on ten Hindu soldiers armed to the teeth with the latest weaponry, including an atom bomb. Boasting  pharran marna  is in every Punjabis blood, be he Muslim, Hindu or Sikh. War hysteria overtakes Sabzbagh. The Azeems dig an underground shelter in their garden. Sarah sleeps with a pocket-knife under her pillow. The cooking staff sharpen their kitchen knives, girls get ready with chilli powder to throw into the eyes of Indian soldiers. But in spite of the elaborate preparation, all that happens is that an Indian plane drops a light bomb to see if the place is worth bombing and then decides against doing so.        
	I take this opportunity to explode some myths about the Bangladeshi War of 1971. It is assumed that the country was liberated by the Mukti Bahini and that the Indian army played a marginal role in the drama. I happened to be in Dhaka soon after it was captured by the Indian army. By the courtesy of General Jagjit Singh, I was permitted to meet captive Pakistani officers and men. It was a privilege denied to all media-men, even from abroad. I had the Pakistanis over in my hotel for drinks and had long discussions with them on what transpired. Foreign journalists, among whom was a German, Tilo Bode, sought to get information from me.         
	It was clear to me that the Mukti Bahini was largely built up, armed, trained and led by Indian officers pretending to be Bengalis. The Indian army was deep inside East Pakistan before the president of Pakistan, General Yahya Khan, was forced to declare war against India. It was an unequal combat. The countryside, though mostly composed of Muslims, was hostile to Pakistan. The stakes were against Pakistan as it was unable to send more troops, aircraft and warships to help the beleaguered army. City after city was taken over by the Indians. And finally, when Dhaka fell, the Pakistani army laid down its arms and surrendered to the Indian army, not to the Mukti Bahini. 93,000 Pakistani captives were taken to India and not kept in Bangladesh. When I told this to Tilo Bode he expressed his gratitude to me saying, Since you have helped me out of my difficulties, Ill tell you something you dont know. Do you know the war cry of the Mukti Bahini? No, do tell me. Sat Sri Akal.            
	The bride price                
	Alongwith a pretty-looking bride
  They gave him a Mercedes to ride  
  And the brides father being the communitys king
  They gave every barati a diamond ring
  Two and a half crore was the total bill
  But more was demanded still.
  And more was paid, till ultimately
  The one-year-old bubbling bride
  Hanged herself, and justified
  The wide-spread practice of female foeticide.

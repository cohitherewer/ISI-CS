	Muthuvel Karunanidhi seems to have got over his guilt complex. It is proved by the regularity with which he now prods the Centre into raking up the Sri Lankan Tamil issue with Indias southern neighbour. Months after encouraging Indian dignitaries at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meeting to get Sri Lanka to ensure safety for Tamil fisherman on its coast, he has coaxed the national security advisor to talk tough with Sri Lanka. Mr Karunanidhis confidence in his ability to make the Centre do his bidding stems from the fact that his party provides life support to the government. And the reason his heart bleeds a little more for the Sri Lankan Tamils is their plight agitates political parties in his state as no other cause does. The Communist Party of India, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Pattali Makkal Katchi and other established parties, together with the fledgling ones, are falling over one another to prove their commitment to the Sri Lankan Tamils. It is only expected that Mr Karunanidhi should join the fray, and lead it.         
	The immediate reason for this show of concern has been provided by the Sri Lankan governments incessant military campaign against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is causing massive internal displacement of the Tamil population. Sri Lanka has warned India that it is being misled into believing this story, but Sri Lankas own attitude to Tamils is not any better. The gradual withdrawal of peace-monitoring agencies and NGOs, on government order, has further clouded the scenario. There are serious allegations of human rights violations against Sri Lanka. Non-transparency in the political initiative is casting doubts on the governments intentions; take the awarding of a parliamentary post to the militant-turned-government-facilitator, Karuna. It could be aiming for the decimation of the Tigers, but not that of the entire Tamil population. If it continues to forget this, it will have to put up with being reminded by its neighbours.

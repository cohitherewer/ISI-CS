	Politics of violence                  
	Sir  Tension gripped Mumbai last Tuesday in anticipation of violence following the possible arrest of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief, Raj Thackeray. It was ridiculous to see MNS workers over the past week or so go about vandalizing shops owned by north Indians. It is surprising how goonda raj continues in different parts of India, the largest democracy of the world. If Raj Thackeray is genuinely interested in the future of Mumbai, and of Maharashtra, he should shift his attention from Chhat pujas to issues of urban renewal and rural development. Blaming Maharashtras problems on economic migrants is to escape responsibility for failing to address the core issue: the crisis in governance. The train from Gorakhpur to Mumbai Central is not going to stop in its tracks because a lumpen mob wants it to. What can and should be stopped is the political corruption that has destroyed Mumbais body, and now threatens its soul. Why cant Mumbais leaders agree, for example, to stop regularizing illegal slums? Maybe, Raj Thackeray, who is also a film-maker, should consider making a film that exposes the people responsible for Mumbais decline. He might even get Amitabh Bachchan to act in it.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was shocking that a spoilt leader like Raj Thackeray, who has been inciting hatred and violence between communities, was arrested after a long guessing game and set free in a couple of hours Maharashtrian dies in protector Raj backlash (Feb 14). Could it be that no law can be applied to this brat-politician? This will only help in giving Raj Thackeray and MNS the media exposure and political mileage that they do not deserve. The people of the state expect the Maharashtra government to take strong action against MNS  it should either be disbanded or disallowed from participating in elections. But after his release, it seems that the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party ruling alliance has struck a deal with the MNS for mutual political benefit. Why else would the chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, warn the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, that Raj Thackerays arrest would trigger off a backlash. Wasnt this an admission that Deshmukhs government can impose the rule of law in the state? At the same time that Raj Thackeray should be given exemplary punishment, Deshmukh should be replaced by a stronger candidate.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The arrest of Raj Thackeray should have come much earlier than it did. The Maharashtra government has made it apparent that it is scared to deal with a man who has shown utter disregard for the nations unity and the principles laid down by the Constitution.          
	When a government gives the impression that it is weak or lacks conviction, unscrupulous politicians become bolder. I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the citizens of Maharashtra does not approve of the sentiments and actions of Raj Thackeray. But, in the prevailing political situation of India, anyone with a few hundred supporters can stone public transport, break into shops, terrorize people and get media attention, thereby giving an impression that he is powerful and influential.           
	The fact that people like Raj Thackeray have been making it to the national headlines in spite of their reprehensible behaviour indicates a setback for the democratic practices of India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	Sir  What Raj Thackeray has said in Mumbai about Maharashtra and Maharashtrians  which has been echoed by his estranged cousin, Uddhav Thackeray  followed by the assault on non-Maharashtrians in Nasik and Pune goes against every principle that our Constitution stands for. It is strange that this unacceptable behaviour has gone unadmonished or unprotested by the national political parties, except for some mild comments by Lalu Prasad and L.K. Advani. The Congress, which with the NCP forms the coalition ruling Maharashtra has largely kept its mouth shut, except for gentle rebukes emanating from the party high command in Delhi. Perhaps these parties are just as parochial as the MNS, and would show their true colours in the future.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In the hullabaloo over the arrest of the MNS leader, Raj Thackeray, and his subsequent release on bail the very same day, everyone seems to have forgotten the innocent man who lost his life in the violence. The dead man was a Maharashtrian, the tribe MNS has ostensibly been fighting for. Will Raj Thackeray take responsibility for the death? The answer is easy enough. He wont. He will only blame the system, as if it was the system, and not stones thrown by his supporters, that killed the man.           
	What we need in India are politicians who will take responsibility for their actions, and those of their supporters. The picture in Mumbai is easy to read. The police and the government want to avoid riots, so they let Raj Thackeray roam free when he should be in jail. But why should there be riots in the first place, if the police are efficient and the government competent? So what we have here is a mess in order to avoid another. For how long will this be allowed to happen?           
	So much is said, yet so little is done. What use is it to criticize politicians without taking any action? But what action can the common man take? He has only his freedom of speech.           
	Yours faithfully,

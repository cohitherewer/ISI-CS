	There are only two certainties that human beings share universally: sex and death. Both are monosyllables in the English language, yet the experience of neither is quite as easy, even when it happens to be quick. The former is usually associated with pleasure, and the latter with fear. But these feelings often get mixed up; and sometimes, in private lives or public perceptions, it becomes difficult to keep sex and death apart.         
	India is now going through such a moment of confusion  and in the highest places. The Centre cannot decide, or seems hesitant to clarify, its stand on homosexuality. The situation would have been comically absurd had the stakes not been so serious. The ministry of health and family affairs believes that homosexuality between consenting adults should be decriminalized. But the home ministry believes it should remain a criminal offence, principally on moral grounds. The health minister has put forward the HIV/AIDS argument: men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, making decriminalization essential for preventive campaigns to be carried out effectively. But the home ministry understands health differently: legalizing homosexuality would unleash delinquent, and hence unhealthy, behaviour everywhere in society. These contradictory positions within the government are in response to the question of whether Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code should be read down. Several civil society groups and government bodies have been pointing out for a long time how this bigoted and colonial law is used to arrest, blackmail and brutalize sexual minorities in India.        
	The matter has now been brought to the prime ministers attention, and Manmohan Singh has asked the two ministers to sort out, between themselves, their conflicting views on homosexuality. This is a perfectly logical thing to do. But one does not have to be prurient, but only principled, to wonder what position Mr Singh himself and his peers happen to take on the issue as leaders of a modern democracy. If the appeal had been made in the name of some other form of social injustice  say, discrimination based on caste or gender  would the Centres stance have been as reticent or evasive? Would not the championing of such a cause have been deemed then as acceptable and advantageous?        
	It is unfortunate that the greatest challenge to sexual injustice in India has come from a deadly disease. HIV/AIDS has forced the sounding of many silences, and brought invisible forms of oppression out into the open. But it has also made Indias struggle for sexual equality and freedom inseparable from an equally oppressive fear of disease and of death. This mortal urgency makes it easy to forget the most important reason why the prime minister and his colleagues must make up their minds about homosexuality. Liberty, equality, justice and the dignity of the individual also happen to be the fundamental principles of the Indian Constitution.

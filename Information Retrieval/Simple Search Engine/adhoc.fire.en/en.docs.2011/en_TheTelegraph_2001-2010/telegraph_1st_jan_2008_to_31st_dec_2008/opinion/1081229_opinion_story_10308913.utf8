	The Indian navy chief, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, conceded that the lack of information regarding the maritime attack on Mumbai was due to systemic failure. By doing so, Mehta admitted, obliquely, that there did exist some intelligence input about the impending invasion of India by a foreign flotilla.        
	According to Mehta, there was some intelligence, but he claims that it was not actionable intelligence. The question is what is and is not actionable intelligence. Actionable intelligence refers to accurate and precise information, including the specific date, time, place and names of actors. Whatever may be the truth, at least three departments  the coast guard, customs and the state police of Gujarat and Maharashtra  need to overhaul their systems to avoid repeating a tragedy like the one in Mumbai.        
	Here are some facts about the earlier Mumbai blasts in 1993. Then too, RDX had landed near the Mumbai port. Intelligence was available, but the lure of money took precedence over the sense of duty among customs and police officials. One of the main accused who later died of cancer, Somnath Thapa, had confessed accepting cash fromlanding agents and sharing the money with his colleagues. The blasts showed how a systemic failure could kill and maim hundreds. Grand plans were chalked out and an expansion of various organizations followed, but to no avail.        
	India needs to reduce corruption and upgrade professionalism. Every department will have to decide on its charter of duty and jurisdiction. Not long ago, a former customs commissioner of Mumbai, who was in charge of the Maharashtra coast line, had reportedly said that customs is not concerned with national security. If it is indeed so, then this responsibility should be given to the coast guard or the marine police immediately. Customs and police checkposts are apparently located near the Gateway of India. One would like to know what they were doing on that fateful Wednesday night. If the coast guard failed to do its job on the high seas, then the police and customs are also guilty of failing to secure the land.                
	Poor job        
	One thing, however, is certain. The customs department is redundant in the case of a future overhaul of Indias security apparatus. This situation has arisen out of a long tradition of departmental bosses training their officers for revenue realization and mobilization only. Hence, customs officials concentrate less on national security and more on revenue. Any suggestion for joint sea-patrolling with the navy, coast guard and police also evokes a guarded response. As if customs could be exempted fully from the onerous task of securing the nation.        
	Mumbai customs once had the privilege of possessing helicopters for maritime operations, with air force personnel operating the machines. However, it was understood that both the helicopters and the few boats were meant for VIPs who visited to gain experience after an inspection of the field formations. Clearly, there exists a mental block in the customs department as its tradition, training and technology do not help the personnel to take on this critical task.         
	There is another problem. Mumbai is the proverbial El Dorado for all officials who come to the city with postings and they inevitably succumb to the vices of greed and irresponsibility.         
	Given the situation, it would be incorrect to involve Indian customs in the sphere of national security. All the more because customs personnel are neither physically prepared nor mentally tuned in nor trained to deal with and understand the gravity of the subject. The task is beyond them, given the institutions history, ethos, tradition, and the attitude of those who run it.

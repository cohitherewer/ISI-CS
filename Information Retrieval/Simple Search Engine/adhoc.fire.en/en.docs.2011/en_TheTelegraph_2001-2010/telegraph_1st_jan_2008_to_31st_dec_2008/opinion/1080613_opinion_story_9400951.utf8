	A casual consumer of news dished out by US-based foreign correspondents may be forgiven for nurturing the impression that the presidential election was concluded last week with Hillary Clinton finally conceding the Democratic Party nomination to Barak Obama. They may be further forgiven for believing that the election in November is just one of those meaningless formalities dictated by convention and protocol. In their mind, the United States of America has already chosen its next president, a charismatic individual who will wash away the blot on the American Creed. Change, they have suggested, is in the air.        
	The conventional wisdom of those who dont vote in America suggests that this is an election the Democrats just cant lose. With President George W. Bush at the peak of his unpopularity  on account of the economic downturn at home and the failure in Iraq  it is believed that the US electorate will make a clean break from the Conservative era that began with President Richard Nixon in 1968, reached its full glory under President Ronald Reagan and lost its popular touch in the second term of President Bush. The victory of a rank outsider like Obama over the formidable Clinton machine is said to symbolize this exasperation with a flawed inheritance. Americans, it is argued, dont merely want change; they want total change.        
	Events may yet follow the script written with passion and dedication in the intellectual salons of Manhattan, Boston and the Beltway, and by activists who, as Obama himself confessed, have barely reached drinking age. On the other hand, as has often happened in the past, foreign correspondents may have failed to overcome the irresistible inclination to equate personal preferences with the aggregate mood of America. Certainly, there is nothing as yet to demonstrate that Obama has established a conclusive lead over the Republican nominee, John McCain: the polls conducted within two days of Clinton bowing out showed the Illinois senator ahead by just a whisker.              
	It would have been surprising had the polls revealed an entire nation gripped by Obama-mania. In the run-up to the 2004 presidential poll, when it seemed clear that John Kerry wouldnt make the grade, many public intellectuals had persuasively argued that America had jettisoned its traditional liberalism and had reinvented itself into a Right Nation. Far from the political agenda being influenced by the aesthetic sensibilities of New England, it was brash Texan millionaires, clever disciples of William Buckley and born again Christian evangelists that allegedly called the shots. Carl Rove, an astute tactician, was accorded iconic status for his ability to create a formidable Right-wing election machine. By the time 9/11 was followed by retribution in Afghanistan and Iraq, it became almost mandatory to refer, either approvingly or disparagingly, to a successful Conservative Revolution and a new Righteous America.        
	The change was indeed momentous. In 1964, when Barry Goldwater secured the Republican nomination to challenge President Lyndon Johnson, the Columbia University historian, Richard Hofstadter, was outraged: When, in all our history, has anyone with ideas so bizarre, so archaic, so self-confounding, so remote from the basic American consensus, ever go so far? In 1964, Goldwater was unelectable; in 1976, Reagan was denied the Republican nomination because the Grand Old Party thought him an ideological outlander. By 2000, both Goldwater and Reagan were part of the pantheon of all-time conservative greats.        
	Public memory being remarkably short, it is easy to forget the vitriol poured on America and its people by those who claimed to be the custodians of European liberalism. Liberalism in the United States today is the politics that dare not speak its name, lamented the British historian, Tony Judt, in an acerbic contribution to the London Review of Books just two years ago. Judt, who has helpfully collated his articles in a new book, Reappraisals: Reflections on the Forgotten Twentieth Century, published earlier this year, was particularly incensed by the liberal acquiescence in the War on Terror. He saw it as a direct outcome of the deliquescence of the Democratic Party. Using one of Lenins viciously polemical phrases, he described fellow intellectuals who joined the anti-Islamist bandwagon as useful idiots.        
	Judt was not in the same radical league as either Noam Chomsky or Arundhati Roy. A self-professed European, he contrasted the deft, if over-bureaucratic, compromises to reverse the tide of history in the European Union to the USs post-9/11 penchant for war. His complaint was that America took its exceptionalism too seriously; it should be grander, more European and less Israeli in its conduct of foreign policy.        
	Perhaps the criticisms of the likes of Judt, who are not inherently anti-American, has struck a chord among the coalition of higher-income, better educated Whites, the youth and the Blacks who engineered Obamas victory in the primaries. The instant withdrawal from Iraq, the boast of negotiating with hostile despots and the commitment to prevent upstarts like India from dabbling with nuclear toys fit in cosily with the European liberal consensus. Equally, the commitment to tax windfall profits of oil companies, increase income tax on the well-off and increase welfare spending on the poor and destitute is just the type of rhetoric heard in the pre-Tony Blair Labour Party. It hasnt been heard in America for some time  at least not from the lips of presidential aspirants. Neither have we heard, at least not since the fall of Saigon, a mainstream candidate proclaim the virtues of eschewing Americas imperial responsibilities.        
	Has Obama changed America or, as Thomas Friedman asserted in The New York Times, has America changed? Has the Right Nation undergone a profound change, thanks to Bushs failure to execute a difficult military campaign in a distant land with greater efficiency?        
	There could be alternative possibilities too. Is the appeal of Obama centred on pure hype? Is he just words as Hillary Clinton famously claimed? Certainly Obama hasnt been subjected as yet to the rigorous scrutiny that accompanies a presidential contest. Will he be found wanting?              
	That this clever Harvard man has oodles of charm and charisma is undeniable. That he has broken the glass ceiling of race is also an achievement. However, to speak for the whole nation  a nation riddled with as many complexities as India  is a daunting proposition. The advantage of primaries is that a candidate ends up preaching to the already converted. Plus he has the luxury of being able to define his constituency: focus on states where the radical minorities are more aggressive precisely because they are out of synch with the rest of the population. Obamas sneering condescension directed at the have-nots of Pennsylvania Its not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy towards people who arent like them or anti-immigrant sentiment as a way to express their frustrations  can be overlooked in a primary. It can have disastrous consequences in a presidential run-off.        
	Obama has entered the contest with McCain without any baggage. Unlike machine politicians like President Johnson or even rank outsiders such as President Jimmy Carter and President Bill Clinton, he is in the strange position of having to first win the Democratic faithful before wooing the swing voters. Obama created his own social coalition for the primaries one which bypassed traditional Democrats. The last presidential candidate who did that was George McGovern in 1972. McGoverns social base was a mirror image of the coalition that is now bolstering Obama. He ended up winning just one state  Massachusetts  and the District of Columbia. America has changed profoundly in the past 36 years, but has it changed unrecognizably?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | They didnt start the fire
                                                                                                                 THEY DIDNT START THE FIRE                                  The compulsions of politics and the insensitivity of the authorities are complicating matters for the students of Besu, says Anasuya Basu                          Fault lines                                  
	Students clashes, bloodshed, death, imposition of Section 144, the university closed sine die. The Bengal Engineering and Science University seems to stop at nothing. Will this 150-year-old institute ultimately manage to get upgraded into an Institute of National Importance? Or will it become one of those universities that missed their chance to prove their excellence?         
	It is ironic that right from 2004, when the university made its bid for the INI status, student unrest changed colour and became a permanent fixture on the campus. It was not as if there was no students movement in the university prior to 2004. Students protested over attendance and examination schedules, over hostels and other issues. But they remained largely peaceful and never made news.         
	Both the nature and the cause of unrest have changed. University authorities no longer command respect from students, who never let go an opportunity to pick faults or point out administrative lapses. Today the violence is spurred by an identity crisis. The varsity has so long retained an autonomous character in functioning. It has fought resource-crunch, the lack of facilities that threatened the loss of accreditations and sundry other issues to remain a premium engineering college devoid of political colour. Yet, something seems to have violently gone wrong in Besu now.         
	A look at the frequency with which violence has erupted on the campus will provide pointers to the rot inside. There have been nine instances in three years when students have clashed on campus, leading to injuries, death and arrests. Each time, the administration has appointed an inquiry committee, but nothing has ever come out of them. When the university was closed sine die in December last year, a three-member inquiry committee, including the former vice-chairman of the West Bengal Council of Higher Education, Subimal Sen, was formed. The committee was asked to look into the past and present incidences of violence and make recommendations. Nothing has been heard of the report.               
	An inquiry by the Criminal Investigation Department was initiated into the death of Soumik Basu in 2006. The third-year student was a victim of a clash between two rival students unions. The CID is yet to table its report. Guardians were called to rein in their wards, there was a white paper on the model code of conduct, talks were initiated to revive students facilities, such as the common room, starting healthy practices like yoga and prayers, encouraging intensive faculty-student interaction. Has any of these measures been implemented? Is the administration at all interested in student welfare?         
	On the other hand, Besu students have been vilified and portrayed as criminals. They are supposed to be an indisciplined lot, who do drugs and alcohol, use abusive language, want to boycott exams at the slightest pretext and disrupt peace on campus.         
	But who are these criminals? They are those who have ranked among the first thousand in a state-level competitive exam, they are all between 18 and 21, and they are, above all, students. If they have been resorting to such activities, it may be worth thinking why they have been doing so. But while we grope for answers, the campus once again totters on the verge of another totally avoidable bout of violence.         
	Since March 20, when groups of outsiders beat up university students right in front of the campus gates, these so-called criminals have been ready for a do-or-die battle. Feeling that they can no longer be assured of security, they are on a war path. And it may soon be difficult to stop them. From what the few female students (who were allowed on the campus on March 21-22) have to say of the March 19-20 incidents, there emerges a clear picture of the threat and intimidation that is typical of the style of functioning of the state-backed Students Federation of India.         
	The agitating students allege that on the night of March 19, a couple of second-year students were on their way to the hostel when they were stopped by third-year students of Wolfenden hostel. SFI supporters and members make up the majority of Wolfenden boarders. The second-year students were asked to prove their identity. When it became obvious that they were not native to West Bengal, they were apparently abused and insulted. A scuffle soon broke out, and second-year students came to their rescue. The student-in-charge and faculty members arrived soon after. The Wolfenden hostellers were caught and later freed.         
	Next morning, at the meeting of the registrar and the dean, the names of the injured students were supposedly given to the disciplinary committee. Classes went on as usual. On the evening before Holi, when a number of students were hanging out near the university gates, a mob of 25 appeared. A few among them are reported to have started identifying students by their hostels while urging others to beat them up. The students were isolated, and the neighbouring shops pulled down their shutters in panic. The girls in the group managed to flee. One of them who had taken shelter in a shop heard the boys being thrown against the shutters and mercilessly beaten up. Two teachers who were witness to the incident and who tried to rescue the students were chased.         
	The police and the Rapid Action Force were called in and they entered the Richardson, Sen and Sengupta halls, randomly beating up students. At 10 at night, students were supposed to have been asked to leave the hostel after a prolonged meeting between the superintendent of police, Howrah, and the vice-chancellor. Arrangements were made to drop them off at railway and bus stations. While the students were being forced out, the RAF surrounded them and arrested 47 from among them who were made to spend the night in the lock-up without food, water or even a bench to sit on. First information reports have been lodged against many, say students, some against boys who were not even present on the campus during the two previous days.               
	The girls who now sit at the gates demonstrating against the mindless police action voice their concerns about their security and on some more pertinent issues. How are we supposed to sit for our mid-term exams when our classmates are being threatened that they will be beaten up and arrested when they return? But giving the exams a miss was also not a sound option since they run the risk of being labelled indisciplined. The vice-chancellor himself went on his rounds on Sunday evening asking students to take the exams. The students did appear for the exams, but a majority of them did not write the papers. Instead, they wrote a protest notes: Dont let Besu become another Nandigram.         
	If relations between students and the administration are strained, so are relations between the faculty and the administration. Teachers have been accused of violating rules and staging demonstrations for the upgradation of facilities. They have also been chided for not spending enough time with students and keeping them out of the way of violence. On their part, teachers have accused the administration of inaction and inefficiency. They believe the administration is out of sync with the campus realities, and insensitive to students.         
	Allegations and counter-allegations follow as the situation deteriorates and students are made scapegoats. They are fast losing faith in authority and are eager to take matters into their own hands. No authority will do, as it has failed to deliver, they say. But what is the way out of the problems of Besu? Perhaps only time can provide that difficult answer.

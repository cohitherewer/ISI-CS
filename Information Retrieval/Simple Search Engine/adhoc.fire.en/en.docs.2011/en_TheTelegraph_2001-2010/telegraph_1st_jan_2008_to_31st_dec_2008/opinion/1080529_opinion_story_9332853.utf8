	Holidaying in Goa over a long weekend, we set aside a day to visit Old Goa. My children werent amused. Its okay going to old places in Delhi or Agra, said my son, but why come all the way here to the sea, and then leave the beach to visit churches? He lost. On a hot, blazingly bright day in May, the family visited two churches, a convent and a museum of Christian art. It wasnt easy, but we did it. But my sons plaintive question was a good one. Why?        
	Why do we go to these places? Why are churches, museums, mosques, temples, forts and tombs so central to a certain notion of cultivated travel? You cant seriously argue that inspecting Se Cathedral, the Basilica of Bom Jesus and the Santa Monica convent is inherently more evolved than visiting beaches at Colva, Calangute, Baga and Morjim. To the seaside hedonist, beaches are as individual as churches: the angle of the shelf, the quality of the sand, the excitement of the surf mean as much to him as flying buttresses, baroque altars and bell towers do to the cultural tourist. So the idea that beaches are generic picture postcard places that need to be joined to historical hinterlands to make holidays meaningful isnt likely to persuade my son.         
	In fact, it can be plausibly shown that historical itineraries are often a substitute for alert, improvised, interesting tourism. This last winter, we were visited by English friends who were in India for the first time. Pressed by the need to make their trip dense and culturally specific, we took them for a walk around Lodi Gardens, crowded with 15th century mausoleums, then went the same afternoon to Humayuns tomb which, always excepting the Qutb Minar, is the grandest medieval structure in Delhi.               
	The next day we packed ourselves into a tourist taxi and headed for Sikandra, where Akbar was buried, then on to the Taj where Shah Jahan made white marble tiles immortal by using them to ice a tomb and finally, just before its gates closed at six, to the Tajs predecessor in the history of white marble tombs, the mausoleum of Itmad-ud-daulah. For two days we showed our friends nothing but dead mens quarters not because we were trying to instruct them in the development of funerary architecture in medieval India, but simply because the tombs were there. To the neutral Martian observer we must have seemed like a parcel of necrophiliacs on a perverts itinerary.        
	For the culturally ambitious middle-class Indian, this isnt unusual. I once travelled for a month in Spain on the back of a single Spanish sentence: Donde est cathedral? I still dream of a silent gothic building made up of multiple arches, naves, transepts, aisles and altars, whose every exit peters out into an adjacent cloister from which there is no escape. I wake up screaming.         
	So why do we do it? Is there a reason or are we Larkins ruin bibbers, randy for antique? I think theres a simple explanation. When we travel, a places old buildings are our substitutes for its people. Getting to a place you dont know is exciting but its also disorienting. Its hard to talk to strangers in alien languages, so we find our bearings with buildings. They are easier to get to know. To start with we have long letters of introduction to them in the guidebooks we carry. I spent hours through that Spanish holiday being introduced by my Blue Guide to wonderfully forthcoming churches. As you face the gate a projecting front gable with cornice returns displays a recessed balcony having corner brackets, pierced balustrade and doorway surrounded by transom... and there they always were, those gables and cornices and balustrades, those doorways surrounded by transom, making me feel at home by simply being there. Old buildings famous enough to have been written about, help tourists settle in. Theyre place-holders that offer travellers a readymade sense of place when they dont have the time to be there long enough to develop one of their own.         
	And once youve seen a church or a tomb, its useful to see other churches and tombs. This helps you believe that youre mastering the alienness of the world youre travelling through. To have learnt to tell a Gothic arch from a Romanesque arch, to know that one is pointed while the other isnt, is to have forged a rudimentary compass. After visiting the Bridge of Sighs in Venice many years ago, I spotted one in Cambridge and another in Oxford. This was strangely reassuring. To know that all covered bridges are Bridges of Sighs is not to know much but it is better than nothing.               
	In exactly the same way, to visit medieval Indian tombs, starting with Sikander Lodis and ending with Mumtaz Mahals, is to be graphically educated about the historical evolution of, say, the Mughal onion dome. The tomb tour gave our English friends a grip on India and a handle on its history, it supplied them with a story of change which made the trip worthwhile. Similarly, by the end of our Old Goa afternoon I knew that the churches were made of a local stone, laterite, and that their interiors were basically baroque. These were small, secondhand bits of information, but they helped me order Old Goa in my mind.         
	Being knowing about a place is one way of making yourself at home. The information doesnt have to be about old buildings. There was a time when every Indian student in Cambridge would tell tell newly arrived desis that Cambridge winters were bitterly cold because no intervening mountain ranges protected the town from distant Siberian winds. It was a perfectly useless piece of lore for the newcomer but it helped the veteran desi feel at home. The equivalent bit of information about Goa would be that tourists oughtnt bathe in the sea during the monsoons because lethal currents can sweep them away. I passed on that story to a friend, hoping it would give him, in conversation with his friends, a claim to Goa.         
	But for the tourist, old buildings are easier shortcuts to familiarity than landscape or weather. Its what theyre there for. Tombs werent built to commemorate the people buried inside them nor churches erected to honour God. They were made to soothe the anxious traveller, to make him feel at home.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

	Towards a new revolution                  
	 Sir  Bhaskar Dutta has justly condemned government policies that have brought on the current inflation (Time for better seeds, May 7). The Centre is too keen on projecting India as an upcoming global superpower. In the process, it has become indifferent to the victims of food shortage. The United Nations World Food Program should take stock of the situation efficiently. Indian scientists, too, should step out of the technological bubble and engage in serious research to bring on a new Green Revolution.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M.S. Quraishy, Calcutta

      
	Welcome hope          
	Sir  The temporary suspension of the ban on the Pakistani cricketer, Shoaib Akhtar, might have enabled him to participate in the Indian Premier League, but it is unlikely that his presence would lead to a reversal of fortune for the Kolkata Knight Riders (Shoaib to play, not this week , May 5). Akhtars inclusion in the team could enhance the bowling attack, but his batting and fielding skills have always been somewhat uncertain.           
	This is worrying, since some of the other bowlers, such as Umar Gul or Ishant Sharma, are yet to make a statement with the bat. Given the structure of Twenty20 cricket, players are expected to be dynamic performers, not just expert bowlers or batsmen. Sourav Gangulys team also lacks big-hitters. KKR has to come up more innovative strategies if it expects to stay in the race.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

                
	Sir  The lifting of the ban on Shoaib Akhtar may prove to be a boon for the KKR, since the team has not been doing too well in the last few matches. However, it is not advisable for the rest of the team to rely too much on one person to bail them out. The Rawalpindi Express might be magical with the ball, but he has never been dependable with the bat. As it is, the KKR has not been at its best. Perhaps a few players could be dropped in the next few matches and those in the benches given a chance? With Ricky Ponting and Brendon McCullum gone, the crisis is now likely to deepen. All the more reason for some brainstorming.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Aroma, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  One fails to understand why Shoaib Akhtar, who was handed a five year ban for misconduct, has been let off for a month to play and earn a stupendous booty in the IPL? Is it because of the dismal performance of King Khans dream team? Or perhaps the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Nasim Ashraf, was persuaded by some other means to make this exception?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  A temporary relief from the ban has showered a glorious bounty on Shoaib Akhtar. His induction into the KKR could well prove to be the turning point for the team. Akhtar might also add some zest to the drooping spirit of the team. Shah Rukh Khan and the cheerleaders can keep the fire burning to a certain extent. Beyond that, the team has to rouse itself and rise up to the challenge. It is wise of the PCB tribunal to continue monitoring Akhtars performance and conduct in the IPL. Thanks to Harbhajan Singh and S. Sreesanth, unsavoury incidents have already marred the flavour of the game, and we would rather not see another one.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asif Khan, Gaya, Bihar

                
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly can now smile big now that the Rawalpindi Express has arrived to add some steam to the KKR wagon. Perhaps we can now be hopeful that the team will fight more confidently and qualify for the semi-finals.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Matter of degrees
                                                                                                                 MATTER OF DEGREES                          - Winter is a properly bourgeois season        Mukul Kesavan                                                          
	The plane taxied to a stop and a flight attendants voice told us that the temperature outside (outside being Calcutta) was 27 degrees Celsius at eight in the evening. This was last week, when night-time temperatures in Delhi were stuck in single digits. My skin prickled  I was wearing a woollen jacket  but my spirits lifted. It had been a cold month-and-a-half in Delhi and it was good to walk around Calcutta for a weekend in shirt sleeves. Even the locals thought it was spring: I saw no one in a balaclava, or even a sweater.         
	When I returned to Delhi, the papers said that at the other end of India, in Bombay (which usually has less of a winter than Calcutta does), the mercury had dropped to an unheard-of low. Once upon a time, Id have sneered. Eight degrees and they were behaving as if it were the new ice age. If you grew up in Delhi, as I did, you tend to believe that you have bragging rights on the business of being cold.         
	Which is odd because for seven months of the year, Delhis hot. In June its hotter than Calcutta ever gets: I can remember the huge digital read-out opposite Safdarjangs tomb registering 46 degrees one afternoon last year. It was so hot that day that the tar had half-melted into fat, black runnels in the middle of the road. And yet, when a Delhiwallah gets nostalgic about Delhi, its the winters he remembers, partly because its the cold that sets his metropolis apart from the others, from cities like Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, where the seasons change from hot to humid and then back again.               
	Once you get past the standard celebration of the Delhi winter (misty dawns and smoky evenings, crisp, sunlit days, afternoon walks in the Lodi Gardens, assorted mausolea mellow in the winter sun), it becomes clear that what the middle-class Delhiwallah really likes about his winter is the fuss and business of dealing with it. Its the lowering of trunks from inaccessible lofts, the smell of naphthalene, the unrolling of carpets, the testing of heaters and the airing of quilts and blankets that were addicted to. Unpacking sleeveless sweaters, full-sleeve sweaters, woollen vests, jerkins, jackets, fleeces, achkans, waistcoats, ponchos, pashminas, scarves, gloves, caps, kurakuls and boots (yes, boots!) reminds us, item by item, that we are people of substance, diversely and discriminatingly prepared to cope with the cold.         
	Winter is a properly bourgeois season. Its not a good time of year to be poor in; in summer theres always a trees shade, but its hard to find shelter from the cold. No, in the language of modern journalism, winter is for winners. Among other things, it gives them a chance to dress up. Say what you like about summer but you cant really peacock in the heat. Cottons and linens have their virtues but to cut a formal dash you need wool and silk. I have a twenty-year-old achkan that I squeeze into every winter the better to attend weddings in. Its black and long and such a snug fit now that its like wearing a body corset, but I paid such an appalling price for it when I got married that I wear it as penance for extravagance. Thats the other thing about winter clothes: they last so long that they have histories, they keep you in touch with your past.         
	So winter is an important part of being a Delhiwallah and when we went to live in New York some years ago, I wasnt intimidated by the thought of being cold. An Indian friend who taught there advised me against buying an overcoat: there hasnt been a proper winter here in years, he said. Being naturally thrifty I didnt. A lifetime of winters in Delhi had taught me that the cold could be kept at bay by wearing many layers.         
	The trouble with layers, though, is that American central heating operates on the assumption that you shouldnt feel cold indoors if youre naked. I noticed that when I met friends at restaurants, theyd casually take off a heavy overcoat underneath which theyd be dressed for summer, that is, central heating. I, on the other hand, had to take off several things (squalid raincoat, shabby jacket, embarrassingly chunky hand-knitted pullover and so on) which was humiliating because it made me feel provincial, it suggested I didnt know how to cope with the cold, it made me feel like a Calcuttan. And I wasnt. I was from Delhi.         
	Worse, for someone whose persona was founded on the standard Delhi conceit that winters were to be celebrated, it was hard to cope with the fact that New York was too cold for me. Giving the lie to my idiot friend, New York produced two of the coldest winters in living memory in the time I was there. When the first snow fell, I went sledding with my children and returned glowing with achievement. We had careened in the snow like proper New Yorkers. Encouraged, we bought ice skates and teetered around a rink. Then it got properly cold.               
	I discovered that when I went outdoors in the middle of winter, there was, for about five minutes, the illusion of warmth because of the heat trapped in my clothes. After that Id freeze. Half an hour outdoors and I needed to go, and that was hellish because New York was desperately short of public lavatories. I learnt certain rules of thumb. The cold was bearable till around -10 degrees Celsius. Lower than that (and there was a day when the temperature fell to -18) all the naked bits of your face froze. When you came out of the cold, it took your face about ten minutes to register any feeling because it needed to thaw.         
	I was defeated by those Western winters and I returned to Delhi, chastened, not a connoisseur of the cold, but a casualty. Watching the Namesake, specially the bits where Gogols parents, Irfan and Tabu, submit to a sub-zero world, I saw the virtue of accepting winter as an enemy. What was the point of being robust about your winter when there were winters elsewhere that would defeat you? So now when I see Bengalis in Chittaranjan Park wearing monkey caps in March, I nod sympathetically, filled with fellow-feeling. Eight degrees in Bombay? I think of men in Matunga caught unprepared, freezing without sweaters and heaters, and my heart goes out to them. Winters are for eskimos; give me melting roads in June.              mukulkesavan@hotmail.com

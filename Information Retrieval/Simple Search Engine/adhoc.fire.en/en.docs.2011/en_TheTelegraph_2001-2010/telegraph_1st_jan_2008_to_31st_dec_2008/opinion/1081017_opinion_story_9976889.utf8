	Taj Mahal By Giles Tillotson, 
  Penguin, Rs 399        
	This a little gem of a book about Indias best-known monument. Shah Jahans memorial to his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, has earned many encomiums, and never fails to inspire awe. But for the non-technical person, very little is actually known about the Taj. This is not because there is a dearth of writings on it. Much of what is genuinely good about the writings on the building is too full of technical details to be accessible to the general and intelligent visitor to the Taj. And much of what is popular is really trash. Giles Tillotsons book fills an important gap. It is lucidly written, and thus comprehensible. It is solidly researched, but the weight of the research never holds back the analysis that Tillotson makes.        
	The great strength of Tillotsons book is the manner in which he sets out the context, historical and architectural, for a proper appreciation of the monument. The historical background is told in summary fashion, which is understandable since this is not the occasion to delve deep into Mughal imperial history. But what Tillotson does is to sketch with enviable precision the rise of Itimad-ud-Daula and his daughter, Mihr-un-Nisa (famous as Nur Jahan, after she married Jahangir), to complete dominance in the Mughal court. This was what historians have come to call the Nur Jahan junta. Mumtaz Mahal was Nur Jahans brothers daughter and her marriage to Shah Jahan earned for the latter the support, for a time, of Nur Jahan in the jostling for succession once it was clear that Jahangir was on borrowed time.        
	Shah Jahan was obviously besotted with Mumtaz Mahal. One evidence, apart from the Taj of course, is that she had 14 pregnancies in 18 years. The emperor obviously found his queen to be not only beautiful but also sexually attractive. His monument to her captured only the beauty.        
	In terms of form, Tillotson traces the evolution of Mughal architecture, marking its main stages. There is a good account of Humayuns tomb. The plan and the form of the Taj are explicated in detail.        
	There are two points that need to be highlighted here. One is that Tillotson completely does away with the myth that Shah Jahan had planned to build a black Taj for his own tomb across the river. The two tombs were to be linked by a bridge. What we see now is supposed to be, according to this theory, only half of the original plan. There is no evidence for this and Tillotson dismisses it as moonshine. In the process of demolishing this myth, he establishes something remarkable. It was customary for the Mughals to place their tombs and monuments in the middle of a garden. The Taj Mahal, as it stands, is not in the middle of a garden, but at the back of it. However, excavations carried out on the opposite bank have unearthed the remains of a garden, of the same dimensions as the garden of the Taj, and perfectly aligned with it. And there is contemporary evidence for the existence of such a garden, which was called Mahtab Bagh. The truth about the garden is quite startling.        
	Tillotson writes, The Taj Mahal is always described as standing at the end of its garden as opposed to in the middle. But if we take the Mahtab Bagh into account, the tomb is standing between two char baghs. Flowing between them is the river Yamuna, which is here co-opted into the garden scheme. A larger or more ambitious embodiment of the Quranic vision of the rivers of paradise would be hard to imagine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Devoutly along the river of clichs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DEVOUTLY ALONG THE RIVER OF CLICHS                                              
	The mind boggles as to what sort of a reader the publishers had in mind when they priced GANGA: A DIVINITY IN FLOW (Vision India) at Rs 2,450. This reader would have to be very devout indeed in order to look beyond the less-than-amateurish photography and bad writing put together by Atul Bhardwaj and Vijay Singal respectively to get to what Amitabh Bachchan calls, in his foreword, the essence of a civilization represented by the Ganga. After Raghubir Singhs masterly photographic journey along the course of the river (Thames amp; Hudson, 1992) it would require an exceptionally brave and original photographer or writer to take the Ganga on again and not rehash the visual or literary clichs associated with the river. Most coffee-tables deserve better than this book.

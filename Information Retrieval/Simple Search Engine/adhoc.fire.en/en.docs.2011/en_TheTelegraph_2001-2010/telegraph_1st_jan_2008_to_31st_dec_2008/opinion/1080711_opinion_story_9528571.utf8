	Keep the faith                  
	Sir  Critics have started questioning the credibility of M.S. Dhonis youth brigade after Sri Lanka beat India to win the Asia Cup (Sniper Mendis mows down Team India, July 7). However, the tag, chokers, has suited India rather well all these years. The Indians have lost big finals before, even when they played with experienced players. If we start questioning the wisdom of preferring youth over experience now, then the process of building a team for the future will be jeopardized. The Board of Control for Cricket in India and the fans alike must learn to put their faith in Dhoni and his young team. Instead of pointing fingers at them after a loss, they should learn to be patient. The present crop of players in the ODI side should be persisted with for success to follow.           
	We should also realize that Sri Lanka won the tournament because they worked to a perfect plan. In the final, the mysterious Ajantha Mendis decimated the Indian batsmen who, not having played Mendis before, were all at sea against him. I think that even old hands like Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar would have had problems negotiating Mendiss spin. It is imperative that the Indian team should learn its lessons from this defeat before it tours the island nation.

	Sir  My daughter asked me a funny yet fitting question after seeing the picture of a smiling M. S. Dhoni on the dailies the other day. How can the Indian captain, she asked, afford to smile after his team was mauled by the Sri Lankans in the Asia Cup? Her bewilderment is easy to understand. Till the other day, a virtual state of mourning would be declared every time India lost a major final. Yet, this time, the country was busy celebrating Dhonis birthday days after the loss.           
	The answer to the conundrum perhaps lies in the emergence of a new world order in which our values are restructured by forces like brand and commerce. The cricketing world has learnt to adapt to these changes, as have todays children. My daughter is already aware of the differences between products like Revlon and Oriflame. Dhoni need not worry. He can afford to lose a few more finals as long as he lords over the market. As for people like me, we can only hope to learn a few things from our children to survive in a fast-changing world.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias performance in the Asia Cup mirrored its showing in the earlier tournament held in Bangladesh. In the tri-series in Bangladesh, we defeated Pakistan in a group game, only to be beaten by the same side in the final. Similarly, in the Asia Cup, India, who had beaten Sri Lanka earlier, lost the final against the Lankans. It is evident that like other Indian teams, this one, lead by M.S. Dhoni, too lacks the will to win. Cricketers believe that they are indispensable and are content to play to the gallery. But after every loss, they try to pass the buck. A review of the two defeats would reveal the limitations that plague the team. These should be corrected at the earliest if Indian cricket is to taste some success in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The loss in the Asia Cup final clearly illustrates that the Indian team has a long way to go before it can dream of bringing back the World Cup in 2011. The bowling needs to be tightened. In the final, Sri Lanka were allowed to post a decent score even though they had lost four quick wickets early on. Similarly, the policy to prioritize youth over experience seems to have backfired. After the losses in two consecutive finals, M.S. Dhoni must admit that his decision to axe Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid was uncalled for. Someone also needs to remind Dhoni that only teams with a healthy blend of old and new players have been successful at the international level. It is significant that India have lost 17 of the last 22 finals they have contested. This is a matter that needs to be addressed if the team harbours any hopes of becoming the best in the business.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  During the Asia Cup, M.S. Dhoni stated that his team was tired after playing back-to-back matches. His comment drew flak from Rajiv Shukla, the BCCI vice-president, who said that the IPL fixture too involved back-to-back games but nobody had complained at that time. Shukla seems to imply that Indian cricketers seldom complain when big money is at stake. However, when it comes to playing for the country, they cite various reasons for their non performance. Such an insinuation can be expected from petty officials like Shukla, who have never held a bat or a ball in their hands. Shukla is forever itching to admonish those who are critical of the board. His penchant to rush to the media at a time when cricketers, and even selectors, are barred from doing so, exposes his selfish interests. A genuine feeling expressed by the captain should not have been mocked in public by a bureaucrat suffering from attention-deficit disorder.           
	Yours faithfully,

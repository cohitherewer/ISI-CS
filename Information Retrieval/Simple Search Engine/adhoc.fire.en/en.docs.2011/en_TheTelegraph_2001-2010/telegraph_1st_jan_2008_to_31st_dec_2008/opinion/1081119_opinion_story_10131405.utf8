	Bubble Trouble         
	The sales tax authorities levied a 10 per cent tax on bubble gum, treating it as an unclassified item. A dealer challenged the order contending that bubble gum was a confectionery and should be taxed at 6.25 per cent. The dealer won the case at the Tribunal and the High Court as well, arguing that bubble gum could be described as mithai in Hindi. He further contended that in a state where the official language was Hindi, in any dispute over the meanings of Hindi and English words, the one in Hindi should prevail. The Supreme Court, however, cited Wikipedias definition of bubble gum as a chewing gum designed for blowing bubbles with, holding that it was neither a confectionery nor a sweetmeat.

	Test for youth        
	An employer received a show cause notice from the deputy labour commissioner of Uttar Pradesh for employing a child. He replied to it on May 9, 2008, saying that the child concerned was above 14 years of age. But the authorities slapped a penalty of Rs 20,000 upon the employer on May 26, 2008. The Allahabad High Court referred to the provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, which prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14. It held that though it was the duty of the employer to produce the age certificate of the child, if he failed to do so, the authorities should have got a prescribed medical officer to test the child medically to ascertain his age. The necessary orders could be passed only after doing that, it held. (Rahul Kumar, Proprietor of Sheetal Hotels, vs State of UP and others)                            
	No baby talk        
	Convicted of raping a six-year-old girl, a man was fined and sentenced to five years imprisonment on the basis of the deposition of the child and her mother. The man appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the evidence of a child witness, unless corroborated, should not be accepted. Rejecting the plea, the Supreme Court held that since the testimony of the child was cogent and credible and she had narrated the incident to her mother immediately after it occurred, there was no reason to disbelieve her.

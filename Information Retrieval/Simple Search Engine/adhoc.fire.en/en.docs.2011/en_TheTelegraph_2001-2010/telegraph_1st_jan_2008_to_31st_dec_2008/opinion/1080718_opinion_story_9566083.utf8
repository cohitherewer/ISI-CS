The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A deal to think about
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A DEAL TO THINK ABOUT                          - It is best not to put all the eggs in the American basket        Cutting Corners -  Ashok Mitra                                                        
	Things are falling into place. The personal agenda of Indian politicians can, of course, appear to be larger than life to the persons concerned. But these have much less relevance for the complex political theatre that is the United States of America. And that is not all. For even if the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency accepts Indias capitulation on the entire range of safeguards at its value and does not raise further inconvenient questions, the Nuclear Suppliers Group may not prove equally accommodating. Australia, for one, could turn out to be a formidable nuisance. Anyway, these proceedings, common sense suggests, are unlikely to be completed before the month of September is ushered in. There is a summer lull in activities, particularly in Europe and North America, which Indian compulsions may fail to disturb. Despite some extremely deft manoeuvres, the Indo-US nuclear treaty could therefore reach the US Congress for final ratification only on the eve of its adjournment ahead of the presidential polls.         
	Both houses of the Congress have currently a Democratic Party majority. The Democrats have been out of power for eight long years and would not like to take one false step before the American electorate votes for president in November. George W. Bushs popularity rating, according to the latest poll count, has slid down to 28 per cent, the lowest in recorded history for any incumbent president. The Democrats are no fools. The proposed treaty is, vide the Hyde Act, akin to presenting the American nation with a new neo-colony; the much-coveted acquisition, besides, is credited to be the worlds largest democracy and has the potential of emerging as a major economic power in the coming decades. Such a fantastic annexation on election eve could not but have a positive impact on President Bushs popularity rating and, to that extent, improve the prospects of the Republican Party in the presidential poll.               
	The Democrats have to examine their heads before they go along with this script. Despite Barack Obamas careful general endorsement of the principles embodied in the treaty, do not therefore be surprised if the Congress filibusters out the motion to ratify it. In January, it will be an altogether new situation, with a new administration and a new Congress.         
	Those in charge of crucial decisions in New Delhi are not babes in the wood. They too are fully aware that, given the constraints of time and American domestic realpolitik, getting the treaty approved during the tenure of the Bush administration is a most remote possibility. The sudden burst of activities in recent weeks is obviously occasioned by a different consideration. Provided that the ongoing perseverence bears fruit, while there would be for the present no Indo-US nuclear agreement, India would still have signed the safeguards agreement with the IAEA. That would be, to plagiarize Aneurin Bevan, a bit like standing naked in the council chamber; India would have, by proxy, complied with all the provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty without anything to show in return. So what; the Indian prime minister would have redeemed his pledge to the US president to be an international good boy and could fervently look forward to a flow of rewards in the coming days from diverse quarters.        
	The underlying assumption is, of course, that the American imperium is for ever and it pays to be on the right side of the worlds mightiest power. But what if this prognosis is full of holes? With all the money they are spending, year in and year out, on basic research, the Americans have been unable to find any alternative source of energy, and will continue to depend overwhelmingly on oil for their overall energy requirements, 60 per cent of which has to be imported. An additional reason for this near-exclusive stress on oil is the domestic public mood. The environmentalists are relentlessly on the march, no new nuclear power stations have been allowed to be set up in the US in the past 15 years. This in turn has created a further problem. There is a huge excess capacity in that segment of American manufacturing industry which specializes in the construction of nuclear power plants. The military-industry complex  and the US administration  can do little about it except to try to sell such plants to sucker nations such as India.         
	The pillars of the American establishment are not exactly bereft of an economic theory to back up their global strategy on the production and distribution of energy. A gentleman, who has been successively chief economist in the World Bank, a key member of the US department of treasury and president of the Harvard University, had long ago laid down the line: since inhabitants of the poorer countries are generally less productive than the average resident of an advanced industrial nation, it makes economic sense to shift polluting industries  for example, atomic power plants  to less developed countries like India: that, in the view of the eminent scholar, would best serve the cause of economic optimum for the world as a whole.         
	The ruling classes in India, sanguine in their faith in American omnipotence for ever, have complaisantly gone along with this outrageous colonial hypothesis. Morning does not however necessarily show the day; the rest of the 21st century need not continue to be dominated by the US. Are not some straws in the wind already evident? George W. Bushs putsch in west Asia, primarily intended to grab Iraq oil, has misfired; the skyrocketing of the price of crude petroleum is surely a direct consequence of that misadventure.               
	There is at least a great deal to be said in favour of not putting all ones eggs in the American basket. The past few decades have been a period of aroused consciousness for both the Latin Americans and the Arabs, and they happen to be in possession of the largest reserves of petroleum and natural gas. Thanks to Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez, the Monroe Doctrine is very nearly defunct south of the equator; even in the north of it, Mexico is touch and go, as the last presidential poll in the country showed. Which is partly why the two Bushes were so desperately anxious to retain control in west Asia; even if that involves the bestiality exhibited in Iraq. To no avail. Much worse, the spectre of Iran is assuming an increasingly ominous proportion on the American sightscreen with every day.        
	Ruling politicians in India, conservative by instinct, are loth to accept the propositions that the Americans could ever be on a losing streak. Were they to apply themselves seriously to learn about the likely shape of the globe 25 or 30 years hence, they would perhaps stop exchanging polemics on the US-India nuclear deal. They would instead have rushed to open, all over the country, thousands of language teaching schools, where the maximum accent would be on the pedagogy of reaching fluency in Arabic and Spanish in the shortest possible time. Simultaneously, if, despite the glaring disadvantage in relative cost, the preference is still for meeting roughly 10 per cent of the countrys total energy needs from nuclear power, measures should be set afoot to extract the uranium that we have under our soil rather than dance attendance on the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

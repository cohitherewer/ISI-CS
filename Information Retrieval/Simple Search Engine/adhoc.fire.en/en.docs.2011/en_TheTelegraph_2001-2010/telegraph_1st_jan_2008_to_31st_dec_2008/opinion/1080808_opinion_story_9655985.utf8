	Creating ldquo;Greater Malaysia rdquo;: Decolonisation and the Politics of Merger 
  By Tan Tai Yong, Institute of South-east Asian Studies, Price not mentioned
    
	Malaysia is a triumph of expediency, the only country in the world that owes its existence to the departing colonial powers creative genius defying all laws of geography and ethnicity. Although Tan Tai Yongs meticulously researched insiders account doubts British competence in pushing through the Grand Design for a composite state to safeguard British commercial and strategic interests and provide a bulwark against Communism, he does not doubt the intention. Britain tried similar stratagems in Palestine, Aden and central Africa.  
	The experiment succeeded in Malaya, which a Granada TV series described as the only country where the former colonial masters were welcomed back, with spontaneous and enthusiastic demonstrations after World War II. As for its federal partners, while sophisticated Singapore had its own reasons for collaborating with Britain, Sabah and Sarawak were too innocent politically to strike out on another course. London easily scotched a movement in Sarawak to bestow a revived rajaship on Simon Mackay, who then lived in Calcutta, and was heir through his mother to the last Brooke Rajah.        
	Tan, who heads South Asian studies at the National University of Singapore where his specialization, surprisingly, is Punjab, could have drawn certain parallels between Malaysia and India. The British claim to have created India from a jumble of warring principalities and the decaying remains of the Mughal empire. Malaysia was far more a colonial construct. The diplomatic sleight of hand through which Britain acquired Singapore from the Johore sultanate recalls many unequal treaties forced on Indias princes.         
	The sop of bumiputera (son of the soil) status for the people of Sarawak and Sabah  both artificial entities with no historical or cultural links with Malaya brought the additional dividend of creating an indigenous majority to balance Chinese and Indian settlers in a conglomerate state based on the political primacy of the Malays over the other races, allowing the Malay leadership to set the pace and agenda for the creation of a new Malay state. The 1948 Calcutta Conference (grandly titled Conference of Youth and Students of South-east Asia Fighting for Freedom and Independence), precursor of the Communist insurrection in Malaya (as well as of insurgencies in India, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines), may have been a catalyst.         
	Tan does not mention either the Calcutta Conference or Sarawakian overtures to Mackay. He relies on declassified British official records that are often more interesting for what they do not say than for what they do. Intelligence reports would probably also have helped to provide depth and understanding and correct the historians tunnel vision.         
	The focus on Singapore is a more serious flaw that conflicts with the books title. Chapter 4, The Citizenship Issue, is about Singapores citizenship problems rather than the bigger question of Malaysian citizenship. The failed British attempt in 1946 to introduce equal citizenship for all through the Malayan Union deserved fuller treatment.        
	Tans Singapore-centricism should not divert attention from his percipient question regarding Malaysias aspirations to turn the federation into a nation-state. Sarawak and Sabah, victims of what he calls a shot-gun marriage, may be quiescent but recent rumbles among the Indians of peninsular Malaya warn that the transformation into a nation-state is still a distant dream.

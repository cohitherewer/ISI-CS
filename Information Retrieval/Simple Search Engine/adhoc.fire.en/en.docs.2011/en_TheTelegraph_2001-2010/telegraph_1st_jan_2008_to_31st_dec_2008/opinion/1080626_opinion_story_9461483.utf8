The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pure happiness, even if it doesnt last
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PURE HAPPINESS, EVEN IF IT DOESNT LAST                                                                  
	It had rained on that muggy June night, twenty-five years ago. The night India won the World Cup. The match had ended late, and yet, after the win, the genteel folk in our locality had rushed out of their houses in their nightwear, as if possessed, shouting and bursting crackers. The crackers did not make much noise, just the occasional dull thud, but I remember my neighbours making a frightful din.         
	Strangely, the other two things I recollect about that famous win concern my state of health and a television. I remember having a fever. Barred from watching the game, and banished to a settee at the far end of the dining room, I lay watching the adult audience huddled in front of the television screen. I followed Indias fate vicariously, through the roars, curses and the silent interludes.        
	The television (a Telerad it was, I think) was a scary contraption: cumbrous, loyal and unchanging. The dense crowd of bodies would part momentarily, when someone in the throng moved to light a cigarette or get a cup of tea, and I would then be able to glimpse moments of the final: an Amarnath pull, Richards standing with his hands on his hips, Madan Lal trotting in to bowl. Sometimes, a thick, grey band would descend teasingly on the screen, slowly journeying from the top to the bottom, turning the cricketers into horribly misshapen creatures as it passed over them. On one such occasion, the turbaned Sandhu, I seem to remember, resembled nothing more than a squashed, moving beetle.        
	Memories are notorious for granting a licence to imagination. Every incident from that evening is now a part of family lore. I now know that our landlord, a creaky octogenarian, tumbled downstairs, stick in hand, when Kapil ran miles to dismiss Viv. Or that a relative locked himself up in the toilet for the rest of the game as Greenidge was dismissed in his absence. Over the years, the countless dinner-table conversations about that evening have made each detail, however trivial, more and more enduring. I like to think that I remember all of it, although it seems improbable.        
	Yet it is difficult not to remember life after Indias victory. That the triumph would revolutionize cricket in India, conceal some of the countrys warts in its cricketing glory for a while, and signal the evolution of much that goes by the name of the modern game  superstars, all-rounders, sponsorship and so on  all this knowledge would come, eventually. But for a six year old, all that mattered then was how a victory in a distant land had changed life around him. Parents wouldnt mind if we played cricket long after dusk. Even my maths teacher smiled at me after I failed to work out a single problem in class. Happiness, in its purest form, seldom lasts. This enchanting period too ended, soon after Lloyds team demolished India in that nightmarish tour of 83-84.        
	I have committed to my memory another World Cup final, for distinctly different reasons. It was in 2003 and India were playing Australia. I was in Mumbai, watching the game at a friends place. After the match ended, I remember walking towards my flat at Andheri, when I noticed a giant cardboard cut-out of the Men in Blue at a street corner. There was no one in sight. Empty beer bottles lay strewn on the road. Each face, including Tendulkars, had been smudged with ink, and a garland of shoes hung over their cardboard necks. Somewhere along the line, the Indian cricket fan had changed. He would not lock himself in the lavatory, praying for a wicket to fall. If the chips were down on the field, he would come out of his refined shell, throwing bottles and burning effigies. The cricketers had changed too. They now looked bigger than the game.        
	So the other day, I sat watching Kapil, Kirmani and Kirti Azad chat in a television show to mark 25 years of The Victory. The three sat chatting and joking like old friends. Kapil spoke of how he had to rush out of the shower to pad up, as the wickets fell at Tunbridge Wells. Azad, good-humouredly, talked of Gavaskars fastidiousness. Kirmani said very little. He just smiled and smiled and kept moving his hands on his bald pate. He was somewhere else, perhaps reliving that English summerin his mind. Of the three, I liked him the best.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

Desai                                                    
	I argued in my last column that growth of the telecommunications industry is going to slow down soon. What can it do in view of this threat? It will have to change its marketing strategy. There are three things it can do.         
	First, it can go the Chinese way. China reached the point of urban telecom saturation some years ago. After that, Chinese telecom operators turned for profits to value added services. The Chinese send 700-800 SMSs a year per head; Indians send 50-60. They change ringtones frequently, and pay for them; turning pop songs into ringtones is big business in China. They watch comics on their phones; Disney has developed special comics for Chinese telephone subscribers. They use their phones for e-mail and internet; there are 162 million internet users in China as against 42 million in India. Timebroadband Services is an Indian company; but it is aiming for a market in China. It is buying dances and other content from Bollywood; it aims to start an internet protocol television service for Chinese telephone users.        
	Second, Indian operators can go abroad. A number of Indian operators have been tempted by investment in MTN, the South African telecom operator. But international financial markets are competitive, and it is difficult to find telecom companies abroad that are undervalued. Buying them can be profitable only if an Indian investor can increase their value added; Indian telecom operators do not have any special knowhow or content to be able to do so. So foreign investment is unlikely to absorb a substantial proportion of the Indian telecom industrys surplus.               
	Third, they can invest outside the telecom industry. Sunil Mittal has looked at retail, agriculture and airports amongst other opportunities. Anil Ambani has been investing in a large number of new enterprises, in the manner of a venture capitalist. The telecom arm of the Tatas is a part of a business house or, to use modern terminology, a private equity firm. So conglomeration is the way most of the surplus being generated by telecom will probably go.        
	Finally, the telecom operators can exploit the rural market. The government is intent on serving this market; but precisely because of its eagerness, there has not been much of a market there. The 2001 census listed 5,93,000 villages. Of these, only 14,989 did not have a village telephone on November 30, 2007. The industry is selling that many cellphones in an hour and a quarter just now. The governments model of taking one telephone at enormous cost to each village could be followed only by an institution which can dip into others pockets and waste their money; and it is approaching the end of the road.         
	Now teledensity within each village has to start rising. It can be raised, but not with the current policies. If the calculations I described earlier are correct, the urban market is approaching saturation; soon, the rural market will be the only one in the country where operators can find substantial new markets. What will be required is not a handful of rural telephones, but millions of them. And they will not be sold in millions if operators do not find profit in them.         
	The policies are themselves set for a change. Till now, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has operated two cross-subsidies. One, called access deficit charge, is a cross-subsidy to BSNL just for being BSNL  an overmanned, inefficient public enterprise. Its argument for the subsidy was that it was the only operator with a large number of fixed lines. It was charging rents on these lines which were much below what the cost of installing the lines would require, and was therefore making notional losses. Since BSNL was owned by the department of telecommunications, which appointed TRAI, TRAI had no difficulty in accepting this argument. But it said that since the number of fixed lines was not going up, the subsidy could also be frozen; and since total telecommunications revenue was going up, the share of the revenue that had to go into ADC could be brought down. From March 2007, the ADC is being funded from two taxes. TRAI levies 0.75 per cent on adjusted gross revenue and Re 1 per minute on incoming international calls.         
	Now, TRAI has proposed to terminate ADC. BSNL is predictably up in arms. It is a perfectly rational organization; it sees no reason why it should give up getting something for nothing. Equally, all other operators who have been cross-subsidizing it are against it. TRAI says that it will merge ADC with the universal services obligation fund. It means that ADC should be replaced by a subsidy on rural fixed-line phones; it would presumably not be for BSNL alone, but be given to anyone who gives out rural fixed-line phones.         
	The other, called universal service obligation, is a cross-subsidy to rural telecom services. It is financed by a 5 per cent tax on adjusted gross revenue; the proceeds go into a USO fund, run by a USO administrator. This is a heavy tax, and the USO administrator has been getting a lot of money. In 2006-07, he received Rs 4,200 crore. With so much money, he got ambitious and started off many schemes. He funds transmission towers, public telephones, fixed telephone lines and broadband connections. His activities raise two questions. First, should he be funded out of a tax on telephone users? And second, what should be the scope of his activities?              
	On the first, the government has created a special fund for rural development called Bharat Nirman. It is supposed to finance telephone connectivity in all villages. This fund should take over the entire cost of that connectivity. The government should undertake rural development in an integrated manner. For instance, when it builds rural roads, they should also include ducts and pipes for electricity and telecommunications. A unified management is necessary, and telecommunications are a part of it. So the government should remove the tax on telephone operators revenue it collects for the USO. If it thinks telephone users are too rich, it may tax them, but the tax revenue should go into the general budget.        
	On the second, it often happens that government subsidies reduce the spread of a service rather than expand it. Rural telephone connections are a classic instance. For decades the DoT was given subsidies for rural telephones. To get the maximum subsidy it selected an expensive technology, namely multiple-access radio relay or MARR technology. The pace at which it installed MARR telephones was glacial, and they hardly ever worked. It is essential to design subsidy programmes that would expand and not contract access.         
	And when we think of access, we should think not only of interpersonal communications, but of information. For information technology has advanced in the past 30 years to the point where it is possible to make information available to everyone virtually free; and the development of telecommunications makes it possible to store that information and make it available anywhere else. We should marry these two developments and create a resource that would make learning far more widely and easily available. We should be thinking in terms of digital libraries  computers storing the worlds knowledge, accessible to anyone on the internet.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TIMELY PLAN                                                    
	It is much more than remembering to switch off the lights and fans, or to turn off the water-tap properly. But being actively aware of climate change implies the right distribution of responsibilities among the individual, the national and the global. The prime minister has released Indias first national action plan for climate change. Quite pointedly, it sets no targets for reducing emissions and increasing efficiency, and therefore sticks to the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, ratified by India in 2002, which lets off the developing countries from setting specific targets for reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. Both India and China, whose climate change plan rivals Indias, have been uncompromising, in various international fora, about relenting to pressure regarding such commitments from the United States of America and the rest of the developed world. So Indias plan is being received more as the setting of a domestic agenda rather than an initial move towards global negotiations.         
	Yet the very formulation of such a plan is an implicit acknowledgment that Indias perception of its responsibilities in relation to other countries, developing as well as developed, is changing. And this is both a question of its internal concerns and its place in the global scheme of things. Indias per capita emission is still low, but in terms of total volume, India is the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after the US, China and Russia. This is something that has to be reckoned with, for Indias own good and for that of the world. There is a tendency to see the fact of being spared by the Kyoto Protocol as an excuse for not thinking about these things at all for as long as possible. This would be a dangerous attitude to adopt. To start thinking concretely and concertedly about renewable energy, water conservation and the preservation of natural resources, and then to act on the fruits of such thinking, are of the utmost urgency for India. The deadly form that air pollution has taken in Calcutta is an example of what might happen if the State fails, or refuses, to take this urgency seriously. While releasing the plan, the prime minister founded his vision of a green India on the most basic need for clean water to drink, fresh air to breathe and a green earth to walk on. India needs to ensure these for its people, even if the rest of the world were not looking on with increasing, and understandable, demands for accountability.

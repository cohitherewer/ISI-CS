	One of the tricks of success is to begin with attainable goals. So when a single district decides to stop corporal punishment for children in schools, the chances of success seem high. The district of Idukki in Kerala has not only pledged to wipe out corporal punishment in schools, but it has also set itself a time-frame  one year  and presented detailed plans to the Centre regarding the practical steps it is going to take. There are a number of features in the decision that are worthy of emulation. It speaks of a proactive administration acting unitedly in a decision  the district collector is as involved in the project as is the districts child welfare board. Such unity gives weight to the decision not to let a single teacher or administrator who physically punishes a child go unpunished; it also promises awareness and deterrence. Besides, there is a voluntary quality to the decision: Kerala does not have a state law against corporal punishment as many other states have. The district is responding to the 2000 Supreme Court ban on physical punishment and the 2006 report from the Union ministry of women and child development that children are physically punished in schools throughout the country.
    
	Most important perhaps is the district administrations sense of pride. It not only wishes to be a model to the rest of the country as far as corporal punishment in schools is concerned, but it has also set itself its own targets. Practical measures, such as complaint boxes for children in front of every school and, it is to be hoped, adequate monitoring and follow-up of complaints, might actually do the trick if there is will and focus. The district administration has accepted that a law by itself cannot change anything, so, for a law to work, it has to be implemented at the ground level. If West Bengal, which prides itself on its local government, had local administrations willing to take on this kind of responsibility at their own levels, many evils, and not just corporal punishment, could have been addressed.

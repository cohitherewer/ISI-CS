The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | there is a plot out there
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THERE IS A PLOT OUT THERE                                                          
	There is nothing more convenient than a conspiracy theory. It allows the suspension of reason, and creates an alibi for not facing reality. No wonder Bengalis are so prone to give credence to conspiracy theories of various kinds concerning a variety of issues. The best example of this tendency is the recent comment by the leader of the Trinamul Congress, Mamata Banerjee, that the exit of the Nano project from Singur was a joint game plan between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Tatas. What she was suggesting was that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Ratan Tata, along with their respective associates and advisers, sat together to plot the exit so that Ms Banerjee could be politically embarrassed, and the CPI(M) thus gain maximum mileage. There is an instinctive refusal here to recognize the real reasons that forced Mr Tata to take the decision to take the Nano car away from the Singur plant. Instead of admitting the enormous damage that the departure of the Tatas will do to West Bengal, Ms Banerjee has sought the easy way out by blaming it all on a conspiracy of which she is the target and the victim. She has thus absolved herself of all responsibility.        
	It would be unfair, of course, to single out Ms Banerjee as being the only politician afflicted by the conspiracy fever. It is a malady that strangely grips Bengalis, more than it does any other group of people. Conspiracies hatched by imperialists and multinational corporations have been the stock-in-trade of generations of leftists in West Bengal. There was a time when leftist politicians firmly believed that all the problems that affected West Bengal were products of a conspiracy carefully thought up in New Delhi.        
	The quest for conspiracies is not restricted to politicians. It has contaminated other areas as well. Whenever Saurav Ganguly is dropped from the Indian side, the cry goes among Bengalis that certain people have ganged up on their icon. There is a denial involved. A denial of the fact that Ganguly is out of form or is being rested or that the selectors believe, rightly or wrongly, that younger players should be given a chance. Each of these or a combination of these could be valid and perfectly acceptable reasons for a player being dropped. But not in the case of the prince from Bengal. He can only be the victim of a conspiracy hatched by, obviously, non-Bengalis.        
	It will remain a mystery how a people that prides itself on its mental and intellectual prowess fall so easily for conspiracy theories. The latter, if anything, is indicative of a shallow mindset and of a tendency to cling to the easy and the most convenient explanation. It is also the sign of immaturity because it speaks of an inability to take responsibility, to admit mistakes, and to accept unpleasant truths.

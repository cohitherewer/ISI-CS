                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE BRUTAL AND THE NOBLE                                  Why is corporal punishment still a hallowed custom in Indian schools?                                            
	It was with shock that the parents of a little girl going to one of Calcuttas prestigious schools approached the school authorities three years ago, before they went to the police and the media, to complain against how their daughter had been treated in class. A handful of her hair had been pulled out from the roots as punishment.         
	The authorities first denied the incident, then declared the teacher innocent, blamed the girls family for going to the media and, finally, pushed the matter towards oblivion by proclaiming the managing committee as the final arbiter. Managing committees, often without parental representation, invariably give a decent burial to such controversies. Last heard, the authorities in this case had succeeded in turning the tables on the father who, at the end of the academic year, had little choice but to approach the school for his daughters re-admission.         
	State-aided schools in West Bengal and some other states have to have, by government decree, a certain percentage of parents in their committees. But private institutions have almost no parents in their committees. Allegations of abuse in schools  like this one, or the one more recently in Behala that ended less fortunately for the parents  are thus dealt with publicly on the streets, with road blocks or the destruction of property. Parents are forced to make fools of themselves before the children, and the school is made the villain of the piece. But why do schools keep parents at arms length? Why is their help solicited only when schools have to organize annual events or Childrens Day shows? Why are meetings with teachers or authorities an unpleasant experience for most parents?         
	The answer lies in the schools perception of parents, and of their usefulness to the school. St James School, for instance, has no parent-teacher association, although it has done more than many other schools to encourage parental involvement through regular open house days, enlisting voluntary services from parents both inside the school and outside. Anjela Ghosh, who heads the junior school, says, We found out that parents would want to have a hand in admissions and the recruitment of teachers. The school cannot allow this because these matters are controlled by the Church of North India. But is parental involvement in these matters necessarily such a bad idea?         
	Anuradha Das, principal of Calcutta International School, does not think so. The Calcutta International School Society, which takes all policy decisions and approves the budget, is made up of 12 members, 11 of whom are elected by parents from among themselves at the annual general meeting. Although this body does not involve itself in the day-to-day running of the school (this is the responsibility of the principal), there is hardly any issue involving students and parents that does not pass through its hands. The body, however, does not recruit teachers. This is done by the management. All contrary views and expectations are sorted out between teachers and parents. It is not hard to communicate with parents who are so well-read and well-travelled, says Das.         
	Does that last bit hold up communication in other schools? But dont authorities go to considerable lengths to forestall this problem when they insist on enquiring into the parents educational and professional backgrounds before admission? The parents class profile or education is definitely not the factor determining parent-teacher communication, says Das. She vehemently discourages such a thought: if parents and teachers are working towards a common goal, then there is no room for misunderstanding.        
	But then, why is it that the two categories of schools willing to go out of their way to solicit and ensure parental participation are those catering either to the underprivileged or the elite? When I refer to the first category, I would like to discount a large proportion of the state-run schools where education is a chore that has to be carried out to keep the funds flowing in. But there are ones, sometimes privately-run, and increasingly by bright B-school products, which believe that open communication with parents is the only way to keep children in rural areas from dropping out of school. It is only because parents have managed to get across to the authorities that harvesting time invariably clashed with school timings that the latter have been changed in Tamil Nadus Dindigul district to 4pm until 9pm, and the midday meal has become dinner (overseen by parents).         
	The other category is that of the exclusive school where the management has to think twice before offending the sentiments of the students and their guardians. (These are often religious, as the controversy over the meat served in one residential school in India has shown.) It is not that the middling sort of schools are oblivious to parental sentiments. But they seem to embrace only those sentiments that suit their own interests. If they have dress codes for teachers (Bengal), or vetoed sex education (Maharashtra), or turned out HIV+ students, it is, the schools claim, only in response to pressure from the parents. Then why are they so unresponsive to other demands, like the complete ban on corporal punishment?        
	Schools have to listen to parents, and they will be made to if Middle India lives out its consumerist dream. In that scheme of things, teachers are professionals rendering a service in return for payment made by the parents. But before that happens, before education is stripped of the last vestiges of the noble, parents ought to be given a hearing  and a patient one too.

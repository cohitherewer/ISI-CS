	I knew the US presidential race was over when my son pre-emptively announced that he had lost his bet with me: Hillary Clinton was not going to be the Democratic candidate. The question of whether Barack Obama can beat John McCain is still open, but it wont stay open once the two men go head to head. McCain has many attractive qualities, but he is 71 and Obama is 46.        
	McCain is also a Republican in a year when the United States of America is heading into recession after eight years of a Republican administration. Even more importantly, he is committed to continuing a war in Iraq that most Americans just want to leave behind. Curiously, this means that the two men with the greatest potential influence on McCains political future are Osama bin Laden and Moqtada al-Sadr.        
	The one thing that could swing the 2008 election in favour of the Republicans is another large-scale terrorist attack on the US. If al Qaida has any ability to provide that attack, it will certainly do so, for Osama bin Laden is aware that his greatest recruiting tool in the Arab world is the American military presence in Iraq. But it is unlikely that al Qaida has any significant presence within the US.        
	Moqtada al-Sadr is a more interesting case. He is the leader of the Mahdi army, the biggest Shia militia in Iraq, and he has just extended his unilateral ceasefire against American troops and rival militias for another six months. His two main objectives in life are to evict the US from Iraq and to gain control of the Iraqi government.        
	So long as the US presidential election promises to result in an administration pledged to withdraw from Iraq, he doesnt have to lift a finger. But if, by August, it looks like McCain has a chance of winning, then Moqtada al-Sadr has every incentive to end his ceasefire and launch a mini-Tet offensive against US troops. The point would not be to win. It would be to remind American voters that Iraq is a quagmire that they should leave really soon.                
	New world        
	So one way or another, Obama is almost certain to be the president by January of next year. He has hedged his commitment to withdraw American troops from Iraq in various ways from time to time, but there is little doubt in most peoples minds that he really intends to do it. What will the Middle East look like after the Americans are gone?        
	Iraq, contrary to all the predictions of disaster, will probably be all right after the US leaves. It will never again be the secular, female-friendly society of the past, and it will take at least a decade to recover from the economic devastation of the embargo, the invasion and the occupation, but it wont break up. Most of the smaller religious and ethnic minorities have fled or been killed, and the larger groups  Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds  have retreated into homogeneous districts and neighbourhoods, so theres not much left to fight about except along the boundary between Arab Iraq and Kurdistan. Its even possible that the more-or-less democratic system imposed by the US occupation will survive the departure of the Americans.        
	Iran will emerge as the new power of the Gulf, but its actual influence over predominantly Shia Iraq will be quite limited. Farther afield, the notion of a dangerously radical Shia crescent running through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon is sheer nonsense: Shias are a minority in Lebanon and Syria. The real fall-out from the US invasion of Iraq is the greatly heightened prestige of Islamist revolutionaries throughout the Arab world. Whether this will ever result in a successful Islamist revolution in a major Arab country remains to be seen         
	Its not much of a headline: Small, nasty war in Iraq ends; Middle East largely unaffected. But then, history often works like that. The equivalent headline in 1975 would have read: US defeated in Vietnam; No wider consequences.

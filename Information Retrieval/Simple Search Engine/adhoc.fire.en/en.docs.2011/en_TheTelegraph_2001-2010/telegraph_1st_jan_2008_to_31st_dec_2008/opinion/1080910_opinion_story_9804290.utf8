	It is doubtful whether Pakistan is celebrating the democratic election of its president with as much spontaneity as it had welcomed the results of the February elections. The choice of Asif Ali Zardari, who assumed office with the overwhelming support of the countrys legislators, does not go down easily with the people who have been witness to his political dealings in the past and are doing so at present. There are even apprehensions of the looming shadow of the past as Mr Zardari goes on to occupy the highest constitutional office of the country armed with the same powers that had once made his predecessor such a despicable figure. Like Pervez Musharraf, Mr Zardari can dismiss parliament, even the provincial governments, and hand-pick supreme court judges. Both the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) and the Pakistan Peoples Party-anointed prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, have repeated the plea for a dilution of the presidents powers. The cry sounds plaintive because the initiative actually rests with Mr Zardari himself. As the co-chairman of the PPP, the largest party in parliament, he holds the key to the passage of any bill seeking to curb presidential authority. If Mr Zardari does forget his insecurities for a moment and relents so far as to allow a restitution of the democratic balance of the State, he will not only have enhanced his public image but will also have strengthened the foundations of democracy in Pakistan.         
	In case that does not happen, the price Pakistan will have to pay for Mr Zardaris self-absorption will be heavy. A continuation of the ambiguity in the power structure will severely compromise the States response to the economic crisis and the issue of terrorism that also complicates its foreign policy. The armys decision to play second fiddle to the civilian leadership has given Pakistan a rare opportunity to set the equations right in politics and governance. Mr Zardari, as president, can use it to the maximum if he allows the executive the space it requires to grow and, as party head, encourages his party to promote the bold policies he had enunciated as a popular leader.

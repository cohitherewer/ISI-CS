The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Experiments with scale
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       EXPERIMENTS WITH SCALE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	Italian photographer, Olivo Barbieri, exhibited his Site Specific project in a New York gallery this year and it comprised a number of aerial shots of Rome, Amman, Los Angeles and Shanghai. Barbieris tilt-shift lens had turned each city and its landmarks into tiny caricatures. Barbieris brilliance lay in confounding the viewers perception of reality by toying with his sense of scale.        
	Uday Shankar Hajra may not have heard of Barbieri, but some of his photographs in Album One, (Photographers Gallery, November 14-20), by his own admission, are modest attempts at imitating another Masters experiments with scale. Giant X-Mass Tree, Old Goa (picture) seemed to have been inspired by Henri Cartier-Bressons Tree-lined Roadway. The trees in Cartier-Bressons photograph challenged our notions of scale with their monstrously larger-than-life quality. Here too, the lone, giant Arcarias tapering form, seemingly towering above the spires of the imposing cathedral on which two men appear like specks, inverts the relationship among objects in the natural order. Hajras preference for colour has to do with the fact that he has been trained as a painter.        
	Two other photographs taken by Hajra command attention because of the stories they tell. Abandoned Factory is in black-and-white, surreal and beautiful. It shows the half-lit interiors of a derelict brick kiln, light filtering through regular openings in the wall. A child, a dog and a tree can be seen through one of the doors, and another patch of light falls on the ground, revealing a circle of bricks and a spectral, human shadow. The shadow, the dog, the tree and the child fill this scene of desolation with a delicate, humane presence. Iveco at Ajoy is about a different kind of human contact: two vastly unequal worlds collide inside this frame. Three villagers, one of whom is almost hidden, stand and gape at a grotesque contraption: a gigantic trailer truck. Their faces are turned away from the camera, but their stillness and total absorption convey a sense not only of wonder, but also of fear.        
	Sadly, the rest of Hajras photographs have very little to offer, and their quality dips alarmingly. The lack of consistency and the absence of originality are disappointing. Hajras idyllic images of boatmen, rivers, fields and grazing cows are shallow, while his horror with all things modern appear contrived. (Network, South Raipur shows a man using his mobile phone in a beautiful setting.) It just goes to show that most photographers of Hajras calibre raises expectations, only to disappoint.

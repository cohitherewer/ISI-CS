                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           LIGHTS OFF                                                              
	By her own admission, Madhabi Mukherjee was so overwhelmed by the role played by the Trinamul Congress mayor of Calcutta, Subrata Mukherjee, in the revival of the Star Theatre that she felt obliged to nod in assent when he asked her to be the TMC candidate against the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, before the 2006 assembly elections in West Bengal.         
	The truth about Madhabi Mukherjees entry into electoral politics in a way tells the story of the intersection of film and politics in Bengal  a story of half-hearted personal favours and guest appearances. No film personality of Bengal who has tried his hand at politics  and there are only a few  can be accused of having a blueprint for turning the state around. Those who actually took the plunge  the likes of Tapas Pal, Anup Kumar, Chinmoy Ray, Biplab Chatterjee, Nayana Das  brought into the political arena their professional skill of mouthing dialogues provided in the script. So much so that their presence hardly ever managed to elicit a serious thought from their electorate. The chances of a Chiranjeevi-like scenario in Bengal, therefore, appear as improbable as the possibility of Citu eschewing strikes.        
	The state boasts of a politically aware people. Surely a state where every street-corner is abuzz with animated political discussion and debate should have more active political participation from its tinseltown? But could you blame a politically conscious people for having reservations about entrusting their real-life problems with their reel heroes? This is what seems to be the case in West Bengal. In a state where communists have ruled for as long as one can remember, having leftist leanings was once entirely in keeping with the order of nature. Only a few film-people like Utpal Dutt chose to wear their red hearts on their sleeves. But ever since communist and CPI(M) have come to mean two different sets of things, the CPI(M), like any other political party, has sought to add glamour to its electoral campaigns.        
	To look for reasons why filmstars are still an inconsequential presence in Bengals politics  remember how it surprised everyone to see them taking to the streets after Nandigram?  one ought to examine the nature of its film industry. For one, Tollywood is nowhere near its counterparts in Mumbai or Chennai in financial musclepower. A churner-out of mostly B-grade movies is simply not able to produce stars whose support to a cause can turn the tide of popular opinion. The one star who came close was Uttam Kumar, but he was quite content with playing cricket for flood relief. Prasenjit Chatterjee is no Rajanikanth, but he has a large enough following in rural and suburban Bengal to consider launching a political outfit of his own. But is there enough in it for him (or any other star)? And is there enough in him for it?        
	The answer to both questions is no. Nayana Das, former actor and Trinamul MLA, who famously attributed her poll victory to the cosmopolitan nature of her constituency comprising Bengalis as well as Muslims, was heard claiming recently that she was not a political person. The wisdom of Bengals voters is often praised, and not without reason. They are not sure if actors can give them good politics. But they have no doubt that if they need a dose of good theatrics, Mamata Banerjee will not disappoint. The choice is easy.       SREYASHI DASTIDAR

	One time-tested way of evading acknowledgment of violence against women is to sit tight on a complaint. Naveen Patnaiks government in Orissa managed to do just that for almost 38 days after a nun in Kandhamal complained that she had been raped and paraded naked by a Hindu mob. The governments stakes were high. That it was a nuns complaint made it explosive against the background of continuing violence against Christians in the area. Christian organizations and leaders, the national commission for minorities, the media and the Centre have been increasing pressure on the chief minister, Mr Patnaik, to control the rampaging Hindu mobs. With the Bharatiya Janata Party as the partner of the Biju Janata Dal in government, the chief minister seems to have been willing to be less than efficient in controlling the crisis. Unofficial estimates of homeless Christians have gone up to 40,000, although the state is acknowledging only 14,000. But even that is a marker of terrible violence, unleashed in its full fury after the murder of the Hindu leader, Laxmananda Saraswati, although extremist political groups claimed responsibility for that. The alleged rape of the nun occurred two days later, on August 25. Nothing was done, although the medical reports indicated rape, and were ready long ago.         
	The combined pressure, which included a letter from the Union home minister asking Mr Patnaik to stop the violence, seems to have worked. A scapegoat in the rape case has been found and suspended for laxity  the inspector in charge of Baliguda police station. The superintendent of police, Kandhamal, has explained the delay by saying that the complainant did not name her violators in her first information report  apparently she was supposed to be on first-name terms with a rampaging mob  and that she was recovering from her trauma in an undisclosed location. Mr Patnaik has deplored the shameful and savage crime but had nothing to say about the states inaction. The case has now been handed over to the crime branch where it will be overseen by an inspector general of police. Four people have been arrested now that the incident has become a source of embarrassment. But no one thing could have exposed the state governments attitude to the violence in Kandhamal more devastatingly than its prolonged inaction over the rape of a nun.

	The perils of the journey often determine the success of a pilgrimage. In India, modern transport and communication may have lessened the dangers of travel, but another facet of modernity has ensured that pilgrimages remain as perilous as before  a myopic administrative set-up, which considers it sacrilegious to apply the science of crowd control in matters of faith. The result is repeated incidents of stampedes at religious congregations. The temple disaster at the Mehrangarh fort in Rajasthan, on the first day of a major Hindu festival, is the third this year. The casualty figures this time have been high enough to send the chief minister into a tizzy. But similar incidents every year have repeatedly pointed to a specific lacuna, which, for reasons unknown, has been unerringly overlooked. The management in most temples and religious sites, some of which are ancient and have severe space constraints, is not equipped to handle a sudden increase in the number of visitors on certain days of the calendar. There are undoubtedly some, such as the Tirumala hill temple, which have sophisticated techniques of crowd management. But the administration here is used to handling a large number of visitors throughout the year and has the required mechanisms in place. The same goes for the management during the Kumbh melas. The administration anticipates the numbers and prepares itself accordingly.         
	What causes disasters of the kind in Rajasthan is the lack of a contingency plan to deal with inadvertent situations, and, much more importantly, the proclivity to see pilgrims as nothing more than cattle. Had the life and safety of the visitors been considered precious, the temple management would have had plans in place for their swift evacuation in times of emergency. Innumerable lives were lost in Mehrangarh because rescue workers had no other way but to physically carry down victims to vehicles after a one-kilometre trudge. The narrow pathway in Wai similarly jeopardized rescue operations during the 2005 disaster in Maharashtra that claimed 300 lives. The secular state administration  which now to a large extent ensures that religious festivals remain normal occurrences in public life  and the management of religious institutions have not only to refashion their policies to deal with large human assemblies, but also learn to value lives and prepare for less ordinary times.

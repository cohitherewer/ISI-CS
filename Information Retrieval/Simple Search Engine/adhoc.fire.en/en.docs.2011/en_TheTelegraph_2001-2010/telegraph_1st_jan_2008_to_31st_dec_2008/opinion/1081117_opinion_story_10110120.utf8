	Heavy price                  
	Sir  The price of aviation turbine fuel has been reduced by about 17 per cent by the oil companies, while the Centre has decided to abolish five per cent of customs duty on ATF (Double relief for airlines Oct 31). The latter may have come as a result of the meetings between the Jet Airways officials, the civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, and the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, following the sacking and the immediate reinstatement of almost two thousand Jet employees earlier in October. The ministers have duly delivered on the promise of revising ATF price, based on fortnightly rates of oil crude in the international market, and waived the interests that the airlines were supposed to pay to the public-sector oil marketing companies.           
	Moreover, the stipulated time for repaying credit for the airlines has also been increased to three months from the existing limit of one month. This strategy, the minister feels, will help bail out air carriers that are suffering from losses. A lot is being done to ease the pressure on airlines, but there has been no revision of prices for petrol, diesel and cooking gas for the common man. The price of oil in India has remained static at a high after the last rise almost six months ago, while in the international market the price has slipped from close to $150 to approximately $55 a barrel. The reduction of prices for petrol and diesel could have helped the government curb the rise in the prices of daily commodities and also to tame inflation. It is unfortunate that the government chose to come to the aid of the big industries first. Not just airline companies but many other sectors have been badly hit by the exorbitant fuel charges. It is also possible that the benefits of the government concessions are going into the pockets of the owners, and not the employees, of these companies. Worse, the governments intervention is proving to be ineffective. This is evident from the fact that despite the government benevolence, some airlines have slashed the salaries and commissions of employees and travel agents respectively. Fares are still high for the passengers, and the transaction charges are on the rise as well.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Citizens are in need of a reduction in fuel prices, but politicians seem to be only concerned about the plight of private airlines. Slashing the price of aviation fuel may have been imperative to rescue the ailing airlines, but why should ordinary citizens keep paying a fortune for petrol and diesel? Are they being forced to compensate for the deficit created by the reduction in ATF price? Inflation has finally dipped, after months, to almost 8 per cent (Welcome return to single digit, Nov 14). Will the ministers now consider revising the price of fuel?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Union government should sell domestic LPG at subsidized rates and retain the raised prices of petrol and diesel to make up for its losses in case the sharp fall in the price for crude in international market does not help matters. But the government is actually working the other way round. P. Chidambaram has reduced ATF prices, much to the relief of airline companies, but is forcing consumers to shell out a lump sum to buy cooking gas. The airline industry may need relaxed price-levels to weather the fiscal storm, but at least their resources and revenues are bigger than those of common people. Unlike the latter, these companies also have the government at their beck and call to help them out of trouble.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Up in smoke          
	Sir  There remains a serious gap between imposing a ban on smoking in public places and implementing it. There is still some confusion about who will extract the fines from the ones caught smoking in public. While the police and conductors on State buses have been given the responsibility to extract fines, they themselves are often found smoking on duty. The new law must be reinforced with some stricter clauses. Tobacco must be put in the same category as illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin so that smokers, as well as the sellers of tobacco-related products, can be punished severely. It should also be made mandatory for candidates seeking government jobs to quit smoking. Government employees who smoke must be asked to give up either cigarettes or their jobs. Nominations should not be given to electoral candidates who smoke. If the government does not act more decisively, smoking cannot be stopped.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Chowdhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The ban on smoking in public places still remains ineffective. Just the other day, while travelling in an auto-rickshaw, I found a co-passenger smoking. I reminded him of the ban. But he retorted that since there was no one around to extract the fine, he could still enjoy his puff. When I told him that the traffic police at the next crossing might put him in trouble, he only laughed. As the vehicle stopped at the signal, I waited for the cop standing a few feet away to come and admonish my co-passenger. But he hardly noticed the man smoking. When the vehicle left the crossing, the man asked me with a wicked smile whether I had noticed. The authorities dont seem to notice the reality non-smokers face every day.          
	Yours faithfully,

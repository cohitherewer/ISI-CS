Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                          Love duet                                              
	History is unforgiving. But in three days, Manmohan Singh will have an opportunity to redeem himself for an error of judgment as prime minister when he arrives in Washington for a summit of the group of 20 industrial and emerging economies, called as a result of the global economic crisis.        
	Leaders seldom get a second chance to correct their mistakes, but the summit will afford Singh a way out of the embarrassment that he heaped on Indians when he told President George W. Bush in the White House Oval Office on September 25 that the people of India deeply love you. As the prime minister prepares to fly to Washington, news from the latest poll in the United States of America is that Bush has the lowest approval rate for any American president since such polls began during the tenure of Harry Truman in January 1952. At a disapproval rate of 76 per cent this week, Bush has outdone Richard Nixon, whose rate of disapproval among Americans was 66 per cent at the height of the Watergate scandal.        
	Obviously, Singh cannot take back what he told Bush nearly two months ago. But he can make amends for his words by standing up against attempts by this White House to make a farce of a summit that Bush had no interest in calling in the first place. It is one of Washingtons worst-kept secrets that Bush, rattled by the way US financial institutions collapsed like dominoes in September, was virtually coerced by Nicolas Sarkozy into convening the summit when the French president went to Camp David on October 18.        
	Leaders routinely attempt to paper over their differences and put on the best faces when they appear in public. But at their joint media appearance in October, what came through were fundamental differences between Bush and Sarkozy on the way ahead.               
	Bush wants to cling to capitalism in its present form, unmindful that it stands discredited. He wants a patchwork that will enable the US to muddle through the current financial crisis in the hope that somehow all will be well in the end. For this reason, Bush said in Camp David that it is essential that we preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism  a commitment to free markets, free enterprise, and free trade. We must resist the dangerous temptation of economic isolationism and continue the policies of open markets that have lifted standards of living and helped millions of people escape poverty around the world.        
	But Sarkozy had an altogether different message. He said Bush is right to say that it would be wrong, catastrophic, to challenge the foundations of market economics. But we cannot continue along the same lines because the same problems will trigger the same disasters. We can only go forward with a sense of responsibility and that those who have made the mistakes bear the brunt of their errors and shoulder that burden of responsibility.         
	The French president chose his words carefully enough not to leave an impression of deep discord, but he conveyed the conviction in Europe that the current crisis was one that was created in New York, but the world was being called upon to solve it. In doing so, we must look at the fundamental rules that will apply to this 21st century of ours Hedge funds cannot continue operating as they have in the past; tax havens, neither; financial institutions that are under no supervisory control  this is no longer acceptable, this is no longer possible.        
	Sarkozy also made it clear that it could not be business as usual once the crisis is over, the way Bush would like it to be. Once calm has been restored, we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so once again. This sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in.        
	So, two different sets of ideas and two diverse paths emerging out of such diversity are bound to clash at the Washington summit. What will be the stand of Indias economist prime minister when this clash occurs on Friday and Saturday? Will he side with Washington or will he go along with a European consensus that Sarkozy represents? Notwithstanding whatever India may be doing domestically to enable its economy to weather the current economic storm, public pronouncements by the government do not inspire confidence that it will say or do what is right at the international level.         
	Sergei Lavrov, the cool and deliberative foreign minister of Russia, announced, as preparations began for this weeks Washington summit, that Brazil, Russia, India and China will coordinate (their) efforts in overcoming the financial crisis. Lavrov said that we are going to coordinate our moves with the leading emerging economies . We are interacting in the BRIC and RIC (Russia-India-China) formats. In saying so, Lavrov followed up on the confident assertion of the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, that BRIC would be the locomotive of the world economy in coming years.        
	There have been persistent reports in the aftermath of the Bush administrations $700 billion bailout for its financial institutions that Chinas Peoples Bank may buy $200 billion more of US debt in order to support the bailout in Washington. At the same time, the Chinese have prepared a huge blueprint for supporting its domestic economic activity that will doubtless be affected by the global meltdown.        
	Brazils president, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, a pragmatic socialist, told a meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers, including Indias P. Chidambaram, in So Paulo last weekend that the international financial system collapsed like a house of cards as the result of a dogmatic faith in non-intervention in markets.        
	Indias ambivalence on the challenges that confront the global economy now is jarring for a country that touts the leadership of an economist prime minister. It is also wanting of a nation that aspires the mantle of an economic powerhouse in the 21st century. When finance ministers from all over the world gathered in Washington last month for meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, even as the crisis on Wall Street was seriously hurting markets in Europe and Asia, Indias finance minister was missing from the gathering.               
	His speech that was read out at the meeting was disturbing for its surprising articulation of merely the most obvious. Here is an example. In a reference to the US bailout and actions by other governments, the Indian statement to the IMF said that the impact of these measures will, however, depend upon the contextual appropriateness of the packages and the manner in which they are implemented. How profound!        
	The United Progressive Alliance governments record in foreign and economic policies is one of kowtowing to the US. That is why it will be watched at the Washington summit this week if the prime minister will continue along that road or make a shift that appears not just necessary, but vital. If a showdown occurs between the US and Europe at the summit, where will India stand? And will India go beyond being no more than a spectator within the smaller group at the summit that represents the aspirations of people from the emerging economies?        
	Frances economy minister, Christine Lagarde, said during a break in the So Paulo deliberations that looking ahead at the Washington summit, we see friction between Anglo-Saxon capitalism on the one hand and the European-style capitalism on the other hand . On the Anglo-Saxon side the balance is more toward letting the market rules play out and the European side probably has a big concern about regulation.        
	It may be difficult for the prime minister to admit that at the core of the current global economic meltdown are policies that he has championed in public for 17 years. But he could take a leaf out of Sarkozys book if he wants to modulate those policies to meet todays challenges. Until recently, the French president was known as Sarko, the American for his blind admiration for the US. But the Wall Street crisis has opened his eyes. He certainly does not love Bush any more, if he did at all. Sarkozys moment of revelation also offers a chance for Singh to redeem himself for putting his foot in his mouth in September.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ways to Arrest the Rot Within
                                                                                                                 WAYS TO ARREST THE ROT WITHIN                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Will the finance minister make a correction and bring the really desperate farmers, who own a little more than two hectares of agricultural land, within the purview of the loan waiver scheme announced in this budget? Or, will Sharad Pawar succeed in undermining the strong pro-Congress base in Vidarbha in an effort to build his strength there? From what meets the eye, the Nationalist Congress Party seems to be distancing itself from the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance, deliberately spreading the message that the agriculture minister is the one who needs to be saluted for the Rs 60,000 crore loan waiver and not the Congress leadership at the Centre! This is a predictable strategy of the shrewd leadership of smaller parties, hungry for increasing their power within the ruling coalition by using the apparent weaknesses of the larger, politically-lethargic partners like the Congress.        
	Once the nuclear deal is signed, will the Congress recommend the dissolution of parliament and head for the hustings? Frankly, if it wants to return to the treasury benches, it had better garner its energy, intellectual wherewithal, and seek a remedy for its failing organization. It ought to remove the moribund lot from critical decision-making positions, and go for the kill. Otherwise, it will be reduced to a minority party in a future coalition.                 
	Reach out        
	Rahul Gandhi should rebel, discard the baggage and take energetic political and structural risks as he goes along experiencing, for himself, the realities of the Indian subcontinent, and its many contradictions. He has nothing whatsoever to lose. To allow an opportunity of this scale to pass him by would be suicidal, in political terms.        
	Reach-out-and-engage is the prime need of the hour. If the pot-bellied, ageing stalwarts of the Congress suggest otherwise, they are doing so because they know their self-serving game will be exposed. A break away from the Janardhan Dwivedis, the Ahmed Patels and the other old Turks can help rejuvenate the party. If the risk fails, so be it. That is what political mobility is about. By not taking the necessary risks, which can only reinforce the status quo, and by allowing the termites to nibble furiously at the base, the Congress will destroy itself.         
	The news filtering in from the foot soldiers in the hinterland is that the Bharatiya Janata Party is quite unwell and not presently in a condition to pull off a victory and replace the Congress at the Centre. However, the Congress is inactive because it continues to nurture the enemies within its larger family.                 
	Retirement benefits        
	The party, as a result, has created a fortification so strong that it has led to the isolation of the decision-makers and their intellectual debilitation. This has compelled the party to abdicate its political and societal space to a lower order. A change of alliance will not arrest this decline. Only an internal purge will allow for a clean, fresh relaunch.        
	It is rumoured that Arjun Singh does not want to move out of Delhi to Mumbai because he is ill and needs doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to be on call, and that if he is made to move it may lead to a further decline in his health. Why, then, doesnt he retire gracefully, spend time with his grandchildren, write his memoirs, let go and make way for the young? When will these aged men and women give up their gaddis?         
	The Congress is caught in a demeaning reality  scheming enemies in the periphery, and the sanctum occupied by aged, defeated men and women who hold on to the reins. Will someone grab the opportunity and run to the finishing line?

	Shakila is no stranger to markets. Her public life, as it were, started in early childhood, in the Taltola vegetable market in Calcutta, where she would come every day from her South-24-Parganas village with her mother to sell vegetables and eggs, and to go to school for a while, and after she dropped out, to sell the paper-packets she made at home. Then, with her first solo exhibition in 1991, and the acclaim that followed and has been growing steadily since then, she has moved on to another kind of market. She has survived and grown in the latter, quietly and cannily, and is now a contemporary artist who shows her work to urban, cosmopolitan viewers. She has restored to collage the power to disturb and defamiliarize that it had briefly come to stand for in Modernist Europe. But her way of doing so was, and remains, unique and inimitable, with a sort of natural and necessary indifference to her European predecessors. Yet her exposure to high as well as popular art through the media and through travelling, going to exhibitions and looking at catalogues must be extensive.        
	The remarkable story of Shakilas journey from one market to the other, or rather of her movement between them, seems initially to fall away when one starts looking at the collages, installations and sketches in Untitled and more (CIMA, until August 9). The jagged brilliance of coloured or printed shreds of paper densely stuck on canvas, or pulped into human and animal shapes, engages the eye as well as the mind. The first look, from a distance, takes in the ordered disorder of her collage. It is most often figurative, confronting us with a story or tableau from everyday life or fantasy. And then, as we move closer to look at the units of torn paper making up the scene, we fleetingly recognize body parts (navel, nipple, nostril, cleavage, skin), hair, stubble, eyebrows and clothing and strangely glowing colour-shapes, ripped apart and then closely stuck together.        
	Her raw materials are mostly film posters (although she hardly ever goes to the cinema). So before she had ripped them into little shapes, these body-parts had belonged to blown-up, larger-than-life human figures. This creates a peculiar disorientation of scale  a turbulence in the eye that is often violent and erotic at the same time  as we take in the small shapes torn out of gigantic bodies from one visual universe, and then work out how she puts them together to create another set of figures that are often quite large and form an entirely different world of images. From among these ripped bodies, bits of printed language stare out like the eyes of dead fish  Mitsubishi Motors, The New Ericsson GF 788, Heist  emptied of meaning and made grist to the mill of a radically different language. The grills of bamboo on the cottage-windows in Domestic Chores (1995) are done with what must have been a picture of the spines of a row of expensive leather-bound volumes, like the Encyclopaedia Britannica. We also see these volumes making up the little hillocks behind the house around which there are children and dogs playing and women washing clothes and cooking.        
	If Shakilas art of collage had remained confined to these little shocks of incongruity, then there would have been sentimental and right-minded resolutions to the complexity of viewing her art. But her work perpetually eludes the conscience of her viewers. In this show, an early work like Domestic Chores hangs next to huge canvases that use collage to create dazzlingly abstract compositions, which trap the eye among shapes, colours and lines coming together in an almost painful chaos of forms. What must have been human figures dressed in bright yellow clothes with red borders are cut up and put together as a canvas densely strewn with culled chickens. This kind of abstraction also shades into a gentler landscape or waterscape, in which textured blue-green, grey and silver paper-elements form rectangles within rectangles to suggest the play of light in moving water  moving, yet caught in an eddy of rectangles with two black snakes suspended in it (picture).        
	Female snake-charmers are a recurring motif in Untitled, as are powerfully tender human figures rescuing vulnerable creatures from catastrophic peril, the colours of which glow and burn in the fire of a private melodrama. But the figure that becomes a signature motif in this show is that of the feeder of birds, a genially bespectacled Indian St Francis, around whom the visual Babel of the modern city clears a luminous space of loving-kindness. The story of creative nourishment and inspiration in Shakilas life centres around her extraordinary relationship with the elderly artist, statistician and habitual feeder of pigeons, B.R. Panesar, who had first spotted her gift in the Taltola market and nurtured it to independent creativity. And it is difficult not to see this recurring image of the bird-feeder as her way of working through this bond with Panesar.        
	It is significant that the few titles one finds in Untitled and more are all curatorial, and not Shakilas own. The eponymous and more in Shakilas art comes then from somewhere else. Hence the drama, and the challenge, of her art will always reside at the shifting and problematic interface between the rural artist and the urban viewer  even as she keeps tearing into, in order to recreate in her own terms, the papery stuff of such differences.

	Serial killers and serendipity            
	Sri Lanka: A Land in Search of Itself (National Book Trust, Rs 50) by Mohan K. Tikku begins with a quote from Marco Polos writings where he calls Sri Lanka (or Ceylon, as it was known in Marco Polos time) the finest island of its size in the world. An interesting observation of the author about the strife-torn island-nation is: It must be part of the Sri Lankan paradox that the worlds most famous futurist [Arthur C. Clarke] should find his home in a society that has been at war with itself, and in a sense, with its past. The slim book does not go into political or cultural theories, or historical debates, but gives a picture of the country taking into account its rich history, cultural moorings and the contradictory forces pulling at its socio-political fabric. The authors liberal use of references from Western travellers and writers raises the readability-quotient of the book, which suffers in parts because of careless editing.                        
	The Trophy Taker (Avon, Rs 225) by Lee Weeks is the authors first novel, and introduces Detective Inspector Johnny Mann. A serial killer with a particular liking for Caucasian women and mutilation arts is on the prowl in post-colonial Hong Kong. One of the victims turns out to be Manns lover, Helen, making him more determined than ever to pin down the killer. In the process, he gets to save the beautifully vulnerable Georgina Johnson, and learns that there are many roads to justice.                                
	Weed (IndiaInk, Rs 195) by Paro Anand is the eighteenth book by the author, who is also credited with helping children make the worlds longest newspaper in thirteen languages in eleven different states in India. Weed is the story of Umer, whose father goes to join the jihadis, while his mother is left to cope with poverty, dwindling resources and the ever-present shadow of terrorism. There is, however, nothing terribly original in the plot or attractive in the narrative style. The ending, where an old shikara-owner seems to solve all their problems with one swish of a wand, is too pat.                        
	How to retire Happy, Wild, and Free (Macmillan, Rs 295) by Ernie J. Zelinski provides retirement wisdom that you wont get from your financial advisor. The advises range from move to a college town to plant your get-a-life tree and watch it grow and grow. But the real enjoyment comes from the cartoons, and quotes such as, the time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.

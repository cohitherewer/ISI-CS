The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Revving it up in the gathering gloom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       REVVING IT UP IN THE GATHERING GLOOM                                  WELL LEFT                                            
	I have no feelings for cricket, and know nothing about the game. Nor does it figure in my fondness for, and exasperation with, India or England. So I went to the Eden Gardens on Sunday afternoon purely out of a fascination with spectacle, to watch people watching a spectacle. Besides, arent journalists supposed to have a finger on the pulse of their times? It was this half-serious mix of curiosity and scruple that made me watch Om Shanti Om (twice) and visit the South City Mall, both of which ended up being a lot of fun  and epiphanic too, each in its own way. I will never forget the lone, giant lobster in the South-City Spencers fish-tank dolefully watching the Poila Boishakh fashion-show that the stampede had carried me into. The girls were sashaying in front of the empty fish-tanks to a remix version of Tagores Pagla haoar badal-dine.        
	What I hadnt expected at Eden was the dismal feeling rising up from the guts as my eye settled into its rhythm of moving between field and stands. The gap between the hype and the real thing, the ads and the event, is often entertaining in itself, though different from the entertainment promised. But sometimes, it can be strangely unfunny. I was struck by how tiny and indistinguishable from one another, and therefore punily uniform, the players looked  all the kings, princes, tigers, riders and chargers. Distance is a great leveller. So the aura of larger-than-life heroism (Hollywood gladiator and Hells Angel, Ben Hur and Mad Max, all in one), with the Dolby-Surround of their grim-set jaws and old-gold helmets, quickly began to look fake, tacky and absurd. The only things that were larger-than-life about these little men were their auction prices.        
	So much of the pitch of this event was purely acoustic: the deafeningly amplified bits from filmi hits tagged to the fours and sixers and outs, setting the cheerleaders off into a flurry of sweaty flailing. The music would stop as abruptly as it came on, with the girls still flailing about catatonically in the sudden silence. The policemen in our stands rushed forward every time they started dancing, and clicked away eagerly on their camera-phones. I thought again of the lobster at the fashion-show when I saw a row of policemens heads straining against the fence to get a closer look at the cheerleaders sitting with their semi-bare backs to the gallery. The parallel rows of fair backs and helmeted heads would have made a lovely photograph.        
	At one point, the tier above us started unfolding downwards a huge, grimy and somewhat tattered tiranga, and the people at our level were instantly furious at their view being blocked by it. There followed a mad, vertical tug-of-war between the two tiers, at the end of which the flag was wrested away by our tier, bundled up and thrown away. And that was the end of the single patriotic episode of the day.        
	Then my friend excitedly pointed out to me a tall, morose-looking man sitting a few rows ahead, who makes her blouses and whose shop on Rashbehari Avenue has a distinguished female clientele. I was just beginning to imagine this quixotic-looking gentleman discreetly measuring the ladies, when suddenly a slovenly young boy carrying a plateful of drippy food in each hand dropped all of it on a man sitting just below where the boy had stopped in his tracks to watch the cheerleaders flail. His victim abstractedly took off his messed-up T-shirt and resumed watching the cheerleaders.        
	I am ashamed to admit that I left before the great blackout number. The drearily neon-lit nether regions of the stands, by that time, were filthy, smelly and waterless. A desperately thirsty crowd was milling about the empty water-stalls looking flushed and crazed, as if about to break into a riot. The chicken biryani and meat-rolls looked like a cruel joke.        
	It struck me on my way out that the success of trash entertainment depends entirely on the skilful use of state-of-the-art technology. Even Shah Rukh Khan, at his most frenetically entertaining, the veins on his straining neck about to burst, could not quite manage to reverse the gravitational pull of this citys dysfunctionality.         
	But a huge moon was high up in the sky. It looked down on the still-blazing floodlights that were making the leaves of the neem trees outside look like shattered crystal. Another lovely photograph.                    AVEEK SEN

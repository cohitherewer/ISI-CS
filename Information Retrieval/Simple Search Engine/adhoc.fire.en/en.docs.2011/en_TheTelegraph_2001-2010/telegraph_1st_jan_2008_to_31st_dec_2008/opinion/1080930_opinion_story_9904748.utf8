	A sigh of relief rather than a note of triumphalism is the adequate response to the Left Fronts decision to issue a key licence to the German wholesaler, Metro Cash amp; Carry. The background to the granting of the licence is perhaps more significant than the decision itself. This is a shotgun licence in many senses. It was only after the German company threatened to withdraw from West Bengal and announced a deadline that the government and the chief minister sat up with a jolt. Before that, the Forward Bloc, a member of the Left Front, had steadfastly refused to grant the required licence. When the chief minister intervened in favour of the German company, the Forward Bloc declared that it would exit from the Front. It required a longish meeting of the Left Front to resolve the matter. The resolution is, however, not without conditions, and these are yet to be announced. Moreover, the meeting of the Left Front also announced that henceforth all foreign investments in retail trade concerning farm products will have to be decided separately and case by case within the Left Front.        
	This last clause is a virtual admission that the Left Front does not have a policy on foreign investments in retail trade. But the fact of the matter is that there exists a national policy in this regard. Why should West Bengal be subject to different clauses and conditions? Is this any way to attract investments, especially foreign ones, to the state? The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, should make up his mind about whether he is in favour of liberalization or not. This cannot be something on which he will take an ad hoc view depending on expediency. He may be justified in feeling that he has acted as a chief minister by forcing the hands of the Forward Bloc. But the more critical question is why the Forward Bloc was allowed to behave in the manner that it did. Obviously, the necessary enabling conditions for foreign investments in the retail of agricultural produce were not set forth very clearly. It is clear now that Mr Bhattacharjee allows a crisis to descend upon him before he chooses to act. This cannot be the determining feature of a political leader. On the contrary, it displays a certain lack of purpose. For the nonce, the investment climate of the state has had a very narrow escape. Fortune may not favour a dithering government every time in the future.

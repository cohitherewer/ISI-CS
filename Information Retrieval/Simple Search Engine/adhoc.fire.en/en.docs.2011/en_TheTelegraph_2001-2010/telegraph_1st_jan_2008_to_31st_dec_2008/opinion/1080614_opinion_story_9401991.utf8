	The 10th annual cultural programme by students of the Southern School of Music was held at Madhusudan Mancha on June 10. A tribute to the ambition and ingenuity of the founder-principal, Sujit Sarkar, the programme boasted additional instrumental items this year.         
	The opening violin trio was played distinctly off-key and ably accompanied by nine-year-old Pramit Sarkar. A second violin trio, by slightly older students, presented a gavotte by J.S. Bach. This was followed by a 27-piece violin ensemble, which included two cellos, playing a long-drawn-out Vande Mataram, an early American folk suite (very nice if a bit too slow), the Hungarian Dance No. 4 with all the repeats, and finally a startling rendition of Mozarts Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.        
	Among the pianists, outstanding performances came from Alistair Quadra and Pramit Sarkar. Both Quadra and Sarkar play with confidence and panache. Though not yet in their teens, they are aware of the musical content of the works they present.        
	The senior section had fewer pianists  just four  all of whom drew from the present examination repertoire no higher than Grade Five. Pramit Sarkar represented the senior violin section with a neat rendition of Elgars Salut dAmour and Kramers Cossack Dance with its fearsomely impressive cadenza, accompanied by Avijit Kundu. Guest performers included pianists Oishik Ganguly, Naima Haque and Gaurab Datta.        
	I can hardly not mention the ubiquitous electric keyboard at each of these annual concerts. Each of the 11 performers came up, took his or her position at this instrument  prominently placed up stage  spent a few critical seconds pressing relevant buttons that got started the rhythm and key of choice, enhancing  correctly or incorrectly  a simplistic melody played with one hand. The bland and dispassionate expression on the faces of these students displayed the intensity of their musical commitment. The teaching of this instrument is gaining popularity in most musical institutions as it is a medium that requires not much expertise or discipline, and produces, at an early stage, results that may satisfy the uncritical ear of a fond parent.        
	The overall ambience was one of happy participation, especially among the diminutive violinists busily and importantly running around and playing in the orchestra with the most ardent concentration (if not accuracy). The rusty, rented Rachals grand piano with its eccentric action and high sustaining pedal (which caused the little ones to almost stand on the pedal) should not be used at these events any more. Since Madhusudan Mancha has feeble acoustics the sound was muffled or lost most of the time.         
	The evening ended with a delightful mini-recital by the young veteran pianist, Avijit Kundu. Principal Sujit Sarkar must be commended for his time management and for improving the quality of the programme from the preceding years.

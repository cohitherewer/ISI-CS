	Politics over economics                  
	Sir  I agree with Amartya Sen when he says that West Bengal badly needs industries and new employment and income earning opportunities (Huge price of street politics, Sept 20). But trampling on basic democratic values and human rights of the people is hardly the way to go about getting industrialized. The main problems with Singur have always been the lack of transparency in the governments deal with Tata Motors, and its highhanded, arbitrary way of getting landowners to sign on the dotted line. Sen himself says that it would have been much better to buy the land... rather than acquiring it. But Sens words are no good, since the government is yet to admit its mistake. The new compensation offer made by the government is much more reasonable, according to Sen, but the fact that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government did not offer it in the beginning indicates that it was Mamata Banerjees agitation that made it rethink.           
	If Nandigram has ignited Khammam and Noida, Singur is likely to inspire more Singurs. The economic loss from the withdrawal of...the Tatas and the ancillary producers will no doubt send a negative message to prospective investors in India, but letting Singur go without a protest would have set a dangerous precedent throughout the country.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Amartya Sen makes several important points, but he does not mention that the government and the Opposition in West Bengal are two sides of the same coin. Sen has also expressed his views on Singur earlier and recommended certain actions for the government, but the latter felt no need whatsoever to review its policies, and neither did the Opposition. Needless to say, the poor farmers get caught in the political imbroglio.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

      
	Sir  Does anyone in Bengal take Mamata Banerjee seriously any more? It would have been easier to indulge her as one does a child had it not been for her rather large ego. Every other day, she accuses Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of being undemocratic, but she herself has thrown every democratic norm out of the window, ignoring the opinions of Amartya sen, M.S. Swaminathan, Pranab Mukherjee, and even that of the Singur farmer who feels that the Tatas will be good for him.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anjan Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As a Nobel laureate and a wise man, Amartya Sen has given excellent counsel to the parties involved in Singur  and to the people of West Bengal in general  through his letter to the editor of The Telegraph. The arguments forwarded by him in favour of the Tata project in Singur are realistic and not romantic. It is in Mamata Banerjees interests to proceed along the path suggested by Sen. More important, the government of West Bengal should admit that it has landed itself into the present crisis.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Hashim, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The economics of Amartya Sen has no place in Singur. The 997 acres there are now the site of a royal tussle between the Big Brother (dada) and the Big Sister (didi). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) of the Big Brother wanted to give itself a facelift using the Nano project. The Trinamul Congress of didi, as responsible Opposition, has merely been doing its duty of putting a spanner in the ruling partys works. It is not agriculture or industry or peoples welfare which is the concern of these parties. None of them is interested in anything other than spoiling the feast of the other.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Basu, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The new compensation package offered by the government to Singurs farmers is more reasonable than the earlier one, feels Amartya Sen. I have three questions in response to this observation. First, why did the government need a bloody agitation before it made the offer? Second, why did it grossly underestimate the bargaining power of individual farmers, compelling them to regroup? And third, would this radically revised offer not encourage other groups to choose agitation as the means to reach their goals?           
	If the Tatas do not pull out ultimately, then they too should reward the locals a little more by laying out more jobs and benefits for them. And last but not the least, I feel that it is in bad taste for the governments of other states to dangle carrots before the Tatas and try to influence their decision to relocate away from Singur.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Chander Parkash Kapur, Siliguri

                
	Sir  No one in his right mind would contest Amartya Sens view that the Singur project was basically sound, and that West Bengal badly needs industries. But the bone of contention is not the fundamentals of the project but the principles of land acquisition involved. The project was not a public service one, such as road or railways, and yet, the method of giving land to the Tatas was reminiscent of the old saying of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Unlike Robin Hood, the government was robbing the poor to pay the rich. Sen also has little reason to think that the project needed to be near a big city, that is Calcutta. The Tatas own car plant in Pantnagar proves otherwise. To say that our prosperity is no longer grounded in agriculture is to forget that a heavily industrialized Maharashtra has a poverty level of over 31.57 per cent. In an agrarian society, it is still the success of agriculture and agro-based industry that can bring down poverty levels.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 STREET  LEGAL                      
	Extra time
    In a case concerning dowry demand and Section 498, the Supreme Court has held that it is unjustified to quash a complaint merely because there was a delay of six months in lodging it. The apex court pointed out that in this particular case, the high court should have considered that efforts were being made for an amicable settlement when the incident occurred. If a complaint had been lodged at that time, it would have ruined any chances of a reconciliation. The complaint was made only after all reconciliation efforts fell through (Pratibha vs Rameshwari Devi).  
	A crime that never was  
	Three men were arrested for murder on the basis of alleged confessional statements. They were charge sheeted and released after eight months when it was found that the charges were false and fabricated. The offence was never committed and the alleged murder victim mdash; a girl mdash; was, in fact, alive and well. Departmental proceedings were initiated against the erring officers and they lost two increments. Unhappy with the punishment, the three victims lodged a case against the policemen. The Patna High Court awarded Rs 1 lakh as compensation to each of the three victims, to be paid by the state. The court held that the punishment meted out by the police department was insufficient for the grave crime they committed, namely the violation of the Right to Life and Liberty of the three petitioners (Mahesh Ram and others vs State of Bihar).  
	Second best  
	The Delhi High Court has ruled that the ldquo;second wife rdquo; should be treated as a legally wedded wife and is entitled to maintenance although the marriage is void. In this case, the woman had run the household for 14 years and had taken care of the husband as well as their two children before being deserted.The court held that had the intention of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act been to deny maintenance to the second wife then it would not have distinguished between wife and concubine. The Act entitles the wife to live separately without forfeiting her right to maintenance if the husband resides with a concubine (Narinder Pal Kaur Chawla vs Manjeet Singh Chawla).				       SOLON

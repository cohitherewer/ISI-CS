	The Nazi leader Goebbels, was fond of saying that every time he heard the word culture, he felt for his gun. The idea of culture inevitably summons up its Other: at worst barbarism, at best, philistinism. Some of the worlds worst tyrants have had a fondness for things cultural. Adolf Hitler, 20th centurys evil personified, loved listening to Wagner. V.I. Lenin, who killed a few men and women in his dream to set up a communist society in Russia, once remarked that he had stopped listening to Beethovens music, which he had once adored, because it had made him feel soft and tender and thus reduced his revolutionary zeal. The most memorable example of the co-existence of barbarism and the love for culture is, of course, that of the Roman emperor, Nero (AD 54-68). It is said that when a great fire engulfed Rome in AD 64, Nero amused himself, in the words of the great historian Edward Gibbon, with singing to his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy. Another grotesque example of the coming together of culture and disaster is when the maker of the first atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer, recited verses from the Bhagavad Gita as he watched the first bomb exploding over the desert in Los Alamos. Compared to these instances the picture of Mamata Banerjee dabbing paint on canvas while the fate of West Bengal hangs on her blockade is indeed small beer.        
	There are occasions when major calamities provide rare opportunities for cultural advancement. Just as the Normandy landings started to recover Europe from Nazi occupation, a powerful group of statesmen met at Bretton Woods, in New Hampshire, in the United States. John Maynard Keynes, who was a key figure in the Bretton Woods negotiations, used the meeting to persuade commissars from the Soviet Union to send the Bolshoi Ballet over to Covent Garden once the war was over. His efforts bore fruit, but not as fast as Keynes would have liked, since the Russians feared defections. It might, at first sight, seem odd that as sombre a gathering as an international conference convened to discuss the prospects of peace should be used by as important a figure as Keynes for cultural advancement. But a genuine lover of culture, like the skilful politician, maximizes every opportunity. Keynes was a past master of the art. On another occasion, while waiting for the King in the House of Lords, he snatched a conversation with Lord Lytton to ensure the move of the Sadler Wells ballet to Covent Garden.        
	Just as a thin line is said to separate profundity and insanity, culture and disaster or barbarism often exist cheek by jowl. This is perhaps one reason why disaster produces great works of art. Witness Picassos Guernica. But philistinism could precede disaster. It is not difficult to construe what disaster lurks behind the flowers that the prima donna of West Bengal attempted to paint.

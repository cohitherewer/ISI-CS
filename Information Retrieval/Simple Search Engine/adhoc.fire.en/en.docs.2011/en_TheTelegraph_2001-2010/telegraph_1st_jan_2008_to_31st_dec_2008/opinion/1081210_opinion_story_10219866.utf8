	On a lighter note?                  
	Sir  It appears from Debashis Bhattacharyyas tte  tte with Mir that filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh has made Mir famous, albeit unwittingly (I dont think I am doing anything illegal. If he (Ghosh) feels that way, he should take it up, Dec 7). Prior to that fateful episode of Ghoshs talk show on a private television channel, where the filmmaker stooped low enough to vent his anger against Mir, the latter, though popular with certain sections of the people, was a bad joker at his best. I remember watching Mir in a laughter challenge contest on a Hindi entertainment channel. There, he tried a funny take on the subject of communal harmony and national integration, but failed miserably. He could not make even a single person laugh.           
	But no matter how debatable are Mirs skills as an entertainer, it has to be acknowledged that his mimicry of Ghosh is almost perfect. And mimicry is an old form of art, although whether it is to be ranked high or low in the order of merit is a matter of individual taste. Ghosh feels that mimicry is an inferior form of art, and Mir claims to have felt insulted by this judgement. The debate will continue, and as long as it does, Mir will be getting more media attention than he got before. However cantankerous Ghoshs talk with Mir might have been, it might just give Mirs career a boost.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Debashis Bhattacharyyas interview with Mir was a treat. Mir had reacted in a sober manner to the unwarranted outbursts of Rituparno Ghosh. However, I have serious objections to the way Bhattacharyya describes Ghoshs flare-up in his show. He says, Rituparno Ghosh ripped into him [Mir] in his television talk show last month..., and tore his mimicry to shreds. This is far from the truth. Honestly speaking, Ghoshs objection was tantamount to attempted censorship. I shudder to think that it is men like Ghosh, the so-called intellectuals, who fight for the artistic freedom of M.F. Husain but would not tolerate mimicry if they are its subjects. What difference does Ghosh have then with the Togadias and the Khomeinis of this world? In criticizing Mir unfairly, Ghosh was behaving like any other bigot who tries to restrict civil rights to protect his or her own interests.           
	Mimicry is a recognized art form practised by artists all over the world. It criticizes society but makes the censure palatable by tempering it with humour. Ghosh had no business labelling it as an inferior form of art. Mir has every right to earn his bread through mimicry and nobody can condemn him for that. Ghosh was wrong all the way to caste aspersions on Mir after having invited him on his show. If Ghosh had some sense of decency, he would not have been rude with his talk show guest.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I had booked tickets in the AC chair car section of the Jan Shatabdi Express for December 3. I was scheduled to travel from Guwahati to Hojai to attend a marriage with my family consisting of my wife, our two young children, and my elderly mother-in-law. Before the train was scheduled to reach Hojai, we proceeded towards the nearest exit with the luggage. When the train stopped, there was no platform on either side. I thought that the train was waiting for the lines to clear and on getting the signal would enter the station. So we waited inside the train. After two minutes, the train started moving again. The TTE approached me and inquired why we did not get down. He explained that there being only one platform at Hojai and a train already being stationed there usually, it is normal practice for the Jan Shatabdi to halt at a place that does not have a platform. When the platform does not come below the steps of the train compartment, one has to jump about 3 or 4 feet to the ground level. I had no clue as to how to take that plunge with elderly ladies, children and the luggage. While I was having a debate with the TTE, the train picked up full speed. Most of our co-passengers asked the TTE to stop the train for a few moments at the next station, Lanka, to help us get off. But the TTE could do nothing, as he had no communication device with him. Things came to such a head that I pulled the chain to stop the train but still it did not stop. Finally, we got off the train at Lumding. We had to take the next passenger train from Lumding to Hojai and reached the place in the evening when the marriage party was almost over.          
	My experience raises a few questions. First, can a train halt at a station without touching the platform? Second, can passengers be asked to get down in such a dangerous manner? Third, should not a TTE possess devices to communicate with the driver? If he doesnt have any, what will happen in case of a terror strike? Fourth, what is the use of having a chain for stopping the train if it is dysfunctional?           
	Yours faithfully,

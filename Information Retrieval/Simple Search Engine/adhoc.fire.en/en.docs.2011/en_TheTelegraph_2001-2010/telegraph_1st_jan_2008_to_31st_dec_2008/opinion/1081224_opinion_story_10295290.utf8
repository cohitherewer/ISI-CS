The insurance company opposed the couples claim for compensation on grounds of contributory negligence as there was more than one pillion rider. The Motor Accident Claim Tribunal did not grant the full amount, also citing contributory negligence. The victims went to the Kerala High Court. The court cited a Supreme Court judgement that had directed the payment of a third party compensation in a case where a vehicle had carried more than the permissible number of passen-gers. And so, while contributory negligence was held to be 25 per cent in the present instance, the company was directed to pay the remaining 75 per cent along with interest.

    The Kerala Municipality Act provides that buildings recognised by the government or registered with the municipality, owned and occupied by educational institutions and used for teaching, along with libraries, should be exempt from property tax. A person who was the owner of one such building also ran an industrial training centre, for which property tax was demanded. The owner filed a petition. The municipality said that institutions and not individuals could be exempted. The Kerala High Court upheld the owners plea, holding that the intention of the statute was to exempt buildings used as educational institutions. Denying exemption to a proprietary concern while granting the same to an institution would be discriminatory. (Usha P. Panicker vs State of Kerala)            Right direction 
    While granting licences to shops in a railway station, the railway authorities made it mandatory that mineral water of only the brands stocked by the railways catering unit could be sold and that they had to be purchased from the railways unit. Some shop-owners petitioned against the directive. The Madras High Court held that while the authorities could direct the licensees to sell quality mineral water, they could not insist that only the brands available in their store would be on offer. The court held that the restraint would violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which ensures the right to practise any profession, trade or business.

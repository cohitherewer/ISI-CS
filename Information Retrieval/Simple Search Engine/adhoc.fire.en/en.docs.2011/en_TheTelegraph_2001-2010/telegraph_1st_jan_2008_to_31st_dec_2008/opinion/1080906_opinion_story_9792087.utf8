                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE ELUSIVE MOOD                               Music      Sreyashi Dastidar                                                
	The three-day Rabindrasangeet conference organized by Dakshinee on August 22, 23 and 24 began with songs arranged in taals created by Tagore. They made for a bad start. Most of the singers were ill at ease with Tagores metrical innovations. Besides going off-key at a few places, Pubali Debnath, in her attempt to keep pace with a fast Shashthi, made Nidrahara raater e gaan sound flat. The same taal, turned on its head and slowed down significantly, had Srovonti Bandyopadhyay scampering to get the arithmetic right in Hriday amar prakash holo. She is probably used to singing the song in free rhythm. The same conjecture goes for Arpita Ray who sang Era par-ke apon kore in Khemta.         
	Biswarup Rudras Kanpichhe deho-lata and Arindam Bandyopadhyays Duwar mor patho-pashe were considerable improvements. Alak Roychowdhurys command over Nabapanchataal in Janani tomar korun charankhani had much that the younger artists could learn from. Alakananda Ray sounded promising. Shekhar Guptas keertan-style Majhe majhe taba dekha pai and the Tagorean Shyamasangeet, Ami shudhu roinu baki, were two of the best offerings of the first session.         
	The second evenings surprise was the inclusion of Rinki Ganguly, possibly a last-minute replacement for Subhasree Ray. One wonders about the reasons behind the choice, though the singer performed reasonably within her limitations. Shamik Pal and Aniruddha Singha impressed with their old-school gayaki and expansive voices. Among the women, Dakshinee alumni Aditi Gupta, Sudeshna Mitra and Kamalini Mukhopadhyay gave sincere performances. Veteran Pramita Mullick took two widely different songs, the folkish Amar sonar Bangla and Sukhaheen nishidin with its Carnatic elements, and sang both with equal mastery. The pick of the evening, however, was Rajasree Bhattacharya (picture right). She managed to keep the audience riveted to two of Tagores compositions considered easy and heard all too often  Purano shei diner katha and Tomar holo shuru amar holo shara. While the keyboard accompaniment jelled well with her songs, the real reason behind the use of this instrument on the second evening only was probably the presence of the two modern singers, Monomoy Bhattacharya and Srikanto Acharya.        
	The final session began with promise, thanks to the consistent Anindya Narayan Biswas and the spirited Supratik Das. It ended with the assurance that as long as there were custodians of the calibre of Ashis Bhattacharjee and Rano Guhathakurta, Rabindrasangeet would not be an endangered art form. In between, there was Saikat Shekhareswar Ray (picture left), who gave a near-perfect rendition of two songs of the anushthanik section, Shubhadine eshechhe donhe and Shamukhe shanti-parabar. Rachaita Ray was another singer who caught the mood of the Bhanusinher Padabali songs without being overtly mindful of the percussions.

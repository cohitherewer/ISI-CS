	Its perhaps the most famous one-liner mouthed by cops in movies, especially those of the Bollywood kind. Youre under arrest! The Hollywood types generally throw in a couple of lines more, while pinning people down on the sidewalk, which generally have to do with the right to an attorney or to remain silent. But what exactly constitutes an arrest? And what can you do if you do happen to be arrested? 
    Q.How is an arrest made?
   A.Going by its legal definition, an arrest is only complete after a police officer or another person actually touches and confines the body of the person to be arrested. That apart, an arrest can also be completed if the accused person submits himself to police custody either verbally or in writing, agreeing to turn himself in within a specified period of time. The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) says that if a person resists arrest forcibly, the arresting authority is allowed to use all means necessary to effect the arrest.               
	Q.Who is authorised to make an arrest?         
	A.Our laws say that only an investigating police officer of or above the rank of a sub-inspector is authorised to make an arrest. Nonetheless, an investigating officer can ask a subordinate officer to arrest an accused, by empowering him to exact the arrest through a specific order in writing. However, this point is open to interpretation. If an ordinary constable happens to be at a scene of crime where he takes cognisance of the offence committed, he is well within his rights to conduct an arrest, without instructions from his superiors, says former top cop and police reforms expert G.P. Joshi.         
	Interestingly, non-police personnel  which include common citizens  are also empowered by the CrPC to make an arrest in the absence of policemen if a situation so arises. In that case, the arrester must, without delay, take such [a] person or cause him to be taken in custody to the nearest police station, states the law.         
	Legally, all citizens of the country are empowered to make this kind of arrest. For example, if commoners see a robber on the run, they can confine him and turn him in at the nearest police station. Going by the CrPC, that is termed an arrest.               
	Q.Are there any special provisions for the arrest of women and children?        
	A.In the case of women, any police officer can exact an arrest. However, if an arrest through physical force is anticipated, the arresting officer should ideally be accompanied by women constables. Besides, going by law, women cant be arrested at night, and should be kept in separate cells during confinement. They also have the right to be interrogated at home, instead of at the police station.         
	Children are technically not arrested. They are taken into custody and shifted to remand homes. Again, any police officer can exact this arrest.               
	Q.Is a warrant from the court necessary for a police officer to make an arrest?         
	A.No. People accused or suspected of committing cognisable offences, proclaimed offenders, those in possession of illegal or stolen goods, people who obstruct policemen from carrying out their duties, and suspected deserters from the armed forces of the country are some of those who can be arrested without a court warrant. However, there is no written rule laying down the exact number of such occasions. In this regard, the police actually reserves wide discretionary powers, says Pushkar Raj, programme officer at the Delhi-based Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. As a preventive measure, an arrest can be carried out based on mere suspicion. However, the unfortunate bit is that the police frequently end up abusing this power for their own interests.                 
	Q.Is any person in India immune from being arrested?         
	A.Technically, no one has total immunity from being arrested. However, serving members of the armed forces cannot be directly arrested by the civilian police force, even if they are accused of committing cognisable offences, says advocate Anant Asthana, a human rights expert with the Human Rights Law Network. Nonetheless, such offenders may be arrested by a member of the military police after being notified by the civilian police.                 
	Q.What rights does an arrested person have?         
	A.Section 50 of the CrPC states that any person arresting another person without a warrant is bound to communicate to the latter the full particulars of the offence for which he or she is arrested. Where a police officer arrests without warrant any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence, he shall inform the person arrested that he is entitled to be released on bail and that he may arrange for sureties on his behalf, the section adds.               
	Q.Can arrested people be searched?         
	A.Yes. According to the law, when a person is arrested with or without a warrant, the arresting authority can search the person and take into custody all articles found on the accused, apart from those worn by him, against the issue of a receipt. If the accused is a woman, the search should be made by another female with strict regard to decency.         
	That apart, an arresting authority also reserves the power to search any premises where an accused person is suspected to be hiding. However, if the premises are occupied by women who ordinarily remain away from the public view, the police  before entering such an apartment  is required to notify them so that they can withdraw from the public view before the police enter the premises.               
	Q.How long can an arrested person be detained?         
	A.Under legislation, and going by the norm of Habeas Corpus, no arrested person can be detained by the police for more than 24 hours. However, if an investigation cant be completed in 24 hours, Section 167 of the CrPC states that an investigating officer has the right to inform the nearest judicial magistrate. The magistrate may from time to time, authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as such magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole, states Section 167.               
	Q.How can a person arrested be discharged?         
	A.Going by legal definition, a person arrested by the police can only be discharged against his own bond, or on bail, or under a magistrates special order. However, if an accused person escapes from police custody during an investigation, the investigating officer can track the accused and arrest him from any part of India.               
	Q.Is there any way in which an accused can stop himself or herself from being taken into custody?         
	A.No. Technically, an arrest can be neither delayed nor deferred. However, one can cite medical problems to avoid going to jail, and instead be taken to a hospital. That way, one is still under arrest but in a place other than a lock-up.         
	That apart, one can request the police to delay his or her confinement, citing other obligations. There is no written rule in this regard, and the police can exercise their own discretion to decide whether or not the request ought to be met with, says Raj.        
	One way to thwart an arrest, however, is to apply for an anticipatory bail, which is a direction by a court of law to release a person on bail, and is issued even before the person can be arrested. Nonetheless, this privilege is extended to people who fear being arrested on false charges, and his reasons for applying for bail must be deemed fit by the court issuing the order.

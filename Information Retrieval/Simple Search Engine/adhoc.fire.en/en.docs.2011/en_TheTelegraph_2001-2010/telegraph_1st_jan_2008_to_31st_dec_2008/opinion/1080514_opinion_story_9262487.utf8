	Falling behind                  
	Sir  It was good to see Samim Ahmed highlight the West Bengal governments apathy towards Muslim education (Secular dilemma, May 6). Muslims make up over 25 per cent of the population of the state that has been governed by the overtly secular Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its allies for the last 31 years. But neither the party nor its illustrious leadership has done anything towards the educational and economic improvement of the minority Muslim community. Muslim youth here have not had any incentive from the government to become good citizens and join the mainstream and compete on equal terms with the rest. I find that it is often difficult to locate primary schools in Muslim-dominated areas. Not only the government, but Muslim social organizations as well should see to it that Muslim children are provided with good primary-level education.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
M.S. Quraishy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I was surprised by the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Boards demand for separate mosques for women (Women seek own mosques, May 7). How can a separate mosque be so important when women in India, and Muslim women in particular, have to deal with exploitation in every walk of life? Muslim clerics need to understand one thing clearly: since women were allowed inside mosques even in the Prophets age, having a separate religious space for women is not a bad idea.           
	But what if the campaign gathers support from all over the world? Will it not take the attention away from other issues that need urgent consideration  womens empowerment through education, rehabilitation and employment opportunities? After all, the Lord can be communicated within the privacy of homes too.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Z. Khan, Pune

                
	No country for good men          
	Sir  Instead of welcoming the governors gesture of switching off the lights in Raj Bhavan for two hours every day, top CPI(M) leaders have hurled abusive remarks at him (Shock treatment, May 8). But their denigrating suggestions that Gopalkrishna Gandhi walk to public functions and let slum-dwellers come and stay in the Raj Bhavan would find few takers. The comrades believe that if the party were to put a person of its choice in the Raj Bhavan, Bengal would progress by leaps and bounds. The people, however, would be hoping that Gandhi completes his full term in office.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Ghose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The people of Bengal are no longer divided into the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Now, you are either a cadre or a common citizen. Staying away from Calcutta has made me aware of this change. The archetypal soft-spoken, intellectual Bengali is now lost amidst the cadre-crowd. I was going home in a cab the other day, when the cab-driver jumped a signal. Amused and surprised, I asked what would happen if he got caught. The driver replied with a straight face, Dada eta Party-r gari aache, ke ki kore nebe (This car belongs to the Party. Who would dare do anything to it)? Events in Nandigram have shown that even the law cannot lay its hands on the party and its supporters. The chief minister, when he was reluctant to shift the book fair from the Maidan, had said, Boi je pollution chhorate pare ta amar jana chilo na (I never knew books could pollute the environment). The similarity in his tone with the cabbie was uncanny. The chief ministers protg, Prasun Mukherjee, brushed aside charges of incompetence after the lights went out at the Eden Gardens with Erokom to onno desheo hoye thake (Things like this happen in other countries too).           
	So, when the governor, who fits very much into the aforementioned description of a Bengali, lodged a symbolic protest against the incessant power cuts in Calcutta, it was not surprising to see Biman Bose react by questioning the need of a governor for the state. Who do we need more  these arrogant cadre babus, or people like Gandhi?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Rahul Kumar Sett, Ahmedabad

                
	Sir  Gandhian principles are followed by only a handful in India, and Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the great mans grandson, would certainly count among them. His mode of passive resistance has had its desired effect. How can cabinet ministers, who have no qualms about using the governments money for their personal expenses, have the gall to criticize the governors action?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tutun Mullick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The power ministry can take Gopalkrishna Gandhis idea to the next level and appeal to individual families to minimize power consumption by switching on the bare necessities (a fan during the day and a fan and CFL lights after sunset) during peak hours. This will surely ease the load on the power-supply system, and thus reduce power cuts. Well-meaning citizens would be quite willing to comply. The governor should be thanked for showing us the way.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sumit Majumdar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  West Bengal is passing through a critical phase.On the one hand we have Nandigram, and on the other is the governors residence in darkness. What sort of image of the state are we projecting? A handful of BPOs or a cluster of shopping malls cannot draw the worlds attention away from the true picture of the state.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arijit Chakraborty, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To discover the thread that binds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TO DISCOVER THE THREAD THAT BINDS                              VISUAL ARTS

	Ganges Art Gallery, where eight Calcutta-based artists are holding an exhibition of installations, photographs, sculpture and video titled To All Whom It May Concern (May 17-July 31), may not provide much wall space, but the sharp angles beneath the staircase turn the gallery into an interesting alternative to the white cube.         
	Perhaps this was one of the reasons why the curator, Jayashree Chakravarty, who is also a participating artist, had chosen to hold this exhibition here. The exhibition does not have any other agenda save bringing like-minded practitioners together and embarking on a journey to discover a common link that would unify their works displayed on the three floors. This, Chakravarty feels, is vital for artists working in Calcutta, a city where artists get few crumbs of patronage.         
	While the success of such a project can hardly be measured in negative or positive terms, suffice it to say that about three-quarters of the exhibits jelled very well, creating a cohesive whole in terms of concept, execution and presentation.         
	The exhibition is like a journey, with viewers being encouraged to hold under scrutiny the works on each floor. Instead of beginning at the base  the strongest element in this show  it is perhaps a better idea to begin at the top where photographs and video installations are on display. Jeet Chowdhury, an ad-filmmaker by profession, has exhibited his photographs, all black-and-white digital prints, of a little girl growing up, and of a mini-series on windows. More interesting and perhaps mischievous is a short film he made of a boxwallah who took up photography late in life. Well produced, it nonetheless has the slickness of an ad film.         
	Aditya Basaks forte is drawing and the ability to look at personal realizations and local realities in the perspective of world history, life today and the future. Instead of playing safe, he has put up a video installation. While, in his paintings, he displays a command over the medium, this project is weighed down by prolixity and highfalutin ideas and images.         
	On the second floor, the emphasis is on installations. Paula Sengupta has put up her work on the side facing the windows where the verandah was once located. Sengupta, a competent printmaker, has dug into the history of this building, inspecting the original documents, blowing them up and displaying them in her recreation of a ghost verandah in a typical Bengali household of the Thirties. With its dim lights, gauzy vagueness and blown-up text, this installation transforms the space assigned to it. In another corner of this floor is Tapati Chowdhurys installation with its accretion of tiny boxes, street sounds and wire sculpture of a man. Chowdhury has succeeded in conveying  if only in part  the often stressful experience of being in the midst of a marketplace, both in the literal and metaphorical sense.         
	Chhatrapati Dutta has been experimenting with installation art for a while. He has thrown together so many disparate elements  such as a collection of shippers binoculars and telescopes, the form of a vessel, a da Vinci drawing and a life-size dummy of a naval officer in Western period costume  that it is difficult for the viewer to get the picture, as they say. His monochromatic video of wrestlers projected on an arrangement of earthen plates, on the other hand, stirs the imagination. Instead of making a direct statement or any statement at all, the enigmatic figures can easily communicate with the audience.         
	The ground floor has three artists  the curator herself, sculptor Adip Dutta and Debnath Basu. Walking into the gallery, one is confronted with two objects dangling from the ceiling like billowing skirts, chimneys, a giant squid or even an alien. Chakravarty has made with her own hands these sheets of paper. Inside these funnels, she has painted hundreds of iridescent critters that have moved out of their cracks and crannies, thanks to global warming. As the viewer steps into these funnels and light seeps through the layered paper, glopaint occasionally catches the light and the pests look as if they are on the march.         
	Duttas child confronting an aeroplane that could be a giant insect (picture) triggers a conversation involving the three participants on this floor. The aircraft is covered with shining stainless steel wool while the child in armour raises its arms at the malevolent toy. Basu speaks in a gentle voice that blends with the mellow tones of this floor. His large works of layered paper on which he has drawn punctuation marks with graphite have the composure of calligraphy. The graphite sparkles at places and the grey areas are alive with fine ink drawings of human bodies. The unspeakable acts they are engaged in are for the viewers to discover.

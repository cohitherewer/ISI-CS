                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THREAT TO STATE                                                    
	Euphoria has a tendency to evaporate. Less than a month ago, a beaming prime minister faced the nation with brimming confidence. He had won the trust vote in the Lok Sabha, rid himself of the Left and was poised to push through the Indo-US nuclear deal in various international fora. Those achievements pale somewhat before the challenges that now face the prime minister. It is evident that matters in Jammu and Kashmir have completely gone out of hand. Blaming Pakistan for the violence there may be a convenient alibi, but it will not help to hide the fact that the Central government  successive ones, in fact  have allowed violence there to escalate through a mixture of indifference, negligence and short-sighted measures. Today, only the true-grit optimist will assert that the valley is safe and will remain an integral part of the Indian nation. How many people will the Indian State kill or imprison to suppress a popular movement that threatens even the existence of the LoC with Pakistan? If the worst were to happen, and the valley were to secede from India, the domino effect of such a move could tear apart the very fabric of the Indian nation. The prime minister, as yet, has failed to provide any policy directive to assure the nation that matters are indeed under control.        
	The harsh limelight on Jammu and Kashmir should not deflect attention from ominous portents elsewhere. A red north-south corridor runs through a large part of the country. In places as far apart as Singur in West Bengal and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, forces are trying to hinder the process of industrialization. The ostensible grounds are alleged popular grievances at the transfer of agricultural land to industry. But there is enough evidence to show that political parties, for their own petty vested interests, are intervening in the process and creating an atmosphere of intimidation and obstruction. Political parties of various shades are ever willing to put their own little gains before the overall interests of the nation. It is an impossible task to expect the prime minister to single-handedly change the political culture of the country, but he must continue to set an example. He also must think of measures that will set norms to determine adequate compensation for farmers who are losing their land because of industrialization.        
	Despite a gold medal in the Beijing Olympics, the morale of the nation and therefore, symbolically, the national flag, are both drooping. The prime minister has to devise ways to transmit his confidence to the nation. India is now prepared to sit at the high table of nations; it cannot afford internal strife that threatens its unity and hinders the progress of modernization. The challenges before the prime minister are formidable. It will need more than goodwill and pious speeches to protect the nation and take it forward.

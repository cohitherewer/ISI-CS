	Shamed democracy                  
	Sir  Naked run for life in Nandigram (May 6) does not come as a shock to those familiar with the dictatorial and fascist character of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which has been ruling West Bengal for over 30 years now. Speaking about morality, secularism and democracy and practising exactly the opposite of these ideals have been the hallmark of Bengals Left Front rulers. The local clubs in Calcutta and the suburbs are run by the CPI(M) cadre who maintain their dominance by blackmailing the local residents and extorting money from them. Parties like the CPI(M) are the biggest threat to democracy in India. It is up to the people of Bengal to show the door to this party of goons.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Binod Goenka, Guwahati

                
	Sir  We have heard the chief minister of West Bengal say that women are safer in his state than in most other states of India. What an irony that his own party-cadre should decide to prove him wrong! The recent instance in Nandigram where a woman ran naked for half a kilometre after she was allegedly stripped and thrashed by CPI(M) supporters for refusing to campaign for the party shows exactly how safe women are in West Bengal. This incident is similar to last years outrage when an adivasi girl was stripped and assaulted in Guwahati. The police in Nandigram, true to their reputation, did nothing to protect the woman as the CPI(M) goons beat her up. Nothing can be more convenient than the policemen and CPI(M) cadre claiming in unison that no such incident took place. And therefore, we are to assume that the chief ministers claim remains true.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  What is going on in Nandigram, as one learns from reports in The Telegraph, is abominable, and should not be allowed to happen in any democratic country (Vote cleansing in Nandigram, May 7). However, the use of the word cleansing is somewhat confusing in the context. It does not convey the sense of the mass killing and torture in the name of vote-grabbing that Nandigram villages have been witnessing over the past week. The term denotes the removal of filth and dirt. Surely The Telegraph too, like the CPI(M), does not consider the people unwilling to vote for the CPI(M) to be filth, meant to be washed and wiped out?           
	Pseudo-medical concepts and terms have been used widely in the past hundred years or so, in connivance with psychologists, medical doctors, public health specialists and others (the media, in particular) to justify and perpetrate ethically flawed dehumanization of groups. In 1915, Ottoman Armenians were subjected to genocide by Turks, who labelled the Armenians as dangerous microbes. Hitler called the Jews parasites, plague, cancer, tumour, bacillus, bloodsucker, blood poisoner, lice, vermin, bedbugs, fleas and racial tuberculosis on the German body that would supposedly be killed with the Jewish disease. In Rwanda, Hutu radio used the term cockroaches (inyenzi) to incite mass murder of Tutsis by machete-wielding militia in 1994. The term vote cleansing obscures perception of the alarming assault on human life, freedom, democracy and dignity in Nandigram.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Being away from Calcutta and West Bengal, I depend on the internet for news of the state. It was on the website of The Telegraph that I read the stunning report of a lady being stripped and thrashed by a mob (to be read as cadre) in Nandigram. It left me speechless for a long time. I belong to Calcutta and am currently studying law in Delhi. It does not cease to intrigue me that the party which came to power three decades ago on the plank of socialism and welfare could have regressed so far. I do not think I can call myself lucky any longer for being born and brought up in West Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anirban Roychoudhury, New Delhi

      
	Sir  For every step India takes towards regaining its past glory, riding on its much-hyped economic growth, it goes two steps back with incidents like the stripping of a woman by CPI(M) cadre in Nandigram. I wonder about the meaning of civility and culture as advertised by brand India. It pains me to see the degree of dehumanization being practiced by a ruling political party in India. There is no place in a democracy for such a bunch of uncivilized tyrants.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sumit Som, Oakwood, US 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  I was travelling by a CTC bus recently. A checker got on the bus and asked the passengers to show their tickets. A number of them could not produce tickets. When the checker asked them to buy their tickets, some of them replied that they would before getting down. This is gross indiscipline and defiance of the law. In any other state, a passenger unable to produce his ticket is made to pay a spot fine. The Bengal government needs to discipline the commuters as well as the bus employees. Checkers, accompanied by policemen, should conduct random checks more often. If anyone is found without ticket in a bus, he should be made to pay a spot fine, on failing which he should be jailed for 24 hours.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R.S. Sharma, Calcutta

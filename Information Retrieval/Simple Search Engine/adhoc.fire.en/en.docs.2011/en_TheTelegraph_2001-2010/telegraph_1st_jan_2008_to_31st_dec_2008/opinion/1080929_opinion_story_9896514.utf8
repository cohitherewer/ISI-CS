	The finance minister has dismissed concerns that the American crisis will affect Indian banks on the grounds that they have little exposure to American financial institutions. He has also assured all who would listen that despite the global financial crisis, India will maintain a growth rate of 8 per cent in 2008-09. The first point is factual; there the finance minister is at least inadequately informed, though not mistaken. The ICICI Bank has revealed its exposure of 57 million euros to Lehman Brothers. To jump from that to a conclusion that it is Indian banks only exposure is a triumph of hope over prudence. For at least three other banks  the State Bank of India, the Bank of India and the Bank of Baroda  have branches in the United States of America; the finance minister forgot to enquire how much they had lent over there. And P. Chidambaram unduly constrained himself when he talked about banks; he has no idea how much Indian non-financial firms have in deposits with US banks. Indian information technology firms exports to the US last year were $24 billion; together with their local operations, their sales in the US would easily come to $50 billion. Then there is another $20 billion of merchandise exports to the US. Thus the uncounted exposure of India to the US could easily come to $100 billion.        
	Coming to the growth rate, Mr Chidambarams pet figure was 9 per cent, right till his golden budget of last February. Then realism dawned, and he modified his assured rate to 8-9 per cent. Now that the growth in the second quarter of 2008 has come down to 7.9 per cent, a claim that growth in 2008-09 would be 9 per cent would invite ridicule; so Mr Chidambaram has come down to 8 per cent. Quarterly figures show a downward tendency, albeit a gentle one, since the beginning of 2006. So it looks increasingly unlikely that 8 per cent will be reached in 2008-09. But Mr Chidambaram can assert and reassert his optimism for another ten months, for the first estimates for 2008-09 will not be published till July next year. By that time the general elections will have been held, and Mr Chidambaram will be off to a better portfolio or none. The press will be off to other pursuits than following his forecasts. So he can then disown any responsibility for disappointing growth.         
	There was a time when Mr Chidambaram was wedded to inflation. Whenever it went up, he said he would bring it down; when it went down, he said he had brought it down. Since March it has refused to come down. Despairing finally of bringing it down, Mr Chidambaram moved on to the growth rate. Here he is on a better wicket. Gross domestic product figures come out only once a quarter and are four months late. They will not prove him wrong in a hurry.

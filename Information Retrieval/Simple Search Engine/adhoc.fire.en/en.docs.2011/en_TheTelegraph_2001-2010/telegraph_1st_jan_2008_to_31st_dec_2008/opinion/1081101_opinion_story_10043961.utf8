	How many times will the administration try to shut an ill-fitting door after the horse has bolted? If the chief minister of Assam looks as if he does not know what has hit him after Thursdays explosions, he has to be asked why he does not. The whole country is supposed to be on high alert  terrorist attacks from the one in Jaipur in May this year have continued almost without let all over the country. The series of explosions  in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Malegaon, not to forget the bombs defused in Surat, and now the precisely synchronized and lethally targeted blasts in Guwahati and three other places in Assam  makes nonsense of the notion of high alert. Against the backdrop of the staggering inefficiency of the Union home ministry, the prime ministers oft-repeated faith in the Indians ability to keep the peace and unite against terrorism has begun to pall.         
	Given the number of terrorist explosions throughout India since 2005, gaining in precision, intensity and frequency, the failure of preventive intelligence seems incredible. The towns, cities and localities where the attacks have taken place each has its incendiary mix of specific troubles and specific symbolisms. There is often an obvious desire to incite sectarian violence, whether the authors are from across the border as the Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami is, or are from within it, like the still shadowy Indian Mujahedeen and the Hindutva extremists. Simultaneously, ethnic outfits, regional chauvinists and ultra-left groups are wreaking bloodshed and destruction with different methods and weapons. This cannot happen unless there is an incurable blindness in the way politics is conducted in the country. It is undeniable that this kind of politics has permitted various forms of violence to grow through its focus on vote banks created on the basis of fragmented interests and unequal development.        
	It cannot be believed that the latest tragedy in Assam could not have been predicted to some degree. The state is being rocked by ethnic conflicts that are taking a communal turn. That Huji has been using it as a corridor has been long known, as it was also known that this group, sophisticated in its material and methods, had taken to using local insurgent groups to execute the attacks. Some Huji militants were allegedly killed in an encounter recently. As though this were not warning enough, it was also being suspected that since the United Liberation Front of Asom had recently suffered some reverses, it would want to reassert itself as a dangerous force. The timing, too was predictable; it was, ominously, Diwali season. Although Ulfa has strongly denied responsibility for the terrible explosions on Thursday, which targeted happy shoppers and busy shopkeepers and occurred close to a court in one instance, the police think that there was possibly a Huji-Ulfa link-up. With so many mourning their dead in different parts of the country, it is, perhaps, a little late to talk about possibilities.

	Nehru: a contemporarys estimate By Walter Crocker, Random House India, Rs 250                        
	This is an important book which has an interesting history that Ramachandra Guha retrieves in his introduction. Walter Crocker served as Australias High Commissioner in New Delhi in the 1950s and much of his time was spent studying Indias first prime minister. He wrote this book after Jawaharlal Nehrus death and it was published in 1966. After that it sunk without trace, save a few mentions in the footnotes of Sarvepalli Gopals three-volume biography of Nehru. Yet on publication, the book did get some attention and did earn some praise. Nirad C. Chaudhuri, not known to be easy with praise, called it an extraordinarily interesting book, written in a style that is cool, neutral and judicial. It is good to have this book back in print. The focus of Crockers narrative was political. The tone of the book is one of admiration, but Crocker was critical of Nehru, especially of the way he handled the Kashmir problem. For anyone interested in the history of independent India, this is indispensable reading.                             
	Memorys gold: Writings on Calcutta Edited by Amit Chaudhuri, Viking, Rs 699              
	Once smitten by Calcutta, one is never free. You can love the city and hate it, but you cannot be free from it. Calcutta has come back in many of Amit Chaudhuris writings. This is not just because he is a Bengali who chose to live in the city. Chaudhuri is obviously drawn to the city and has a feel for it. This should make him a very strong candidate for editing an anthology of writings on Calcutta. Yet there are doubts. Professor Sukanta Chaudhuri has recently pointed out in a review of Amit Chaudhuris collection of essays, Clearing a Space, that according to Amit Chaudhuri, Pathuriaghata is not in Calcutta. Lapses of a similar order are also noticeable in this collection. To give two examples. In his introductory note on Kaliprasanna Singha, Chaudhuri does not mention the fact that Singha actually translated into Bengali the entire Mahabharat. Even today, this stands as the classic translation. In his note on Samar Sen, there is no mention that Sen edited Now, a journal that was of enormous significance to the intellectual world of Calcutta in the Sixties. Any lover of Calcutta, of writings on it, will find some of his favourites missing from this collection. But that is not the point. There are some unexpected gems here: Michael Madhusudan Dutt writing to his friend, Rajnarain Bose (left unintroduced in this volume), about how he met a shopkeeper in Chinabazar reading the Meghnadvad Kabya. There are excerpts here from Hootum Pyanchar Naksha (Hootum was the nom de plume of Kaliprasanna Singha), but, unfortunately, Hootums Bengali is untranslatable. Readers in English will get the content and miss the fun. Despite some reservations, it is good to have this book.                            
	Visualizing space in Banaras:Images, maps, and the practice of representation Edited by Martin Gaenszle and Jrg Gengnagel, Oxford, Rs 750              
	No other city in India raises the kind of emotion that Banaras does. Call it by any name  Kasi, Varanasi or Banaras  it conjures up notions of the sacred, of narrow alleys, of a holy river and inevitably, of filth. This book looks at the many ways that the city has come to be represented. It is a tad technical.

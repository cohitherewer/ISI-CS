	Have blog, will fight                  
	Sir  Of late, a new cyber illness has caught hold of the top Bollywood stars. Its main symptom is that the affected person launches his own blog, apparently to share his ideas and opinions with his fans, but actually uses it to spew ire and contempt at selected individuals (Duel of dons, May 17). Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan are surely down with his virus, and both have targeted Shah Rukh Khan in their blogs. I can only see a reflection of their inferiority complex in these writings. Stars of such high standing need not have resorted to cheap thrills.           
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
        
	Leaning too much          
	Sir  In Nandi frets, Singur eats fruits (May 14), Kinsuk Basu writes, unlike Nandigram, where not an inch was acquired but violence has become endemic, the buzzword here [in Singur] is development. Nothing could be more unfair and insensitive than this, as the results of the panchayat polls have shown. Basu talks of the endemic violence in Nandigram almost as if it were some sort of an inner corruption of the place. Apart from the statement issued to DYFI members, where the chief minister declared that the land acquisition notice issued should be torn and disposed of, there has been no official notice, to my knowledge, to the same effect. It is not surprising that the people of Nandigram are unable to place their trust in a government which believes in paying them back in their own coin.           
	Basu also talks about protests in Singur being more tokenism than a show of strength. If they were, one could see on television how ineffectual they were against the police force deployed. Did Basu try to find out how many of the guards employed at the Tata project are paid their salaries regularly? Did he ask how many sharecroppers have NREGA or BPL cards in Singur? Or for that matter, how many of them have got 15 per cent of the price of their land as the government claims to have given them? These information, if gathered, would no doubt have changed the complexion of the story.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
M. Chakraborty, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In my months-long experience in Singur, I must confess that I failed to hear even once the buzzword of development that Kinsuk Basu seems to have heard. I dare say I would have preferred to learn about the present conditions of people who do not have new BSA-SLR bicycles, or, indeed, any bicycle, or any guarantee of food for the coming weeks, and of people whose lands have been acquired without their consent. I am reminded of the people of Dobandi and Khaserberia, for instance, who do not have alternative sources of income, or non-agricultural skills, and who have not received any compensation for their loss of livelihood till date.          
	While there has been some fine reporting on Nandigram in by Imran Ahmed Siddiqui and Rohini Chaki, Basus report on Singur was remarkably myopic.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Dhar, Calcutta

                          
	Tribe in need          
	Sir  More than 900 lives have been lost and about 300 villages destroyed under the National Socialist Party of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah)s policy of ethnic cleansing between 1993 and 1995 (also known as the Naga-Kuki conflict). It will not be wrong to say that the Kukis are one of the unluckiest tribes in the world. Their backwardness has to do with ignorance caused by lack of proper education. But one still feels hopeful to hear about the peace talks between the government and Kuki militant groups. However, the government should not take any step which might affect the tradition and culture of this ancient tribe.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ngamtinlun Kuki, Pangei, Manipur

										        LIFE, INTERRUPTED
    A man was invalidated out of the Indian Army in 1983 after nine years of service as he was suffering from schizophrenia. He was also refused disability pension as the authorities ruled that he had not got the disease in the line of duty. After his death in 1996, his wife approached the court claiming disability pension as well as family pension. A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court upheld the widow rsquo;s claim on both counts. Since a medical board had not declared the disease as constitutional in nature, the court was of the opinion that the disease arose out of the stress and strain of army service. It, therefore, directed payment of disability pension with arrears as well as family pension to the widow (Darshana Devi vs Union of India).
    HARD TIMES
    The Madras High Court has held that the authorised representative of a litigant cannot give evidence in a court of law if he or she does not have personal knowledge of the incident. The point arose in a case relating to an oral agreement that was entered into in 1994. As the person in question was given the power of attorney only in 2003, he could not be expected to speak about the agreement entered into in 1994 and the normal course of business which had then taken place, the court held. If a litigant cannot appear before the court in person, the law provides for appointment of commissioner for recovering evidence, the court pointed out and advised the party to do that (Shakuntala (MS) vs Anandarajan). 
    HOLY MOTHER!
    The Madras High Court has held that the child of an unwed mother is her legal heir and is entitled to the mother rsquo;s pension and other benefits. In this case, the child of an unmarried woman was denied her pension despite the fact that the government had taken a decision to extend pension benefits to the illegitimate child of a man. The victim then approached the court for justice. Directing payment of the pension, the high court held that it is ironical that the illegitimate child can inherit the pension of his biological father but not of his biological mother, a relation that is so much easier to prove (S. Gowarikar vs Secretary to Government, Government of Tamil Nadu).

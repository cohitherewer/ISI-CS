	Food sans thought                  
	Sir  I was extremely shocked to read about the cuisines that were put up for world leaders attending the G8 summit in Japan (Food shortages? Not for leaders in Japan, July 8). At a time when the world is battling spiralling food prices, such opulence and lavishness is uncalled for. It was extremely insensitive of Japan, the host nation, to flaunt its wealth in such a manner. As a member of the G8, it should act more responsibly. The food and wine may have been good, but money saved would have been far better.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Not afraid          
	Sir  The terror attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul is the most chilling instance yet of the severe hostility India faces from a Talibanized Afghanistan and its jittery Pakistani sponsors (Terror strikes Indian embassy, July 8). Ever since India took a conscious decision, and rightly so, to assist the government of Afghanistan in rebuilding the country destroyed by civil war and Taliban, there has been disquiet on two fronts  the Pakistani intelligence and its natural ally, al Qaida-backed Taliban. The tragic deaths of the defence attach, the counsellor for political affairs and two Indian security personnel, apart from scores of others, notwithstanding, we must continue with our mission in Afghanistan. A large number of Indians are involved in humanitarian work there and their work is much appreciated by the people of that devastated country.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The dastardly suicide bombing in Kabul, killing 41 people, including Indian embassy officials, has been condemned by all world leaders. Many, including the Afghan interior minister, have directly or indirectly pointed fingers at Pakistan. Mondays bombing was not an isolated incident. Indian engineers and workers building infrastructure in Afghanistan have earlier been attacked, abducted and killed. There is a clear design in these killings. Indian civilian workers, or anybody helping rebuild the country, are the targets.           
	It is high time India made it clear that it is not going to take the attack lying down. The security cover for Indians in Afghanistan must be strengthened. Also, international bodies should be persuaded to exert pressure on Pakistan to stop extending patronage to outfits like al Qaida.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.C. Bhowmick, Asansol 

                
	Sir  Although acts of terror such as the one on the Indian embassy in Kabul cannot dent Indias resolve to help Afghanistan, it is time for the Afghan government to take the help of foreign experts in tackling terrorism to protect the lives of people working for the welfare of the Afghans.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  It is a matter of concern that there is no let-up in extremist violence in Afghanistan. Footage in the electronic media has shown dozens of Afghan men lining up outside the Indian embassy every morning in the quest for visas. The suicide bomb blasts were clearly aimed at creating panic among the people who think India will open doors for them. India has always been committed to the development of Afghanistan. Naturally, the Indian embassy and nationals have become targets of jihadi outfits like the Taliban. No doubt India should take better care of its nationals, but local governments too should provide foolproof security to our missions in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and other sensitive regions. The government may have to rethink its foreign policy in the light of such attacks.                    
	Yours faithfully,

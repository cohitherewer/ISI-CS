	This month, when the index of industrial production for March 2008 showed an alarming drop over the same month last year  3 per cent compared to 14.4 per cent in March 2007  policymakers were not unduly worried about growth prospects or that GDP growth could be decelerating from the pace of the last three years. Overall, industrial production for 2007-08 grew at 8.1 per cent, compared to 11.6 per cent in 2006-07. Economists point to the high base effect: March 2007 was a record climb, they say, so some moderation was inevitable. Others point out that services account for almost three-fifths of the Indian economy, and that continues to grow at a good clip. Industrialists, by contrast, seem worried about the economic slowdown that declining IIP growth underscores. For them, high input costs and high interest rates form a combination that could seriously dent industrial output. And with inflation as high as it is, cutting interest rates to stimulate growth is a non-starter. Which raises an important question: how much does manufacturing matter? The manufacturing sector  and agriculture  employs several times the number of people than do services. To be able to sustain demand, the impact of slower growth on these two segments of the economy cannot be ignored. As long as demand is domestically driven  and it is significant in the Indian economy  any drop in manufacturing output should be a cause for concern.         
	A slowdown in manufacturing also results in a slowdown in services; take trade and transport services, for example. Lower output implies lower freight traffic and lower growth in transportation services. True, in India, the correlation between manufacturing and services is not as strong as it is in developed countries. In large part that is because India continues to add new services; while transportation may decline along with manufacturing, medical tourism services, for instance, are not likely to fall. Many foreigners who come to India to avail of medical tourism services are also highly likely to stay on for longer periods to enjoy other services. Services growth is also high because of large government expenditure on social services such as health and education. This government, in particular, has focused rather intensively on raising social expenditures over the last couple of years; these expenditure levels have added a lot of stability to services-sector growth.         
	But while some services may act as a buffer to declines in industrial output, others may face a more direct impact: financial services, or more particularly banking, for one. Decreases in demand growth will result in a slower pace of deposit and credit growth. Thus, monetary policy (it is also called credit policy with reason) plays an important role in what happens to industrial output growth, primarily through interest rates. Yes, manufacturing matters as it is the vital link between production and prosperity.

	Still on fire                  
	Sir  The Nanavati commissions report on the Godhra incident is significant (Specially commissioned, Sept 27). The report, which says that the train fire was a pre-planned conspiracy hatched by some members of the minority community, goes against the observations made by the U.C. Banerjee commission earlier that had said that the fire was an accident. It is difficult to say which one of the two reports comes closer to the truth. The one presented by Nanavati commission is an in-depth study, which takes into account every factor that came before and after the Godhra fire. The fact that it took the commission six years and 12 extensions to complete the task indicates the thoroughness with which the investigators went about their job. If what the report says is true, then immediate action should be taken against the culprits responsible for the loss of hundreds of lives in Gujarat in 2002.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government has trashed the Nanavati commissions report, calling it faulty and biased. But can the UPA cite any reason as to why it thinks that the report is prejudiced? It should be remembered that Justice Nanavati had earlier inquired into the anti-Sikh riots, which broke out after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. His report was much applauded at that time and Nanavati was hailed as an exemplary judge. How can the same man be suddenly thought of as untrustworthy? The Congress cannot denounce and reject a report simply because it did not deliver the verdict preferred by the party.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

                
	Sir  If the Godhra fire was a result of a conspiracy masterminded by sections of the minority community, how does one explain the killing of Muslims post-Godhra? The Nanavati commission report fits the hands of the Narendra Modi government like a glove. The perfect concordance of the report with what Modi and his men have been saying all this long should make one suspicious. The report comes at a time when communal feelings are running high in the country, and it will certainly stoke these dangerous sentiments. Any sensible Indian should think twice before accepting the commissions report at its face value.           
	However, this is not to say that the Congress is right in criticizing the report, since the reasons for its denouncement are suspect. The sad truth is that once again the political parties of India are exploiting sensitive issues to reap political dividends. This is disgraceful and it does great dishonour to those who lost their lives in the Sabarmati Express and in the riots that followed.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Now that the Nanavati commission has come out with its report on the Godhra incident, the Congress has started to question the validity of the commissions views by citing the content of U.C. Banerjee commission report. But the Congress should do well to remember that the Gujarat High Court had declared the Banerjee panel to be illegal. In fact, the panel was set up by Lalu Prasad to put Narendra Modi in a false position. The Congress should learn to call a spade a spade and stop its rants against the Nanavati commission report.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjan Das, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Double trouble          
	Sir  Under existing rules of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, a government school teacher who does not have a B.Ed degree at the time of his appointment is expected to get one while in service. However, the degree has to be acquired within five years of appointment if the teacher is to get an increment on its basis. But teachers are having a tough time getting admitted to a B.Ed course these days because of the scarcity of B.Ed colleges in the state. The problem assumed an alarming proportion after it became obligatory for B.Ed colleges to get the approval of the National Council for Teacher Education. After this directive, the government hurriedly stopped B.Ed courses in a number of colleges on the ground that these institutions did not have the endorsement of the NCTE.           
	Since the government did not start the course at the same time in an equal number of colleges having the NCTE approval, the pressure on the existing centres has increased drastically in the last few years. They find it hard to accommodate the hundreds of students and deputed teachers who apply every year. As a screening procedure, they tend to give preference to those teachers who have three to four years of experience rather than to those who have just been appointed. A teacher, as a result, is caught in a double bind. He cannot hope to get admitted to a B.Ed course unless he has spent some years teaching. Yet he must also complete the course within five years of service. The government should either increase the number of B.Ed colleges or abolish the five-year ceiling for the existing teachers.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajesh Dey, Kotulpur, Bankura

                
	Sir  As if the paucity of NCTE- approved B.Ed colleges is not enough, teachers are now also being inconvenienced by the outmoded syllabus for English in the West Bengal School Service Commission examination. The syllabus, as it exists now, emphasizes literature only. Undoubtedly, one cannot teach English without knowledge of the literature in the language.           
	But it is as important for the teachers to be well-versed in grammar, phonetics and methodology in order to be able to teach in schools. The students in most state-aided Bengali medium schools need to be taught grammar with special care if they are to acquire proficiency in this particular language. As such, the teachers need to know the latest methods of teaching grammar if they are to be of help to the students. The school service commission needs to restructure the syllabus keeping this in mind.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Biplabratan Sarkar, Jalpaiguri

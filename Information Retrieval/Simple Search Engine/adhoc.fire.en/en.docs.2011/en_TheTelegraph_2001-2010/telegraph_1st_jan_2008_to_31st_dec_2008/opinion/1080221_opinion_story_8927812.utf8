	Pakistan has made an eventful journey from the dictators boots to the polling booth, one that would not have been possible without the collective force of the public will. The unique public triumph lies not only in making the president keep his word of holding free and fair elections, but also in sending out an unambiguous verdict against the president, Pervez Musharraf. The vote has overwhelmingly gone to two parties  the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). Both have relied on their central, anti-Musharraf agenda to garner votes. The verdict does not immediately lead to the dismissal of the president or guarantee his exit. But it brings to the fore the distinct possibility of such an event taking place, provided two-thirds of the parliament agrees to it. For now, the more difficult task before the two parties is to form a government. Asif Ali Zardari, leader of the PPP, which rode home on a sympathy wave and is the single largest party in parliament, is a good judge of the public mood. Not averse to working with the discredited president, he has suddenly realized the impracticality of such an option and invited the PML(N) to form a consensus government. But given the latters hardline stance on issues like the reinstatement of the supreme court judges, a consensus may perennially elude the two parties. Efforts are also allegedly on within the PPP to cobble a coalition with the smaller parties that would enable it to seize power and also allow the president to continue in his constitutional office. But if that happens, the PPP would once again stifle Pakistans efforts to experience real democracy and re-open the road to political disquiet.        
	There is another direction in which the popular will has thrust itself. The defeat of the Islamist coalition of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal and the vote for the more centrist parties like the Awami Nationalist Party shows the popular yearning to end bloodshed. The extremists, who have proved to be the bane of the nation, however, work on their own dynamics which are independent of the rites of government-formation. Their momentum is dictated by an anti-Americanism which political parties in the provinces or at the centre may not be able to dissociate themselves from. In other words, the posturing of the new government vis--vis America will also dictate its success in containing militancy and realizing a need fervently felt nationwide.

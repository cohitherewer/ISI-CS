The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Birth Is Awaited
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A BIRTH IS AWAITED                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Of course the nuclear deal will be signed and made operational. And of course, the Left will spit and fume along with a few other mates who realize that they are on a downward slope, declining rapidly in strength but who would like to stay in power a wee bit longer than their fated time in office if elections are announced six months ahead of schedule. For the Congress, however, it would be far more productive to go to the polls now, thus showing that they are willing to give up the gaddi ahead of time to deliver what they believe is in the long term interest of India. It would also be of advantage to the party if the Rashtriya Janata Dal breaks off from the United Progressive Alliance and joins the Left and other parties to form a third front. This would leave the Congress free to attempt an alliance with Nitish Kumar and his party, the Janata Dal (United). After all, why should the Congress be bullied by the Left Front, which is already in decline and which is inevitably going to demand a larger number of seats and deliver less than it has today if it enters into an alliance again? Instead, the Congress could work towards an arrangement with Mamata Banerjee to batter the Left all the better at the hustings in West Bengal.        
	Changing coalition partners is normal in fickle, ineffective political dispensations where the lesser and weaker constituents of the conglomerate are participants primarily because they need to get on with their personal, petty agendas and not because they share a passionate commitment to the prosperity of millions of Indians. In such superficial relationships, political blackmail to maintain the status quo dominates and suffocates governance.                 
	New hope        
	The vulnerability and weakness of disparate political leaders, representing small- and medium-sized regional parties, usually with regional priorities, coming together only to prop up the numbers for the largest amongst them, make a mockery of the desperate needs of India. Such partners know well that they cannot ever rule akhand Bharat unless they broaden their minds to embrace the diversity that cuts across class, caste, creed and faith. Since that kind of commitment requires a different mindset and value system, a competence and intellectual skill that they know they lack, they can only make themselves heard by walkouts and boycotts. They are, quite honestly, anti-national.        
	India wants to get on and not wallow in the social and economic deprivation that has remained unchanged for over 60 years. Disparities in society cannot be made to disappear by mouthing loud rhetoric but through sensible and carefully nuanced initiatives that address the multiple needs of our diverse social strata. Weak political entities  the kind that are dominating the landscape today  always try to divide society to perpetuate their rule. It is an old technique that causes disruption and generates profound hatred among the people. Keeping the destructive status quo alive and making failed political dispensations thrive with the regular use of undemocratic, confrontationalist opposition politics can only hurl us into anarchy.        
	Indian democracy has to mature. Its leaders from across the spectrum have to become selfless and put their personal interests on the backburner. It is unfortunate that a short way into the start of a new millennium we have diluted our sense of self-respect and pride that was alive and kicking as recently as when the British were ruling us. The Indian National Congress has the opportunity, yet again, to call the bluff of the bullies, to do what needs to be done, give up the kursi and go to the people, albeit a trifle earlier than the due date, to deliver possibly a premature but healthier UPA! The fight is worth the risk because only a fighter survives till the end.

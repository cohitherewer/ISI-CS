                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Run for cover                  
	Sir  The life of every Calcuttan is in grave danger. Uma Maity, whose arm was ripped off and who died with two rods piercing her throat and temple, is the latest victim of irresponsible driving (Bus race rips arm and life, March 17). It has become risky for anyone to venture on the streets since there is a possibility of being mowed down by speeding buses. It is the responsibility of the state government to provide a solution to the problem. Errant drivers have to be severely punished in order to set a precedent. The traffic police should also spend less time taking bribes and concentrate on controlling frenzied vehicles plying the roads. If something is not done quickly, Calcutta may soon resemble a ghost town, as people would prefer to stay in the relative safety of their homes.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The killer buses of Calcutta take at least a couple of lives every day. In this they rival the record of the Blue Line buses of Delhi. One of the chief reasons why buses in Calcutta are driven so recklessly is that driving licence is easy to obtain in the city, and to purchase as well. Bus drivers do not need to go through any rigorous test before getting their licence. However, passengers too need to be careful while travelling by a bus. They should make sure that no part of the body sticks outside the window when the bus is in motion. Otherwise accidents will continue to occur. It is pity that instead of being cautious after every accident such as the one which killed Uma Maity, all that the people do is torch vehicles and beat up the drivers. Violence is not a solution to the problem.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurabh Sharma, Liluah 

                
	Sir  I stay in Chennai, and am currently touring Kharagpur. The news of the ghastly accident in which Uma Maity met her end shocked me. It is ironic that the communist government of West Bengal allows private bus operators to take the public literally for a ride. In contrast, in Chennai  which is under non-communist rule  the people have an excellent public transport system run by the state government. Of late, a large number of luxury and air-conditioned buses have been commissioned to ply within the city limits. Communists in Bengal should learn from Chennai if they really care for the people they profess to work for.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
M.S. Murty, Chennai 

                
	Sir  The consecutive deaths of Debjani Sinha and Uma Maity are unfortunate and alarming. I fail to understand why the guilty drivers of the buses should simply be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and allowed to get away with mere warnings when they deserve the harshest of punishments. Do the police not consider a killing as murder unless there is stabbing or shooting or throttling? The lives of two women have been lost and the bus drivers who raced their buses are fully responsible for the deaths. Yet the police continue with their usual lackadaisical investigation into the deaths. This is the attitude that allows accidents to occur every other day in Calcutta. The drivers need not fear the police, who will turn a blind eye to everything as long as their palms are greased sufficiently. The police are as much responsible for the deaths on the roads as the drivers. As a regular commuter, I too fear for my life when I am travelling on the citys roads.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
P. Agarwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The state buses running through Calcutta are as ramshackle as the private buses are vicious. It was a private bus on the DN-18 route that caused the death of Uma Maity. To add to the passengers anxiety, there is now a new breed of buses flaunting the banner of West Bengal State Transport Corporation that ply between Garia station and Belur, Naktala and Dakshineshwar, and between Sonarpur and New Town. These buses are deceptively similar to the state buses but are supposedly owned by private operators. In that case, they either have the permission of the WBSTC for the use of the name of the state transport corporation or do not think it necessary. However, they have found that the use of the WBSTC sign gives them a kind of respectability and a degree of leniency from the police.           
	It is perhaps in the interest of the government to let these buses ply the far-flung corners of the city, thus giving the impression that the network of public transport service has been extended to cover large areas. The only party that emerges a loser from this convenient system is the commuter. Not only are these buses wilder than usual (and therefore cause for more frequent mishaps), they deny passengers the benefits available on state buses. Physically handicapped persons are entitled to free rides in a state bus if they can produce a valid certificate of their disability. I know a physically challenged person called Bidyut Kumar Dey. He boarded such a bus on March 15, 2008 assuming it to be a state bus and so expecting a free ride. Instead of being granted the privilege, he was insulted and heckled. Such incidents will increase if the state government does nothing to protect the rights of commuters.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I found it amusing that the editorial, Death drive (March 18), chose to compare the murderous buses of Calcutta with the Sunderban tigers, who can kill but cannot be killed. The analogy fits not only the city buses but also the government that runs the state. The government can cull human beings like chicken when they stand in the way of its policies. The ruled have no choice  they either have to accept government orders or face death. In the case of the buses, although we know that they pose a threat to our lives, we can do nothing but sadly acknowledge that drivers of Calcutta have developed a taste for human blood. No complaints to the police or to the government will make the bus drivers change their way. After all, they have the support of the police who will allow them to take a life or two as long as they are able to pocket a few notes.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Kumar, Calcutta

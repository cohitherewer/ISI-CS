	 The tiger was present, but the roar was missing. During his customary dussehra speech, Balasaheb Thackeray, instead of growling as is his wont, coughed, spluttered and paused occasionally for a sip of water throughout his half-hour long address, prompting anxious Shiv Sainiks to wonder whether it was time for the ageing tiger to pass the mantle on to the cub. But after a while, it was evident that even the cub was yet to earn his stripes. When Uddhav Thackeray, Shiv Senas executive president, took his turn at the mike, there were no snarls, only soft purrs. Uddhavs oratory skills lacked the fire his father was once famous for, and there was feeble applause when he declared that Mumbai belonged to aapla baap (our father). After the end of the proceedings, worried sainiks were apparently asking themselves whether Mumbai had now been passed on to Raj Thackeray, the other big cat in the litter.                       
	 The dates for the Lok Sabha polls havent been fixed yet but the race for tickets in the Bharatiya Janata Party has begun in all earnest. Shatrughan Sinha and Ravi Shankar Prasad are reportedly fighting tooth and nail to bag the prized Patna seat. The BJP top brass isnt averse to hand over the ticket to Sinha, but chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is said to be uncomfortable with Shotguns popularity, will have none of it. His opposition forced LK Advani to ask Sinha to trade Patna for Delhi but the Bihari-babu, who was earlier denied a Rajya Sabha nomination with the promise of a Lok Sabha ticket, is keen to fight from Bihar. Last heard, Sinha, disgusted with the BJPs indecisiveness, is contemplating quitting the party. We can only say that this is yet another script gone horribly wrong for the poor actor.                            
	 Anoop Mishra, a state minister in BJP-ruled MP and a close relative of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has thrown down the gauntlet at Jyotiraditya Scindia.Tired of Scindia flaunting his close ties with Gwalior and his habit of claiming credit for everything good that has happened there, Mishra has challenged Scindia to contest the next polls against him from Gwalior. Scindia is currently an MP from Guna, which used to be a part of the former kingdom. BJP insiders, however, are worried about Scindia accepting the challenge. A clash between the two men would leave the party MP from Gwalior and Jyotiradityas aunt, Yashodhara Raje Scindia, without a turf to fight on.                            
	 Does Veerappa Moily duck for cover whenever a blast rocks the nation? If yes, that can only be because of what happened after the bomb blast in Mehrauli recently. Moily, the AICC chairman of media department, was quick to issue a press statement from Sonia Gandhi the day of the Mehrauli blast, surprising scribes who were able to get the Congress presidents reaction within hours of the tragedy. But much to their horror, that statement, said to be prepared by the man himself, was short on crucial facts. For instance, it declared the death toll as three, although the police took two more days to arrive at the real figure. Now Moilys opponents in the Congress are of the view that the media department chairman needs to be taken to task for this faux pas. But Moily and his merrymen are breathing easy. They are confident that they will be spared just like home minister Shivraj Patil was after he bungled on virtually everything.                            
	 Talking about faux pas, here is one from the beacon of truth, the British Broadcasting Corporation. The other day, while reporting on the anti-nuclear-deal protests by Left Front supporters, the BBC, it seems, displayed a photograph of the CPI leader, D Raja, with a caption that read OJ Simpson. The error cropped up because the preceding news item concerned the controversial Simpson who was jailed for robbing his own memorabilia! One wonders what Raja makes of the glitch. Yet another conspiracy launched by the capitalists, the Americans, along with their British pals this time?                            
	 Rahul Gandhis busy political schedule forced him to skip the weddings of a close aide, N Sherpa, and the son of family loyalist, V George. But on both occasions, the gracious man was said to have compensated the Georges and the Sherpas adequately. Now isnt this why his supporters call him the peoples prince?                        Here comes the    
	 All is not quiet in the newly formed Congress-Samajwadi Party parivar. According to the political grapevine, Sonia Gandhi is supposed to have requested Mulayam Singh Yadav to restrain his Man Friday, Amar Singh, from interfering with the governments functioning and whipping up anti-Congress sentiments among the partys allies. Madams salvo came in the wake of the secret parleys that Amar Singh held with Maharashtras dissident leader, Narayan Rane. And that was not all. He followed that meeting up with another one: this time, with Union minister, Lalu Prasad. So miffed is the Congress president that she is supposed to have warned Mulayam Singh that the Congress-SP tie-up might well be over if he failed to stop Amar Singhs antics. Poor Mulayam Singh Yadav. As if stopping the mercurial Mayavati in her tracks was not enough, now he has to devote time to find ways to prevent a marriage of convenience from falling apart.

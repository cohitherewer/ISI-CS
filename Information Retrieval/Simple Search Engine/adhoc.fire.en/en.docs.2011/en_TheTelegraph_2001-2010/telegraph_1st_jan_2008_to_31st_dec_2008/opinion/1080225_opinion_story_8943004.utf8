	Access and the quality of teaching are the abiding benchmarks for assessing standards of primary education. So it is reassuring to know that the Supreme Court has supported the permitting of new private schools by state governments. It has set aside a judgment given by the Bombay high court vetoing the sanctions granted by the Maharashtra government to almost 1,500 new higher secondary schools. The apex courts judgment is founded on two important arguments. First, to veto these schools would deprive thousands of children of education. Second, it would also hinder the state government from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide education for all children.         
	This opening up of education to private enterprise does not allay all fears about the fate of quality education for all in India. To empower state governments to allow new private schools need not necessarily help them discharge their constitutional obligations. This might, in fact, enable them to evade precisely these obligations, by smoothly transferring the actual responsibility of founding and running the schools to the private sector and then setting themselves up as simply the assessors of these privately provided services. In Bengal, for instance, the general quality of the education provided by the government hardly inspires confidence in the government as a monitor of standards. Both in policymaking and in implementation, the government has fostered a kind of bleakness in the education sector that makes it difficult for it to claim a natural entitlement to authorize private schools and punish the sub-standard ones among them. In education, as in health, the transition from government-run to private services will have to be thought through, and achieved, very carefully indeed. The question of responsibility and accountability  constitutional obligation  will remain, and the State will always be implicated in it in an active way. Encouraging governments to allow more private schools might end up allowing the former to get away with not doing properly what they are supposed to do according to the Constitution, rather than the other way round.

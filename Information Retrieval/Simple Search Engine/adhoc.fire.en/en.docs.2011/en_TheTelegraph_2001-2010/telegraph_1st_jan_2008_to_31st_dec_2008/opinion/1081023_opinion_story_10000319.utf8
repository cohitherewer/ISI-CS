	Born great                  
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar surpassing Brian Laura as the highest run getter in the history of Test match cricket brought about an early Diwali for India (Tender 16 to sterner stuff, Oct 18). Tendulkar may have been dismissed before scoring a century in Mohali but by then he had reached his milestone, to the great joy of his fans. This milestone may be his last, as after 19 years of cricket, Tendulkar has very little left to prove. Perhaps he should take a cue from Sourav Ganguly and hang up his boots when he is on the top of his game.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar is the jewel in the crown of Indian cricket. For close to two decades, he has carried the cricketing hopes and aspirations of an entire country on his shoulders. Tendulkar, doubtlessly, is the modern Bradman. He ranks above his contemporaries for his ability to score runs all over the world. No wonder Bradman said that Tendulkar reminded him of the way he used to play. Can there be a greater testimony to Tendulkars greatness? The only prize that has eluded him so far is the World Cup. It is impossible to win a tournament like the World Cup on ones own, but Tendulkar did come close in 2003. Nonetheless, Indians should be thankful to the Little Master for the joy he brought us all.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The day Sachin Tendulkar reached the pinnacle of success, the Indian share market slid below the 10,000 mark, following to its lowest level in two years. Tendulkars innings was a classic. He played slowly, laying the foundation for a big innings, and then went on to build on it. The sensex, on the other hand, has been playing T20 cricket for a while, rising rapidly and falling equally fast in the last nine months. Hopefully, the sensex would turn around and start performing consistently like Tendulkar has done all these years.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rakesh Bajoria, Calcutta

                
	Sir  We must doff our hats to Sachin Tendulkar for becoming the highest run-scorer in Test cricket and also the first ever cricketer to amass 12,000 runs in this form of the game. Lest anyone forget, Tendulkar has the most runs in one-day internationals and the most centuries in both Tests and ODIs.           
	Tendulkar is not only a supremely talented cricketer but also a fine person. His comment  that people must learn to convert stones into milestones  shows the greatness of his persona. Young cricketers should emulate Tendulkars dedication and hard work if they want to make a name for themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh 

      
	Sir  Indian cricket fans will look back on this year with mixed feelings. While Tendulkar replacing Brian Lara as the maximum run-scorer in Test cricket is certainly good news, Sourav Gangulys announcement that he will retire from cricket after the Australian series is likely to sadden quite a few hearts.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani

                
	Sir  There have been occasions in the past when Sachin Tendulkars performance has been disappointing. On those occasions, the call for his retirement got quite shrill. It is shocking to see that some experts are still asking Tendulkar to retire, despite the fact that he displaced Brian Lara to become the top batsman in Test cricket only a few days ago. Tendulkar still has a few years of cricket left in him and he should be allowed to carry on. The same can be said of Sourav Ganguly who scored his 16th century in the last match but the wise men in the BCCI seem to be hell-bent on mistreating Indias finest left-hander.           
	Yours faithfully,      
M.C. Joshi, Lucknow 

                
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar has, expectedly, gone on to become the batsman with the maximum number of runs in Tests. It is true that these days, one rarely gets to see the swashbuckling Tendulkar of yore. But his dogged perseverence has ensured that Tendulkar is still a force to be reckoned with. Few other cricketers can match Tendulkars brilliance and the man has become a cricketing institution in himself.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Sinha, Khagra, Murshidabad

      
	Sir  The prayers of one billion Indians were answered in Mohali when Sachin Tendulkar went on to overtake Brian Lara and become the only member of the 12,000-runs club. From a child prodigy to the most respected cricketer of world cricket, from Lahore to Mohali, it has been a long journey for Tendulkar. There is no need to compare Tendulkar with other greats such as Donald Bradman, Garfield Sobers, Vivian Richards or Sunil Gavaskar. These men were cricketers belonging to different epochs in the history of the game and all of them had god-given talent. In a country divided on political, caste, and religious lines, Tendulkar serves as the only unifying force. He is an icon and a role model for us all. In this hour of joy, I only hope wise counsel will prevail on those experts who have been egging Tendulkar on to call it a day.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar shone in Mohali, and Sourav Ganguly wasnt too bad either. The chief selector reportedly stated that he hoped that Tendulkar would play till the 2011 World Cup but it was time for Ganguly to retire. It is unfortunate that Krishnamachari Srikkanth has adopted two different yardsticks to measure the performances of two great players.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

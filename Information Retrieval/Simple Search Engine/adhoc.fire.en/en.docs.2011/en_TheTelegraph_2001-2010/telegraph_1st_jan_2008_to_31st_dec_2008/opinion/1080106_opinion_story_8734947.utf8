The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                            Letters to Editor
                
	Life in the metro                  
	Sir  On December 30, 2007, I left my mobile in a taxi after getting off at south Calcutta to enter a shop. Naturally, I was saddened by the incident. On returning home, my husband instantly called my mobile number, which was answered by the taxi driver. He was very nice and promised to return the mobile phone the next day. True to his word, S.K. Noushad came to our flat at about 8.45 p.m. and returned my mobile to me. I believe that the existence of such honest human beings still makes life worth living in Calcutta.          
	Yours faithfully,        Swagata Basu, Calcutta
        
	Romantic beginning          
	Sir  What is the objective of publishing a picture of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in romantic bliss with his girlfriend on the front page of The Telegraph on the very first day of the year? (Will an Indian leader dare do this in 2008, Jan 1). What has Sarkozy got to do with India? Of late, the personal life of Sarkozy has been receiving more attention in the Indian media than it has been getting from perhaps even the French papers. Surprisingly, in all the reports about Sarkozys romantic escapades, there has been little or no mention of his qualities as the head of the State.           
	By publishing such a picture with a telling caption, was The Telegraph trying to titillate its readers on New Years Day? Or was it challenging Indian leaders to become more promiscuous? If the last supposition is true, then The Telegraph will surely find its challenge answered soon since Indian leaders have the ability to outdo any competitor when it comes to indulging in objectionable pleasures.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Surajit Das, Calcutta

      
	Sir  God forbid that any Indian leader would do what Nicolas Sarkozy seems to be doing these days. On the other hand, Sarkozys young and beautiful supermodel girlfriend, Carla Bruni, seems to be making hay while the sun shines. After having captured an ageing but powerful head of State as her boyfriend, she must be eager to grab whatever attention comes her way. Although his relationships are his personal affair, Sarkozy is also a public figure. As the president of France, more discreet behaviour is expected of him. He should do better than just flaunt his attractive girlfriend with whom he reportedly has a live-in relationship. I wonder how the Egyptian government is hosting this couple without inviting the wrath of the conservative section of the society.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Nicolas Sarkozys picture in The Telegraph was a disappointment. The expression on the faces of both Sarkozy and Carla Bruni seemed so contrived that the couple looked ridiculous. Were the two giving a photo-shoot in Egypt? And one shudders to think what will happen if potbellied, bespectacled, balding Indian leaders start imitating Sarkozy. One will not dare pick up newspapers if the media start flashing pictures of our notoriously ugly leaders locked in an embrace with their beloved every single day.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  On January 1, 2008, The Telegraph dared Indian politicians to emulate Nicolas Sarkozy. No Indian politician has responded so far, but Chua Soi Lek, the health minister of Malaysia, seems to have acted on their behalf, featuring in a widely circulated sex video (Minister admits taking part in sex video, Jan 2). Such a feat on the part of an ageing political leader deserves a special mention in the Guinness book. The Telegraph seems to have got more than it had bargained for, albeit from a man in another country.                    
	Yours faithfully,

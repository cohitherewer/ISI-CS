	Cash current to shock thieves                  
	Sir  Electricity theft can now be controlled in a novel way. Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam in Gurgaon has resorted to a method of tracking electricity theft locally. Those who inform the authority about energy theft will get 40 per cent of the amount collected as penalty from the power thieves. This method could make people alert about pilferage of power in their locality. This may, in the long run, effectively decrease the overall level of energy consumption. The electric supply companies in West Bengal could easily adopt this method of curbing power theft.          
	Yours faithfully,        Anil Kumar Bhandari, Kharagpur
        
	Class apart          
	Sir  The teachers in West Bengal face utter humiliation during elections and census. Election and census duties form a mandatory part of their service. Ironically, these duties have to be carried out at the cost of academic assignments. Curricular activities come to a halt for about a fortnight and later, the teachers are criticized for not being able to finish the syllabi. Besides, government officials on election or census duties often misbehave with the teachers, who are academically far superior to them.          
	The authorities, therefore, in the interest of students, should try to relieve teachers of election and census duty.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  B.Ed degree holders are getting more and more preference over even Masters degree holders in the Regional Level Selection Test for schoolteachers and the School Service Commission examination. The National Council for Teacher Education has not cared to justify this discrimination. Earlier, one could acquire a B.Ed degree while working as a teacher, as a deputed candidate. But candidates are denied this chance today. Many deserving individuals are suffering as a result.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There is a large number of part-time teachers in the undergraduate colleges of the state. They are required to take ten to twelve classes per week, the number being equal to the number of classes taken by a reader; besides, the part-time teachers are expected to do other academic duties. But they are paid a paltry sum and treated as casual labourers. Thankfully, the state government has finally decided to absorb part-time teachers of undergraduate colleges among the permanent teaching staff and also to increase their salary. I would like to suggest that part-time teachers who are qualified in keeping with UGC rules be absorbed directly as lecturers. Those who do not fulfil the criteria may be allowed to upgrade their skills within a stipulated period of time.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The concept of midday meals has been effective in attracting students, checking dropout rates, spreading literacy and improving the quality of education and students health in our villages. But the scheme tends to take some basic facts for granted. The budget for midday meals is still too little to guarantee good-quality food. The cooks employed are often untrained in hygienic cooking methods. A steady supply of water, too, must be ensured if the cooking and cleaning processes are to meet the standards set by world bodies for children.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Dutta, Garbeta, West Midnapore

                
	Sir  There is a gulf between the retirement benefits offered to government employees and to teachers. These include pension, contributory provident fund, and also fixed deposits and monthly investment schemes. These disparities should be removed at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,

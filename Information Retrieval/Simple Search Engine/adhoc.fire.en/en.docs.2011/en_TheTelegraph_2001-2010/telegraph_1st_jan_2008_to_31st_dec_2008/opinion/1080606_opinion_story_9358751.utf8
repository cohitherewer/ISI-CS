	Just demand                  
	Sir  The editorial, A sensitive matter (June 1), offers an incisive analysis of the debate over the introduction of an English medium wing in government schools. It is our misfortune that the government is delaying the implementation of the proposal because it is eager to please its ally, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, which is sceptical about the idea. Having been a teacher in a government school for the last three decades, I think that introducing English as a medium of instruction alongside Bengali would be a judicious step. Fluency in English has become an absolute necessity in a competitive world. The school where I teach has Urdu and Bengali medium sections. For the last few years, the institution has had trouble getting the required number of students from classes I to IX. The Bengali section usually has to make do with less number of students than it can accommodate. In the Urdu section, the admission committee has no option but to take below-average students in each class only to keep the roll-strength intact. Even some of the better and well-known government schools like Hare School or Ballygunge Government High School have been facing the same problem, as very few students today are willing to jeopardize their careers by getting taught only in Bengali. The demand for English is evident in the fact that more and more English medium schools are being set up every year, and each of them seem to be doing good business.           
	The lack of infrastructure in government schools has also lead to their decline. The scheme to launch an English medium section in government schools might be a failure if trained teachers proficient in the language are not employed for the task.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S.A. Rahman Barkati, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The state governments dilly-dallying over introducing English in government-school curriculum has gone on for so long that nobody is surprised by it any more. The government had at last planned to do something to introduce English as a medium of instruction in schools. Now, even this plan  acknowledged by all as being a sound step towards improving secondary education in the state  has become a point of contention among the parties that make up the Left Front. The RSP, a coalition partner, has stated that the government needs to take a fresh look at this proposal since it is a sensitive matter. Many of the brightest students from the West Bengal board fail to do well in competitive examinations because of their poor grasp over the English language. With the opening up of the economy, lucrative jobs are now available with multi-national corporations, which provide high salaries and incentives. However, the employees need to be able to interact with ones clients and employers (who are, more often than not, Westerners) in English. Extremely capable students from government schools are thus losing out in this sphere too.           
	One wishes that the constituents of the Left Front government would not jeopardize the prospects of the children of this state in order to play out their own political battles.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shantanu Mehta, Burdwan

                
	Metro manners          
	Sir  Commuting on the Calcutta Metro has become nightmarish due to the insensitivity of a section of passengers. Some men and women prefer to stand at the gates and obstruct other passengers from boarding or alighting from the train. This happens even at times when the aisles have enough standing room. Women commuters are particularly inconvenienced as they need to manoeuvre their way past men who crowd around the doors. Some passengers stand on the vestibules between the coaches. Some even lean on the sliding doors, although there are posters on the train specifically advising passengers against this dangerous habit.           
	The authorities should take immediate and strict action to prevent these violations. Only then will the Metro be safe and comfortable and live up to its reputation of being Calcuttas pride.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bandana Sarkar, Calcutta

      
	Sir  I find it shameful that certain women lunge for the ladies seats as soon as the doors inside a Metro compartment open. At other times, these women force the aged and the infirm men to vacate the places reserved for women simply because these particular rows have been set aside for them. It is hardly lady-like behaviour to displace an old man because he could not find a seat in the general section and thus sought out the ladies seats.           
	Moreover, in many instances, these ladies do not even offer their seats to women with infants in their arms, choosing instead to let the latter stand precariously balancing a restless baby for the rest of the journey. Then there are the mothers little darlings  young boys whose voices are cracking and who are tall enough to reach the overhead rods  who sit by their mothers side even though they are old enough to stand. If perfectly self-reliant women can have seats designated for them, then the aged and the sick should be provided with the same facilities. Are the authorities listening?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rakhi Sen, Calcutta

                
	Erratum          
	Sir  My article titled, The right question (June 4), has referred to the finance minister of West Bengal as an alma mater rather than as an alumnus of MIT and Calcutta University. I regret my error.                    
	Yours faithfully,

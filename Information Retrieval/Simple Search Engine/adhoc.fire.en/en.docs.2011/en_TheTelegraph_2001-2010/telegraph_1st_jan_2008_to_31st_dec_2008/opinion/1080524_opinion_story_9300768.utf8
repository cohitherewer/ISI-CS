                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A DIFFERENT SUMMER                              Rita Datta      Visual Arts                                                
	What may draw you to CIMA Gallerys Summer Show (until July 5)  featuring 34 works by 30 artists  are the lesser-known names, mostly from outside Bengal.        
	Sanjay Sable, for example. Sables bovine creature is neither a bull nor a bison, but has been invented as an understated metaphor for a kind of casual, unthinking human savagery. The creature seems to have been kneaded into a deformed lump, its faceted head twisted towards the viewer, tongue out, a stumpy leg crushed against the torso, hoof cleanly chopped off, udders hanging at the bottom. A string passes through its nostrils as a sign of human ingenuity for using pain as a tool of enslavement. The neat execution, the clinical precision of the lines and the contrast between red and black shun rhetorical excesses. Indeed, no amount of blood and gore could be more unsettling than an animal trussed for the skewer, or tightly packaged for sale in giant tins.        
	From the little that has been seen of Sanjeev Sonpimpare in Calcutta, you sense that his dark humour perceives urban life split vertically or  as in his work, Collapsible Construct horizontally: the individual who is condemned to acrobatics to retrieve his balance. Must one stand on ones head to make sense of a topsy-turvy world? But the individual is divided in twofor hes collapsible, isnt he? The legs are upside down, the torso erect. But, may be, thats the headstand inverted along with the entire scene so that the bottom is actually up.         
	Another artist you would notice is Santosh More. His suspended block of cubicles is a harmony of interlocking geometric sections with a baffling play of perspectives that refer to architectural design gone surreal. As though the noted Iraqi British architect, Zaha Hadid, has met Ren Magritte. The brushwork is photographic, but the reality is subtly, artfully skewed, asking the eye to fathom the grammar of the construction.         
	The lucid economy of Prakash Ghadges drawing captures an island in a lake of white canvas, which is hauntingly isolated, though not lonely: it seems complete in its pristine, timeless being. Its woods are dark and deep, seductive in their hint of secrets with tall, slender trees throwing up delicately drawn canopies to the sky. Perhaps every man is an island after all, at the very core. Not easily accessible, though reaching out through tentative antennae. Like reflections on water that mesmerize with illusions of permanence, but dissolve on touch.        
	The two artists who carry the tribal tradition in their works are Bhuribai and Mayank Kumar Shyam. The former uses acrylic but the quaint, quirky, capricious motifs lose nothing of their charm. The latters spry pen weaves a filigree of branches and twigs that radiate from a fluted trunk rooted in human forms (picture). Both, significantly enough, reject anthropocentrism, locating human beings in Nature, not in control of it.        
	At the opposite end of this idyll stands Rameshwar Broota. The painter resorts to a photographic blow-up to throw, quite in your face, a zoomed-in image thats brutal and insidiously violent. The man in uniform is de-humanized in excerption, his face left beyond the frame, the focus is on his gun and some rusted, painted, machinery ominous in their anonymity. The counterpoint of mute white space, which doesnt exist in reality, erases context to underline the ageless relevance of the close-up.         
	Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar appears proclamatory in her wasteland terrain that upturns romantic notions of the landscape, while Kingshuk Sarkars triptych could be apocalyptic with greater thought. For the layers and layers of chopped logs with charred bark and tender, torn, raw wood is not without a touch of surreal horror, while the grieving girl who stands in the middle could possibly convey more if she were reduced in size and the ashen earth around her magnified. Sumitro Basaks hollow men are contemporary, urban, bristling with tension, crouching frog-like, or pinning down what looks like a white umbra, but poised to spring. As hollow are the man and woman in Uday Mandals work, headpieces shorn of identity, bodies of substance, conjured with hefty strokes that lend them no dimension.        
	Then theres Madhuri Kathe with a threadbare weave of sagging woof and weft; Dilip Kumar Samantas ordered space of neat colour segments that recall print design; Shambhavis inflections of orange touched with burn imprints of soot; Shakilas unusual collage; and Palaniappan whose edgy, bleeding cont lines seem to etch cryptic ground plans, scorching the paper surface and taking sharp turns as though deflecting pursuers.

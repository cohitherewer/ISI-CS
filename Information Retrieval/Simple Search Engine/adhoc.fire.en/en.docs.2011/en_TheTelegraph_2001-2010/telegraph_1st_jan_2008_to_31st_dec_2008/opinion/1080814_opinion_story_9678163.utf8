	This is how some wars begin: not with a bang but with a whimper. Earlier this year, as Kosovars went mad with joy after declaring their independence from Serbia, another no-mans land called South Ossetia appealed to the world to recognize its autonomy as well. But nobody seemed to be listening. The West was too smug to bother, relishing every bit of its triumph over the old enemy, Russia, which had naturally supported the Serbians. In March 2008, as South Ossetias cry for help went unheeded, its next-door neighbour, Georgia, locked in a bitter quarrel with Russia for supremacy over this region, made a bid to join the Nato. This move, keenly supported by the United States of America, prompted Russia to back South Ossetias demand for self-determination. As the latter refused a power-sharing deal with Georgia last April, the crisis escalated irreparably, assuming its deadliest form in the war that had broken out between Georgian and separatist South Ossetian forces, with Russian troops rallying behind the latter, though now halting action. It is uncertain who threw the first stone; but the origin of this war goes back two centuries, to the time when Georgia and South Ossetia were annexed to the Russian empire.        
	If the roots of the crisis lie in Russian imperialism, these were deepened over the long 20th century. First, Georgias independence after the Russian Revolution in 1918 created a rift between the two nations. Then, in the post-Soviet era, Georgia never reconciled itself to South Ossetias aspirations for self-determination, nor did it stop resenting Russian peacekeeping forces in the region carrying out a de facto regime. Russias imperiousness remains palpable even today as its president, Dmitry Medvedev, gloated after his forces had punished Georgia, killing more than 2,000 civilians. The great hand behind this theatre of war belongs, as usual, to the US, and, to a lesser extent, to the European Union. Georgia remains one of the strongest allies to the US, sending the largest number of troops, after Britain, to Iraq. A key transit point for the Caspian Sea oil reserves to travel into Europe, Georgia is crucial for the EU. But apart from a few strong words, there is nothing much that the West can do to Russia. Military action, even expulsion from the G8, are not sensible options. As Russia cuddles up to its Soviet allies, the ghost of the Cold War lingers on too menacingly to be ignored.

                                                                                                                                    END OF HOPE
                          
	Even the most tattered of ceasefires holds out a shred of hope for the political resolution of violent conflict. But with the Mahinda Rajapakse government deciding to annul its six-year ceasefire agreement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Sri Lanka might be heading towards what a Colombo analyst has called all-out war. Civil strife in Sri Lanka is into its third decade. The death toll, since the start of the Tigers First Eelam War in 1983, is around 70,000. Of this, more than 5,000 belong to the period beginning from early 2006, and more than 200 have blown themselves up as suicide-bombers. Meanwhile, the Indian government has tried to do its peacekeeping, with more-or-less disastrous consequences, followed by attempts in Geneva (intermittently respected by the rebels), and most recently and least hopelessly by the Norwegians. But the annulment of the ceasefire might result in even the Norwegians giving up in despair. The progress they had made has now been pushed back by about a decade, and if the Nordic monitors depart from Sri Lanka they would be leaving the country in the grips of a war to which there seems to be no end in sight.
    
	Yet, this sequence of military skirmishes alternating with suicide attacks, interspersed with largely ineffectual international efforts at peace, runs parallel to the significant growth in the countrys economy. Sri Lankans enjoy possibly the highest per capita standard of living in south Asia. And this, paradoxically, provides the context in which the Tamil experience of being an ethnic, religious and linguistic minority has to be understood. The end of the ceasefire signifies the official endorsement of a burgeoning militarism on the part of the State that has been the underside of a chauvinism since soon after Sri Lankas independence from British rule in 1948. Continual human rights offences and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians have been the concern of the international community as well. Both the government and the LTTE have to be held accountable for these. The rebels see their relationship with successive governments as a process of broken promises. If the president hopes to return to constitutional means of negotiating for peace after weakening the rebels with a spell of hardcore militarism, then an unflinching look at this bloody process should provoke some harder thinking.

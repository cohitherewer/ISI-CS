	My first and last lessons in cross-dressing (and cross-singing) were given to me in Class V. This was St Xaviers in the Seventies, and I had been chosen to play Snow White. The Disney musical version was going to be the school play that year. I had terrible teeth but an angelic soprano. So a combination of Mrs Mesquitas relentless voice-training, Miss Petersons resounding slaps, Mrs DSouzas wedding dress and wig, and Father Sassels saintlike geniality turned me, in a few months, into a coloratura addict, relishing my two hours in white lace, unshakeable in my faith that some day my Prince will come. But our singing classes with Mrs Mesquita ended with primary school, although, by that time, my musical life had shifted focus to the School of Music, where a terror more profound than that induced by Miss Petersons slaps began to form around the apparently delightful act of learning to play the violin with Mr Dutt. But there was now a clear division between my musical education and formal education. It was only much later, when I started teaching literature to undergraduates, that I began to put these two halves of my life together. And now I find it impossible to teach or write about anything literary or visual without using music, although I havent played the violin for two decades.        
	When Miss Peterson was our class teacher in Class IV, she had taught us how, while reading aloud from our Radiant Reader, we must read ahead, just with our eyes, the next few words even before the mouth started to form them out loud, so that the reading remained unbroken. In my ensemble classes at the CSM with Mr Dutt, I was learning, around the same time, how to read music with one eye while keeping the other one on the conductors baton, and how to listen to ones own playing with one ear while listening to the rest of the orchestra with the other, and finally, how to engage in all four of these optical and auditory activities simultaneously. This didnt need genius to pull off: just solid teaching, some terror and a bit of practice.        
	I realize now that these early lessons in reading text and music were radically formative of the way I deal with sequences and simultaneities as an adult. They taught me how to respond to and process, first, anything that happens all at once but at several levels together, and second, things that gradually unfold in time and/or space, like a film or even just the flow of everyday life, talk or experience. In essence, these two teachers were working on the same lobe of my brain, and it doesnt matter if I havent turned out to be Yehudi Menuhin at the end of it. Later, in university, my favourite professor told us about the synchronic and the diachronic in Saussurean linguistics, and I realized, in a flash, that synchronic was Miss Peterson and diachronic was Mr Dutt. Now when I teach Shakespeares sonnets or struggle to formulate why Bachs music was important in Bergmans films, I cant organize what I want to say without taking recourse to these fundamental structures of life and of thought: the synchronic and the diachronic, Miss P and Mr D.        
	This is why I think it is unfortunate that children have to have fairly well-to-do parents in order to have a basic musical education within some sort of a classical tradition, Eastern or Western. And when they do manage to go to a school that offers music lessons, these classes often stop at the primary level, and end up teaching nothing but a few popular tunes and how to fool around with an electronic keyboard. The deadening utilitarianism of Indian secondary and higher secondary education, elite as well as plebeian, leaves no room for activities that are not going to help at all in any of the board or entrance examinations.        
	Even if children cannot be taught to play or sing up to professional standards, the discipline of learning the rudimentary structures of music or of simply learning to sit quietly and listen to excellent music in a more-or-less informed way so that it becomes an inward habit can be profoundly educative. But for this to happen, the singing teacher should not be working in isolation from the other teachers, but in tandem with, say, the history, literature and language teachers, and eventually with the physics and mathematics teachers.        
	Good music  like good books, films and pictures  not only makes us better human beings, but it also teaches us how to think, connect and communicate in more complex, yet also more lucid, ways. This is more than a question of learning a few tunes. And its got very little to do with being cool.

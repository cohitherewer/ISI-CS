                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THE RIGHT QUESTION                          - A government of 30 years should be a model of peace					 					      Dipankar Dasgupta                                                        
	This is the beginning of the end, the Bengal governments major political opponent has announced. What the forecast has left unclear though is whether the pronouncement applies to the government in power or the state of West Bengal itself. The question is, as Henri Poincar had aptly observed, what is the question? and the trillion-dollar-question for us now is which question is more relevant to ask. Is the Left Front on its way out? Or, is the state of West Bengal about to wither away?         
	And indeed, it is impossible to resist asking such questions after watching a news conference on television where the commonly perceived nemesis of the leftists offered for our consumption one of the greatest puns ever employed in the history of mankind. Following the victory in Singur, the leader under reference described Ratan Tatas Nano as Naa-No. Not once, not twice, but countless times.         
	One does not need to be a Bengali to figure out that naa is the Bengali synonym for the English word, no. The clearly expressed sentiment that dominates the celebration in the opposition camp, therefore, is a solid negative, unless of course the more imaginative among us were to interpret the double negative as a positive forecast that a rosy future awaits our state.         
	Needless to say, few sensible persons would entertain the latter hope. Among other things, the manner in which the Kolkata Municipal Corporation was handed over to the leftists on a platter by the Naa-No philosopher will keep the memories of the citys inhabitants tender for a long while yet, for a well-meaning mayor fell prey to the Naa-No predator, resulting in a withdrawal of many of the amenities of decent urban life. And, though public memories dont last too long, one may also remember the questionable performance of the Naa-No railway ministry during a certain period of the National Democratic Alliance rule.               
	There is little point drawing up a long list of pure negatives offered over the years by the detractors of the state government. The effort would amount to banality at best and evoke nausea at worst. Except to warily await the possible victory celebrations or bandhs that could freeze civil life in the near future, there is little that one can expect from these self-professed underwriters of progress, should the leftists be dislodged from power. But the latter event, surely, is a distant possibility.         
	Dispensing with the opposition by highlighting repeated instances of its dismal incompetence is a relatively easy task. It would be dishonest, however, not to employ the same scales to weigh the achievements of the government itself. Any attempt to do so reveals immediately where the true tragedy lies. Leave alone Poincar, any man in the street would have little problem in posing questions about the Left Fronts performance that cry out for answers.         
	What necessitated, for example, the bloodshed that accompanied the elections? Is it not a reflection on the competence of the government that democratic elections cannot be held peacefully except under the surveillance of the Central Reserve Police Force? The question that looms uppermost in ones mind does not relate to the identity of the murderers, but why and how the murders were committed in the first place. Surely, a government that has been in power for more than 30 years is expected to be a model of stability, peace and prosperity, especially so in a democratic society. Yet, this same government, which has gone hoarse yelling away in self-admiration and turning the public literally deaf with listening to the noise of Marxist slogans, has ended up accusing its opponents of inviting death among the rank and file. One does not suggest that the opposition forces did not accumulate arms and ammunition to prepare themselves for the upcoming elections. What one wishes to know is how they could so prepare themselves if the government had been successful in the maintenance of law and order.         
	That law and order is no longer a concern for the ruling party was adequately proved by the home ministrys handling of the Rizwanur Rahman case. Few people discuss the incident any more, though it is hardly one that occurred during the Maurya period of Indias history. Memories are raw in the public mind, but literally no one is left in this society who expects a clean resolution of the case and the criminals brought to justice. Likewise, buses racing down the streets, murdering innocent men, women and children with the police turning a blind eye every other day is a matter of serious concern. All hopes of a cleaner society have disappeared and a cruelly cheated community is sinking everyday into abysmal cynicism.         
	The Left Fronts inadequacies are not confined to a malfunctioning home ministry alone. The rot lies deeper. Amongst its many other colossal failures lies the disaster it has wreaked on erstwhile educational institutions of repute. The perception of the government and the Left parties that academic institutions of excellence are elitist, and hence non-Marxist entities, is suicidal to say the least and would have put even a Stalinist Soviet Union to shame (though not China probably). The leftists, by preventing such institutions from flourishing, leaving their management largely in the hands of sycophants with questionable academic credibility, have become qualitatively indistinguishable from those in the United Progressive Alliance government who, overtly or covertly, offer their blessings to people recommending Rahul Gandhi as the prime minister designate. Besides, destroying the eminence-wise hierarchy among teaching institutions is tantamount to treating Harvard University as equivalent to Idaho State College. One cannot help asking where the ministers themselves would prefer to send their children if asked to choose between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Burdwan University. Clearly, Mahatma Gandhi, the father of this nation, would probably have gone for the latter, but we have travelled a long way since the Mahatmas days and even the finance minister of the state is justifiably respected more for being an alma mater of MIT than of the University of Calcutta.               
	However painful this may sound, one cannot help being reminded of Orwells Animal Farm by the communists in power in this state. There is telling evidence now that all men are not equal anymore. Land acquisition in Singur is a clear case in point. A century-old act was invoked and land purchased at throwaway prices from unsuspecting farmers. No question or opposition was tolerated, while Ratan Tata was accorded royal treatment for condescending to grace the state by his presence at negligible cost to himself. No plans have yet been clearly formulated for rehabilitating the displaced. It is no wonder that Nandigram was watching the events with wary disapproval and we dont need to go through the gory details of what ensued. In the face of opposition, the government relented and beat a hasty retreat. The result of this duplicity  attack when you are strong and keep out of harms way when you are weak has been clearly borne out by the district elections. There is little doubt that people affected by the highhandedness of the government have lost faith in it, though it would be a monumental error to conclude that they are reposing faith now in the opposition or the city-bred intellectuals in search of a cause. The villagers have fought their own battle to ensure that their means of livelihood are not snatched away.         
	Had they been clearly exposed to the governments vision surrounding an industrialized society, if it has one, the saga of violence and destruction could have been avoided. What sparked off the events was the hurry to industrialize, willy-nilly as it were. One suspects that industrialization and growth will take a back seat now and the scarcest of resources, time, will be wasted tackling an opposition which has never been known for constructive criticism.

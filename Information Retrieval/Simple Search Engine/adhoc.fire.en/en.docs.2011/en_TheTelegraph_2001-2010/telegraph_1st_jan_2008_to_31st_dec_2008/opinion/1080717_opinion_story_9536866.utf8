The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Mate for the soul
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MATE FOR THE SOUL                                                                  
	I still remember the maudlin expression on my friends face as she gushingly described her new lover to me. Although I was too intrigued by that look of unqualified idiocy on the face of an otherwise intelligent woman to pay enough attention to what she was saying, one of her comments struck me, if only because it was more inane than the rest. She said that her beloved, following Paulo Coelho, has said that sexual ecstasy can last for only 11 minutes. Love has to be more than physical if the bliss were to be prolonged, or so Coelho advocates. What my friend would have me consider as an undoubted sign of her lovers ardour was the fact that he had promised her more than 11 minutes of sexual rapture, beside a lifetime of spiritual love. I was too flabbergasted to duly support my friends conviction, as was expected of me. But with a vengeance I decided later to look up the author who has brought such mush into the world.         
	The first Coelho book I could lay my hands on was The Alchemist and it confirmed my suspicion that the author was one of those ageing flower children who now sell pop Karma and Nirvana in their novels to make a living. Predictably, Coelhos books are much adored in this world ruled by leadership gurus. Coelhos website declares that he is the Messenger of Peace for the UN and the Unescos special counsellor for Intercultural Dialogues and Spiritual Convergences. Many MBA courses recommend the reading of The Alchemist to their students. The story of Coelhos life has all the elements usual in people who love to portray themselves as martyrs: incarceration in a mental asylum, kidnap and torture by assailants because of his advocacy of freedom of expression and then the life-changing pilgrimage to Santiago where he had the epiphany. Coelhos website has a slide-show in which his quotes appear against the background of dull, picturesque locations. It reminded me of the garish posters that often adorn the walls of seedy wayside hotels declaring the God is love, Love is great (sometimes, gret) and the like.        
	When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it  thus spake Coelho in The Alchemist. I had tried hard to put myself in the shoes of those people who find this inspiring but a feeling of drowsy numbness has thwarted my attempts. I turned to some of his more recent books in the hope that they might provide the key to his charms. Interestingly, I found that at least two of them, Brida and The Witch of Portobello, have girls suggestively showing their well-sculpted bare backs on the front cover. The eponymous Brida is about the heroines search for her Soulmate.The recommendations for making this quest fruitful include lighting candles and dancing to the rhythm of the world. The novel also helpfully supplies the answer to the question that every young girl is supposed to ask  how will I know who my Soulmate is? By watching out for a particular light in the eye, or, alternatively, for a point of light above the left shoulder of your Soulmate, says Coelho. I can now understand why he is so popular among those cute young boys and girls for whom the year starts from February 14.         
	Coelhos Like the Flowing River records his encounter with a girl who seems to be the original behind Brida  she sings hymns unbidden in a deserted chapel. The way Coelho shows her his appreciation is quite appalling, and gives an inkling of what The Alchemist myth is all about  he sends her a copy of one of his own books by post.

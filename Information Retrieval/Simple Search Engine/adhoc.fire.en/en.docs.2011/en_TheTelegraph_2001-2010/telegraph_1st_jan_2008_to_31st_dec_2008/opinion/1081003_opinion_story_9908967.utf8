                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FRAIL MEN, GOUTY WOMEN, AND TEDIOUS HISTORIES                                                                  
	The Immigrant By Manju Kapur,
   Random House, Rs 395        
	It is quite baffling that Manju Kapur should think that one is still interested in the immigrant experience after having every other book that comes out in the market harping on it. It is even more puzzling that she should believe that the readers would consider her version of the theme worthy of attention simply because she sets her story in the Seventies, when Indians were just beginning to migrate to the West and so were experiencing the anguish of deracination for the first time. However, Kapur takes no great pains to recreate the Seventies in her novel. Apart from a few references to the Emergency and Morarji Desai that stick out of the narrative, there is nothing to remind the readers that the action takes place in a time different from theirs. As a result, The Immigrant reads like yet another hackneyed tale on the problems of adjustment of the diaspora, and the reader can only yawn tearfully from start to finish before finally nodding off.         
	However, to give Kapur her due, there is something in her novel that might make at least some readers sit up in the middle. If you have always wondered what the likes of Dr Lodh do to cure erectile dysfunction, The Immigrant can provide some valuable information on the topic. The novel centres around the failed marriage of a thirty-something professor of English, Nina, and an Indian doctor settled in Canada, Ananda. Their arranged marriage proves to be a disaster chiefly because Ananda cannot satisfy Nina in bed. As Ananda sleeps soundly every night after a short and abrupt act, his starving wife has to masturbate herself to sleep  Maybe if she did it one more time, sleep would come. With a strong sense of duty her hand slid between her legs. To quell Ninas dissatisfaction, Ananda visits a sex therapist in California. The therapy, which continues for two weeks, involves learning to copulate slowly and steadily with a surrogate. The description of Anandas enriching experience continues for pages, at the end of which comes the breathtaking moment when Ananda tries his newfound knowledge on his wife. He introduces his penis to her, her old friend and betrayer. Look, this is how you have to hold it. And, They had sex all weekend. If the marriage still breaks down after all this, nobody can accuse at least Ananda of not having tried hard enough.        
	Presumably, we are to feel sympathy for Nina in the novel since she leaves her home in Delhi only to be bitterly disappointed with her new life in Canada. There are long sermons on the predicament of women who crossed the seas to marry men living in unseen lands. Having left her homeland far behind, Nina feels the pain of not belonging in the distant shores she settles in. Her pain is compounded by her estrangement from her husband. Unfortunately, one cannot help but feel that Nina richly deserves her fate. If an educated, financially independent woman has nothing to think of but her womb, her ovaries, her uterus, the unfertilised eggs that were expelled every month on her thirtieth birthday, then there is a strong possibility that she will end up suffering Ninas fate. Nina marries not with any expectation of love or companionship but only for the sake of begetting children. When Anandas hurried acts fail to produce the desired result, she turns reluctantly to her studies as a poor alternative. If Ananda later takes a Canadian lover, Nina too finds one among her university friends. But she cannot settle down without a child, and the thought of adoption only fills her with alarm. She brands herself a sterile woman who is helpless, out of control and with no confidence in her femininity. When she is not thinking of her ovaries, she masturbates on the commode and chews the cud of self-pity.         
	The novel is so dreadfully boring that even the ridiculous typos provide some relief. Minuscule is spelt miniscule, not once but thrice, and breastfeeding becomes Beast feeding. Coming in the middle of Ninas endless and irritating ruminations about her thwarted life, the last-mentioned typo, in the sentence, Beast feeding was not the simple, natural exercise she had thought it was is bound to give rise to some unintended hilarity. And as part of the lectures delivered to Nina on the ways of adapting to life in a foreign land, the phrase, In Rome, do as Romans do is repeated umpteen times by different characters.        
	The woman on the front cover of the novel, staring out of a window on the white bleakness beyond, must have been intended as a visual counterpart to the lonely Nina. If one looks closely, this lady has gouty, misshapen feet that do not quite match her slim figure. Perhaps we are to understand that immigrant women in the Seventies got the gout when they were almost thirty, were sexually frustrated and sterile.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

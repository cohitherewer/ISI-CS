	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme is the United Progressive Alliance governments most ambitious and expensive innovation. It aims to give a hundred days employment at a decent but not extravagant wage to any villager who is prepared to do manual work. The minimum wage fixed for the programme is Rs 60 a day, but most states have been paying Rs 80-100. The government considers the programme its foremost achievement. But there was also scepticism about giving money to district administrations to spend. The programme seemed well designed for bureaucrats and politicians to siphon off money. Whether and how far they do so would always be difficult to establish. But if it is assumed that there is no corruption, the spread of the programme suggests that it is useful but not overwhelmingly so. The figures of the number of people who have registered for work, which have just become available, give an indication of where the programme fulfils the greatest need and under what circumstances it is likely to work best.        
	Thus, in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the number of registrations comes to 10 per cent of the 2001 rural population. Since only about a half of the population is in the workforce, this means that almost two-fifths of workers in this rural heartland have registered. Many may not have registered because they do not know about the programme, or because they do not need work, or because of the lethargy of district administrations. But the numbers are such that the programme cannot be dismissed as unnecessary or a failure. These two are states with low non-agricultural employment, so it is not surprising that they have attracted the highest proportion of villagers. Orissa, with seven per cent registration, is similar. What is surprising is that registrations are also high in Andhra Pradesh  eight per cent  and Tamil Nadu  six per cent  for these are among the most successful states in their development in recent decades. The explanation probably lies in their dryness. The monsoon in these states is short and uncertain. Agricultural wage earnings in them are variable, and their lack of stability perhaps leads workers to take up off-season work.        
	The monsoon is hardly uncertain or inadequate in West Bengal, which comes next with six per cent registration. This can only be due to the character of the government, and its tentacles through the party organization that extend into the villages. It is impossible to say what assets have been created with the labour employed under the programme. But the machinery for spending the money, 90 per cent of which comes from the Central government, is largely in place; and the money spent will certainly benefit some Bengalis. It would be heartening, however, if the West Bengal government could convince people that it would be spent on deserving workers creating socially useful assets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | down the drain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DOWN THE DRAIN                                                    
	There are certain kinds of human error that baffle the rational mind  if at all they can be called errors. Imagine getting a loan of Rs 1,200 crore for a municipal project, and then, after Rs 500 crore of that money has already been spent, noticing suddenly that the entire plan was founded on mistaken principles and everything done so far had to be undone before work could continue in the right direction. This is exactly what seems to have happened to the Calcutta Municipal Corporations project for relieving a vast stretch of southern Calcutta (including Behala, Thakurpukur, Tollygunge and Netaji Subhas Road) of acute waterlogging. It was only accidentally that the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project discovered, while conducting a survey, that the money borrowed by the Corporation from the Asian Development Bank was being used up in repairing and redirecting an extensive drainage system according to a plan that would have ended up having an effect that was exactly opposite of what is required. The initial plan was made on a superficial, preliminary survey, without making region-specific tests. So what was imagined, and what has been achieved so far have gone in completely contrary directions. If the work had been done along these lines, then not only would the entire money  Rs 1,200 crore  have gone down the drain, as it were, but all these areas would have been waterlogged more acutely than ever before, quite apart from the inconvenience suffered already by the people in these areas from the upheaval caused by the project.        
	How can the municipality, together with the present mayor and his predecessor, get away with irresponsibility of such colossal proportions? The usual dodging of accountability has already started, with the usual shamelessness. The need for doing something in this area was so urgent that the authorities plunged into the project without stopping to reflect on what they were about to do. This is the ridiculous excuse that is doing the rounds now. The total and nonchalant inability to handle vast sums of money in an efficient, transparent and accountable way does not raise just the question of competence or knowhow, but also more sinister issues of how taxpayers are being taken for a ride on an unimaginably massive scale.

                                                                                                                 STATE AT STAKE                                                    
	The Centre of Indian Trade Unions inhabits its own illusory world. It is so self-contained and hermetically sealed that the Citu has not yet realized its own irrelevance to its parent party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). There is no better testimony to this self-delusion than the bizarre situation that while the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is wooing investors in south India even while attending the party congress in Coimbatore, the Citu is contemplating declaring a strike in Haldia Petrochemicals, one of the most important industrial units in West Bengal. The Citu is oblivious to the fact that the party is backing Mr Bhattacharjees industrial drive, and that a strike at this juncture in Haldia Petrochemicals can adversely affect the image of the state and the chief ministers attempts to woo investors. A strike will only bring back all the old associations about West Bengal being a state where production is hampered because of labour militancy. For over two decades, West Bengal suffered because workers under the red flag were more interested in strikes and agitations than in production. It was assumed that this is how things should be in a state ruled by the CPI(M). It is only in the last few years that things have begun to change.        
	The change is related to a new orientation brought about by Mr Bhattacharjee, and also to the general recognition from within the CPI(M) that the party and the state are both doomed without economic development. Mr Bhattacharjee has succeeded, to an extent, in instilling among investors the faith that their money and their profits are safe in West Bengal. This faith cannot be allowed to be broken by the Citu, which wants to further its narrow interests at the expense of the overall policy being pursued by the chief minister of West Bengal. The importance of Haldia Petrochemicals in the project to transform the economy of West Bengal cannot be denied. It is also a fact that because of factors that are external to the manufacturing unit, it has entered a difficult business cycle. Under the circumstances, a strike on any pretext will spell disaster. The minister for industries, Nirupam Sen, struck the right note when he said that production should not be hampered. But the fact of a strike threat casts a very dark shadow on the future of West Bengal.

	A cluster of Rabindrasangeet singers presented Baishe at Gyan Manch on September 18. The entire programme was structured beautifully by the writer, Bani Basu, who strung together the solo, duet and choral songs with a script that was as brilliantly conceived as it was narrated by the writer herself. The best thing about the show was that there were very few jarring notes, be it in the singing, in the musical accompaniment or in coordination among the artists. Of the solo songs, Prabuddha Rahas Pather shesh kothay, Aniruddha Sinhas Chinile na amare ki, Jayasree Dass Amar milan lagi and Sukanya Naths Ke boshile aji deserve special mention. But the best offerings were the duets because of the perfect harmony between the well-chosen pairs. Sukanya Nath and Aniruddha Sinha sang Andhar raate ekla pagol with a lot of feeling. Nath was joined by Sutanu Mitra in Mor hridayer gopon bijan ghare, while Ilina Mitra and Prabuddha Raha came together to sing Tomar sur shunaye. Swapan Saha (Jokhon porbe na more payer chinha) and Dipanwita Mukherjee (Aha tomar shonge praner khela) gave competent performances. Nath, as the musical adviser, must be lauded for doing a good job. This is a group from which one expects more in the coming days.

	Banal and boring        
	It is easy to guess the purpose of the exhibition of photographs, titled Darjeelings Ts (Sept 23-28), by Gnter Wehrmann from its venue. Displayed at the Promenade Lounge of Taj Bengal, the photographs were obviously meant for the foreigners to whose sense of the exotic the Misty Mall or the rolling tea gardens might still appeal. However, the images were an insult even to the banal expectations of the wide-eyed tourist. Wehrmann has followed the policy of shoot-at-sight, since neither the colour nor the composition of the photographs was faintly interesting. There were the predictable pictures of colourful shops with bored sellers, a bashful Red Panda among the foliage, a porter bent over with his load in Chowk Bazaar and, of course, the toy train. They looked like tacky images torn from a calendar on Darjeeling and then put inside expensive frames. The captions were enlightening. Wehrmann claims to have envision[ed] the matted hair, forehead, eyebrows and lashes of the slumbering Shiva in the form of Kanchenjunga.

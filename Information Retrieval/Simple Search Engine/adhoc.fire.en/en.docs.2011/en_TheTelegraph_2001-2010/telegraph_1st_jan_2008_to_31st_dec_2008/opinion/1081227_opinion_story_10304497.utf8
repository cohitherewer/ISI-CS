                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LESS TALK, MORE ACTION                          - This is not the time for propaganda overkill        Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                            Story in the making                                              
	Both A.R. Antulays bloomer and General Ashfaq Parvez Kayanis boast underline the need for some national rethinking. They suggest that India should be far more firm with Pakistan, substituting effective action short of war for extravagant rhetoric, while making certain that Indian Muslims are not affected by the hysteria in which popular television anchors often appear to indulge.        
	Far from being only the medium, TV is the message that overwhelms all else, shaping the thinking of millions of viewers who have little time for the printed word. This can be dangerous for frenzied commentaries accompanying dramatic visuals gloss over the nuances of Pranab Mukherjees elements in Pakistan or Asif Ali Zardaris non-state actors. Television can be both misleading and mischievous. Commentators gloated, for instance, that China had slapped down Pakistan when China had slapped down India by equating the burgled with the burglar, a tactic the Americans also favour. Again, when the screen showed the statement by Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader, threatening to send thousands of well-armed militants to fight India, the commentator turned it into thousands of well-armed terrorists. Competition between channels is not the only reason. Television has become the national adda, cause and effect of what is best described by another Bengali word  hujug  whose dictionary translation as a passing popular excitement or trend misses the originals infectious effervescence. Accuracy and objectivity are not outstanding features of adda or hujug.              
	Abroad, the media are accepted as Indias disguised official voice. No one has ever acknowledged how much credibility radio and newspapers  TV was not a factor then  lost in the run-up to the Bangladesh war because of glowing daily reports of the Mukti Bahinis glorious victories, territorial gains and destruction of Pakistani men and arms, capped by the fiction of Mujibnagar. Though fully behind India and the liberation of Bangladesh, the worlds media ridiculed the hyperbole that reduced a good cause to an exercise in exuberant jingoism. It wasnt only that our medias patriotism ran away with its professionalism. That was what authority decreed. I remember a briefing when the army spokesman asked me to present the same incident differently if I was writing for an Indian or foreign newspaper.        
	India must not again compromise a sound case with propaganda overkill. Of course, we are not alone in weaving tales. The late J.N. Dixit dismissed as utter poppycock American claims of averting an India-Pakistan war in 1990. Richard Haass, who accompanied Robert Gates to India in a special White House plane that the senior George Bush, then president, sent specially to fetch him from Moscow, told me the subcontinents intensely menacing atmosphere reminded him of Barbara Tuchmans evocative recreation of the eve of World War I in The Guns of August. One day, Condoleezza Rice might describe to some other journalist how she rushed to Delhi in December 2008 to prevent India invading Pakistan. There is enough sabre-rattling in the public domain, backed by the deliberate obfuscation of the external affairs ministers harping on all options, to substantiate the claim. It would be a great feather in the cap for a lame-duck George W. Bush to boast that in the closing hours of an inglorious presidency he trumped Dads achievement and dragged two nuclear powers back from the brink of Armageddon.        
	American commitment to Pakistan  which goes back to even before the British left the subcontinent  is a permanent feature of regional power politics. It will not change unless there is a major cataclysm such as turned Washington against its other faithful protg, Iran. India should factor that, as well as Chinas support for Pakistan, into its foreign policy calculations. The more India grows, the greater will be Chinas need for a Trojan Horse in the subcontinent.        
	These are the facts of life in a tough neighbourhood where the mix of hot air and inaction can only encourage Pakistanis to call Indias bluff by mounting more guerrilla attacks. History repeats itself. Pervez Musharrafs Operation Badr replicated Ayub Khans Operation Gibraltar, which had points in common with the 1947 invasion of Kashmir. Significantly, both Operations Gibraltar and Badr had been drawn up many years before they were actually put into motion. This continuity in Pakistani thinking and planning even while signing water-sharing treaties, shaking hands in Shimla, operating the Samjhauta Express, wielding the willow or engaging in composite dialogues makes nonsense of anxiety in some quarters in India about endangering a nascent democracy. There is no divergence between Pakistans military and civilian authorities when it comes to India.         
	Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was fond of quoting Palmerstons famous dictum about a country not having eternal allies or perpetual enemies but only interests that are eternal and perpetual. We have been left in no doubt about those interests. Pakistan feels it was cheated at partition of territorial, riverine, military and financial assets. It seeks to avenge Bangladesh, regain the Siachen glacier, and, above all, slip in the missing k in the countrys name. What is not mentioned is that a politically stable, economically successful, secular democracy next door with 160 million Muslims whose leaders feel confident enough to defy majority opinion, as Antulay did, challenges the basic premise of the Islami Jamhuria-e-Pakistan.         
	This minority could be Indias invaluable ballast for secular stability. But that demands proper handling as well as proper responses. The angularities of some Muslims is a complex subject that calls for separate examination. What is worrying is not the cynicism of the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal legislators who rallied to Antulay in hopes of winning votes but the psychology of voters who lap up such wooing. Across the communal divide, the tunnel-vision bigots who send me abusive letters for not equating Hinduism with nationalism do not understand that either India lives in multicultural harmony or it doesnt live at all. The worlds second or third largest Muslim community cannot be forcibly converted, driven into the Arabian Sea or liquidated through some other form of final solution. The danger of irresponsible comments such as Antulays is not Pakistani exploitation (that propaganda war needs no excuse) but that they play to the domestic Islamist gallery and justify a Hindu backlash. It was heartening in this context to read of 6,000 ulema from all over the country condemning Islamist terrorism. That, like the denunciations of many ordinary as well as stellar Muslims, should help to pacify Hindus who suspect all Indian Muslims of constituting a fifth column.              
	This is no time for divided loyalties or political posturing. Only a united India can respond to Pakistan with the vigour that should have been evident right at the start. Cancelling a cricket tour is neither here nor there unless it is part of an overall boycott. While there can be no meaningful composite dialogue with Pakistanis who are trying to destroy India, a joint terror mechanism only perpetuates the pretence that Pakistan, too, is a victim of terrorism. Its murderous internal politics amounting to civil war which killed Benazir Bhutto is not the same as the Islamist terrorism that attacked Mumbai.         
	All governments know how far they can go with Taiwan or Tibet without provoking Chinas immediate retaliation. India would be accorded the same deference if it demonstrates its seriousness by drastically limiting ties with Pakistan, restricting travel, implementing economic sanctions and urging friends in the international community to do the same or be exposed as abetting terrorism. Israel has shown both that there cannot be any half-measures when it comes to security and that others acquiesce in the most stringent precautions that are necessary for survival. India must take the lead in its own defence if Manmohan Singh wants the international community to use its power to persuade Pakistan to abide by the United Nations security council resolutions on ending terrorism. That means less talk and more action.

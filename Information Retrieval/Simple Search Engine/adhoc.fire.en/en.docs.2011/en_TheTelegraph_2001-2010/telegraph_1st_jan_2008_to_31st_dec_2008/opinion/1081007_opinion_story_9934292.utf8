	There is nothing sudden about the violence that has overtaken two districts of Assam and is spilling over into a third, although it may have been triggered off by a confrontation over cattle between tribal guards and raiders from the minority community. The unrest can be said to have been simmering since August, when students groups began picking out members of the minority community as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. The vigilantes did not always bother to discriminate  among Indian citizens, migrants and migrants-turned-Indian citizens, or even between migrants from Bihar and Bangladesh. But the hostility towards immigrant settlers has a far longer history. It has grown rather than lessened, accompanied by increasing fears about changes in the demographic balance. The long view is unnerving, because the intensity of the current violence and arson, the warlike confrontations between the tribal people and immigrants, the mounting numbers of homeless, injured and dead, recall the numerous clashes over the years right down through the Nineties. The stakes for both sides are growing, and it is alarming that the army and police seem unable to contain the violence. It is as if bottled-up resentments and hatred are no longer amenable to control.        
	It may not have come to this had successive governments in the state and at the Centre had handled the problem of illegal migrants objectively and firmly, without playing around with it purely for political interests. Tarun Gogois government, too, has dithered and ducked, and is now busy accusing the National Democratic Front of Bodoland of having incited the ethnic cleansing. The NDFB has denied it, while the government is threatening to withdraw the ceasefire agreement with the group should proof of its involvement be found. But how does all this matter at the moment? Thousands are losing their homes and taking shelter in camps, some are dying, and sometimes from police fire  bringing the situation under control is surely the first priority. Busy blaming others and splitting hairs over the labelling of the unrest in the anxiety to deny communal violence will not help. The basic problem will not go away in a day, but ensuring some kind of peace and security for the people is the minimum duty of an elected government.

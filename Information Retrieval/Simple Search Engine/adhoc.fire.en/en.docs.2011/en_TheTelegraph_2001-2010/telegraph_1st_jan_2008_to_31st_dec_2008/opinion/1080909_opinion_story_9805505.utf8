Desai                                                      
	Few issues have polarized West Bengal like Singur in recent times. West Bengal is no stranger to polarization; where there are Communists, there will be poles. They came to power in West Bengal by polarizing it. It was Indias most industrialized state. Its industry faced decline in the 1960s. The advent of polyethylene, invented in World War II, threatened the hegemony of jute as a packing material; and the downturn of 1965, which followed a long boom, reduced the demand for Bengals engineering products.        
	Workers of declining industries are like tinder in the hands of extremists. Bombay faced a decline when the Central government discriminated against its textile mills and tied their hands in competition with powerlooms. Shiv Sena courted the workers thrown out by textile mills. Their violence led Gujarati industrialists to leave Bombay, and laid the foundations of Gujarats industrialization. West Bengal faced a similar decline when the Communists led unemployed jute workers in demonstrations and violence. The industrialists of West Bengal dispersed west, north and south; the Birlas even went abroad and built up an industrial empire in Thailand, Nigeria and other countries.         
	Shiv Sena was a xenophobic, inward-looking, regional party. Although CPI(M)s rhetoric was very different, its rule in West Bengal was equally effective in putting off non-Bengali entrepreneurs. Calcutta even today remains a refuge for many non-Bengali communities  not just Gujaratis and Marwaris but now Biharis, Oriyas and Nepalis. But none of them brought enterprise with them. They all took jobs; none created any. Least of all Bengalis.              
	That is why when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decided that he wanted to reindustrialize  or more accurately, deagriculturalize  West Bengal, he immediately thought of non-Bengalis. He first thought of foreigners. They would not be familiar with West Bengals history, and would not carry a baggage of prejudices. So he went to Singapore and sought out the Salim group. Besides being foreign, it had the advantage of being vague. Its name sounded Muslim, but it was not Muslim. It was supposed to be an Indonesian group, but it was actually Chinese. It had shifted its base from Jakarta to Singapore. It certainly did not carry any baggage.        
	Buddhadeb brought it in primarily to develop real estate; but there he ran into villagers resistance. They did not want to leave their villages and hand them over to developers; they preferred to stay where they were, eat paan at the village shop and gossip. Buddhadeb could dream of an industrialized Bengal, where every Bengali rushed off to a factory at seven every morning and took pizzas home with him for his children. But that was not their dream. They were already living their dream, which was to sleep in the shade of the neem tree by the river while their ducks fed themselves.         
	That was a very selfish, precapitalist view to take; these villagers did not care a hoot for the Great Bengal that Bhattacharjee dreamt of. They were standing between Bengal and greatness; they had to be summarily removed. Which the CPI(M) proceeded to do, with forces official and unofficial.         
	It would have been a success; the villagers would have been removed and their memory extirpated, and high-rise buildings would have come up in a couple of years where the villagers used to play cricket with coconuts. Unfortunately, India is a democracy, and one of the nuisances of a democracy is reporters, who can go and take a photo of any armed Communist doing his duty and any poor woman crying over her burnt house. And capitalism ensures that they can sell their photographs to fat Americans and Germans, and that their ambassadors can tell the lackey government in Delhi to stop the heroic cadres. There was such an international rumpus that Buddhadeb had to stop his pogrom. Salaam, Salim! See you somewhere else, but not in Bengal.        
	Next time, Buddhadeb learnt from his mistakes. He got hold of Ratan Tata, the cleanest and most admired Indian industrialist. Ratan would not mind if his labour force paid dues to Citu; it would be a welcome addition to its treasury. They chose a sexy product  Nano, the Peoples Car. All seemed hunky-dory.        
	But then comes along that spoilsport Mamata Banerjee. She got together some disaffected displaced farmers and started marching up and down the road in front of where the Tata Motors factory was to come up. She set up a booth there and started fasting. This was much worse than Nandigram; the site was on a highway to Calcutta, and her people managed to hold up thousands of trucks and buses. And reporters had a field day. In Nandigram they had to find a place in villagers verandahs to sleep and to live on roasted rice and Coca-Cola. In Singur, all modern conveniences were provided for. They could stay in hotels in Calcutta, and eat in dhabas, which gave truck drivers excellent food.         
	Even Mamata could have been tackled. But then the peace-loving Governor had to get involved. Once he came in, there was only one recourse  talk, talk till you drop dead. And since Mamata did not yield an inch, there was only one solution  to give her whatever she asked for.               
	Now  that is a lesson which Buddhadeb would not have had to learn if he had not been a Communist. For democracy gives rabble-rousers and troublemakers tremendous power. They can paralyse an economy, and there is nothing the government can do. If they are Kashmiris in the far-away north, the government can kill a few every day, and the rest of India would not notice. But West Bengal does not have that luxury.         
	So Buddhadeb has only one option if he wants to industrialize West Bengal  talking to the Opposition and buying it off. Governments in the rest of India do it all the time. On paper, they all have power to acquire land by compulsion. In practice, district collectors everywhere talk to villagers beforehand, and work out a compensation package that they would accept. Often they do not even do that. They let industrialists work out a deal with villagers. All kinds of deals are worked out. Villagers get jobs besides compensation; they buy land in neighbouring villages and get rich as its value rises with industrialization; sometimes they even lease their land to industry.        
	That is the lesson for Buddhadeb if only he would learn it: let industrialists deal directly with the villagers. They cannot do that in West Bengal because most farmers are lessees of the government; so the first thing he should do is to sell off all farm land to cultivators. He should run his electricity industry efficiently and offer industrialists cheap, 24x7 power; he should build wide, straight roads from their factories to ports and airports. He should improve communications between West Bengal and the rest of India. He should put all trade unionists who impinge on others freedom to work firmly in jail. There is plenty for him to do to attract industry. But he should get out of land issues as far as possible. He should recognize that the Communists are just no good at it, and that people get on better without their help.

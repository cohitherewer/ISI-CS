                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Letters to Editor
                
	Fear incorporated                  
	Sir  The havoc wreaked across Mumbai for nearly 60 hours last week gave India a taste of the fear that must have gripped the United States of America on September 11, 2001 (War on Mumbai, Nov 27). There is small consolation in the knowledge that the horrors are finally over as the memory of this tragedy would continue to haunt billions for days to come. Given the regularity with which terrorists have taken this country to ransom, it seems human life has little value here. After every debacle, people demand concrete measures from politicians, and are invariably let down. The prime minister, after being severely criticized for retaining Shivraj Patil as home minister, has finally shuffled the cabinet. However, based on this gesture alone, it would be premature to hope for better governance. The success of this swap of ministries will depend on the results. Finally, despite the failed intelligence and belated police action, the army, the National Security Guards, and the anti-terror squad deserve thanks for their bravery.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kshama Agarwal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The miserable performance of the intelligence agencies paved the way for a group of young men to arrive in Mumbai and unleash fear all over the city. Despite repeated attacks, the complacence of the Maharashtra government has remained unshaken. Had there been adequate security measures, grenades and ammunition could not have been smuggled into luxury hotels so easily.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Orchida Chatterjee,

      
	Bhadrakali, Hooghly                     
	Sir  One need not be terribly clever to guess that the mayhem in Mumbai could not have been perpetrated by a few fidayeens, landing on the Indian shore in a trawler, without the help of a local network of accomplices. It is evident that the men who invaded the Taj knew the layout of the hotel only too well. Some of the hotel staff must have had a hand in smuggling the weapons inside.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The carnage let loose by terrorists over Mumbai has finally provoked the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to take tough decisions. Apart from handing over the home ministry to P. Chidambaram, it is believed that a new investigative agency would be formed. Although the armed forces did a valiant job in rescuing the guests from the hotels and some residents of Nariman House, the inefficient police force really did stick out like a sore thumb.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Upinder Fotadar,

      
	New York, US           
	Sir  When the American army general, H. Norman Schwarzkopf, was asked whether those who carried out 9/11 could be forgiven, he retorted, I believe that forgiving them is Gods function. Our job is simply to arrange the meeting. India, by contrast, has so far wisely refrained from repaying aggression with aggression. But evidently, peaceful diplomacy is not going to be an antidote to rising terror. India has failed to take concrete steps against terrorism. The government, steeped in vote-bank politics, chooses to ignore the local population, which must be giving logistic support to the masterminds of evil to help execute their missions with precision.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arvind D. Tapkire, Mumbai

                
	Sir  One wonders what Raj Thackeray and his brave sena were doing when terrorists took Mumbai by storm. While Thackeray was busy hiding, the NSG, comprised mostly of north and south Indian men, did an excellent job of making the city safe again.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rakesh Bhatia, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Having watched the Mumbai drama unfold on television, several questions arose in my mind. One, why and how did the ATS chief, Hemant Karkare, die? Did he not have protective gear when he went into action? Did he have any arms other than a revolver? Was his action heroic but foolhardy? Two, who were the people in flak jackets but without helmets? Did they think that their heads were solid enough to deflect bullets? Were the police, ATS and the NSG protected by Kevlar vests? Normal flak jackets stop revolver bullets but are useless against rounds from AK-47s. Third, did the security forces use stun grenades, essential when facing a hostage situation? The terrorists were not wearing flak jackets, then were they protected by Kevlar vests? Were there any sharpshooters with high-powered rifles and telescopic sights? On TV, the terrorists were seen at the windows several times. They should have been shot as soon as they showed themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Mozumdar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Even as we shudder at the thought of Mumbais date with terror, we cannot but pay tribute to the media for having brought the account to us with such chilling realism. The descriptions and the explanations brought to us by The Telegraph were remarkable: they were sincere, discreet, cautious and responsible. The reports were clear, analytical, and explained to the reader what went on and what had gone wrong. They also highlighted the bravery of the NSG and other security forces. I hope that the newspaper will do a series of articles on other forms of internal terror, which strikes the country from time to time. Thanks to the brave and hardworking journalists, The Telegraph proved itself to be truly unputdownable.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dolly Roy, Calcutta

	This is art that holds up a mirror to dreams. Yet it defies a strictly surrealist label, in that the real is inescapably a part of the language of its discourse. Birds, beasts and people are framed by a luminous natural world, but transformed by the inflections of colour and water. The sky turns a deep purple at twilight, a giant fish makes its way shorewards, nubile ladies lie on a golden green surface. There is languor in the air.
    
	Kartick Chandra Pynes inspired exhibition of water colours , titled Kothao tomar haariyeh jaabar nei maana monay monay,which concluded recently at Gallery Kolkata (Dec 22 to Jan 5)  captured a unique dialogue between the real and the surreal. A sylvan landscape  lush vegetation, flowing streams, birds fluttering in the shimmering sunlight  is transformed by a momentary quirk. It could be a patch of white, applied on a greenish tree trunk, the colour purple floating on the river, or a fiery crimson, dispersed liberally over a bare land awash with yellow. These strange feats of brushwork  along with the maddening dance of powerful colours  suddenly come to a standstill in an odd work: just a tree, three tiny birds atop it, and a couple of dogs listlessly walking by. 
    
	But there is little respite. You stand before one such scene of luscious desolation, and the very next one confronts you with a vortex of emotions. A group of people, tiny and obscure, gather around a pond with four large fish floating in it. The thin rivulets of brown that keep flowing in from everywhere around literally intensify the vortex effect.
    
	In terms of style, Pyne certainly does not, by any means, follow a consistent visual mode. Traces of Impressionism are discernable, most memorably in the depiction of some wild animals (hyenas?) peering out of thick foliage (picture). The green, yellow, brown come alive in the deft brushwork. The undulating stripes cutting across this natural expanse hint at a breeze sweeping over the place. Patches of white appear erratically, the beasts look gentle and weary.
    
	Among the other animal paintings in this series, there is a rooster that looks remarkably like Kunkro in Abanindranath Tagores Alor Phulki, and a deer, painted in dirty crimson, looking over a hedge. One of the defining features of this collection, however, is Pynes obsessive use of purple. The colour keeps coming back, as if in an exercise in free association, lending itself to the earth, sky and water and occasionally to some of the creatures.
    
	There is a peculiar duality inherent in the colour. Purple evokes a range of powerful feelings, of vibrancy combined with mystery. The colour also has a subversive ring to it, and, indeed, it haunts some of the intensely erotic works. In one, for instance, naked women presumably sun themselves. But the sun here has a rotund face, quivering lips and eyes bold, its rays, instead of the golden warmth, releases a sickly purple light. Outside this purple glow, life decays, as the leaves turn yellow.

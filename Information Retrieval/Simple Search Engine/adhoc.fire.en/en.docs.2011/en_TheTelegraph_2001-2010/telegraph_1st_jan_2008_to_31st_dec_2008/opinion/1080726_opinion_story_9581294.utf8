	The man with a mission                  
	Sir  It is a pity that Anusua Mukherjee considers Paulo Coelhos popularity to be confined to those cute young boys and girls for whom the year starts from February 14 (Mate for the soul, July 17). There are only a few authors who are able to change peoples lives for the better through their writings. Coelho is among them. As such, he is read and appreciated by all who find inspiration in his simple yet profound philosophy of life. Instead of vilifying Coelho, we should praise the good man who motivates people to live their dreams.          
	Yours faithfully,        Purbani Das, Asansol
        
	City blights          
	Sir  It is impossible to pass through Moira Street these days without being sickened by the sight of the garbage piled on its two sides. Sweepers collect household wastes from the adjoining lanes and dump them here early in the morning. Two trucks of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation come at around 7.30 am to pick up the garbage, and quite inexplicably, continue with the task till 9.30 am. The large trucks block a considerable portion of the road, resulting in traffic snarls as the rush hour starts. The local residents have frequently raised objections and lodged complaints with the local councillor, but to no avail.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R.A. Jalan, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I had to visit Bhavishyanidhi Bhawan at Salt Lake, recently, to make some enquiry about provident fund. The public relations officer there kept talking to me in Hindi although I asked my questions in Bengali. As I am not familiar with Hindi, I repeated my queries in English in the hope that he would reply in English at least. Surprisingly, he still used Hindi and by his gestures made me understand that only Hindi was the mode of communication there. I had to return without getting any clarification on the matter I had gone to enquire about.           
	Bengali is the language of this state. Notwithstanding the constant influx of Hindi-speaking people to West Bengal, the majority of the residents here speak Bengali. The PRO in a state office who cannot converse in Bengali fails to justify his appointment. His stubbornness in sticking to Hindi may reflect his devotion to the language but it makes him an incompetent PRO.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Dipak Datta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The Taratala bus stop on the side of Brace Bridge is in a perilous state. The shed can crumble on the heads of passengers and passers-by any day. The passengers who wait have no option but to stand in the sun and shower. I request the authorities to immediately demolish the structure and construct a proper one with shades and chairs.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Moupiali Mahalanobis, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  After the recent hike in taxi fares, it has become almost impossible for middle-class passengers to travel by taxis, even occasionally. Moreover, the taxi drivers often extract more than what is due by tampering with the meters. There are mechanics based in different parts of Calcutta, who, for a few rupees, tinker with the seal or change the gear ratio to make the meter move faster. Oriyapara in Bhowanipore has become the centre of such shady business. The police and the transport department are surely aware of this, but prefer to remain silent.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.P. Jhunjhunwala, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Recently, I have observed the police imposing spot fines on cyclists on roads like Chittaranjan Avenue and Chowringhee. However, to my surprise, the police had no problems with cycle vans plying on the same thoroughfares, dangerously disrupting traffic. If cycles are fined, so should cycle vans.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

	Between them, Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Begum Khaleda Zia made democracy almost unworkable in Bangladesh. If their supporters now want to make common cause against the army-backed interim government, that only shows their desperation. But it may not be enough evidence of a meaningful change in their politics. Nor does it offer any hope that the two leaders would rise above personal rivalries in the interest of the people. Ms Wajeds Awami League and Ms Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party want to join forces in order to compel the government to announce the elections earlier than scheduled. Rival political forces in Bangladesh joined hands in 1990 in the fight against the military dictatorship of H.M. Ershad. But the political circumstances then were very different. The people then had high expectations from the parties and their leaders. In the subsequent years, when the BNP and the Awami League ruled the country alternately, Bangladesh witnessed the collapse of not only democratic politics but also the rule of law. 
    
	No matter what the parties do, the people of Bangladesh seem to have very different concerns. It is not that they do not want to see democracy and their rights restored. But they would like the rule of law to be restored first. And they may not like to see the political parties hold the country and their lives to ransom again. If the long detentions of both Ms Wajed and Ms Zia have not led to violent public reactions, that is because the people were fed up with their brands of politics. Democratic rule cannot mean much to a people if it makes their lives insecure. While they clamour for early elections, the BNP and the Awami League should seriously ponder the mistakes they had made and take steps to correct them. The biggest challenge for both parties is to save themselves from their leaders. The army can only help restore the rule of law. But there is little hope for democracy in Bangladesh until the parties reform themselves.

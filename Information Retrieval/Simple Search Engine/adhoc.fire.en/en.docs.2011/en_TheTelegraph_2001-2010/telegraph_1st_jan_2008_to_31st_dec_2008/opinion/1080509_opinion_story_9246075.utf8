                          Fantasy with a touch of poetry      
	Generation 14 (Penguin, Rs 295) by Priya Sarukkai Chabria is told by Clone 14/54/G, a fourteenth generation clone, living in a fearsome, dystopian world. The setting is reminiscent of Oceania in George Orwells 1984. In fact, the similarities with the classic are too many, even too obvious. The backdrop is subversive  a society cleansed of memory, bereft of all past, hurtling only into the future. Expressions of sexuality are forbidden, which is why the protagonist keeps a secret diary. She is involved in a greater crime for which there is no acquittal: Its nothing obvious. Its terminal and secret... I remember. She hunts out her Original to verify if these visitations of memory are related to her forgotten ancestor. (Readers familiar with Kazuo Ishiguros Never Let Me Go might detect another influence here.) In the course of these explorations, Clone 14/54/G becomes drawn into bizarre misadventures. Written tautly, this is sci-fi with a poetic touch.                        
	Writing in an age of silence (Women Unlimited, Rs 250) by Sara Paretsky is a memoir by the creator of V.I. Warshawski, the celebrated South-side detective. Beginning with her difficult early life spent in rural Kansas, Paretsky describes her foray into writing as a journey from silence into speech. It was her small-town upbringing that provoked Paretsky to defy every form of establishment. She refused to attend the University of Kansas in accordance with the wishes of her parents, and went on to study German in Vienna on a summer scholarship instead. More radically, she took to the streets in the Sixties, inspired by Martin Luther Kings civil rights movement. Perhaps it was this core of irreverence that made her create such a gutsy woman detective.                        
	CUBAS NICOLS GUILLN: 43 poems (Tarjama, Rs 200) translated by Keith Ellis collects some of the finest verse by one of the most distinguished Spanish-American poets of the 20th century. Born in 1902, seven weeks after the founding of the Republic of Cuba, Guilln was keenly sensitive to the revolutionary principles that structured the history of his nation. Beyond the ideological strictures, he saw into the philosophical mysteries of social change, how it affects and defines a history of human emotions: From my first light, when/ I was merely a wisp of dreams and tears,/ from those times,/ they told me my name. My password/ for talking with the stars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Look away closer 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LOOK AWAY CLOSER                                                                   
	With Italy making it illegal for men to touch themselves ostentatiously in public, Italians will now have to reckon with not just one, but two new offences. First, the act itself. But forbidding it for the sake of public decorum means that looking at a man touching himself is also an experience from which the State must protect men, women and children. Thus is born Forbidden Pleasure No. 2: Thou shalt not look        
	Yet, doesnt the human eye always have a secret life? And isnt this secret life at its busiest and most secret in public? (Think of travelling on the Metro.) The retina is not only a helpless piece of tissue (it cannot choose but see), but it is also capable of being pitiless and amoral, even when connected to the most scrupulous brain. Moreover, to make matters complicated, the human body and mind acting together can be both moral and amoral, or pitying and pitiless, at the same time. Even while I want to look away in embarrassment, disgust, shame or horror, a part of me wants to keep on looking, and what compels it is a mix of curiosity and pleasure, from neither of which is desire too far away. And even if things dont happen as dramatically as this, at a more banal level, the eye works out, in the light of common day, its own way of indulging its covert pleasures, its everyday perversities, which would leave the most Orwellian State quite clueless and helpless. We are always surrounded by human bodies that we know we cannot kiss or kill. But does that stop us from imagining either?         
	Nobody knows this better than Art. What we would look away from in real life, we would contemplate publicly, without embarrassment or revulsion. With this mysterious falling away of shame and morality, what is normally uncivil magically becomes high civilization.        
	What is Henri Cartier-Bresson making us look at in the picture above, captioned The seats opposite, Romania, 1975 in his great book of photographs, Europeans? And what is he looking at, for that matter, and why? It is not good manners, not even in Romania, to stare at human sexual intimacy, let alone when the intimate have fallen asleep. But do we expect the best artists to care? And do we punish them for not doing so? Art often looks, and makes us look, with an eye that is voyeuristic, cruel or shameless, taking us, even before we have rationally understood our response, beyond the realm of the nice and the good. HC-Bs photograph is about, among other things, a man sitting with his legs improperly open in public, his crotch vying for attention with the womans beautiful face. The picture is also about another man, the photographer, looking at all this and compelling others, us, to look too. The tenderness of HC-Bs soft focus doesnt shrink away from making a visual link between the mans sleepy tightness and the bulging headrest between the seats, against which the womans elbow rests.         
	Another intriguing photograph  taken in Orissa in 1980, and part of his book on India  shows A fisherman and his son. We see the well-built fisherman from the back, wearing the flimsiest langot. His naked little son, whom we see frontally, is trying to stop his father from walking forward by burying his face between his fathers legs, clasping them firmly with both hands. We thus see the child only neck downwards, framed by his fathers legs, recalling the famous HC-B image of a man with his head seemingly lopped off by a heavy, knotted-up curtain hanging in front of him. What sort of viewers do we become, in spite of ourselves, while looking at how HC-B looks at the fisherman and his son?        
	Would I have been able to talk about all this here if I hadnt done so in the name of art?                    AVEEK SEN

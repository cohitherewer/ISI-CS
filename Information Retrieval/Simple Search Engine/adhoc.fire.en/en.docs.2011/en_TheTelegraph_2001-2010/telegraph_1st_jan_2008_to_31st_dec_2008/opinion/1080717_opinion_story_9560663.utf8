	Is it true that most people read Jonathan Livingston Seagull for the first time after being gifted it by their love interests? It must be, or all the members of this august club have ended up as my friends, and that would have to be too much of a coincidence. It could also explain why JLS becomes the favourite book of so many people. You see, to say that the book is anything less than a favourite would be an act of unbearable cruelty to the person who gave it to you if you still happen to be hitched to him or her. For those who have left behind the giver of the book in the last town, it may not be worth the effort to re-read the book to find out if liking it didnt have something to do with a wingless object of past desire.        
	Obviously, my Seagullibility isnt very high. Ive never quite got the point about this anorexic seagull who would rather have others do the eating and food-gathering for him while he makes merry in the air. Reminds me of some men I know who feel that they were not born to do things like the weekly groceries, but only to pick out the weaknesses in Sachin Tendulkars batting or Pasolinis films. But perhaps JLS was trying to lead us into a world where we wouldnt have to depend on food for survival? Why hasnt this struck G8 leaders yet?        
	It did not occur to me once while reading the book that Jonathan, Son of the Great Gull, could be Jesus. I thought JLS was a small but super-advanced aircraft. After all, its creator was a pilot and the book has more references to terminal velocity, wing-strain, level flight and miles per hour than the Bible has to the Lord. It could have been a flying manual but for the fact that Richard Bach could not take responsibility and tell his readers that stranded mid-air, Faith could save them.         
	Alright, JLS can be called the Roger Bannister of seagulls  he breaks some kind of a speed barrier which makes other poor, limited seagulls attempt perfect speed. But he would make a very imperfect Olympian, because he is only interested in Citius and Altius, and not the least bit in Fortius, unless, of course, you buy the theory that his flights of fancy (what else?) give him a mysterious strength that some good, fresh fish wouldnt.        
	Aesop didnt need human nomenclature for his fables. If Bach absolutely had to use names for his avians, why couldnt the names be like Vitalstatistix or Impedimenta? One of my favourite childhood fictional characters was a panda called Amulyaposhu Panda. He appeared in one of the illustrated Raduga Publishers books which translated into Bengali, using a rather alien-looking typescript, childrens stories from foreign lands. If Bach had read Amulyoposhu, he may have learnt how to make Jonathan less preachy and more endearing and still retain his moral about setting oneself free.        
	Why do so many readers swear by Jonathan Livingston Seagull? Possibly because theres an escapist in each of us who is constantly trying to shirk his daily chores or social responsibilities. What better excuse than to say, I have higher pursuits to think of? In the Seventies (JLS came out in 1970), when the Americans werent exactly having the time of their life, Bach cant be blamed for showing an escape route. But could a young American fob off enlistment in the Vietnam War citing higher pursuits? I think not, unless you were George W. Bush, and now we know what his pursuits were.        
	A final word of advice. Do let your reservations about JLS be known to the person who gave you the book. Or, like me, you will get Illusions for your next birthday.

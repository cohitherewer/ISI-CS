The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fading India
                                                                                                                 FADING INDIA                                                    
	Frail humans tend to take credit for good luck. The Bharatiya Janata Party put on the halo of Shining India. Unluckily for it, the voter did not agree; he gave a fractured verdict which the Congress took as a vote for itself. It inherited the booming economy that fate had separated the BJP from, and had no qualms about claiming credit for it. A fortnight ago, the finance minister declared that for its shining growth story, India had the Congress, in incarnations past and present, to thank.        
	But as P. Chidambaram basked in self-made sunshine, the light was fading; industrial growth was falling. Following his governor in the Reserve Bank of India, he called it moderation in the index of industrial production. But that unruly index is now turning immoderate. In January, it showed growth of 5.9 per cent  rather embarrassing for a government that claims credit for having introduced India to high growth. What is even more worrying is the steepness of the decline. As recently as in October, the index grew 12.2 per cent. Monthly growth figures can fluctuate on account of the base effect. But after smoothing out the irregularities, there is still a fall from about 10 per cent in the middle of 2007 to under 8 per cent by November. The decline is being led by three major industries: textiles, machinery and vehicles. They indicate the causes for the decline. Textiles have been badly hurt by the rupee appreciation of March-April last year; two-wheelers, cars and trucks were hurt by the tightening of bank credit from the middle of last year; and machinery sales are slowing down as manufacturing growth comes down.         
	Underlying the sinking fortunes of the industries are the anti-growth policies of the RBI. The governor has heard too many fellow-governors in too many swank conference rooms inveighing against the evils of inflation. As a result, the RBI has developed a phobia about inflation. It has forgotten that the economy also has to grow. Y. Venugopal Reddy also does not realize that, however much he squeezes the economy, he cannot bring down inflation below a certain point. For inflation is built into the Central governments policies. As monopoly buyer of major foodgrains, it increases purchase prices every year. It is impossible to force up food prices year after year and keep other prices down. So the Central government engenders inflation, and the RBI throttles demand to keep inflation down. Working so well in tandem, they have managed to bring a beautiful boom to a premature end. The prime minister and his team may not care; in a few months they will face an election, and that may be curtains for them. But the country will have to live on with their errors.

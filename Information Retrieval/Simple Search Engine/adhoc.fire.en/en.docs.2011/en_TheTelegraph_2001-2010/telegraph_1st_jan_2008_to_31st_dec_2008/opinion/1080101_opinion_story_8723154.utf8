   MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh
   
	We begin our journey today into 2008, but alas, carrying a great unfortunate baggage of events that were sadly divisive, realities that scarred Pakistan badly, changes that are beginning to restructure the polity in Nepal, happenings in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka that generated anguish and turmoil. We, the south Asian neighbours, have been through a painful time over the last many months but have not been able to reach out to each other to share the stresses and strains of harsh change unsettling the region. 
 
	The affected countries are an intrinsic part of the Saarc committee, which has failed to build a genuine alliance in the region by endorsing a socio-political methodology that makes sense to all mdash; one that harnesses the economic and entrepreneurial strengths of the region to take on the world.
 
	In fact, that should be the 2008 Saarc resolution. The leaders should agree, for a start, to drop all travel restrictions on south Asian nationals within the region, and through that gesture, raise the sagging level of dignity, unity and regional pride. 
 
	This is essential for rapid economic progress, regional trade, peace in what has been a volatile part of the world for much too long mdash; compelling economic stagnation, divisive politics and administrative corruption that have suited all the international interventionists who see the area possessing a huge potential for exploitation. 
 
	Like the European Union, the Saarc too has to readjust and restructure itself, and become far more energetic, productive, inclusive and dynamic. It is one sure way of creating the much-needed platform for forceful regional assertion to ward off negative external interferences mdash; economic, political and military. We have had enough of such veiled exploitation. 
  
	Neighbours in need
 
	We now need to reverse the order, and one way forward is by cementing relations in complete faith, rejecting the greed for short-term gains. The dangling of lollipops before self-serving leaders from the developing world, that has been the erstwhile tactic of the rich nations, is now pass eacute; and must be seen as such. The Saarc countries, by nurturing and protecting each other rsquo;s strengths, will be able to negate their weaknesses, which have been exploited thus far in an effort to maintain the cracks in the south Asian body politic.
 
	Inclusive cross-border politics is the need of the day mdash; India must lead from the front and cease to play the big bully. Political compassion and economic magnanimity should be the foundation of this new structure where dissension is dealt with through debate and dialogue. Jawaharlal Nehru saw the importance of this in the Fifties, but subsequent governments were sceptical and diluted his vision.
 
	Our contemporary leadership lacks in vision and that lacuna needs to be filled with ideas that should come from the collective intellect of the new generation in this part of the world, to ensure that its aspirations transform into functioning realities. 
 
	Let us rekindle our values, our cultural ethos and our intrinsic truths. Let us salute our true industrial legacy mdash; the human resource that the developed world has virtually lost. Let us conserve our heritage and culture that surpass those of most other countries. Let us fiercely defend our plurality and reject all divisive forces. Let us celebrate our past and energize our future on our own terms, first for our region and then for the world.
 
	We have cringed for much too long. We have permitted the economically affluent world to ride roughshod over us. We have held on to the unsavoury crumbs that came our way. Our colonial past compels us to be subservient to the ruler mdash; represented today by the rapacious, self-serving politician and administrator. This must change.

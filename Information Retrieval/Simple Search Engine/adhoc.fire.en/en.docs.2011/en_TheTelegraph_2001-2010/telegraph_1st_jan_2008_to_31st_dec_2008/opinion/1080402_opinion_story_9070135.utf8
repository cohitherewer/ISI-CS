                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Money matters                  
	Sir  The recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, suggesting salary increases of 30 to 35 per cent for Central government employees, seek to compensate them for the inflation and, more importantly, to keep them happy before the elections (Pay more, pleasure less, March 25). But do Central government employees really need an urgent hike in salary? They may be getting less than people working in the private sector, but they are well looked after by the government. This is evident from the fact that they hardly ever change their job once they enter government service. While in service, they can work with zero accountability. If they ever manage to get caught for any offence, they can still rest safe in the knowledge that the trial, if any, will stretch over years. Instead of further privileging the privileged, the government should institute a commission to look into the pay in the unorganized sector. Those working in this sector have no fixed salary, not to speak of perks, benefits, or even medical allowances. If these recommendations are implemented, they will widen the gap between the rich and the poor.           
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Low pay has been a perpetual complaint of government employees. Once vied as a lucrative career option, government jobs have now lost their charm owing to low incentives. Most qualified Indians now prefer to work in the private sector. The recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission are meant to woo them back into government service. Notwithstanding the preference for the private sector, surveys however show that the government jobs are more profitable. Added to job security, there are health benefits, insurance, transport allowances and fixed working hours. If the suggestions of the pay commission are implemented, public sector jobs will become even more attractive. Perhaps we may soon see technical experts and management consultants making a beeline for such jobs.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

                
	Sir  What could be more thrilling for Central government employees than the news of a whopping 30 to 35 per cent pay hike? Now that government employees will be earning more, can we expect them to be a little more responsible and less corrupt? Will they stop taking bribes if they get a fat pay cheque?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Salil Gewali, Shillong

                
	Sir  Government officials have been clamouring to have salaries at par with their counterparts in the private sector. But are they willing to work as hard as private sector employees? The performance of workers in the private sector is constantly assessed, and with the slightest drop in standard, they are shown the door. Babus in government service, on the other hand, spend their time dozing on the chair or going on tiffin breaks, and yet they are hardly ever fired. Government servants, obviously, want to have their cake and eat it too. Although they have no desire to improve their performance, they aspire to have all the luxuries at the expense of the taxpayer.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhijit Guha, Ontario, Canada

                
	Sir  If the government faithfully follows the pay commissions recommendations, how will it meet the additional burden on the exchequer? As it is, the government is foundering under the load of inflation. The pay commission suggests that women employees with minor children would be allowed to take childcare leave for up to two years. If one or more officials go on leave for two long years, how will the office function?           
	The best recommendation of the pay commission is to reduce the number of holidays from 19 to 11. Rest assured, the government is unlikely to agree to it. With the elections looming over the horizon, it cannot do anything to lose favour with the officials.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  The Sixth Pay Commission should have worked out a system that would link employees salary with their performance. They should not get a handsome amount at the end of each month simply for warming the official chair for eight hours a day.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Sir  The pay commission recommendations put the pay of the service chiefs of the army on a par with that of the seniormost bureaucrats (Fatter packet, but forces want more, March 25). But even with impressive salaries, the army may not be able to attract talent. The reasons for this reluctance are not difficult to find. Recurring instances of army atrocities have damaged its public image. What the army needs is better public relations, not better pay.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  In the absence of employees representatives in the commission, the Sixth Pay Commission has been unable to address some of the persisting problems of employees in the public sector as well as in the defence forces.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

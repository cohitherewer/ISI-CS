The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The debate in brief
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE DEBATE IN BRIEF                          - The confidence vote was not all circus        WRITING ON THE WALL   ASHOK V. DESAI                                                        
	The confidence vote was a parade of egos. Advani boasted about how much better Vajpayee ran his coalition than Manmohan Singh. Manmohan Singh complained about the nasty names Advani called him. But it was not all circus.        
	Lal Advani said that by telling The Telegraph last August that he would enter the nuclear deal in defiance of the Left, the Prime Minister had paralyzed and destabilized the government, and put it in the intensive care unit. He had kept his Communist allies in the dark about the deal  quite unlike Vajpayee, who took all his allies on board before he exploded the bomb in 1998 within two months of assuming power. The PM can sign the nuclear agreements under the Constitution, but he must not; the Constitution should be amended to require Parliaments approval for international treaties. The UPA government is nowhere near keeping the promise of taking electricity to every village within five years. After signing the nuclear agreement, the nuclear share in electricity output will rise from 3 per cent now to 6 per cent. That is hardly worth the trouble. The government has not tried or convicted any terrorist; it is afraid of offending its vote bank. The 400 acres promised by the J amp;K governor should be given to the Amarnath temple authorities; all opposition against them has been organized by ISI.              
	Mohammed Salim said that the Left had given the government a debit card, but that it had spent far beyond the limit. The government should give estimates of the cost of nuclear power and its place in energy supply; it would not be worthwhile if cheaper alternatives were available. The government keeps giving Liberhan Commission extensions, 15 years after its appointment, so that it would not find anyone guilty of demolishing Babri Masjid. Despite being told by Supreme Court, the government has not brought anyone to book for Gujarat riots. The Srikrishna Commission report on Bombay riots has been buried. The governments soft communalism is no match for hard communalism. The government has left it to its national security adviser to work out a nuclear deal. He will find a deal acceptable to foreign powers. The government has outsourced its foreign policy.        
	Pranab Mukherjee refuted Advanis allegation that the nuclear deal was shrouded in secrecy; it was debated in the lower house in July 2005 and February-March 2006, and in the upper house in August 2007. The government would not accept all the prescriptive provisions of the Hyde Act. The 123 agreement was different; it did not mention the Hyde Act. The government had consulted its allies on everything. The committee it set up to consult them on the nuclear deal met nine times. The government would have shown its allies the agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as it was initiated in Vienna. They refused to wait. They withdrew their support at 12:30, which was 9 am in Vienna; and the IAEA initiated the agreement soon after when its office opened. If they had given the government a couple of hours, they would have been shown the agreement. If the Left brought down the government, it would only help the BJP.        
	Devendra Prasad Yadav brought to the Houses attention that 184 illegal mines were scouring out Govardhan, the mountain in Deeg district of Rajasthan where Krishna used to graze cattle.        
	Anant Geete said he was power minister in the previous government. The country needs 150 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. Hydroelectric potential is 150 GW; that is the cheapest power available. The finance minister had asked nationalized banks to write off farmers debts, and to put up lists of beneficiaries. So they had done, but the banks had not been compensated. Cooperative banks too must write off loans but would get no compensation. Banks in Vidarbha have not given a single loan to a farmer since the waiver.        
	Bhartruhari Mahtab said that the country was going to be short of electricity. Many countries in that situation had built nuclear power plants. But the present cost of electricity is Rs 2.30 a unit; he had read that the cost of nuclear power would be Rs 7.80. Who could afford it at that price?        
	According to Anand Sharma, whilst the opposition accused the government of proposing to make agreements with the US and IAEA without Parliaments approval, that was precisely what the previous NDA government had planned to do with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. He quoted Strobe Talbott to the effect that Jaswant Singh, the then foreign minister, had told him so. Neither the 123 agreement nor the safeguards agreement limited Indias right to explode a bomb. Under them, India simply declared a unilateral moratorium, which it could revoke at any time. This is not the first time the Left opposed something that was in national interest. In 1985, they had opposed Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who wanted a computer revolution. Thanks to it, India today has a 65 per cent share in IT-enabled services.               
	Praful Patel deplored the low standards of debate  for example, Shah Nawaz saying that East India Company had enslaved India for 300 years, and the 123 agreement would enslave it for 600. Pranab Mukherjee had said that in 2050, India would have to import 1.6 billion tons of coal. What effect would that have on global warming? On national logistics? On international prices? Such are the issues the House should be discussing.        
	P. Chidambaram said that the 1954 Atomic Energy Act prohibits the US from cooperating on nuclear matters with other countries unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Its Section 123 authorizes the US President to exempt any country from those conditions. Under the agreement signed on August 1, 2007, the President exempted India from Section 123 as well as from the provisions of the Hyde Act, which was enacted in 2006. The agreement is still to be ratified by the US Congress; once it is, and once India and the US notify that all its conditions have been met, it will enable civil nuclear cooperation between the two countries. It is an enabling agreement. Actual nuclear cooperation will require specific agreements. Its Section 16.4 says, The Agreement shall be implemented in good faith and in accordance with the principles of the international law. International law overrides US domestic law; besides, the US Congresss ratification of the agreement will override all the laws it previously passed. Meanwhile, the government is only continuing the voluntary moratorium on tests that Vajpayee had declared; it aims to convert it into conformity with the CTBT and bring India out of nuclear isolation. China started importing nuclear technology in 1970, mainly from France. Today it has 11 reactors operating and another six under construction. It will have 50 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2020 and 120-160 GW by 2030. Some people in the Opposition do not want India to catch up with China. They want China to become a superpower, but not India.        
	The debate showed Chidambaram at his best. Manmohan Singh made a grave mistake in making him finance minister. If he had been foreign minister, he would have achieved reorientation of foreign policy faster than Manmohan Singh, and the nations finances would have been saved from disaster.

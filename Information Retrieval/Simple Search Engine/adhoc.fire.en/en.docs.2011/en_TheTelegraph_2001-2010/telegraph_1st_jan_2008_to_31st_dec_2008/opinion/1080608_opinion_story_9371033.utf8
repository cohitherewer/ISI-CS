	Bad education                  
	Sir  It is ironic that Ripun Bora, who tried to cover up a murder by offering a bribe to a CBI officer, happens to be the education minister of Assam (10 lakh to hush up murder, June 4). Its been eight years since Daniel Topno, a student leader, was killed. Topno, who was Boras archrival and defeated him in 1996, was supposedly murdered for revenge. Whatever the reasons behind their enmity, as a public servant entrusted with the development of young minds, Bora should never have impeded the process of justice.           
	Yours faithfully,         Omi Gurung, Gangtok
        
	Not surprised          
	Sir  There is a curious feeling of dj vu about the fiasco over Tarit Topdars driver flouting traffic rules (Cops brave enough to fine CPM man, June 4). We all expect big shots in this country to behave like Topdar, dont we? In fact, many Indians probably secretly dream of becoming bigwigs so that they too can get away with similar offences. At least this MP did not indulge in much theatrics, as many in his position are wont to do.           
	Whatever might be their colour, all politicians consider being above the law to be their privilege. It is, however, heartening that the people on the street protested, and a junior policeman held his ground and carried out his duty. If the faintest sense of personal responsibility and some civic sense is beginning to dawn on us, it surely augurs well for our democracy.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  It is not difficult to understand why the Left is so reluctant to discipline errant drivers. Three decades of red rule has improved the quality of life of the ministers so much that, with incomes of Rs 4,000 per month, they can afford chauffeur-driven SUVs.           
	The Left has always chosen to protect these poor car-owners. So Prakash Karat ignores the economy and opposes the hike in oil prices, Subhas Chakraborty refuses to check pollution, Asim Dasgupta lowers sales tax on petrol to keep the car-owners happy, and Tarit Topdar asks his driver not to show it [driving license] to the police.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                          
	Leader emerges          
	Sir  Barack Obama has created history by clinching the Democratic Party nomination after defeating former First Lady Hillary Clinton (The last lap, June 6). Obama has proved to be a brilliant orator, an outstanding leader and excellent organizer. During the last 15 months of campaign, he dazzled the nation with powerful speeches. He has also demonstrated excellent fundraising abilities by amassing 25 million dollars mostly from small donors.           
	Obamas arrival suggests that a paradigm shift in Americas foreign policies is imperative. His opposition to the Iraq war is a case in point. Hopefully, Obama, if he wins the presidency, would repair some of the damage done by George W. Bush. For instance, America should stop wasting its precious millions in military aid to Pakistan. That might bring the crisis in Kashmir to an end.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.C. Bhowmick, Asansol

                          
	Mind the flab          
	Sir  The Delhi High Courts ruling, which threatens obese Air India airhostesses with suspension, is laudable (HC blows to overweight airhostesses, June 5). The Bengal chief minister, who also heads the police department, should take a cue from this judgment and give obese policemen three months time to lose their flab or face dismissal. Calcuttas police force is full of pot-bellied members, who are unfit to chase miscreants.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

	American capitalism is gasping for breath; every minute counts. And yet, the American House of Representatives, when asked by the government to approve a rescue package of $700 billion, first voted it down and then attached stringent conditions before passing it. It was only doing its duty. Popular consent to taxation is the foundation of democracy. Popular movements emerged out of opposition to royal demands for taxes, and people insisted on the right to tax being delegated to their own elected representatives. So the American Congressmen were only doing their duty to prevent unjust taxation above the duty to save American capitalism. Indias elected representatives never bother about how much their government spends over its revenue, or about its deciding to spend over what parliament has approved. All the finance minister has to do is to move a vote on account. It attracts no attention of the members of parliament, and is almost always passed on a voice vote. Financial surveillance is the first duty of parliaments; it is a duty Indian representatives neglect.         
	An even stranger feature of the vote in the House of Representatives was that it failed to pass because representatives of the ruling Republican Party voted against it. To democrats in India, this must look extraordinarily irresponsible. Here, a member of a ruling party who votes against the government would invite expulsion from his party; that might spell the end of his membership in the next election unless he has a strong local base. Whatever their views, members of parliament are herded like cattle by their parties whips, and vote like sheep for whatever their party wants them to. The dissident Republicans are, on the other hand, unlikely to attract any retribution because they stood up for an ideological position that can be regarded as classically Republican  that private businesses must stand or fall on their performance, and that it was not the States business to prop them up if they went bankrupt. Such a free-market position would be natural to an American; but to stick to it even when the consequences of doing so can be dire shows courage. That some may consider it foolhardy does not make it any less courageous.         
	Such principled action is foreign to Indian politicians. Long ago, they voted like slaves for nationalization of banks. Not so long ago, when those banks loans turned bad, members of parliament voted thousands of crores to write off their debts. Even the prime minister, who had a reputation as an economist, shamelessly defended the write-off of loans to well-to-do farmers as a novel form of bankruptcy. That he and his party were looking after their own interests in doing so is manifest; what is not so manifest, but no less true, is that they were acting against the peoples interests.

	The railway minister, Lalu Prasad, did not disappoint his supporters: he delivered the populist budget that everyone was expecting in anticipation of what will be a busy election season. For the third out of his five years, the minister has reduced fares, lowered freight, announced the introduction of more trains and even proposed government employee status for porters at railway stations. 
    
	Does it make sense to have a separate railway budget? It is roughly 8 per cent of the Central budget that P. Chidambaram will present at the end of this week. The Rs 55,421 crore in total working expenditure is a little over half of last years defence budget. So it is not even the largest item of government expenditure. But a separate railway budget puts the Indian Railways outside the ambit of the trade-offs of public policy that the government has to take into consideration in preparing its annual budget. Instead, and as with past ministers, it has become an instrument of political patronage and reward. Granted, under Mr Prasads tenure as railway minister, the Indian Railways is probably the only publicly-owned rail system in the world that makes a profit, and pays the government dividends. And to be fair, the ministry has also encouraged a few public-private partnership initiatives. But their success only adds weight to the idea of separating the infrastructure (rail tracks) from the services provided for both passengers and freight (trains and stations), and privatizing them. Maintenance and new investments in upgrading the infrastructure  the estimated amount is about Rs 2,50,000 crore over the 11th Plan  could then be managed more easily and transparently, and here the private sector could play a major role. Even partial privatization would help the railway system compete with private road transport, and there would be little need for cutting passenger and freight fares as political gestures. The government officials view of the railways as a social service and public good, and the fear that privatization would make train travel unaffordable to large sections of the population, are anachronistic. Businessmen are aware that pricing an essential service too high is not profitable. The government could have its say through some form of minimal price regulation for travellers. 
    
	Mr Prasads budget, his supporters notwithstanding, is a disappointment. In preparing the railway budget he could have offered some carefully-thought-out and much-needed policy prescriptions, rather than a bunch of handouts. He chose to let the electoral calculus prevail over policy imperatives. Political leaders should do the courageous thing: get rid of a separate railway budget, which in no way enhances the standard of services provided by Indian Railways.

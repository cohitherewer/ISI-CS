	I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION (Rubin Museum of Art and Mapin, $39.95) by B.N. Goswamy and Caron Smith is the catalogue, beautifully put together, of an exhibition at the Rubin Museum of Art, New York. It focuses on the core Sikh beliefs in the period of early development by the ten historical Gurus (16th-17th century) through paintings, drawings, textiles and metalwork from the 16th through the 19th centuries. Top right is a late-19th-century watercolour on paper showing Guru Nanak dressed in a robe inscribed with verses from the Quran interspersed with prayers from the Japji. Next on its left is a folio from a Janamsakhi series with a late-18th-century Pahari brush drawing of a scene depicting early intimations of Guru Nanaks divinity. Extreme left is from the same period: a Pahari-Sikh opaque watercolour on paper of the Sikh chief, Bhag Singh Ahluwalia. Bottom right is from the Bilaspur workshop. The figure on the right is possibly Nanak, looking like a Muslim fakir, being approached by a couple of princely figures.

	Valley of fear                  
	Sir  The outbreak of violence in Jammu was not just motivated by the land row, but by the utter neglect of the people living there since Independence. In order to keep Kashmir happy, the Centre has taken Jammu and Ladakh for granted. The unemployment rate in Jammu is staggering compared to that in Kashmir. The breaking point was reached when the state government botched up the Amarnath land transfer issue. Jammu has risen to protest the denigration of its population, which has stayed united for the last 60 years irrespective of religious affiliation. To describe the cry for social and economic justice as communalism is to wilfully disgrace the people of Jammu.           
	Even the Bharatiya Janata Party fared poorly in Jammu in the last elections because the common man is now educated and cannot be fooled easily. We have nothing against the people of Kashmir. It is their leaders who are instigating the Kashmiris. It seems that Mehbooba Mufti, the leader of Peoples Democratic Party, is forcing India to bow to the demands of Kashmiris. But where was she when the Kashmiri Pandits were thrown out of Kashmir? Kashmir belongs to the people of Jammu as much as Jammu belongs to the people of Kashmir. There are many who have been displaced due to terrorism but the Centre is yet to address their needs. Countless soldiers and civilians have died because of the vested interests of political leaders. Yet, the Centre has the cheek to include these very elements in the talks to resolve the crisis.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Neeru Sharma, Jammu 

                
	Sir  It is incredible how the squabble over the allocation of forest land to the Amarnath Shrine Board has opened a nasty can of worms in Jammu and Kashmir (Jammu begins to choke Kashmir, Aug 7). What began as an internal unrest has now grown into a widespread menace, with Pakistan becoming a key player in the developments. The differences between the Hindu Right and Islamic extremists have been fanned out of proportions by our wily neighbour in its bid to exploit the fragile political set-up in the valley. The BJP and its allies should have done a reality check before venturing on the path of protest. Given the precarious situation in the state, even a non-violent protest, like a road blockade, can rapidly escalate to violence. Sadly, the think tank of the Right had only electoral aspirations in mind as it embarked on a rough-and-ready course to ensure justice for Hindus. Both the government and the Jammu agitators have frittered away the hard-earned sympathy of the Kashmiris and pushed the state to the brink of doom. Perhaps this is the first time in years that anti-India feelings are strongest in the valley. Even moderate Kashmiri parties like the National Conference and the PDP have put their pro-India policies on the shelves.           
	In order to prevent Pakistan from making the most out of the situation, all parties would have to rise above their sectarian agendas. Before the protests turn into a communal inferno, the government needs to act decisively. The decision to allocate the forest land was taken post-haste without weighing its pros and cons. While it has provided the much needed fodder to secessionist forces in the valley, revoking it proved to be no solution either, as it gave the Right a perfect excuse to whip up communal sentiments. What is alarming in the whole episode is the abysmal failure of the administrators to gauge the public mood on both sides of the communal fence.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Coming on the heels of the serial bomb blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, the communal flare-up in Jammu and Kashmir has put the United Progressive Alliance government in a spot of bother. So much so, that the prime minister and the UPA chairperson had to appeal to its sworn enemy, the BJP, to restrain the unrelenting Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti-led agitation (PM, Sonia in touch with BJP on Jammu, Aug 4). Undeterred by the goings-on, the Opposition leader, L.K. Advani, appeared impervious to reasoning. He has insisted on the immediate restoration of the forest land to the Amarnath Shrine Board. The BJP president, Rajnath Singh, spoke in a similar voice and reiterated his partys commitment to the issue by extending the land restoration demand to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There is little doubting that these were knee-jerk retaliations to the BJPs humiliating loss of face in parliament in the recent trust vote.           
	If the BJP is to blame for the present turmoil, the Congress is no less guilty. The fact that a section of Congress supporters in Jammu is wilting under pressure and raising the bogey of Hindu sentiments has rattled the party, and rightly so. What is most unfortunate is that the land transfer that triggered the crisis has already been rescinded but the decision has had no effect on the agitators. Although the curfew has been temporarily suspended, the freedom of press remains seriously curbed, which is why we continue to be baffled by different version of events reported in the media.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The chaos in Jammu and Kashmir has exceeded its brief. The Centre should realize that Jammu and Kashmir are sensitive places and it is dangerous to take advantage of their vulnerabilities. L.K. Advani has rightly pointed out the futility of calling an all-party meeting in Delhi. Rather, the government should call the meeting in the affected places and ask local leaders to come forward and lead the peace process.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

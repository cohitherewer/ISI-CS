                                                                                                                                    PARTY LINE
                          
	Communist rhetoric is often a case study in confused thinking. After six decades of independence, they are no closer to deciphering the nature of the Indian State and their place in it than they had been before. That confusion is at the bottom of the uneasiness that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) feels about the possibility of the Centre conferring the Bharat Ratna on Jyoti Basu. The partys objection to its leaders accepting honours from the State defies both logic and its own record. So much has changed for a party that once took the official line that Indias independence was false and hence it wanted to achieve real freedom for the people through armed struggle. Long after that line was dumped and the CPI(M) accepted the parliamentary path, it harboured illusions about a half-partisan warfare to stage a peoples democratic revolution. 
    
	Of more recent vintage is its volte face on foreign capital. If it is still resistant to foreign capital in areas such as retail, it only shows the partys failure to come to terms with its own change. Even the Lefts opposition to Indias proposed nuclear deal with the United States of America has more to do with old, ideological hang-ups than with todays reality. In every other sphere of public life, communists today compete with bourgeois parties to do things that were once anathema to them. Pretensions to ideology, therefore, show not just their confusions but their duplicity too. Even in states like West Bengal and Kerala, where communists have been in power, they seem to have no problem in accepting the rituals of State power. Yet the party would not quite lay the ghosts from an ideological past to rest. 
    
	Prakash Karat, the CPI(M) general secretary, cannot cite any party policy in order to justify his objection to the Bharat Ratna for Mr Basu. The argument that the party has always been opposed to such awards for its leaders flies in the face of its own transformation over the years. There was a time when Indian communists needed the approval of their parties even to choose their partners in marriage. No such preposterous code applies to todays comrades. There is thus no rational justification for the party deciding for its leaders whether they should accept State honours. Such restrictions would amount to questioning the leaders personal wisdom and integrity. Mr Basu is not only among the oldest living leaders of the CPI(M), but also has an illustrious public record. To suggest that he cannot decide for himself whether to accept the honour is to insult him. If, after 23 years as West Bengals chief minister, he still cannot make up his mind about the character of the Indian State and its honours, it should be his own affair. He may not act against the partys wish. But the important thing is that it should be his  rather than the partys  wish.

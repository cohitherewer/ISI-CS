	Women and children, especially the girl child, come up often in the ministerial language that emanates from Delhi. This language is always well-intentioned, sometimes visionary. That much of it comes from Renuka Chowdhury is natural, given that she is the Central women and child development minister. She has suggested recently the opening of a crche in the Parliament House. Before this, she had thought of commissioning films on female foeticide to be shown in multiplexes to well-to-do audiences. She had also once suggested that parents could dump their newborn female offspring with the government rather than killing them before or after birth. These declarations are usually made with passion  and then they are forgotten, for it is difficult to do anything else with them. Ms Chowdhury has now set a deadline for state governments to implement various legal imperatives concerning child rights and domestic violence. If they fail to deliver on time, then the minister has threatened them with stepped-up intervention by the Centre.
    
	The setting of deadlines and threat of Central intervention are both significant though not necessarily hope-inspiring. The first can be, and has often been, ignored by the states in all sorts of sectors. The second does not guarantee greater efficiency, and might result in more elaborate bureaucracy. That government-run homes for children are no better in Delhi than anywhere else in the country has been made amply evident not very long ago. In the spheres of childrens rights as well as domestic violence, the laws have been more or less in place for a long time. But the existing infrastructure for their implementation has always been so abysmally inadequate that the situation can hardly be mended by occasional reprimands from the Centre. Besides, the rights of women and of children, and therefore their violations, are of very distinct kinds. Mentioning them in the same breath, or clubbing them together under the same minister, does not ensure any simplification of the problems. Setting up child rights commissions and training counsellors to deal with victims of domestic violence require different kinds of expertise, and a thorough grasp of very different actualities. There is nothing to doubt the sincerity or amplitude of Ms Chowdhurys compassion. But there has been, so far, very little else.

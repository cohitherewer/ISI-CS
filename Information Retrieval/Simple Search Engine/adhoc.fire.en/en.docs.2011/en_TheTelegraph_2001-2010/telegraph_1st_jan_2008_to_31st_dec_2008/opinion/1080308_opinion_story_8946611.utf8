The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Music of love, with a difference
                                                                                                                 MUSIC OF LOVE, WITH A DIFFERENCE                              Fauzia Marikar      music                        Mozart: master of melody				                                       
	When all the world was amush in a pervading pink haze of roses and heart-shaped balloons  yes, I speak of the commercially romantic ecstasy of Valentines Day this year  my friend, Hyacinth, and I (same sex and strictly straight) decided to celebrate our freedom from folly (never too late) with an evening out.        
	We went to an unusually refreshing, not-very-often-heard performance of hymns and spirituals presented by the newly formed Kolkata Konsort, at St Johns Church (Feb 14). The Kolkata Konsort is a group of musicians who describe themselves as sharing one thing in common, a passion for performing great music.         
	Inspired by Neil McGregor Woodhams, who sings bass-baritone, its other members include James G. Stephens (bass), Sudip Pande (tenor), Mohan Sundararaj (piano/organ) and Malsawn Dawngzuala (trumpet).        
	Instrumental assistance was provided by a string quartet from the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra who had ever-so-slight problems in the second fiddle department (oh so CCO!).         
	The evening began with an organ introduction of a verse from the well-known Old Hundred sung by the three vocalists. Might this be sung a trifle faster? I briefly wondered, but soon realized that having played it at countless school assemblies, anything slower than the speed of light might seem rather too adagio.         
	The quality of voices was excellently matched  Neils mellow baritone, clean and sensitive, Sudips high clear tenor, and Jamess rich and velvet base, which seems to get more beautiful over the years.         
	The programme consisted of familiar hymns and spirituals. Go down Moses and Nobody Knows were sung as bass solos. The purely secular Voi che sapete  the Pages song in Mozarts Marriage of Figaro  was sung by Sudip, and Handels oratorio duet, He shall feed his flock, by Neil and James.         
	The tonal balance and well- organized choreography appeared disciplined and informal at once. Mohans sensitive accompaniment at the fine old pipe organ and the piano, together with the well-tongued and timely trumpet passages of Dawngzuala, made this a memorable event.         
	The attendance was astonishingly good, which proves that no matter how great and attractive the advertisements may be for the wide wild world of romance there is another silent call of the aesthetic and the meaningful that does not need roses and pink, heart-shaped balloons.         
	This second presentation of the Kolkata Konsort was held in the name of Project Haven, which supports some of Calcuttas most disadvantaged and vulnerable children. What better gesture of love on this day than a musical evening for such a cause.

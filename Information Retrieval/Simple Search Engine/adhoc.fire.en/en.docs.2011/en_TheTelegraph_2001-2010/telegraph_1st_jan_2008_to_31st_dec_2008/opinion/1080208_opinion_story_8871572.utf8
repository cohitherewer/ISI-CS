	Internal divisions                  
	Sir  India has long been a witness to supporters of political parties being incited into rage and violence by the actions or remarks of their leaders. A recent example is Jaya Bachchans refusal to recognize Raj Thackeray as a political force. This, coupled with Thackerays earlier comment on Amitabh Bachchan, drove the supporters of the Samajwadi Party and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to clash with each other on the streets of Mumbai (Sectarian strife in Mumbai, Feb 4). A number of similar cases can be cited where party workers have ended up beating and killing each other, while the prime instigators have got away untouched. The latter have moved on, never looking back to see the destruction their comments have caused. How long are we, the masses, going to play puppets to these self-serving politicians?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Supriyo Banerjee, Ariadaha 

                
	Sir  None can support the kind of nationalism that creates regional divisions. Raj Thackerays shocking outburst against north Indians and the subsequent assault on innocent taxi-drivers and road-side vendors cannot be condoned. Thackeray first objected to north Indians performing Chhat puja, and followed this up with his comments on Amitabh Bachchan. Mumbai is Indias economic capital because of the contributions of people from other states. Thackerays antics, like N.T. Rama Raos insistence on Telegu pride or Narendra Modis emphasis on Gujarati asmita, are a euphemism for vote-bank politics. Indias democracy has much in it to make us feel proud, but we should not ignore its weaknesses. Thackerays strain of politics is one of the many challenges before Indian democracy.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The drama that unfolded after Raj Thackerays diatribe against north Indians working in Maharashtra has raised questions about Mumbais cosmopolitan status. People from all over India flock to Mumbai to make a fortune. The Dhirubhai Ambani story, for instance, shows how the city is perceived as a gold diggers paradise. Apart from rich industrialists, there are countless others who have made Mumbai their home, making a living on its busy streets. Bollywood too is a classic example of Mumbais heterogeneity  the film industry comprises artistes who hail from all over the country. It is sad to see politicians trying to divide the populace for petty political gains. This kind of divisive politics is detrimental to the countrys development.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  If the news about the vandalism carried out by Raj Thackerays supporters at Amitabh Bachchans home is true, the act needs to be condemned unequivocally (Bottle missile minus shards, Feb 5). Raj Thackeray and his supporters have brought shame on Mumbai. Goons from Thackerays party roamed the city, thrashing people from other states. Surely, these are not the people who should decide on who ought to reside in the city and who ought not? The law-enforcers, who have failed to check the violence, are equally guilty. Otherwise, how can one explain the fact that a government that can get tough with farmers for defaulting on electricity bills cannot punish miscreants who hold the city to ransom?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune 

                
	Sir  The manner in which Raj Thackeray questioned Amitabh Bachchans contribution to Maharashtra is shocking. As citizens of India, our loyalties should lie with the entire country, and not just with one state. Thackerays declaration that Mumbai belongs to Maharashtrians only is equally deplorable. Such slogans are detrimental to Indias unity. Thackeray and his supporters should be charged with treason for their acts of violence in Maharashtra. The Centre as well as the government of Maharashtra should be careful to ensure that such acts are not repeated.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I had given my passport for renewal to the regional passport officer, Calcutta, on October 1, 2007. The receipt gave my file number as B 019842. I learnt from the relevant internet website that it had been renewed and sent to me by registered post on October 24, 2007. Not having received it by December 28, I sent an email to the RPO to know what had gone wrong. I did not receive from him even an acknowledgement of this mail, or of two subsequent mails sent on January 5 and 12 respectively.On the latter date, I wrote that if I did not receive any response, I would lodge a complaint against the RPO with the minister of external affairs. I did not receive any response. So I wrote to the minister and, lo and behold, I received a telephone call from the office of the RPO saying that my passport had been returned undelivered and that it was being sent to me again! The point of this story is that unless threatened with imminent danger, or persuaded by other means, it seems that the babus seldom act in India.           
	Yours faithfully,

                          Rumbling within      
	 In Indian families, the younger lot is expected to follow in the footsteps of their elders. The same holds true for our political parivars, or so it seems. Senior Congressmen have often fought each other tooth and nail over the spoils. Now it seems that the babalog, inspired by the older generation, have mastered the art of squabbling as well. Congress young guns, Sachin Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia, recently met each other at a social do in Delhi but moved on after exchanging courtesies. The cold vibes, according to insiders, are a result of Pilot encroaching on Scindias fiefdom in the Bhind-Morena region in an attempt to bolster his credentials as an influential Gujjar leader. The cold war between Pilot and Scindia doesnt bode well for the prince though. Rahul Gandhi may now have to work harder to keep the peace among his own troops before he goes about trying to conquer the political turf for his party.                    
	 Now for some news from another parivar. The Shiv Sena leader, Bal Thackeray, may have nothing to do with Raj any more but the nephew continues to idolize his uncle. Rajs rivals in the Congress and in the NCP have it that a few days after securing his release on bail, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief apparently requested a television monitoring agency to supply him with footage so that he could compare his showing against that of his uncles. In his bid to appear like the elder Thackeray, Raj has also repeatedly stressed on the similarities between the two mens agendas, style of functioning and interests (Raj has sworn that he has great interest in cartooning!). Uddhav Thackeray, the heir apparent in the Sena, will surely find all this disturbing. Is it then time for another catfight to determine who is the real tiger?                            
	 The ruling BJP is trying to win another term in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh and is praying that the two sadhvis, Uma and Pragya, will not upset the apple-cart. Meanwhile, some Congressmen are also praying for a win, none as fervently as Union minister Kamal Nath. A seven-time winner from Chhindwara, Nath is keen on the top job so that he can use his global experience to achieve local solutions. His supporters have ruled out the chances of sabotage as Suresh Pachauri and Digvijay Singh have pledged support to Naths candidature. Let us hope for Naths sake that this indeed is the truth. Otherwise, his global experience will come a cropper in the face of insurmountable local hurdles.                            
	 Meanwhile, in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, riches are tumbling out of cupboards as the polls draw near. In an affidavit submitted to the district election officer along with his nomination papers, the chief minister, Raman Singh, who is supposed to contest from Rajnandgaon, laid bare the list of his worldly possessions as per rule. Singh, who held an important portfolio in the NDA regime, gave details of his and his wifes sizeable cash savings, bank deposits, gold and silver assets, and other sundry investments such as life insurance policies. But what was surprising to see was that neither the CM nor his wife, despite their wealth, own a vehicle. Whats the use, his detractors argue, of a car when some of the roads in the state are in such poor shape?                            
	 Guess who is the most (un)wanted man in the Congress these days? He is none other than Shivraj Patil, the home minister. Weary of his alleged bunglings in the aftermath of the frequent bomb blasts, state leaders have apparently written to the party high command saying that if the Congress wanted to win the elections, it should desist Patil from campaigning. Patil wouldnt mind if their wish is granted. This would give him a chance to rest his feet and watch his colleagues toil hard at campaigns amidst the heat and the dust.                            
	 Cricket and politics mix all the time, but not politics and glamour. The opening day of the Delhi Test saw LK Advani and Arun Jaitley in attendance, along with Mick Jagger, who went unrecognized by the DDCA chief although he sat next to him. Perhaps Jaitley was engrossed in the game. Or is his knowledge of rock music not as profound as his knowhow about the world of politics and sport?                          
	 Trust guruji to think out of the box. In a bid to resolve the Maoist insurgency, the Jharkhand chief minister, Shibu Soren, made an unusual offer to the guerrillas the other day. He apparently asked the rebels to choose a particular district in the state and run the administration. This, according to the wise man, would make the Maoists aware of the problems faced by the administration while running the government. Although Soren laid the onus of choice on the rebels, he promised that his government will provide monetary support in case the offer was taken. The only criteria, he said, was that the Maoists would have to keep the people of the district happy.       
	But his worried supporters are asking what if the Maoists bite the bait, accept Sorens offer and manage to keep the people happy ? That will spell disaster for guruji as the poor man will have to think out new ways to win back the peoples affection to stay in his seat.

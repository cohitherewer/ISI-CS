	Pope Benedict XVI lives on a planet that is no less whimsical than the one ruled by the formidable Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland. In his land, a heretic, denounced by the Catholic Church for 400 years, has suddenly resurfaced as a hero. Just in time for the anniversary of Galileos telescope, the pope has decided, against his previous judgments, that the Italian astronomer was not of the devils party after all. In fact, his discovery that the Earth moves round the Sun helped the faithful contemplate with gratitude the Lords works. For nearly two decades, from the time he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope has steadfastly defended the trial and conviction of Galileo by the Inquisition in 1633 as rational and just. No amount of criticism had quelled his dogmatism, not even the furore at the La Sapienza University before his speech this year. But faith and reason still remain the strangest bedfellows  at least in the papal imagination.        
	On popes planet, human beings face as much danger of extinction as rainforests: the reason being the increasing disrespect to the fundamental distinction between men and women in contemporary society that violates the order... set down by creation. Though this remark has been widely interpreted as homophobic, there is an overtly anti-feminist edge as well. The militantly pro-life pope has never claimed any sympathy for either women or homosexuals. His god, he has already made clear, is strictly male, and gay rights are but a threat to civilization. So his pronouncements are not all that surprising. What is disquieting is the glaring contradiction of this orthodoxy with his avowed admiration for Galileo. Science may have finally wriggled its way into the popes mind, but what rules his heart is still the story of creation. The order that has been decreed in the holy book remains the ever-fixed point of reference for the pope. In 1986, Mr Ratzinger had condemned homosexuality as an intrinsic moral evil. It is all the more ironic that the popes disapproval of the gay community remains undiluted even in the times of radical church reforms, as Catholic bishops in England and Wales are taking a more pastoral approach to gender and sexuality.

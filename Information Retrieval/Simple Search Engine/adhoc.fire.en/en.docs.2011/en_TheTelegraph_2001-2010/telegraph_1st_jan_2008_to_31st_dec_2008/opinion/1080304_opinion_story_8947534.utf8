	Hurry up, please
         
	Sir  It is good that the president, Pratibha Patil, has realized the desperation of people denied justice, a desperation that compels them to subscribe to the deviant culture of the lynch mob (Pratibha dig at judiciary, Feb 24). Her warnings to the judiciary to mend its ways so that justice is delivered within reasonable time should be taken seriously by judges and lawyers. A common mans expectations from the countrys justice system are frustrated everyday, what with the prohibitive cost of litigation, the inordinate delay in reaching a verdict and the constant insecurity over whether the truth will prevail in the end or not. However, it would be unfair to put all the blame for the lags on the judiciary alone. As the chief justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, pointed out, poor governance and lack of administrative reform are also responsible for the huge number of cases piling up in the courts. Therefore, the government should take the initiative to set up fast-track courts where cases will be sorted out in one to five years. Besides, the court proceedings should be simplified so that more people can easily comprehend what is happening. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Surajit Das, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The concern expressed by Pratibha Patil about the huge delays in court cases is absolutely justified. Long breaks in court proceedings can only favour the guilty. Many criminals roam free for decades and many others escape altogether after their trials are endlessly deferred. In defence of their performance, members of the judiciary argue that inadequate infrastructure is to blame for the delays. But this cannot be the only reason for the deferral of cases. Scheduled proceedings are routinely adjourned by devious lawyers on some pretext or the other. A long summer vacation and other holidays also contribute to the slow pace of legal proceedings in India. In addition, strikes by lawyers, unthinkable in most developed countries, are a regular occurrence in our country. 
     
	A recent study found that if the judicial system works at the present pace, it might take another 30 years to clear the backlog of pending cases, provided not a single new lawsuit is filed. This underscores the urgent need for reforming our judicial system. The importance of Patils call to fix the judiciary cannot be over-emphasized. But will the government and the judiciary answer the call?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US 

        
	Sir  Pratibha Patil is worried about the state of the Indian judiciary, but what is new in this? It is a set speech that is repeated every few years by our top leaders. No solution has yet been found to the problem of pending court cases. The judiciary always talks about shortage of judges, while the government blames the dearth of funds. And the litigants, troubled as they already are, are left hoping against hope that their cases get resolved within their lifetimes. I remember in this context a dialogue I once heard in a Bollywood movie. A litigant lamented that in the fifteen years that he had been fighting a case, insaaf nahin, khali date mila (he got no justice, only dates). The comment sums up the malaise affecting the legal system but also suggests the remedy. If the practice of adjournment, which results in the delays, can be abolished, then cases can be disposed of faster. If examinations cannot be deferred according to a candidates wish, then why cant the same logic apply to cases? Instead of speaking from the pulpit, Patil might think about introducing this measure to ensure fast trials. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Religion no bar
     
	Sir  If Muslim women start organizing and attending religious tutorials, this step would go a long way in emancipating them (Islamic classes for women by women, Feb 25). The debates conducted at the sessions in Bhopal may all have been on religious subjects, but at least they would encourage women to come forward with their questions. This will make them more aware of their rights and will help them participate more fully in mainstream society. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Deepanjan Bhattacharya, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It is doubtful whether religious instructions to women would help liberate them. On the contrary, there is a possibility of the classes giving yet another boost to Islamic fundamentalism, while brainwashing women to accept the role they have been assigned within conservative Muslim society. The questions that the women will ask are likely to receive orthodox answers. And these in turn might make them accept gender discrimination rather than fight it.
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  Religious sessions always follow an agenda. Hence one wonders what message the religious tutorials for women in Bhopal is giving out. Although Muslim women are hardly any worse off than their Hindu counterparts as far as their status in society is concerned, it is a fact that they have little socio-economic security. Muslim personal law still allows polygamy and triple talaq. In this situation, Muslim women need to be made conscious of their rights, instead of being tutored in religion. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

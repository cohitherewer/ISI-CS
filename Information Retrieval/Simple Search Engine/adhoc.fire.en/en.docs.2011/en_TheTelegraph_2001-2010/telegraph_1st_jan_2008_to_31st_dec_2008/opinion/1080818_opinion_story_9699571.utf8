The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fresh chill in the air
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FRESH CHILL IN THE AIR                                  Gwynne Dyer                              
	Have you noticed, my wife asked, that when one of Americas allies thinks it has a green light to invade somewhere, they always do it in the summer? She was right: Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990; Israel invaded Lebanon in July 2006; Georgia invaded South Ossetia in August 2008. Israel really did have a green light from Washington, but Saddam Hussein was catastrophically wrong, and Mikhail Saakashvili was, too.        
	The difference is that the US government continues to support Saakashvili even after his smash-and-grab assault on South Ossetia went horribly wrong. The Bush administration is just trying to save face  sending in humanitarian aid in US military aircraft and ships after the shooting stopped, for example  and Washington never really backed Georgias aggression. But if the Russians dont understand that, were heading for a new Cold War.        
	That would be a very stupid way to spend the early 21st century, but the comically belligerent vice-president, Dick Cheney, is not the only one declaring that Russian aggression must not go unanswered. The US and British media are talking as if communists still rule in Moscow and Russia has committed a wanton act of aggression.        
	Republican presidential candidate John McCain declares We are all Georgians now and suggests expelling the Russians from the G8. Even relatively balanced people like the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, used Cold War analogies: This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a neighbour, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with it. Shes right about one thing  its not 1968  but the rest is nonsense.        
	Russia didnt threaten Georgia; it responded to a surprise Georgian attack on South Ossetia, a territory where there were Russian peace-keeping troops by international agreement. It has not occupied Georgias capital, nor has it overthrown the government.                
	Not dark yet        
	It is true that Moscow was unhappy about Georgias close ties with the US, which included American sponsorship of Georgia for Nato membership. It is also true that, presented with the opportunity by Saakashvilis attack, Russia has taken advantage of it to smash his shiny new American-trained army. It may even be true that Vladimir Putins government deliberately suckered Saakashvili into his attack by provoking him in various ways, but that is far from certain. Even if that did happen, it was still Georgia that attacked South Ossetia on the night of August 7, and Georgian peacekeeping troops who turned their weapons on their Russian colleagues.        
	If the Russians had not reacted as they did, Georgia would now control the whole territory, and the surviving South Ossetians would mostly be refugees in (Russian) North Ossetia. That does not give vengeful South Ossetians the right to drive the Georgian minority in the enclave out of their villages, as some reports suggest may now be happening, and it is the Russians duty to stop it. But this is not Czechoslovakia in 1968.        
	Saakashvili attacked South Ossetia because he thought his American ties would frighten the Russians into silence, but in reality the US was never going to fight a war against Russia over Georgia. So now we have the charade of the humanitarian aid, and the brazen cheek of the US special envoy to the region, Matthew Bryza, telling the BBC that the violence in the Caucasus strengthens Georgias case to join the Nato alliance.        
	The Russian troops will probably all be gone from Georgia within a week, and Saakashvili will also probably be gone within a year. There will be a certain chill in the air for a while, but the Cold War is not coming back. At least, not over this incident.

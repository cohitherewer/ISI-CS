	Doomsday in market                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has clearly been driven by his prejudice towards Western capitalism in his analysis of the current fiscal crisis (All fall down, Oct 24). He does not mention the downfall of the markets in communist China, which too is a big player in global economy. Shanghais Composite Index opened at 5278.82 points at the beginning of 2008 and slipped to 2397.37 points by the end of August this year, down by almost 55 per cent. Since the markets of all big economies are interlinked in this age of globalization, the American market cannot be isolated as the sole cause of trouble. The United States of America may have set some dangerous monetary trends, but the markets in other countries are also in the wrong for following them.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhas Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The volatility of the Indian market, besides being a symptom of a global economic pandemic, is a result of thoughtless financial liberalism practised by irresponsible private financial organizations. Ashok Mitra, therefore, is quite right in saying that only the government now can save the market. The private financial institutions have been busy picking up their profit shares, without bothering about the long-term consequences. The mortgage crisis in the US had its parallel in India, with private banks dispensing easy loans to their customers, many of whom later defaulted. Although the government can now hardly compensate the mammoth losses, it should step in to protect the economy from further erosion, by keeping track of the internal functions of private financial companies.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amitava Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The bloodbath at the Bombay Stock Exchange as well as in the markets worldwide evidently dampened the mood for the celebration of Diwali. Thousands of day-traders are living a life of terrible uncertainty. Before imitating the liberal financial policies of the US, the leaders of the Indian economy should have remembered that the average standard of living in India is much lower than that in the US. Who knows how many day-traders will be forced to commit suicide if the market crashes? Hopefully the government has learnt its lessons, and there would be regular checks on the goings-on in the private organizations from now on, so that the entry and exit of foreign investors or the collapse of foreign markets do not destabilize the Indian market.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Badruddin Ahmed, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The only viable solution to the financial terror, if Ashok Mitras counsel of shunning altogether the US economy has to be followed, is to make the Indian economy primarily agrarian again. This might make our markets less volatile than Americas, but it will definitely not be a terribly rewarding scheme. Even nationalized banks are hit by the global recession; so investment in less-profitable agrarian policies cannot be entirely out of the cycle either. Also, in the middle of this mayhem, it will not be wise to switch to a completely new mode of economy. It will be worth waiting for some more time for the government to correct the errors within the system. Some fundamental corrections will hopefully revive the high-tech and industrial sectors, whereas a modern agrarian economy will require lumpsum investments in contract farming, genetic research and a major overhaul in Indias existing agro-industrial sector. Given the current economic climate, the country cannot afford it now.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore

                
	Sir  In a pedantic tone, Ashok Mitra argues that the so-called free market does not raise human welfare to its highest possible level. How is it possible then that South Korea, pursuing the free market spirit, has a per capita income of $24,600, while North Korea, not a follower of the same, lags far behind at $1,900? The same goes for Taiwans laissez faire economy that has a per capita income of $29,800 compared to a meagre $4,500 of socialist Cuba. Also, the author does not explain why the corruption index is so high in communist China, if capitalism is the sole reason for the loss of morals. Technological advancement, along with liberalization, has increased the rate of consumption worldwide. As a result, whether a nation has a liberal economy or not, citizens have grown used to the consumption of excess. In fact, in a race for higher GDPs, the governments of many countries, whether communist, socialist or capitalist, are encouraging large-scale consumption. Mitra is, as always, wrong in blaming it all on capitalism.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Union government and the Reserve Bank of India seem to have exhausted all their ways to arrest the fall of the Indian market. So Indian investors have been left to look towards the Dow Jones (In America Indian investors trust, Oct 24). Resorting to conventional ways, such as slashing the Repo rate, will not help. The Centre needs to introduce some radical measures to combat this debacle. If necessary, it should ban intra-day trading, which was responsible for the rapid fall of the index by a thousand points in a single day recently. The stocks of big companies with strong support base lost over 10 per cent in a days trading owing to random purchase and sale. The Securities and Exchange Board of India should make all stocks adopt the trade to trade (T2T) mode, and prohibit the sale of stocks on the day of purchase. There should be a minimum lock-in period of maybe 3-4 trading sessions before a stock may be resold.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  P. Chidambaram seems worried only about the plummeting Sensex and the affected investors (Tongue biting, Oct 25). The problems of investors who trust only banks and post offices seem to have gone unnoticed by the finance minister. I bought certificates worth Rs 5 lakh from HDFC Bank in 2004. For the last two months, I have been requesting the bank to allow its redemption for an emergency I have faced. My request was turned down on the ground that the money was not supposed to be withdrawn before the completion of six years. But when I requested the bank to grant me a loan of Rs 5 lakh against the bond with the promised half per cent additional interest in the 8 per cent interest facility granted in the bond I had purchased, the bank stated that the loan could be granted only at an interest of 16 per cent. I understand that private banks have to stretch themselves to grant loans in the midst of this turmoil. But if the Centre wants, it could help banks provide loans to people in need.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Statement through style                  
	Sir  All young women in the city dress similarly these days. It is evident that they religiously follow the tips that are given in fashion magazines. What they dont seem to realize is that their individuality is lost in these dresses with their narrow leggings, polka dots, and cuts and frills. Distinguishing one clone from another becomes quite a task. Following popular trends is a common practice among young girls, but perhaps they should put personal style above fashion, so that their art of dressing bears the signature of their persona.

	New name          
	Sir  Oxford Inspires, a cultural development agency in Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom, has decided to replace the word, Christmas, with Winter Light Festival to secularize the event and make it more inclusive (Christmas axed from Oxford, Nov 3). But by proposing to remove the word Christmas from the lexicon of Christian festivals, the agency is ignoring the religious context of this very occasion: the birth of Jesus Christ. A similar attempt was made three years ago in America when the White House issued a Christmas card signed by President George W. Bush and Laura Bush. The card did not have any reference to Christmas. Instead, it reportedly carried wishes for the holiday season. This secular drive may have been an endeavour to win over non-Christian nations, but when it came to endorsing the life-saving stem-cell research, President Bush chose to cling to his Catholic faith and opposed the scientific researches in his country. Similarly, Oxford Inspires may also end up exposing its prejudices at some point in the future. In fact, the decision to retain the Christmas tree shows how superficial the groups principles are.

	Sir  Not only Christians but other religious communities celebrate Christmas by indulging in material excess. Now, we we hear that the word, Christmas, will be pruned out of the festivities by a cultural organization in Oxfordshire to add a secular dimension to the birth of Christ. All over the world, Christmas today is merely an occasion to splurge on costly gifts and on food. Some people are apparently unhappy that the fiscal meltdown will result in Christmas not being as extravagant as it has been in the past few years. The commercialization of this religious festival has robbed it of its solemnity and spiritual grandeur. We are forgetting that Jesus was born in a manger and this poor kings wealth signified his love, and not gold and riches.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The airline industry in India is suffering not merely because of financial reasons, but also because of unprofessional airport staff. I flew from Bangkok to Calcutta recently, and after I collected my luggage I was horrified to find that all my money and other valuables were missing. There was no sign of tampering, however, and the locks were intact. I suspect that the things were stolen by someone before the delivery of luggage from the conveyor belt, because out of the three bags I collected two from the conveyor belt in no time, but the one from which the things went missing was seen lying in a corner almost half an hour later. When I approached the airport authority for help, the staff seemed clueless. Some of them even suggested that it was my fault. I was leaving for Guwahati soon, so I left after being assured that a probe would be ordered. I called Calcutta airport a couple of times later, only to discover that no one knew of the incident.           
	Yours faithfully,

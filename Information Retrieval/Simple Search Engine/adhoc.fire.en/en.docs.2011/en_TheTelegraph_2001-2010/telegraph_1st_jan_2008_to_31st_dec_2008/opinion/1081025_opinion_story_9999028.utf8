	Death knell for the birds                  
	Sir  The rhythmic beats of dhaks is an integral part of the festive mood in Bengal. The dhaks are often adorned with feathers, for which thousands of egrets, herons and storks are killed each year before the festive season starts. Most of these birds are protected species, and the Asian open-bill stork is an endangered one. The dhakis usually purchase the plumes from hunters and gunmen, who consume the meat and sell the feathers. Unless the forest department takes immediate measures to stop the killings, these birds would eventually face extinction. People also need to be made aware of this meaningless butchery so that they can help forest officials catch the culprits.           
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha, Murshidabad 
        
	Who cares?          
	Sir  The news of the collapse of a bridge being constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation in east Delhi was shocking (2 die as Delhi Metro bridge collapses, Oct 20). It is ironical that a bridge being built under a transport project, which has come to symbolise the capitals ambition to become a world-class city, should fall down, causing two deaths and injuring 17 people. The incident once again raises the question as to whether adequate steps are taken to ensure public safety in the cities and metros of India.           
	Although no major mishap has occurred in any Metro site till date, the sudden collapse of the bridge was an eye-opener. If workers at Metro locations usually waved black flags and glowing rods to direct drivers along alternative routes, how did this bridge land on a bus and two cars? The accident points at a lapse in the precautionary measures adopted by the DMRC.          
	The collapse of the bridge also raises a question about the quality of the materials being used in its construction. If a bridge is so fragile in the initial stages of its construction, nobody can trust it when it is opened.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The DMRC has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the family of each of the dead and Rs 50,000 each to the injured. Declarations of compensations, along with the promise of an inquiry, have become part of the usual platitudes that are offered after any accident. But have these superficial gestures of concern succeeded in preventing accidents from recurring? Unless there is a strict quality-control on the materials used in construction projects, and safety rules are strictly followed, untoward incidents will continue to occur. The state governments should open monitoring cells in every construction site that will keep constant checks on the work in progress.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is said that accidents do not happen, but are caused. The bridge in Delhi would not have tumbled down had the contractors, engineers and officials at the site been careful enough. The politicians, who are always so ready to offer sympathy to those affected, cannot be absolved of blame either. More often that not, it is the nexus between politicians, construction companies and promoters, all of whom are after personal gains, that results in the poor quality of construction materials and lack of supervision at the sites, leading to tragedies like this one. People would continue to suffer if the system is not purged of corruption.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  The collapse of the bridge and the launcher cradling it will be a blemish on the otherwise spotless track record of the DMRC. In future, traffic should be closed when huge blocks are being lifted. Or else, construction work should be conducted only at night, when the the flow of traffic is thin.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DIFFICULT SHOW                                                    
	Everybody loves a good fiction, especially when it comes packaged as the real thing. The ubiquitous reality shows featuring children excel in the art of make-believe. The participants, dressed up in the manner of their favourite Bollywood idols, sing or dance before a panel of judges. While they are at it, the little Hrithik Roshans and Bipasha Basus are expected to equal their role models in performance. If these aspirants manage to impress initially, they are praised to the skies, which turns their fervent wishes into earnest conviction: they believe that they have become the stars themselves. Sixteen-year-old Shinjini Sengupta, now recovering from a complicated illness, allegedly fell victim to such grand illusions. After a promising stint at a dance contest, she faltered, was rebuked by the judges, and temporarily lost her power of speech and movement. Fingers are now being pointed at the parents  who apparently knew of her pre-existing spinal injury but were tempted by the prize-money  and at the judges for humiliating her in public.        
	The link between Ms Senguptas trauma and the harshness of the judges remains medically unverifiable. But this has not deterred the women and child development minister from calling for an end to such reality shows. The information and broadcasting ministry has been more prudent in asking for safeguards to forestall such incidents. (Last year, Shilpa Shettys bitter experience of racism at Celebrity Big Brother ushered in a closer scrutiny of such programmes in Britain.) Admittedly, children are being increasingly pushed into the deep end of competition by parents blinded by the allure of vicarious fame and monetary gains. The State can regulate the sphere of parental influence only to an extent, when parental pressure takes on criminal dimensions  as in the death of Biswadeep Bhattacharya last year, hit by his father for missing a shot at a table-tennis training session. In Ms Senguptas case, the blame cannot be squarely put on her parents. It is difficult, given her age, to decide where volition ended and coercion began. There is also no reason to summarily condemn every talent hunt, on the assumption that whoever participates is egged on by pushy parents. To many, a degree of success, or even an appearance in such a show, might enhance their self-confidence, and also bring on the first stirrings of maturity that come from being able to take both victory and defeat with grace.

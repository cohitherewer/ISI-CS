	I have been reading the autobiography of John Hope Franklin, an American historian who rose from obscurity to reach the very pinnacle of his profession. Franklin was born in 1915, to black parents who lived in the southern state of Oklahoma. Fifty years before his birth, a civil war had been fought, and won, on the question of race. However, although the Norths victory led to the abolition of slavery, in the South discrimination against the formerly subject race continued. Blacks could not vote or seek elected office. The best schools and universities were barred to them. So were the best restaurants and the most lucrative professions.        
	Franklins parents were god-fearing and hardworking. His father was an honest and able lawyer, working mostly with black clients. His mother was a caring homemaker, who worked in odd jobs when she could. Their example inspired him to seek a level of education well beyond what was then thought possible or desirable for a black man growing up in the southern United States. He took his first degree in a college for black students, which, however, did allow white teachers, one of whom became John Hopes mentor. This man had studied at Harvard, but left without finishing his Ph D (which was to be in history). When his black student got admission to the same programme, the white professor gave him a personal loan till such time as the university offered him financial aid.        
	John Hope Franklin succeeded where his teacher had failed. After taking a Ph D in history, he taught in a succession of black-only colleges (including the prestigious Howard University), before becoming the first historian of colour to be appointed to a full professorship at a major white institution  Brooklyn College  in New York. Later, he joined the great University of Chicago. His career ended at Duke, arguably the finest university in the southern United States, and a place that until recently had vigorously practised racial segregation.              
	In the course of a long career, John Hope Franklin won many distinctions. He was the first black scholar to be elected president of the two most prestigious professional associations, the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association. He was awarded a string of honorary doctorates, including one from his alma mater, Harvard. He won one of Americas highest honours, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And in his lifetime he witnessed the opening of a major new academic initiative named after himself. This is the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute at Duke University, established in 1999. According to its homepage, the institute is an interdisciplinary humanities center dedicated to supporting humanities, arts, and social science research and teaching at Duke. It seeks to encourage serious humanistic inquiry throughout the entire University and to instill the general public with an awareness of the centrality of the humanities to the quality of human life and social interaction. And it promotes scholarship that enhances social equity, especially research on race and ethnicity in their most profound historical and international dimensions.        
	The focus of Franklins own research was the social history of race relations, as exemplified by his early work, From Slavery to Freedom, which went on to sell more than three million copies. His many books included biographies as well as analyses of travel literature. He trained dozens of graduate students, and was a very popular and successful head of department at both Brooklyn and Chicago.        
	From what I have just recounted, the career of John Hope Franklin is one of success and distinction. What I have thus far omitted to mention are the struggles and the suffering. One of his most vivid memories is of his mother and he being turned out of a whites-only railway compartment. At other times, he was refused service at ticket counters and at restaurants. The ordinary white American saw his black compatriot as a second-class citizen; but, as Franklin relates, his professional colleagues were not wholly free from racial prejudice either. There were academic meetings where he was barred from staying in the same hotel as his white counterparts. He even suggests that some highly regarded academic journals would not review his books because of his race.         
	Franklins life and scholarship provides a bridge between the civil war and the civil rights struggle. He helped prepare the brief for the famous case, Brown versus Board of Education, that ended segregation in schools. Later, he took part in the marches of the Sixties that sought to endow African-Americans with the full rights of citizenship. That movement finally allowed his people the right to vote, and allowed them too a greater access to schools and jobs, and to fairer treatment before the law. But, as he learnt from experience, while discrimination and prejudice were removed from the statute books, they did not entirely disappear from daily life. Indeed, on the night before he was to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he went for dinner at a Washington club, where a white woman, thinking that a man of his colour could only be one of the menial staff, handed him her coat to hang up.        
	In the last pages of his book, Franklin notes that there are now more black men in jails than in colleges in America. What does this fact, he asks, say for the direction in which our society is moving? We cannot have a healthy and wholesome society, he says, as long as the young black male is alienated. The entire social system of America, argues Franklin, bears the special responsibility for the current plight of these young people who, in a very real way, may be regarded as a metaphor for the ills of our society and the problems we face. Then, in the final sentences of a fine and at times very moving book, the historian places the problem in proper historical context. He writes:         
	It was the nations slave policy, even before it was a nation, that sealed their fate and the fate of the nation. It was the nations erection of an apartheid society after slavery that made them pariahs of the land, thus hanging a chain of dishonesty and hypocrisy around the nations neck. It was a national economic policy that withheld from them opportunities to train for jobs requiring technical skills and special responsibilities that modern America could provide And it was national policy that permitted its citizens to badger them, goad them, and humiliate them to the point where they could not be easily reached. But they must be reached, through legislation, goodwill, understanding, and compassion. The test of an advanced society is not in how many millionaires it can produce, but in how many law-abiding, hardworking, highly respected, and self-respecting loyal citizens it can produce. The success of such a venture is the measure of the success of our national enterprise.               
	John Hope Franklins book carries the telling title: Mirror to America. It was published in 2005, at a time when the author would not have known that an African-American was soon to mount a very impressive campaign for the presidency of the United States. Reading Franklins book is an educative experience; more so against the background of the Democratic primaries, and the bitter and contentious debates that have arisen around it. This primary has opposed a woman to an African-American. Both are from groups that have historically been discriminated against. But listening to Barack Obama, or reading John Hope Franklin, one should have no doubt as to which is more disadvantaged. For the womens movement has been far more successful in having its claims endorsed and appreciated by society at large. It is hard, sometimes, to be a white woman in the United States; harder still to be a black man.

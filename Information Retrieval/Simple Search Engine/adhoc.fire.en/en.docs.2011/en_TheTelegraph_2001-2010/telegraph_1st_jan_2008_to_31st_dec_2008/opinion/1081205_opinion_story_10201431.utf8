	Under fire                  
	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee points out correctly that terrorism is a global phenomenon and it is impossible for India to tackle this menace on its own (In dubious battle, Nov 30). There are several reasons for this. Firstly, jihadi outfits are mushrooming at an alarming rate. They are well-equipped with electronic gadgets, which make things difficult for security personnel. Secondly, with its extended reach, terrorism has rendered national as well as geopolitical boundaries irrelevant. Foreign nationals suffered as much as Indian citizens in the recent attacks in Mumbai. Global terror has even turned the ostensible logic of Islamic jihad on its heads: thousands of innocent Muslims have been killed in India, Pakistan and in other countries as a result of such strikes.           
	In the wake of the Mumbai attacks, the usual blame game has started once again. The allegation of Indian intelligence networks that the attacks were carried out by Pakistan has been denied by the government of that country. As a result, diplomatic ties between the two nations have been adversely affected. The question of the common mans security seems to have got lost amidst the charges that are being traded. Both India and Pakistan are victims of terror. The attacks on the Taj and the Oberoi followed the disasters at Pakistans J.W. Marriott hotel. The time has come for the two nations to collaborate, and not point fingers at each other. Only that can help rid us of global terror.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Terrorism may be affecting the whole world but it would be wrong to club the various terror outfits together. Unlike what Rudrangshu Mukherjee says, each terror group operates within a specific geopolitical context, thereby reinforcing the borders and boundaries among affected nation-states. The terror perpetrated by the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan insulated the nation and resulted in the infringement of the peoples social and cultural rights. The Indian Mujahideen has devastated some Indian cities. The al Qaida targets pillars of Western civilization, namely subjects in the United States of America. Militants in Pakistan are trying to occupy the whole of Kashmir. Islamic extremists around the world may draw inspiration from the leading global terrorist network, al Qaida, but they still remain separate entities with diverse agendas. What is also worrying is that terror has now acquired many new faces. In India, the clashes in Assam, Darjeeling and the ones between the Gujjars and Meenas in Rajasthan are all examples of a versatile evil. In a bid to denounce Islamic terror, Mukherjee, like many others, seems to have overlooked the latent forms of terrorism that dog India today.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapas Bandyopadhyaya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Apart from criticizing the incompetent government, intelligence services and politicians, Rudrangshu Mukherjee offers nothing new in his article. One had hoped that Mukherjee would illuminate the historical aspects of terrorism in the Indian subcontinent for the readers.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Manas Adhikary, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee deserves praise for detecting the lapses in Indias administrative and intelligence bodies. But suggestions, other than those offered by Mukherjee, should also be looked at. The defence and administrative systems need to be overhauled completely. Special teams in intelligence, both at the Centre as well as in the states, should be constituted. If there are any lapses on their part, these units should be held accountable to the people and not to politicians. Communication between intelligence agencies and citizens has been minimal so far. This can be improved upon by organizing meetings between the citizens and intelligence officers.           
	Indias porous borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh need to be bolstered, and captured terrorists should be executed after a brief trial to deter these men. Tolerance and mercy may have been Indias pride, but in these troubled times, lenience can only lead to further despair.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Kumar Dutta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Season in hell (Nov 28), states that those who attacked people and hotels in Mumbai had support and supplies within the city. This might well be true as the terrorists could not have executed their plan in such a well-orchestrated manner without having support at the base. However, support, in this case, means more than resources. The slips on the part of the security network must have made the task easier for the attackers. But the fault does not lie with the police alone. Often, it is the people who refuse to adhere to security drills, such as frisking before entering cinema halls or auditoriums. Such tantrums on the part of citizens make it difficult for the guards to do their work. Security checks may inconvenience citizens but the momentary discomfort is a small price to pay to make our country safe from frequent attacks by terrorists.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Sir  Our brave commandos have saved the nation from insurgents time and again. Once the threats are neutralized, it is business as usual for the complacent people of this country. Now that the Mumbai terror strike is history, a casual attitude towards public safety is likely to set in yet again. This is dangerous because such a relaxed attitude will result in lowering the guard and increase chances of yet another massacre. More lives will thus be lost in yet another unprecedented carnage but will that change things around? Unlikely. The editorial, Harsh lessons (Nov 30), hit the nail on the head by saying that a responsible attitude on the part of citizens and a change of mindset are needed, not just for a few days or months but for all times.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Ichhapore, North 24 Parganas

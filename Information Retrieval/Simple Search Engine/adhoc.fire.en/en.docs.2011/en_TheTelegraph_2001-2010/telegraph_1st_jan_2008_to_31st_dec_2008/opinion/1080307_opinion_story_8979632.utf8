	Hot potato                  
	Sir  When farmers demand cold-storage space, they get kicks and baton blows (Potato riot for storage space, Feb 29). After this, what should they give us if we want potatoes from them? The ministers and their lackeys will obviously claim that the policemen were provoked into beating the agitating farmers. But what had caused the farmers to protest in the first place? They had been pushed to the wall by the government and its corrupt officials. I wish to ask why the police needed to kick the farmers when they had other more civilized ways of dealing with the protest.           
	We start crying foul when the price of an essential vegetable like potato rises, but are the farmers to blame for it? In fact, they are the victims, since they are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices owing to lack of storage space. It is shameful that farmers in India are treated so shabbily. Why cant the government provide an essential service like cold-storage facility for perishable food items? If we take the black-market rate for storing a 50-kg bag of potatoes to be Rs 20, then it seems that the administration of Gangarampur Agricultural Marketing Society has pocketed Rs 40 lakh or thereabouts with its 10,000-tonne capacity. If we think of the projected state-wide production of 85-88 lakh tonne this year, we can get an inkling of the sordid game that is going on. No wonder political parties fight among themselves to establish control over agricultural marketing.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The growth of any sector depends on the well-being of producers and consumers, and the farming sector is no exception. It does not need an economist to tell you that proper storage facility, coupled with better transportation of agricultural produce from the doorstep of the farmer to that of the consumer, would reduce transmission loss and benefit both sides equally. Apart from it being unethical to allow 30 per cent of farmed food to go waste, a better return would entice farmers to increase production. The basic principle of any industrialization drive is to ensure increase in farm produce per acre. This is not only meant to neutralize the loss of arable land to industry and maintain food security but also to enhance the per capita income of rural folk. The growth in both the sectors would generate jobs and encourage those manning the supply chain (in other words, middlemen who prevent farmers from getting the full amount from the sale of their produce) of farm products to move away from it.           
	The West Bengal government should take a holistic view of things and facilitate private investment in the farm retail sector.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	House of cards          
	Sir  Its really shocking to see how irresponsible our members of parliament are. Disruptions, pandemonium, and a huge wastage of time and resources have become the salient features of the Indian parliament. Instances of MPs coming to blows are not hard to find. They also specialize in coming up with novel ways of registering protest. Since the 10th Lok Sabha in 1991, MPs have wasted nearly 700 hours and an unbelievable 63 crore rupees. Each minute of a session costs Rs 25,000. Needless to say, every penny of it comes from the taxpayers pocket, as does the money to pay for the many comforts and allowances of our elected representatives. And yet, they show no sense of responsibility towards their duty of legislating. Important bills lie neglected for months on end. India needs a code of professional and ethical conduct for its MPs.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

                
	Sir  At the special session of Parliament convened to commemorate the golden jubilee of Indias republic-hood, MPs solemnly pledged that they would not disrupt the proceedings of the House. But the pledge was forgotten as soon as the special session was over. The chief opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and its allies disturbed proceedings on the opening days of the budget session for no other reason but to gain some political mileage out of it. Wasting tax-payers money by disrupting costly parliamentary proceedings is nothing less than a crime against the people. The courts should take a call on this.           
	Yours faithfully,

	No love lost          
	Sir  Tennis has always presented a picture of unity compared to other sports in India. But after the revolt in the Indian Davis Cup team, this seems to be a thing of the past. Although Karan Rastogi has withdrawn his complaint, Prakash Amritraj, Rohan Bopanna and Mahesh Bhupathi are still not budging from their stand of refusing to play under the captaincy of Leander Paes in the upcoming tie against Japan. Is the crisis a fallout of the long-standing feud between Paes and Bhupathi? Paess commitment to his country is beyond question. His decision to rest the unfit Amritraj Jr on the opening day and field him on the penultimate day against Uzbekistan proved to be prophetic. The players and officials should together try to settle the differences.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok K. Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi pair has brought Indians a lot of cheer in the past. It is painful to watch the partnership falling apart. Was it necessary for Paes to call Prakash Amritraj unprofessional in public after the Davis Cup tie against Uzbekistan? Paes may be ultra-patriotic, but that does not mean that others are not committed to playing for India. The All India Tennis Association should calm down the disgruntled players, and see to it that the falling out of the star players does not affect the fortunes of the country in the Davis Cup (AITA buys time, Feb 29).          
	Yours faithfully,

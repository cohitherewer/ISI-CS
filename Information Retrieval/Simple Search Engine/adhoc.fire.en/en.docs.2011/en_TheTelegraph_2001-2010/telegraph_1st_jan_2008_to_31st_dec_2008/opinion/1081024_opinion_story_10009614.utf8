	A country on the verge of fear                
	A History of Modern Britain By Andrew Marr, Pan,5.15                
	Andrew Marr is a journalist who makes no pretence of being a historian. He writes the history of contemporary Britain from the 1940s to the present times through anecdotes and quotations rather than through analysis. This is not to say that the last element is absent, but to emphasize what are really the two most novel features of the book. He is not afraid to make judgments, even predictions. He, however, advises his readers to forget the crystal ball when they read this book. His view of Britain is that of a country on the edge: fear of war and invasion, bankruptcy and shortage, the Cold War and migration. The book is not only about politics. It is also about societal currents and the emergence of varieties of popular culture. It is written with aplomb and it is obvious that his subject matter draws and engages Marr.               
	Natives In A Foreign Land              
	Sahibs Who Loved India Compiled and edited by Khushwant Singh, Viking, Rs 325                
	The story of sahibs who loved India probably begins with William Jones and will have other remarkable heroes like C.F. Andrews and Verrier Elwin. Khushwant Singh does not go back that far, but to those sahibs  civil servants, boxwallahs, journalists  who were alive when Singh was the editor of The Illustrated Weekly of India, which is where all these articles appeared. Some of the pieces are remarkably perspicacious. Take this bit from the pen of Philip Knightley, who was in India in the early 1960s. He wrote this in the early 1970s: [Television] is on the way. This will certainly spell the end to the social ease that is Indias great attraction. No more dropping in unannounced, no more spontaneous parties, no more all-night conversations. Once the square-eyes monster moves in he rules absolutely. Among the contributors there is one remarkable omission: the redoubtable Bob Wright, who was quite a figure in his time in Calcutta. Among the sahibs who loved India it is possible to make a division: those who loved India, spent some time here and then went home; and those who stayed on. Singh does not make the distinction.              
	Struck By The Music              
	Musicophilia:Tales of Music And The Brain by Oliver Sacks, Picador, 5.99                
	Music is not only the food of love, it can also minister to a troubled mind. One amazing real-life story that Sacks narrates is that of a doctor who was struck by lightning and had a near-death experience. On recovery, he was inspired to become a pianist, and playing the piano became a kind of obsession, but a very pleasant one. He couldnt explain from where the music came to him; it just came to him, as it indeed did to Mozart himself. Sacks is a physician and his book brings together the stories of many individuals and their varied responses to music. People stricken with Parkinsons can become animated by a familiar tune; memories are revived in an Alzheimers patient by a particular melody. Sacks book has many amazing experiences to tell. His writing is relatively free of jargon, given his subject. The stories open up a question: is the response to music something instinctive on the part of homo sapiens?

	Last lap                  
	Sir  Sourav Gangulys farewell from international cricket was in a match that will be remembered for many years to come. His last Test match was V.V.S. Laxmans 100th, in which Harbhajan Singh got his 300th wicket, and Sachin Tendulkar took his 100th catch. M.S. Dhonis magnificent gesture to hand over the captaincy to Ganguly after the ninth Australian wicket fell also showed the team to be a cohesive unit that knows how to respect seniors. Being a Bengali and a resident of Ranchi, I felt proud of both Ganguly and Dhoni.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Supriyo Joardar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  Love him or hate him but you just cannot ignore him. Throughout his career, Sourav Ganguly has always proved his critics wrong. If cynics thought his debut century at Lords was a fluke, he followed it up with another one at Trentbridge in the same series. When he staged a comeback in 2006, he ended up being the top scorer against the Proteas in South Africa. In 2007, he single-handedly won us the series against Pakistan at home, the first such instance since 1979-80. Not many recall his match-winning knock at Kanpur earlier this year, which saved India the ignominy of losing the series to South Africa at home. Despite being a key factor in many of Indias victories in the past two years, he was left out of the Rest of India squad for the Irani Trophy. By quitting international cricket, he has done what any person with self respect would do. His century in Mohali and 85 in Nagpur are testimony to the fact that he can still score runs against the best teams in the world. He walks into the sunset with his head held high.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  One of the many reasons to remember the Nagpur Test is the titanic exit of Sourav Ganguly from the international cricket arena (We will remember the years of pluck, not the day of duck, Nov 10). The farewell match didnt follow the script that his fans had prepared for Ganguly before the onset of the series. Dada missed the ton but his flawless 85 in the first innings helped India take an upper hand against the mighty Aussies. Although Jason Krejza dismissed him for a first-ball duck in his final innings on the penultimate day of the Test, India was already in a position to dictate terms to the opposition. There is no doubt that a leader of men like Ganguly is happy to have finished his glorious career on a winning note.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Too early to celebrate          
	Sir  It is rather amusing to see the wild celebrations in the media on Barack Obamas election to the presidency of the United States of America. Obamas election, we are told, is a new dawn; the US has put its racist past firmly behind it, and we can now look forward to a kinder, gentler America. These sentiments are very nice. Sadly, they are also somewhat exaggerated.           
	Obama started with several advantages  he is young and personable and was never associated with the Iraq war. Furthermore, his erratic and aged opponent committed hara-kiri by appointing as his running mate someone who might politely be described as bizarre. Obama  or Hillary Clinton, for that matter  should have won by a landslide. Instead, in an election with an unprecedentedly high turnout (just 64 per cent of all eligible voters), Obama barely scraped through, with 52 per cent of the popular vote, not much more than what Bush had got in 2004. This means that just one of every three Americans have voted for Obama. That should give us pause to think.           
	For those who presume Obama will be better than Bush, it must be pointed out that he has repeatedly changed his stance on key issues to please everyone, and that his election will make no difference to the African-Americans who are cheering his victory. In fact, Obama is likely to have to prove his fitness for the office he will occupy by trying extra hard to show that he does not unduly favour blacks. Their situation, far from improving, might actually worsen.           
	Obama talks of withdrawing troops from Iraq, but is determined to continue the Afghan war, which is proving to be as unpopular and unwinnable as Iraq. Another point to ponder would be that Obama did not use public finances for his campaign, but chose funds from private sources. This means that he is now indebted to corporate houses and will have to keep appeasing them if he wishes to seek re-election. Therefore, we can say goodbye to serious attempts to rescue poor Americans, or the environment.           
	If there is one thing that is positive about Obamania, it is this: by ecstatically welcoming his election, the people of India proved that, despite Manmohan Singhs claims, they certainly do not love George W. Bush.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Brian James Kharmawphlang, Shillong 

                
	Sir  The election of Barack Obama as president of the US cannot be assumed to fulfil Martin Luther Kings dream, any more than Benjamin Disraelis premiership in Britain in the 19th century enhanced the position of Jews, or Margaret Thatchers improved the status of women in Britain.           
	What Obamas win proves, however, is that we live in a globalized but unequal world with a few bubbles. Obamas half-brother earns his living rearing goats in a remote village in Kenya and he does not share the same language and culture with the president, let alone wealth and status. Do we need further proof of this?           
	Yours faithfully,

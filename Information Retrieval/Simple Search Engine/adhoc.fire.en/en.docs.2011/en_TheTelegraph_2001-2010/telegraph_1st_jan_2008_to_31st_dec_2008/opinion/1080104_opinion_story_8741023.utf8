	Although the world has to rest content with seven wonders, the rich photographs of 100 Wonders of India: the Finest Treasures of Civilisation and Nature (Roli, Rs 795) suggest that India has far more than a hundred. It is impossible to escape a sense of arbitrariness in the choice of man-made and natural treasures displayed in the book. The accompanying write-ups contain details of history, geography, location and aesthetic tradition where relevant. The picture on the left shows the piers of the Sheshagirirayar Mandapa of the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Tamil Nadu. The relics of St Francis Xavier preserved in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa are shown in the picture on the middle, and below it is a view of Old Delhi from the minaret of the Jama Masjid, built by Shah Jahan in 1656.

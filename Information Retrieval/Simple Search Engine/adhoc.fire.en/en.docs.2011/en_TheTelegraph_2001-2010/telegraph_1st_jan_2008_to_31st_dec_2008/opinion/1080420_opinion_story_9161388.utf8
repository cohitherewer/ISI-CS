	Exceptions prove the rule                  
	Sir  It is ironic that when it comes to a supermodel like Carla Bruni, nudity no longer remains a symbol of oppression. Rather, such images fetch astonishing prices (Carla Bruni nude snap sells for 45,000, April 12). The hype created by the media around such trivia sets skewed standards of morality in the society. Female nudity as a public spectacle is no longer outrageously exploitative when celebrities are involved. Empowered women like Bruni should think twice about the social implications of their act before baring all.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Haunted past          
	Sir  Indians have the right to know who is responsible for the assassination of the former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi. Priyanka Vadra, being the daughter of the deceased, would be naturally more eager to get to the truth. However, given Priyankas obvious political lineage, one wonders if her visit to Nalini was driven by motives entirely personal. Is it merely accidental that the timing of the visit coincided with Arjun Singhs proposal to put up Rahul Gandhi as the next prime ministerial candidate? It is likely that the Congress will try to use the visit to rouse popular sentiments to bolster electoral support for the 2009 elections.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Priyanka Vadra has shown exemplary humility in taking the initiative to meet Nalini, who was allegedly involved in the conspiracy that killed her father, Rajiv Gandhi. Earlier, her mother, Sonia Gandhi, had pleaded clemency for Nalini, thereby converting her death sentence to life-imprisonment. Sonia did not want Nalinis daughter, like her own children, to become an orphan, and hence her appeal. Such charitable behaviour should inspire other families to come to terms with their misfortune. The family of Pramod Mahajan too should forgive his murderer and brother, Praveen, and seek his pardon.          
	The Nehru-Gandhi family has always been courageous and has selflessly dedicated itself to the nation, despite two assassinations. It is heartening to see that the children of this illustrious family are equally resolute in their actions.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The meeting between Priyanka Vadra and Nalini is a touching story and is bound to evoke public sympathy. Few will disagree with Priyankas request that her privacy be respected, and that the visit to Vellore is not turned into a matter for speculation. For the scions of political families, public life is not idyllic. Yet, being a Nehru-Gandhi, Priyanka may not escape peoples scrutiny. They will continue to wonder why the visit took place at this particular juncture.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Before deifying Priyanka Vadra, the media should take stock of the ways in which her visit breached protocol. To begin with, her visit was not recorded in the jail register. When quizzed by journalists, she seemed to have had no qualms in admitting to this discrepancy. She even went on to lecture them about the virtues of forgetting and forgiving.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Loo and behold           
	Sir  Bengal is projected as an investors haven, but the reality is quite grim. On a recent trip to Siliguri, I was compelled to use public toilets. The state they are in is nightmarish. It is a shame that women have to use these filthy toilets for lack of a choice, unlike men who relieve themselves in public.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Pilgrims regress                  
	Sir  The opposition to the allotment of forestland in Jammu and Kashmir to the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board by certain political parties is unfair and deserves the strictest condemnation by all secular citizens of the nation (Land fall, July 2). It is the duty of the state government to make suitable arrangement for the lodging and safety of the thousands of devotees who visit the shrine every year. There was nothing patently unreasonable in the giving away of the land to reduce the hardships of the pilgrims. If investors are allowed to set up factories in several states, what harm could come from building shelters for weary and weather-beaten pilgrims? Why should then the government spend crores on Haj subsidies?           
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Sir  Thousands of devotees visit Amarnath for the annual yatra and during the arduous journey, they need temporary shelter facilities. It was with noble intentions that the Jammu and Kashmir government allotted the degraded forestland to the SASB to construct temporary structures for the Amarnath yatris. It was clarified that the proprietory status of the forestland would remain unchanged and that the board would have to comply with environment protection laws. There was nothing unseemly about these privileges, but in India, it does not take much to communalize any issue. With political turmoil sweeping the country over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Amarnath controversy is bound to provide the ideal opening to the Hindu far-Right to fully exploit the communal angle. Other than the strikes, gun fire, and destruction of public property, nothing much of political value can be gained through such extremist means.           
	The Bharatiya Janata Party has refused to learn from history  from the aftermath of the Gujarat pogrom to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. This time too, any attempt at escalating the already deepened crisis in the Kashmir valley will only shatter L.K. Advanis dream of becoming the prime minister of India after the next general elections.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to stall the transfer of the promised forestland to the SASB, under pressure from Muslims. When the Peoples Democratic Party withdrew support to the Congress in the state, the latter developed cold feet, and did not have second thoughts about endangering its secular credentials. The Congress has yet again taken the majority community for granted, in another wanton attempt to please a minority community. When other communities have unfettered rights to manage their religious affairs, why should the Hindus alone be denied theirs?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vijayalakshmi, Chennai 

                
	Sir  After a lot of political wrangling, the Jammu and Kashmir government has revoked its order on the transfer of land to the SASB, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has expectedly retaliated with the threat of an all-India bandh. When the country is facing mounting inflation, the call for bandhs which is akin to holding the economy at ransom, is highly objectionable. What kind of strength do these communal leaders expect to display by making the common people suffer?          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

                
	Sir  The ugly threat of communalism seems to be very much on the agenda of the BJP, which is, by now, anticipating early general elections. Without giving any importance to recent developments like the nuclear deal, price rise, the threat of Left withdrawal from the Centre, the BJP has taken a proactive role in the Amarnath land issue. The party has wasted no time in seizing this opportunity to exploit Hindu sentiments in order to return to power by hook or by crook. One hopes that the people of India will not surrender to a party that compromises with the spirit of secularism, while giving secondary importance to good governance.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
W. Hossain, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is a shame that the government of Jammu and Kashmir has capitulated before the Muslim vote bank and withdrawn the land given temporarily to the SASB. One wishes that the government had displayed such adroitness and stopped Haj subsidies. In a secular country, the government has no business meddling with religion  but the Indian definition of secularism is to berate anything Hindu. This can only happen in Hindu-majority India, where the government can trample upon Hindu sensibilities without fearing a backlash. Environmentalists have raised the issue of environmental damage as well  in the same breath they should protest against the concept of Haj because it leaves a massive carbon footprint across the world. Such biased reactions are only expected from the establishment and media in India, raised as they have been on a leftist staple of countering anything Hindu.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kaushik Ghosh, Mumbai

                
	Sir  It was reported last month that a Congress member of parliament, K. Rahman Khan, has suggested that the Haj subsidy  under which the State sanctions crores of rupees  be converted into a Haj Management Fund, a project which has been lying neglected for a while now (Tired of terror, Muslims focus on basics, June 12). The government might consider this idea well worth a try. But for non-Muslims, a more fundamental question remains to be answered. Would the State ever consider giving such astronomical sums of money to the people of the Hindu, Christian, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh or other religious communities, for them to be able to go on pilgrimages to their chosen destinations? The answer, in all likelihood, is a firm No. After all, only a few hectares of land set aside for exhausted Amarnath pilgrims to rejuvenate themselves had the minority community up in arms, and the quaking State followed up by an abject retraction.          
	Yours faithfully,

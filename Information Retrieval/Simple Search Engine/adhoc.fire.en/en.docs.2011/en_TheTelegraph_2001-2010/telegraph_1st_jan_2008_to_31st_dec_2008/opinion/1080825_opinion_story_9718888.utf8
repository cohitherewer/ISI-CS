	Struck and shut                  
	Sir  No other state of India has such a notorious tradition of bandhs as West Bengal (Not quite there, Aug 22). If it is not the belligerent Opposition, the ruling party or its allies find one excuse or the other to offer a free holiday to the people. And of course, there is never a dearth of issues against which the ruling or opposition parties can call a bandh. But the parties have no right whatsoever to hold to ransom the very people on whose behalf they claim to call strikes and bandhs. The Citu-sponsored bandh on August 20 was a protest against the Indo-US nuclear deal and the rising rate of inflation. Unfortunately, both issues have become as stale as last weeks bread, and neither the nuclear deal nor inflation can be rolled back because of the bandh. Even the IT sector was not spared this time. Is it any wonder that Bengal is lagging behind other states in industrial development? The chief minister of Bengal either follows a double standard by allowing Citu to stop all industrial activities for a day, while preaching about the need for industries in Bengal; or else, he is simply incompetent in curbing the hooliganism of the Citu cadre in his state. Party-politics here comes ahead of peoples interests.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  After reading the remarks made by the Citu state president, Shyamal Chakraborty, on the spontaneous support of IT workers for their bandh, I wonder if he really cares about what people want. His comment has made him a bigger target of the IT workers ridicule than he already was. IT workers do not treat bandhs as state-sponsored holidays. And every time there is a bandh, they have to make up for the days loss by working on weekends. Moreover, our companies had to tell our foreign clients the disgraceful reason that led to the suspension of work that day. I had to let my clients know that our Bengal operations would be hampered, though the Chennai offices continued to operate as usual. Do Citu leaders have any idea how ashamed I felt while saying this? The Left perhaps has not learnt its lessons from the last panchayat and municipal elections. If it isolates itself from the people any further, it will have lost Bengal.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  No political party or union has the right to prohibit an individual from going to work or wherever he needs to go. On August 20, not only were thousands stranded at railway stations and airports, but several patients too failed to reach hospitals owing to the withdrawal of all transport from the streets. Businessmen and MNC employees may not feel the pinch, but does Citu, the self-appointed guardians of the working classes, care how many daily wage-earners had to go without a meal on the bandh day?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  In the nationwide bandh on August 20, attendance at work was perhaps the lowest in West Bengal, as always. This time, the IT industry too was forced to a halt by Citu, an ally of Bengals ruling party, which has vowed to bring an industrial boom to the state. However, the industrialists, both in India and abroad, must have been wondering if the state government really has a coherent policy on industrialization at all. While in Singur, the CPI(M) is rooting for the Tatas small-car project, the party is uncomfortably silent on the Citus hostility to the existing industries of Bengal, not to mention the daily labourers.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyan Kr Ghose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Lefts irresponsible behaviour has reached new heights (Into the gloom, Aug 21). To shut down all official activities to protest against inflation was self-contradictory and foolish. The Left-backed trade unions absurd decision to strike work, for causes that are already too old, betrays its inability to offer a practical solution to the problems. Bandhs have been reduced through overuse to devices for asserting the existence of a party when its political significance begins to wane. The ignominious defeat in the trust vote and the subsequent progress of the nuclear deal probably pushed the Left to exploit the power of bandhs to regain visibility. Sadly, the issues protested against through strikes are hardly ever resolved, and the tool itself becomes a nuisance for the people.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anirban Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The bandh called by Citu on August 20 further debilitated the sagging work culture at government banks, particularly since the State Bank of India had called a strike just two days earlier. Those who bore the brunt of the twin closures were ordinary people, businessmen and senior citizens who depend on banks for regular withdrawals of money. It is time the government dealt strongly with strikes called by employees of the Central government and the public sector. Already richer by the recommendation of the sixth pay commission in a country where educated unemployment is high, these employees should have some consideration for the vulnerable state of the economy hit by inflation.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	A correction          
	AIDS Sutra: Untold Stories from India, the book from which Amartya Sens In it together (Aug 17) was extracted, is edited by Negar Akhavi and not by Prashant Panjiar, as mentioned in the article. The error is regretted.

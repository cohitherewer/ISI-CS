                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LOOK BACK IN PASSION                              Mohua Mitra      Music                                                
	The 20th century witnessed a wave of cross-cultural activities in India and Bengal. Indigenous and foreign approaches confronted each other in every sphere of life, often producing a harmonious whole  particularly in the sphere of popular entertainment. The theatre and cinema of pre- and post-independent India were born out of this marriage of two cultures. Academy Theatres latest production, Theatre O Cinemar Gaan: Ekal Sekal, is a retrospective journey, documenting how Bengali theatre came to adopt cinematic vision and language, leading to pioneering work for cinema in Bengal.         
	Madhusudan Mancha was a suitable venue for the production on June 14, Michael Madhusudan Dutt being one of the pioneers among Bengali playwrights. Devajit Bandyopadhyay has drawn from his research in recordings, notations, prompt books and clippings, threading them into an interesting string, tracing traditional moorings as well as the new waves from the West. The well-sequenced presentation, ably supported by Soumitra Chattopadhyays emotive reading of theatrical scenes, centred on Devajit and Riddhi Bandyopadhyays songs.        
	The name of Hiralal Sen keeps popping up in this search for the roots of Indian cinema. Khirodeprasad Bidyabinodes play, Alibaba, was transformed into a silent film by Sen (popular stage artist Kusumkumari played Marjina in this), to be followed later by Madhu Boses 1937 talkie, Alibaba. Devajit performed Aay bandi tui begum hobi khwab dekhechhi from the film. He also did a remarkably good job of rendering the Krishna Chandra De classic, Phirey chol aapon gharey, from Debaki Boses 1932 film, Chandidas. But did he have to sing the lilting Prajapati prajapati, made famous by Kanan Devi in Shesh Uttar?         
	Riddhi Bandyopadhyays excellent presentation of Toofan mail jaaye (once again a Kanan Devi hit) was followed by a rather mediocre duet (Je raatey more duarguli from Ritwik Ghataks Meghe Dhaka Taara).        
	Most of the songs that followed were well-chosen: O amaar moner manush go from Kabi  adapted from Tarashankar Bandyopadhyays novel set against the backdrop of the arid landscape of Birbhum; Ei sundar swarnali sandhyaye (originally sung by Gita Dutt in the film, Hospital); Hemanta Mukhopadhyays Ei meghla diney from Shesh Parjantya; Bhalobashar tumi ki jaano from Satyajit Rays Chiriakhana. Unfortunately, the music largely failed to evoke the drama of the bygone age. The passion was missing, and in some instances, the original notation, too, took a beating. The marked deviation from the original of Bhalobashar tumi is a case in point. The team would do well to retain its love for and understanding of the music of Bengali stage and screen, and not get overtly influenced by the demands of modern entertainment during its performances. Devajits Bhajan pujan janine ma, jetetey phiringee aami from Anthony Phiringee gave a glimpse of this sincerity. So one went home, hopeful.

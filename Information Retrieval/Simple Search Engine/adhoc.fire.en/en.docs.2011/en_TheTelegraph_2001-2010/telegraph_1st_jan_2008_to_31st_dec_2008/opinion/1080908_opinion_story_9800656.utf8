	Y V. Reddy has departed from the governorship of the Reserve Bank of India. His many admirers would laud him for his steadfastness of purpose. He took the five per cent inflation target seriously. Since inflation was over the target for most of his tenure, he went on increasing interest rates. This bias was not shared by the finance minister, but Mr Reddy stayed on course. He was also resolute in his pursuit of stability; he insulated the economy from all international currents that might bring in volatility. He killed off the P-note market; he kept external commercial borrowings under strict controls. Negative moves always generate criticism. But undaunted, Mr Reddy stuck to his guns, caring little for voices of dissent.         
	This single-minded obduracy may have saved India from risks undefined. But it also prevented a debate on monetary and financial policies. They have been stuck in the mould of the 1980s. The voluminous manuals of rules and notifications that were the RBIs weapons of control then remain largely intact. Mr Reddy travelled and spoke much abroad. He accepted and advocated monetary orthodoxy  that Central banks had only one foe, inflation, and only one weapon to combat it, interest rates. That made him a darling of the international monetary priesthood, and made him unassailable at home. Two reports that the government commissioned  the Percy Mistry committee and the Raghuram Rajan committee  were critical of the RBIs policies. But Mr Reddy contemptuously ignored them; neither the prime minister nor the finance minister had the courage to ask him to address the issues raised seriously.        
	This may change, now that Mr Reddy is gone and has been followed by D. Subbarao who has just stepped down as finance secretary. Having served in the North Block, he can hardly have escaped the excitement and the intellectual freshness of the two dissident reports. Although they have been extremely circumspect, the prime minister and the finance minister must have some sympathy for the reports they commissioned, the chairmen they chose and the views they sought. So Mr Subbarao carries with him a brief for reform. He may not wish to act on it; after all, the life his predecessor lived is an attractive one  travelling often to international resorts, consorting with similarly grey-suited grey men of finance, giving long and boring speeches, enjoying good food and drink. Mr Subbarao may think he deserves it after his years of labour. Or he may wish to change things, but may be daunted by internal resistance. The RBI staff are determined and competent; taking them on takes courage. But he should also ponder the fact that for the first time in his life, he is his own boss. He has got one chance. He could use it to make the financial system serve growth, to give Indians everywhere efficient banking, and to take babudom out of businessmens hair. It is worth trying.

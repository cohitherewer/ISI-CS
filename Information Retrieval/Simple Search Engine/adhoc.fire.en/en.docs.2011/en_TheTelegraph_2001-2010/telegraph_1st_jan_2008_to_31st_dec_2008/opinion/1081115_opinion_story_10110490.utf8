	The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal is upset. Suhrid Dutta, the former secretary of the Singur zonal committee, and Debu Malik, a party worker, have been convicted in the Tapasi Malik murder case, and the fast-track court in Chandernagore has actually sentenced them to life imprisonment. Now, when the CPI(M) is upset, it drops even the pretence of respecting the democratic process from which it draws its power. Rather, it would seem from the strident reaction of party personalities valued for their abusive speech, and their choric hangers-on, that the justice system, in which the Central Bureau of Investigation plays a major role, has done the unthinkable by officially labelling two partymen murderers. An organization may always offer its support to loyal workers in trouble. And to disagree with a judgment and go for appeal is perfectly acceptable. What is passing strange is the assumption that a partyman can do no wrong. The CPI(M)s virtuous outrage at the judgment is an index of the distance it has travelled from a sense of peoples perceptions.        
	It was easier when Tapan Ghosh and Sukur Ali were arrested during the Nandigram upheaval. The two CPI(M) leaders, accused of murder, conspiracy and destruction of evidence in the Chhoto Angaria case, were supposed to have been absconding when they were actually functioning as party office-bearers. They were hailed as martyrs by party leaders after their arrest. What was possible in the blood-soaked tumult of the Nandigram days may not work with the horrific details of Tapasis murder still unforgotten. Hence the martyrs aura has not yet touched Dutta and Malik, although Duttas achievements in Singur are being trumpeted abroad. Not that the CPI(M) has much option. The Opposition has seized gleefully on the conviction, and the CPI(M) has not left itself either the space or the sense of security and invincibility to handle the embarrassment with coolness.        
	It has taken recourse to its favourite bogey  universal conspiracy. The conspiracy is not against Dutta or Malik, but against the party. It would be almost as brainless as the accusers to look for logic here. What emerges is that the CBI  called in by the chief minister at the insistence of the Opposition after the Criminal Investigation Department had accused Tapasis father of her murder  is supposed to have conspired with the Opposition, all the forces against industrialization in West Bengal, and  in the wildest moments  with the Centre. The leaders screaming conspiracy have so far stopped short of calling the court a party to it; they have made do with dark hints. The effect, unfortunately, is comic rather than threatening, and distracts from the fact that such accusations are defamatory. It might still help if the CPI(M) turned its attention from the metaphysical realm of conspiracy to the more mundane level of damage control.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WITH A WHIMPER                                                    
	Hope in India is always short-lived. When L.K. Advani had declared a few days ago that the world should know that when India faces a war-like situation, India is united, there was the glimmer of hope that Indian politicians would stop gaining political mileage out of a national crisis. This was something new since on all previous occasions, politicians, irrespective of their colour and creed, had tried to use the situation to score points over their rivals and to secure votes. Thus, a national crisis had all too often become another instrument of garnering votes. This had inevitably put all politicians and political parties in a lurid light. The anger against the political class among educated people articulated itself in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on Mumbai. Under the circumstances, Mr Advanis clarion call for unity during a crisis had come as a gust of fresh air. But like a gust, it passed all too soon. In the Lok Sabha, speaking on the two new security bills presented by the government, Mr Advani was back to his old tune. Despite his partys support to the bill, he could not resist the temptation of taking a few pot shots at the government, at its procrastination on matters relating to security, and thus implying that the Bharatiya Janata Party, when it had been in power, had been better at the job.        
	This kind of rhetoric and playing to ones own constituency, as Mr Advani well knows, serves no national purpose, and is therefore uncalled for in the circumstances facing India and its people. The game of one-upmanship can be played by many. But it is a futile sport with no winners and India as the loser. If Mr Advani can provide a list of the blunders and inefficiencies of the United Progressive Alliance government, someone from the Treasury benches could also bring out the dirty linen from the time when Mr Advani was Union home minister. Will that kind of exchange take the nation or the discussion forward? There is no point, however, in blaming Mr Advani alone for failing to rise above party interests to embrace a wider cause. A.R. Antulay, the minorities affairs minister, embarrassed his own party, the Congress, by raising questions about Hindu-Muslim terrorism within India and about the circumstances that led to the killing of Hemant Karkare. Mr Antulay probably does not realize the dangerous implications of his statement. He too is attempting to make political capital out of a crisis that affects Indias relationship with Pakistan.        
	The politicization of national crises and a refusal to think beyond electoral advantages are two of the main issues that have aroused anger against politicians. But will the latter ever learn? It will be too optimistic to think that men like Messrs Advani and Antulay will change. Maybe a younger generation will. Hope, however, is short-lived.

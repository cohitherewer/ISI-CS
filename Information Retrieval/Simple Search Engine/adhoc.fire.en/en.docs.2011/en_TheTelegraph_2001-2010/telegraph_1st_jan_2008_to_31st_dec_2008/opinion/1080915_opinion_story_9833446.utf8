	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seems to be getting the cold shoulder from all corners. As if a belligerent Mamata Banerjee and an unhappy Ratan Tata were not enough, now the Bengal chief minister has been doled out yet another setback  that too from a fellow leftist. Shortly after Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), won the general elections in May this year, Mr Bhattacharjee became the first Indian leader to invite him to a state visit. Although Mr Dahal, better known as Prachanda by his nom de guerre, accepted the invitation then, nothing came of it. Mr Dahal has, since then, relinquished the crown of a Maoist hero to become the prime minister of a new republic. Now, for the first time since assuming this exalted role, he is in India for a state visit, but his itinerary has bypassed Bengal. (It is impossible to know if his first diplomatic tour as prime minister to the land of his hero, General Mao, was pre-meditated or merely timed to attend the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.) With the dream of a resurgent Nepal in his eyes, perhaps Mr Dahal finds it more meaningful to drop by at the countrys premier IT hub, Bangalore, giving shabby Bengal the slip.         
	The dynamics of Mr Dahals visit, however, relate more intensely to national interest. The fury of the Kosi is unabated, as the flooding in Bihar remains precarious. The Centre has to impress on Nepal the gravity of the situation. No doubt the Kosi river treaty needs to be reviewed, but Nepal cannot expect India to maintain the embankments on its own. The Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950, to which the Maoists had initially taken a dislike, would also be debated. Although the Maoists came round after realizing the obvious benefits of this treaty, it is time now to revisit the deal. For nearly six decades, residents of India and Nepal are enjoying freedom of movement between the borders, reciprocal rights of residence and work permit. Bilateral trade between the two countries amounts to $1.4 billion. But Indias Maoist corridor is also believed to lead right into Nepal. Maoists may be the biggest threat to internal security, but the Centre prefers to be in denial. It is crucial for these issues to be thrashed out. Only then can Mr Dahals noble sentiments about India begin to make sense.

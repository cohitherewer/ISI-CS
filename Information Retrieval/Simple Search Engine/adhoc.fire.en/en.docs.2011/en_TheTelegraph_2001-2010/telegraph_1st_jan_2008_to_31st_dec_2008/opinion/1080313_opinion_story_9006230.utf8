	Something strange happens to the roads in eastern Colombia. As you near the Venezuelan border, you suddenly come across long, dead-straight stretches that are about eight lanes wide. They are, of course, emergency airstrips for the Colombian air force to use in the event of a war with Venezuela, and they date back to a period long before the current crisis between the two countries. But they are still there, and the topic is on the table again.        
	Its hard to know how seriously to take the threats of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, regarding war with Colombia, because he often talks like that. Speaking on his weekly television show, Chavez denounced last weekends Colombian military incursion into Ecuador. This could be the start of a war in South America, he warned, addressing Colombian president Alvaro Uribe. If it occurs to you to do this in Venezuela, President Uribe, Ill send some Sukhois (Russian warplanes recently bought by Venezuela).        
	Then, intoxicated by his own rhetoric, Chavez upped the ante: Mr Defense Minister, move 10 battalions to the border with Colombia for me, immediately  tank battalions. Deploy the air force. We dont want war, but we arent going to permit the Empire (his term for the United States of America)...to divide and weaken us. All very exciting stuff, but can he be serious? There hasnt been a war between South American countries in over eighty years.        
	The trigger for this crisis was a Colombian raid early Saturday that killed Raul Reyes, the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and sixteen of his companions. It was an important success in Alvaro Uribes long war against the Marxist guerrilla army, but there was one little problem: it all happened on the far side of Colombias border with Ecuador.                
	Those airstrips        
	Ecuadors president, Rafael Correa, like Venezuelas Chavez, is one of the new left leaders of South America, whereas Alvaro Uribe is a conservative leader with close US ties. Both Correa, whose country borders Colombia on the south, and Chavez, whose country borders it on the east, essentially see the FARC as a legitimate contender for power in Colombia. Chavez even eulogized Raul Reyes as a good revolutionary and condemned his cowardly murder by the Colombian army.         
	Uribe has gradually been winning his war against the guerrilla organization: numbers of commanders have been killed or captured, and there is now a steady flow of defectors. Nothing could be better for Colombia than an end to this crippling five-decade insurgency. But both Chavez and Correa see the FARC as a friendly force.        
	So the Colombian government suspects both its neighbours of aiding and abetting the FARC, and it may well be right. Venezuela and Ecuador fear that the recent Colombian incursion into the latters territory to kill FARC fighters may be only the first of many, and they also worry that the US is encouraging such attacks as a way to destabilize these two leftist governments. They, too, may be right.        
	Given these concerns and calculations, the apparent over-reaction of Chavez and Correa may be quite rational. But theyd never actually go to war, would they? It still seems very unlikely, in particular because the far more experienced Colombian army would dismantle any force the Ecuadorians sent against it in a matter of days. Venezuela and Colombia are more evenly matched, and for that very reason it would not be in either governments interest to have a war: neither side would win.        
	So thats settled, then. Except that I keep remembering those emergency airstrips on the roads. Even long before Uribe and Chavez came to power, somebody must have thought that a war between Colombia and Venezuela to be likely enough to have spent all that money preparing for it.

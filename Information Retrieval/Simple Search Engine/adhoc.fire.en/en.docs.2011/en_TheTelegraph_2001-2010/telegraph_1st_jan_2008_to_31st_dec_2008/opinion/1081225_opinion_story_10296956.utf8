	Slight flutter followed by business as usual: this has been the pattern during attempts at getting Calcuttas old and polluting autorickshaws off the roads. But this time, the Calcutta High Court has refused to budge: the December 31 deadline for two-stroke autos will not be extended, and it is now the state governments responsibility to implement the courts decision. There are two aspects to this situation: the confiscation of old vehicles and the conversion to liquefied petroleum gas. The stakes are high in preventing both from happening immediately. Besides, there are two more deadlines through the coming year that also have to be met. The only way this can be done is for the government to have a clearly phased plan. But why does this sound like an outrageous proposition in Calcutta? Evidently, not being able to evolve a plan in little less than a decades time is not simply a question of inefficiency. The political and economic stakes are high and intertwined  the peoples government must ensure that the peoples vehicles remain on the road, and that they run on the peoples fuel. The money paid by the autos to the unions (mostly aligned Left) adds up to around Rs 15 crore, and the adulterated and illegal fuel business is worth around Rs 150-160 crore. The latest problem is that the transport minister has suddenly decided to change his tune and start sounding stridently righteous. But all this without a plan.        
	Why is Calcutta finding it impossible to achieve what Delhi and Bangalore have managed quite a while ago, though not without some turbulence? The answer is twofold. Lack of political will, and indeed political corruption, are certainly the perennials. And, as far as the court order is concerned, this is the main hindrance. But there is a larger picture that must take in the over-all civic culture of West Bengal. Ordinary Calcuttans seem generally perfectly contented, apart from the routine disaffection, to breathe deadly air and be dangerously hurtled along in illegal, and illegally fuelled, vehicles. There is no active and organized sense among them of getting together and fighting for their entitlement to clean air and a sound transport system. Both the State and its various offshoots (like auto unions) take advantage of these pathologically high tolerance levels.

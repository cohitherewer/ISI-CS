	Who are para-teachers? Those in India who answer to that name do not themselves have any idea about what their designation is supposed to signify, and their employers are equally in the dark. Yet there are probably around half a million para-teachers operating all over India at present. The West Bengal government has been keen, in recent years, to appoint para-teachers who work on contractual basis and are given about a third of the salary that the permanent teachers receive. And this, when nearly 45,000 posts for permanent teachers are lying vacant in the state.         
	Para- or contractual teachers are a recent phenomenon in India. Their history goes back to the Eighties when a primary school in a village in Rajasthan started appointing the local jobless youth on contracts under a programme funded by the Swedish International Development Authority. It is easy to come across para teachers in developed countries like Britain or the United States of America. But, of course, the context and the mode of their operation differ widely between the developed and the developing nations. In India, more than assisting full-time teachers in their job, para-teachers serve rather to assist the state governments in reducing public expenditure. Since more than three para-teachers can be employed at the cost of one full-time teacher, state governments are understandably more interested in contractual, than in permanent, appointments.        
	From their point of view, the system of hiring teachers on contracts is convenient in every way. It saves them money and the hassle of providing teachers with all the attendant benefits of government service. Because these teachers jobs hang on a contract that can be dissolved at the employers whim, they can be pressurized into working really hard. On the other hand, the presence of the para-teachers can be utilized as an opportunity by the authorities to let the full-time teachers know that they are not indispensable. The system is beneficial to the local politician as well since he can have the votes he is after by appearing as the messiah who confers prestigious posts in local schools on unemployed men and women.               
	The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan started in collaboration between the Central and state governments all over India in 2001 with the objective of providing free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years. In order to increase the teacher-student ratio (the desirable percentage being 1:40), the SSA started appointing a large number of graduates. But they were all employed on a contractual basis on the condition that their posts would be dissolved with the termination of the SSA. In West Bengal, the upper primary para-teachers under the SSA started with an honorarium of Rs 2,000 a month which was increased to a princely Rs 3,000 in 2007. Group D officials working for the SSA (mostly office clerks), for whom it is sufficient to pass class VIII to be eligible for the posts, get about Rs 5,300 per month. It usually takes three to four months, sometime more, for their salary to reach the para-teachers. Arun Basak (name changed), a para-teacher working for a school in Madhyamgram, got his appointment in March 2006. He received his first salary in October that year. If the state government is introducing midday meals in schools on the assumption that children cannot be taught on an empty stomach, can teachers teach when they are starving? asks Basak.         
	Because the school for which he works suffers from a dearth of full-time teachers, Basak has to take classes from V to X, although his contract requires him to teach from class V to VIII. When permanent teachers are on leave, he has to check answer-scripts on their behalf, besides working on his own share. But there is more to his work. For one, he renders all the services that, strictly speaking, should fall within the purview of a school clerk, such as tabulation or the preparation of report cards. And then there are additional obligations. Participation in work related to elections or census reports is compulsory for all male para-teachers. And in accordance with the aim of the SSA to bring back drop-outs within the schools fold, para-teachers are also entrusted with the responsibility of luring back the runaway children.         
	This work is compulsory but most para-teachers find it daunting because the childrens families usually look upon their entreaties as an undue intrusion into their privacy. And for all the wariness they earn, there is not enough compensation. On the contrary, there are demeaning strictures separating them from full-time teachers. For instance, they cannot invigilate in or mark scripts for board examinations. They get only 12 days of leave a year and if a headmaster so wishes, amounts can be deducted from their monthly emoluments on any extra leave. To rub in the point of their difference from the permanent teachers, some schools require the para-teachers to sit in discrete enclosures, away from the privileged lot.         
	Ever since the para-teachers started being engaged, the state government and SSA authorities have usually been all praise for them. Their commitment and dedication are held up as exemplary, especially for the edification of the permanent teachers, who get paid more but allegedly work less. But most of the para-teachers do not seem to be fired by ideals of selfless service. If they work more, it is because they have the one-year contract, whose renewal depends on the assessment of their performance by school and panchayat committees, dangling like Damocles sword above their heads. Much of their labour proves to be fruitless anyway because the inadequate infrastructure works against them. For instance, even if some of the drop-outs are made to return, they often cannot be accommodated in classrooms already bursting at the seams. Thus, in spite of a sense of futility, para-teachers slog on, and keep hoping that they will be regularized within the system one day.         
	The situation is no better for the contractual teachers appointed by the state government to teach only in the higher secondary classes. Perpetual shortage of full-time teachers means that they are required to teach in lower classes as well  and all for Rs 3,000 a month. While for para-teachers there is the slim chance that they might bag a permanent post by clearing the School Service Commission Examination even if the SSA contract leaves them in the lurch, there is no such hope for the HS teachers. Teachers for subjects exclusive to the HS level are not recruited through the SSC. In the absence of any immediate promise that they will be absorbed as permanent teachers, HS contractual teachers continue to be at the mercy of school authorities that exploit them under the threat of termination of contract.              
	The expectations of these teachers had been raised recently when they received a circular from the state school education department saying that there will be no further appointment of part-time HS teachers after April 2007, but that the existing teachers may continue as before. The teachers took this as an indication of the education departments direct intervention in their case that will result in curbing the power of school authorities to decide their fate. But the concerned department seems to have gone off to sleep after making this declaration and no amount of knocking on the door seems to be working.        
	In one of the several ironies in the Indian educational system, para-teachers are known by such endearing names as shiksha bandhu, shiksha karmi, lok-shikshak or guruji across the country. Conferring such honours upon them is perhaps a subtle way of diverting attention from the indignity of their position. But para-teachers like Arun Basak are least beguiled by such pathetic attempts to keep them from complaining. When they have to fight a regular battle to keep home-fires burning, they are not going to be taken in by mere names. Basak declares angrily that although what he gets at the end of several months is called an honorarium in glossy SSA brochures, he prefers to call it a wage, of the kind paid to unskilled labourers. If this is the gurudakshina these gurujis deserve, do we have the right to utter the words teacher and esteem in the same breath again?

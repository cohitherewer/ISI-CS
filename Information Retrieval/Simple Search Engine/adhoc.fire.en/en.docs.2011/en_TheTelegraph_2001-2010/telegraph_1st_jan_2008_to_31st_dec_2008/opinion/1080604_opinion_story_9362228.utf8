	Father figure																														  
	The family court passed an order granting custody of the child to the mother, giving the father visitation rights on alternate weekends, permission to meet at school and 50 per cent of vacation time. But proceedings continued as a dispute arose about the interpretation of the order. The Bombay High Court kept the order in abeyance till it received a report from a psychiatrist. The father, who could not meet his child at all as long as the order was in abeyance, approached the Supreme Court. The apex court modified the order, holding that the father should be given access at least to some extent. It also directed the high court to dispose the case as expeditiously as possible (Mohan Kumar Rayana vs Komal Mohan Rayana).  
	Toothless law        
	The court can take cognizance of an offence under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, only if it receives a complaint from the authority set up to implement the Act. On the basis of media reports of the recovery of hundreds of skeletons of children from different parts of Orissa, a social activist filed a petition in the high court pointing out that no steps could be taken until the state government set up the appropriate body. The court found out from the records that a committee had been formed in 2007 but no gazette notification was issued to ascertain whether it complied with the Act. So, it directed the government to take all measures to form the body that would implement the Act (Hemanta Rath vs Union of India).                            
	Sick logic        
	A company, against which proceedings were initiated for dishonour of cheques, contended that the case should be quashed under Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act as a scheme for revival of the sick company was being implemented under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The Bombay High Court held that proceedings could not be quashed but the accused, if convicted, could pray for bail or a stay order on the basis of the BIFR scheme. It was for the court to decide on the prayer and pass appropriate orders (M/s Aefloat Textiles (India) Ltd vs Boghara Polyfab PRT Ltd).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THE POWER OF THE INTERNET                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	In a country where nubile girls in the briefest of shorts invite barely a glance, a 11-year-old became the object of a drunk Communist Party officials lust. Within a week of the incident, the 58-year-old official was sacked. In the next two days, he was exonerated by the police.        
	The case of party secretary, Lin Jiaxiang, of Shenzhens Maritime Bureau is the talk of the town. Everyone is surprised that the incident was not only reported in the official media, but also that the senior functionary was sacked swiftly, despite being so close to retirement. This case truly reflects the power of the internet in China. Had almost the entire incident not been uploaded on to the net, the official may have ended his career with full honours.        
	On October 29, an 11-year-old got up to go to the toilet at an upmarket sea-food restaurant in Shenzhen. A paunchy diner asked her where it was and told her to show him the way. When they reached the toilet, which is normally in an alcove off the dining area, the man caught hold of her neck and tried to force her into the gents  thats what the girl, who managed to free herself, told her parents. As the parents were inquiring about him from his female companion, the man came out and began yelling at them: I did it, so what? How much money do you want, give me a price. I will pay it!                 
	About turn        
	Even as they argued, the man pushed the girls father and said, Do you know who I am? I was sent here by the Beijing Ministry of Transportation, my level is the same as your mayor. So what if I pinched a little childs neck? Who the f are you people to me?! You dare f with me? Just watch how I am going to deal with you. The father by then had called the police, and the restaurant staff prevented the man and his companion from leaving.         
	At the police station, the bully became a lamb. Please, Im begging you. Ill pay for that, he told the girls father. How about 15,000 yuan? Seeing the latter unmoved, he asked him to set the amount, offered to pay for the girls upbringing, even suggested that all of them have dinner together. He begged the father to think about the effect of this scandal on his career: Im not a hideous person. Im almost 60 and will soon be retired.At the same time, he dropped enough hints about his connections that had resulted in him being posted at Shenzhen.                
	Leave them alone        
	The entire episode was caught on the restaurants CCTV  except the crucial part  what happened outside the toilet. Lins conversation at the police station was taped by the fathers friend. Both clips ended up on the internet. The police investigation concluded that Lin was drunk, but there was no proof of indecent conduct. Lin did have bodily contact with the girl but the contact was limited to the joint of her shoulders and the neck, said the police at a press briefing. Lin had held her by the nape and kept asking her where the restroom was. The fact that the slip of a girl could easily free herself from the fat Lin meant he wasnt using much force. Lin told the police that he rested his hands on her shoulders to express his gratitude.         
	Meanwhile, the girl is hysterical, refusing to attend school without her mother, and has vowed never to dine out again. This verse appeared on the net after the episode, with a picture of Lin holding up a Civilized Work Unit award he received early this year.        
	You use public funds to eat and drink, we endure it/ You show off your public cars, we endure it/ You have third and fourth wives, we endure it/ You have many villas-houses, we endure it/ Now you will not even leave our own children alone

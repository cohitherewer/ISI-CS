The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | India remains incredible
                                                                                                                 INDIA REMAINS INCREDIBLE                          - The Congress has decided to party at the taxpayers expense					 					      Swapan Dasgupta                                            
	Last Monday was a terrible day for the global capital markets. The Dow Jones index slipped below the 12,000 mark, the FTSE 100 plunged by almost two per cent to a two-year low, and the sensitive index took a 951 point pounding and fell below the 15,000 mark. The immediate provocation for the slump was the distress sale of the American investment bank, Bear Stearns, over the weekend  it was sold for less than one per cent of what it was worth just a year ago  but the larger fear was of a global recession, with the United States of America as the epicentre.         
	The implications of what happened at Bear Stearns and, two months ago, in the British mortgage company, Northern Rock (which prompted the first nationalization in Britain in more than three decades), are still being dissected. As an offering to that exercise, Bill Emmott, a former editor of The Economist, suggested that The biggest and most important casualtyis going to be the culture of easy lending to companies and to households that has lain behind Americas economic growth in the past six or seven years. As a result, even if the Fed cuts US short-term interest rates again, credit conditions in America will still tighten. This is already happening in Britain where, despite interest rate cuts, banks are scrapping two- and three-year fixed rate mortgages and re-negotiating their loans to home-owners at a much higher rate because of the inherent risks involved. On the Richter scale of financial crises, wrote a financial commentator, the present implosion now registers as a full force nine  10 being of the never-before-recorded variety.              
	A feature of this global downturn is the proactive role of all governments. The hitherto cautious Federal Reserve has cut interest rates dramatically over the past quarter and the Bank of England injected a whopping 5 billion into the strained money markets. In a dramatic move last Sunday, the Fed invoked Article 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act, last used during the depression of the 1930s, which allows it to shower money on almost anybody it wishes by a vote of five governors in unusual and exigent circumstances.         
	The contrast between the sense of urgency being displayed by authorities in the worlds financial centres and the cynicism of those at the helm in India is striking. For the past three months at least, there have been early warnings of the gross domestic product growth slipping below the targeted nine per cent. There have also been fears (subsequently confirmed) of the inflation rate rising above the Reserve Bank of Indias five per cent danger mark  a reason why the much-awaited cut in interest rates was shelved. In addition, there were strong indications that recessionary conditions in the US, the appreciation of the rupee and high domestic interest rates could see a slowdown in the annual growth of Indian exports from an estimated 8.7 per cent in 2008 to 7.8 per cent in 2009. In short, the writing on the wall pointed to the compelling need to tighten belts, eschew profligacy and focus singlemindedly on maintaining Indias competitive strengths in a difficult environment.         
	Of course, it was never going to be easy. In an election year  although, strictly speaking, the Lok Sabha election is likely to be in early 2009  every government is under pressure from the political class to shower the electorate with sops and freebies. The underlying belief, which has never been empirically verified, is that a show of generosity will automatically translate into votes. In recent times, only the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, has had the gumption to defy political wisdom and refuse a blanket amnesty to many thousands of farmers who were charged with power theft. Most incumbent governments have followed the line of least resistance and made extravagant populist gestures that have cost the exchequer dearly and yet not guaranteed re-election.         
	The United Progressive Alliance government fell effortlessly into a self-made populist trap in this years budget. With singleminded dedication to bolstering Sonia Gandhis image as Indias Lady Bountiful, the finance minister earned a bagful of political brownie points with his awesome debt-waiver programme that is expected to cost anywhere close to Rs 75,000 crore, spread out over three years. It was bad enough that this gesture of utter irresponsibility was announced at a time when the global economy is so delicately perched. What is even more astonishing is that there has been a subsequent clamour, led by heir-apparent Rahul Gandhi and the agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, and endorsed by the Congress president, to enlarge the scope of debt relief to such a point where it becomes a matter of discretion.         
	The national burden of the UPAs vote purchase scheme is quite steep. If the faltering national rural employment guarantee programme is added to the loan-waiver scheme, India will have to expend nearly two per cent of its GDP to prevent the Congress and its allies from going under politically. The all-important distinction between private money and public funds appears to have been obliterated by this budget. This is more so when, by the finance ministers own admission, leakages in the public distribution system are in the region of 36.38 per cent, that is, more than a third of public money never reaches the targeted beneficiary.         
	It is often claimed that high growth doesnt win an election in India but high inflation helps lose it. The euphoria over loan write-offs and higher exemption limits for income taxpayers is certain to be either drowned in a backlash of unfulfilled expectations (there are reports from Orissa that some villagers have been told that loans taken for marriage expenses have also been waived by a benevolent Sonia) or simply forgotten by the time the finance bill is passed. However, what will endure is the soaring rate of inflation caused by foodstuff shortages and higher prices of items such as naptha.               
	The pressure on prices is likely to be maintained by the dramatic rise in money supply (M3) which grew by roughly 22 per cent between 2007 and 2008. At the time the National Democratic Alliance demitted office in May 2004, the broad money supply growth was around 12 per cent.         
	Add to this the fudgy math of the government. Official estimates say that the Central fiscal deficit will decline from 3.1 to 2.5 per cent of the GDP. But, as many economists have pointed out, this figure doesnt include off-budget subsidies on food, fertilizer and petroleum products, the deficit of states, and the fiscal costs of the debt-waiver. According to a Goldman Sachs study, the consolidated fiscal deficit will grow from 6.6 per cent of GDP in 2008 to 6.9 per cent in 2009.         
	The finance minister, P. Chidambaram, may consider himself a trifle unlucky that the global downturn happened just as the election season began in India. A government desirous of maintaining elementary standards of rectitude would have attempted to balance its political imperatives with a sense of national responsibility. More important, it would have tried to repair India s leaky roof during the glorious sunshine of the past four years by facilitating dramatic improvements in infrastructure. Neither was attempted, not least because of the Lefts ideological cussedness.         
	For the past four years, Indias success story has been entrepreneur-driven. The government hasnt been able to help much but it has, at least, not come in the way. Now, when a modicum of state intervention is imperative, the Congress has decided it is time to party at the taxpayers expense. No wonder they call it Incredible India.

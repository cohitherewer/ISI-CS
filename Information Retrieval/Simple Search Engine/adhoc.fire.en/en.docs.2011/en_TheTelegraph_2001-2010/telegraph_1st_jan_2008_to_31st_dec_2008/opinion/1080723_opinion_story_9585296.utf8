                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SING IT LOUD                                                    
	Virtue does not come by mere words: thus sings the Guru Granth Sahib. Manmohan Singh has demonstrated that he lives by this simple, but difficult, injunction of the Sikh holy book. He had stated, one year ago, his commitment to the Indo-US nuclear deal and then he acted in accordance with his commitment and staked the future of the government he leads. Mr Singh brought his words and his deeds together in upholding something that he considered to be right and good. He acted like a prime minister and like an honourable human being. The reward is a vote of trust in the Lok Sabha for his government that is actually a vote of confidence for Mr Singh, even though his innate modesty will stop him from admitting this. The margin of majority may not have been as slender as apprehended, but that is only an arithmetic quibble. Mr Singh deserves applause, and more than that, needs support. He put the interests of the nation before the craving for office. With the trust vote behind him, Mr Singh can go back to the real tasks that face the nation.        
	When the history of the last two decades gets to be written, Mr Singh will be seen as the maker of two landmark events. One was the economic reforms of the Nineties, and the other is the Indo-US nuclear deal. Thanks to the hurly-burly of politics, Mr Singh is now free of the ally that hampered his progress in both these areas. The Left is opposed to reforms and to the deal, both of which they see as parts of an elaborate conspiracy hatched in Washington. Mr Singh can now devote his attention to economic reforms and to containing inflation. These issues also need firm handling. It has been made clear to Mr Singh and to his critics, within and without the Congress, that when it matters most he has the support of his partys leadership. This should enable him to go ahead and set the nation on the path that he considers to be the best for economic growth with equity.         
	The trust vote has ended one phase of political uncertainty, but this does not mean that the prime minister will have a smooth ride with the policies he wants to implement. He has to manage a new group of excitable allies and a new set of political equations. He should not lose faith in the vision that he has for the country. He can draw sustenance from what his holy book says, The path of the faithful shall never be blocked.

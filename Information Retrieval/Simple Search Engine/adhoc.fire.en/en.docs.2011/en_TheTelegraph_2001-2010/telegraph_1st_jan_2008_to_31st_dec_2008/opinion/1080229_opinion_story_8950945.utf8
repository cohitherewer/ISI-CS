	According to the World Association of Newspapers, the top three countries of the world in daily newspaper circulation are China, India and Japan, followed by the United States of America and Germany. In India, according to Google, the vernacular press leads with Hindi, followed by Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. The statistics would be much the same for Hindi and other vernacular journals and magazines. English newspapers and journals come a poor second.         
	Because of the high circulation figures of Hindi dailies, some publishers feel that books on the social sciences and humanities in Hindi would also sell well. However, they so far havent ventured into publishing books exclusively in Hindi because Hindi publishers are poor compared to their English cousins. Most Hindi publishing houses are small organizations with poor professionalism. They confine themselves to printing guidebooks for texts or to downmarket fiction. Big money still hasnt gone into publishing in the Indian languages or into translations from English into the vernaculars.        
	There are four reasons why journalism in Hindi works while Hindi books do not sell. Firstly, there is a lack of marketing infrastructure, that is, bookshops, which are absolutely necessary for the wider distribution of Hindi books. Secondly, there is a cultural divide between the purely Hindi and the English-speaking elites; if the divide has narrowed over the years, it is because the Hindi-speaking elite is bilingual now and prefers to read English books in the original and Hindi titles in Hindi rather than in translation. Besides, the quality of literature in Hindi is poor compared to what is available in English. And then, more university grants are available available for English language publications than for Hindi. Let us consider each of these four factors separately.         
	Outside the state capitals in the Hindi belt and some of the metros, there are virtually no Hindi bookshops elsewhere in India. The few which are there usually double up as kirana stores which sell an assortment of daily goods, along with newspapers and magazines. Unlike newspapers that are distributed through vendors who do not require large establishments, bookshops need floorspace with some display facilities. That is, bookshops have overhead costs that are not incurred in case of newspapers and magazines. More importantly, the terms of trade are different. Vendors are given a handsome discount with full return facilities  unsold copies are taken back or adjusted against future purchases. The same facilities are not extended to books, which once bought cannot be returned.         
	Generally, there is a clear class/cultural divide between the Hindi and English-speaking elites: the latter group has more expendable income and is willing to spend it on books; this is not the case with the Hindi elites who tend to fall back on downmarket entertainment.        
	Finally, everything boils down to the availability of grants for libraries because individual buying power is limited. While the UGC generally disburses grants equitably, a matching contribution by the state governments is also essential in many cases. Often the latter doesnt show up and that means libraries are unable to make fresh purchases. Most of the available budget is spent on maintenance and staff salaries.         
	Things may improve in the coming years but that will require enormous stamina as well as resources. Meanwhile, Hindi newspapers and journals with their infotainment will continue to flourish.

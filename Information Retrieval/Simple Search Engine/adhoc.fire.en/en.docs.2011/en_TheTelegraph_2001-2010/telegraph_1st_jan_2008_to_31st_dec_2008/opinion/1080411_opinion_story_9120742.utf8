	In matters of survival, mothers are the best teachers daughters can have. The first survey on the attitudinal difference towards girl children conducted in selected districts of six north Indian states discovered that mothers in rural Rajasthan are teaching their daughters the arts of resistance to exploitation in the in-laws home. Simultaneously, sons are being asked to be polite and obedient. The survey was conducted by the Social Policy Research Institute of Jaipur district as part of a project on the basis of a recommendation by the Advisory Committee of Womens Studies and Development Centre. Not only did mothers feel that their daughters should be forceful, but the daughters too felt that they should not give in to unreasonable demands. These revelations are indicative of a startling change in a state which neglected its daughters, left them illiterate and married them off as early as possible  if they had not been already killed off as foetuses. But the census report of 2001 and the human development index report of 2002 had already shown a remarkable improvement in Rajasthans literacy figures: the rate jumped from 38.55 per cent in 1991 to 61.03 in 2001; for women, it rose the maximum number of percentage points among all states, up to 44.34 from around a little over 20 per cent.        
	The SPRI study is showing some of the effects of this. A large number of parents not only wish that their daughters should study up to college, but also say that they do not discriminate between boys and girls in matters of education. In case of limited resources, most parent respondents said they would decide on the basis of the respective performances of their children. Also, the age of marriage for women now seems to be rising, however slowly. For a state notorious for child marriages, even a small sign of awareness is a promise to be built on. But the sex ratio figures in the 2001 census report and the 2002 HDI report do not match. If the survey is any indication, then the sex ratio should be improving too. However, it should not be forgotten that the SPRI sample is very small: 400 girls between 13 and 18 and their parents. Rajasthan may be changing, but it is a large state with tribes making up 12 per cent of the total population. One of the worries in recent times has been the fact that some tribal people were beginning to make use of sex-selection technology; education and the age of marriage among tribes are still cause for serious concern. But where mothers are advising daughters to be firm, it is time to hope that real change has begun.

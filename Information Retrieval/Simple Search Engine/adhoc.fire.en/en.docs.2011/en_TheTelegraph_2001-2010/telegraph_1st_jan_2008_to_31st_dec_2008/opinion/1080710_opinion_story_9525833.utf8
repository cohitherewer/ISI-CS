	It is the chronicle of a withdrawal long foretold. The story unravelled over 11 months. The Left had made it clear that it would withdraw its support to the United Progressive Alliance government when and if the latter decided to go ahead with the Indo-US nuclear deal. The prime minister was equally adamant that he would sign the deal, even if the price for this were the loss of Left support, and even perhaps the loss of majority in the Lok Sabha. Over the past 11 months, various attempts were made to arrive at some sort of compromise. In retrospect, those attempts look like a charade since neither side was actually willing to yield ground. To be fair, the Left began the negotiations on a high note by linking the deal to its support to the UPA and the latters survival. Some of the Lefts demands were extraordinarily unreasonable and also ignorant of the norms of democratic government. As a mere ally, and not a part of the government, the Left demanded to see a confidential document. No self-respecting government could accede to such a demand. It also wanted to subject what was an executive decision to the sanction of parliament. The Left failed to substantiate its claim that the deal was damaging to Indias interests. Following a trail of ideological rhetoric and rant against the prime minister, the Left finally withdrew its support to the UPA on Tuesday. The result was not even a political whimper.        
	The impending political uncertainty has produced strange allies for the Congress, much to the chagrin of the Left. In all likelihood, the UPA government will survive with the support of the Samajwadi Party, and the Left, like old mother Hubbard of the nursery rhyme, is now staring at a bare cupboard. It is clear that the Left will have to spend time now in the political isolation ward. It can only blame itself  or perhaps, to be more precise, blame the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  for this plight. This will, of course, not be the first time that the communists find themselves totally alienated from the mainstream of national politics. They put themselves in a similar position in 1942, and again in 1962. But the spell in the isolation ward this time may well turn out to be more painful and long lasting, given the growing irrelevance of the communist ideology and the Lefts almost minimalist presence in places outside West Bengal and Kerala. The Left can exit the cul-de-sac it willingly entered by walking backwards, but it prefers to blame rather than rethink.        
	Truth be told, the support of the comrades was like an albatross around Manmohan Singhs neck. The Left, as an ally, did not help in policy-making, it only obstructed. The father of economic reforms in India may actually be pleased to be rid of Left baggage.

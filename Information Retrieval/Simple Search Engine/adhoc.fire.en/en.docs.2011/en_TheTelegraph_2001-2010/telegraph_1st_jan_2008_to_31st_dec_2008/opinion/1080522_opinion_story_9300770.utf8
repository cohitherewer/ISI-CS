	Does a gift remain a gift if it is not freely given? The Supreme Court has ruled that a demand for gifts for a womans newborn by her in-laws may not be regarded as extortion of dowry. The court made this observation while acquitting Narayanamurthy of Karnataka whose wife had killed herself in the second year of marriage, shortly after the birth of her daughter. She was allegedly driven to death by her in-laws who asked for a gold ring and silverware for the infants thread-changing ceremony. Mr Narayanamurthy and his parents were tried under sections 498A (cruelty), 304B (death within seven years of marriage) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Initially acquitted by a trial court, Mr Narayanamurthy was convicted by the high court, but the apex court quashed the judgment because of insufficient evidence.        
	Last year, another Supreme Court ruling had distinguished between legitimate demands for domestic expenses from married women by their in-laws and extortion of dowry. Household expenses, dowry, and gift  all three demands are poised precariously between the innocuous and the coercive. Given the economics of marriage in Indian society, a subtle shift of emphasis might turn a request into a threat, persuasion could give way to oppression. These rulings, however, come in the wake of an increasing scepticism with personal laws. There is a persistent anxiety with the domestic violence act, which, many suspect, could be manipulated to extract personal revenge. The bill for the prevention of sexual harassment at workplace is now expected to have a proviso to discourage those women who might try to frame their male colleagues. The reality is more layered than what it is made out to be. Women in India exist on the cusp of legal reform and victimization. It is easy to conceive of the legitimate and the illegitimate as opposed to each other, but in real life the former might give sanction to the latter.

	From the open, public places of Delhi, terror made a swift progression into the secure, private space of the Marriott in Islamabad when the hotel took the full blast of a suicide attack that has left at least 60 dead. The bombings in the two capitals would appear as entirely unconnected events if one chooses to ignore the intricate networks and linkages that the terror industry has fostered in the region. Pakistan, unfortunately, continues to do so, and for reasons best known to it. It is most likely to see the Marriott bombing as a direct fallout of the recent military aggression of the United States of America on its soil, as also a reaction to its own military operations in the federally-administered areas in the west, particularly Bajaur and Waziristan. As before, action against the perpetrators of the violence will be caught up in the rhetoric of using strategic patience, tact and persuasion together with the iron hand. It was the inherent contradiction in this policy that produced Lal Masjid  a terror stronghold bang in the middle of the capital  and made Pervez Musharraf look apologetic for having reduced it to rubble. The same contradiction now makes General Ashfaq Kayani a hero for allowing Pakistans borders (and its terror chain) to remain intact against foreign aggression and Asif Ali Zardari a quisling for sitting beside Hamid Karzai in his debut press meet as president and accommodating concerns for a reconciliation with India and Afghanistan to control terror.        
	Before Pakistan draws up its plans with its immediate neighbours and rehearses them with the US during the meeting of the United Nations general assembly, it would do well to sort out the confusion at home. It is apparent that the government policy in the tribal areas is still not clear. There are doubts about why the war is being fought there and for whom, and the alarming civilian casualties demand such an answer soon. Only a clearing of the air would allow the civilian leadership to gain greater public confidence in its anti-terror policies. For their part, the people have to realize that what is at stake are their safety, security and freedoms, all of which can be guaranteed more certainly by their democratically elected leaders than by the military leadership. There is not much to be gained either by undermining the civilian leadership or by turning a blind eye to the machinations of the army and its extra-legal machinery.

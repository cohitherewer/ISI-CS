	Is it possible to bring every accident of life under the regulatory scrutiny of the law? Awaiting the birth of a child is usually a joyful activity. But it would be presumptuous to try to imagine the mental and physical state of Niketa and Haresh Mehta as they await the birth of their first child as law-abiding adults. The experience of discovering a cardiac abnormality in the foetus, of deciding to go in for an abortion, of choosing the legal path to such a solution and of being prevented by the law to go ahead with it defies human empathy. In a country like India, how easy it would have been for the Mehtas and their doctor to avoid this trauma, and now this sense of doom, by stepping outside the law. But the problem with the law in India is that it leaves no room at all, no merciful human space, between criminal foeticide and legally permissible abortion. There is a whole area of medical risk and uncertainty  involving the well-being of the mother and of the child in a number of intertwined and unpredictable ways  which the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1972, is unable to visualize at all. And the problem is with the 20-week regulation after which a foetus cannot be aborted, unless there is a definite risk for the mother.        
	This is an arbitrary stipulation, varying from country to country, many of which fix it at a much later stage of pregnancy. There is no purely medical consensus on when the foetus becomes an autonomous living entity, and therefore legally entitled to the rights of a human individual. Hence, for the Mehtas, to be stopped at the limits of such an arbitrarily determined law from being able to choose between two painfully difficult options is to have that pain compounded, rather than resolved. Such an ethical crisis is best dealt with medically and personally, rather than in a court of law, by the parents in consultation with medical experts. Diagnostic methods have developed since the early Seventies, when the MTP Act was framed, and a range of foetal abnormality can be detected now, but often well beyond the 20th week. A law that cannot accommodate such revelations could foster a great deal of human suffering. The Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act does exist to stop female foeticide. It should be implemented properly, and the MTP Act amended to make room for the humane and rational resolution of the sort of crisis the Mehtas are faced with.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | hollow protest
                                                                                                                 HOLLOW PROTEST                                                          
	If a red rag enrages a bull, a hike in the price of fuels has a similar effect on the comrades. Come an announcement that the price of diesel and petrol has been raised and out comes the political rhetoric of anti-people policies. It is like the pressing of a button. The regularity and the predictability of the protest raise doubts about its sincerity and relevance. In West Bengal, the communists are pursuing the policy of economic development with some vigour. In keeping with the doctrine of the free market, the West Bengal government is supporting private enterprise, and is frowning at the idea of subsidies. The policies of the West Bengal government are opposed principally by the Congress or its foster child, the Trinamul Congress. At the Centre, the Congress advocates and follows policies of economic reform that are criticized and opposed by the communists. The situation is bizarre, to say the least, and perhaps can only be explained by the utter hollowness of pro forma protests.        
	The main purpose of the price rise is to reduce the amount paid out as subsidies. It is significant that the hike only affects petrol and diesel. Kerosene has been left untouched. In other words, prices have been raised of those two items that are daily consumed by the affluent in India. There is no logical reason for the state to subsidize the rich in India. Following this logic, the price of cooking gas should not have been left untouched. Which poor family in India has its food cooked on gas? The money that is saved by withdrawing subsidies from commodities used by the affluent can be better used to service sectors like education and health in which allocated resources are low. The argument that the price of fuel can be kept low by cutting back on duties is self-defeating because it means a reduction in the states revenues. The state cannot be asked to spend more on welfare and education and at the same time have its earnings lowered. The protest against the fuel-price hike is not only meaningless, but also a remarkable exhibition of double standards. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) cannot follow one type of economic policy in West Bengal, and oppose the same type at the Centre. Similar double standards have been displayed by other political parties as well. The Bharatiya Janata Party, for example, opposed the privatization of insurance when it was in the Opposition, and became its proponent when in power.        
	The significance of the decision to raise the price of petrol and diesel perhaps lies elsewhere. Observers have noticed that ever since the crisis over the Indo-US nuclear deal engulfed the government, the latter has gone into inactive mode. No important decisions have been taken, no important policies have been announced. Another way of looking at this passivity is to say that the government is going through its midlife crisis. The decision about fuel prices shows there is life in the government even after rigor mortis.

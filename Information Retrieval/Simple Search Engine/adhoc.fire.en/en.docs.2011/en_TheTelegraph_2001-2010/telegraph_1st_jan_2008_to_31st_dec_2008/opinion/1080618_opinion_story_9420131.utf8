	It was a SpiceJet flight to Chennai. First, they wanted me to sign a form because I was supposed to be a sick person. I had refused and the lady at the check-in counter had asked me, as if instructing a kindergarten student, But what are you sitting on? A wheelchair! Ergo, I was sick. Not everyone on a wheelchair is sick, I tried to educate her, but she didnt agree. Her senior intervened and I finally wrote on the form, Main bimaar nahin hoon (I am not sick).         
	Then they boarded me on the aircraft after all the passengers were on board. This was against international norms, which stipulate that disabled passengers be boarded first. They didnt have an aisle chair, so four porters, with no training in lifting a disabled person, carried me to my seat. Everyone was in a hurry because I was the last boarder and the aircraft was waiting to take off. In the commotion, the tube of my urine bag came off. I could see the wetness spreading on my trousers and promptly covered it with my hands. I was not going to be able to use the toilet, because they didnt have aisle chairs on board. Grin and bear it, I told myself.         
	At the Chennai airport, they provided me with my wheelchair at the aircraft door, but the foot-strap was missing. I lodged a complaint at the airport, claiming compensation.         
	Two days later, as I was returning to Delhi, I prepared myself for another grin-and-bear-it flight. I want to be boarded first, I said to the girl who was wheeling me. You will be, she said as she parked me near the SpiceJet boarding counter. Once parked, I was stuck at that spot because the airline wheelchair had no pushing rims for me to move about. How would you like to be sitting in one place for forty minutes? I asked her. She smiled. Rules, she said.        
	When it was time to board, I was taken to the aircraft before all other passengers. Theyre doing one thing right, I thought. But there werent enough people to carry me up the ladder, so we waited for about twenty minutes. (According to the directorate general of civil aviation guidelines, airlines are supposed to provide ramps or ambulifts to board disabled passengers). By this time the coach had arrived with the other passengers and, yet again, I was boarded last.         
	As the plane descended at Delhi I asked the air-hostess to ensure that my wheelchair was taken out of the hold and brought to the aircraft. It was midnight when we landed in Delhi, and after all the passengers had disembarked, I found that my wheelchair had been taken to the arrival lounge. I wont get off this plane till my wheelchair is brought here, I insisted. Why do you have to have your wheelchair? Why cant you use ours? Youll get yours in the arrival lounge in fifteen minutes, the flight steward reasoned. I told him that the airline wheelchair was not designed all that well. But to him a wheelchair was a wheelchair was a wheelchair.         
	Then something snapped. I didnt want to take this anymore. I didnt want people to smile at me and say rules. I didnt want to be explaining things at every step of my life. I wanted to go to a concert without having people lift me. I wanted to be able to go see a movie without having to wait for boys to carry me in. I wanted to be able to buy a toothbrush on my own. And I wanted a glass of water. But I found that the cabin crew were nowhere around. A security guy was explaining to me why the wheelchair could not be brought from the arrival lounge. I asked him for a bottle of water. The flight steward came over, with an air-hostess in tow. She stopped a few seats away and made a face. By this time my wife had been in touch with the Duty Officer who was on his way with my chair. A little later the flight steward came again and said it was time for him to go. The security staff will take care of you, he said.        
	Finally, after an hour-and-a-half, I was taken off the aircraft. They gave me a can of Coca Cola. But I dont drink aerated drinks. I didnt want to hurt their sensibilities so I took a sip. It was their third anniversary that day, after all.

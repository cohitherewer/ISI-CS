	Publishers want authors to write what people want to read rather than what they believe in. In other words, publishers want authors to write books that sell rather than books about what the authors passionately believe in or about what they really know. This assumption raises some disturbing questions.        
	First, how much do publishers really know about the pulse of the market when, by all accounts, the market is a highly fickle place? Fashions and needs change; what could be a rage one day could become pass within a week. The history of publishing is full of bloomers where publishers have passed over titles that became bestsellers later.         
	Second, when the market becomes the guiding factor, what happens to the traditional criteria of excellence  language, style, subject matter and scholarship? Do they matter at all? Do publishers believe that merely packaging and publicity will make a book commercially viable?        
	Third, have publishers started to take only a short-term view of new publications and forgotten the long-term factors? In other words, are publishers no longer interested in books that go into reprints over the years? After all, real profits in publishing come from reprints because only the initial costs are covered in the first print.        
	Publishers know by experience and instinct what sells and how to organize distribution by offering incentives that the traders would find hard to refuse. They do not know whats inside the covers or how good or relevant it is; they are not expected to know it either. Authors who often claim that their book would sell like hot cakes do not, as a rule, have a feel of the market. They have the scholarship and the ability to write but these are different from what sells a book.        
	When you look closely at a select crop of new books, you would realize that the traditional criteria for the success of a book have been passed over by many publishers in the rush to bring out the books. Packaging, which means attractive, glossy covers and plenty of colours, is what matters for mass market books. With increasing specialization and the growth of niche markets, the earlier criteria have been left to up-market publishers to bother about. Most publishers just want success and they want it now. If quality declines,well, thats too bad  you can look for it elsewhere.        
	But this does not mean that all is lost for the serious common reader. He will always be a contender because he has the money and the inclination to buy but will purchase only if the quality of the work satisfies him. In the Indian context, quality usually means simplicity of language and style. If Satyajit Rays Our Films, Their Films is now in its tenth reprint, it is because of the simplicity of language and the deep scholarship behind it. You could find many more examples of the like. Finally, quality will tell.       RAVI VYAS

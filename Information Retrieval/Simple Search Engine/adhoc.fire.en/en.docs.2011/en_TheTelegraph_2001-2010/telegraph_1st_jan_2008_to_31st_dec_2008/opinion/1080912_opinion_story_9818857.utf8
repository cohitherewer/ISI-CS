	Bengali eyes are focused on Singur. All the attention is on whether the Nano will roll out thence. The most important persons of West Bengal are straining to ensure that it does. But the strain has been largely Bengali. The street fights were between Trinamul Congress activists and the police; the talks have been between the government and the Opposition. Tata Motors has held itself largely aloof from these confabulations. Ravi Kant, the managing director of Tata Motors, has kept himself available for consultations; but otherwise, the negotiations have been something of a play without the prince of Bombay House. Ratan Tata meets the chief minister from time to time, but has avoided the saboteurs of his project and well meaning saviours.         
	But he is very much in the picture. So much so that no final solution can be reached without him. And he has, in his own unassertive manner, stated the conditions of his agreeing. He has said that the Tatas will leave if the people of Bengal do not want them. He did not mean all the people, or even the majority; if enough people make the Tatas unwelcome, they will leave. So what he has asked for is a once-for-all end to the agitation; if he believes that the Trinamul Congress will keep agitating on one ground or another, he will withdraw. He has been specific that the fact that Tata Motors has spent Rs 1,500 crore on the Singur site will not deter him from leaving. He has also said a number of times that Nano will come out on time. The only question is whether it will come out of Singur or somewhere else. Everyone assumes that the somewhere else will be a greenfield plant in another state, for instance, in Jharkhand, or Uttarakhand, both of which have offered him land and on very good terms. Given the fact that the sales of passenger vehicles produced by Tata Motors have fallen since last year, the Tatas have enough capacity  be it in Pune or Pantnagar  to roll out the Nano. Engineers from Singur have already gone to Pune to test the Nano engine; they could stay on and produce the entire car from there. A small-car project in West Bengal should not be stopped by small politicians with big egos. The Tatas have some money to lose, West Bengal has industrialization to lose. If West Bengal wants the car, its politicians need to abjure their contentions  immediately and permanently.

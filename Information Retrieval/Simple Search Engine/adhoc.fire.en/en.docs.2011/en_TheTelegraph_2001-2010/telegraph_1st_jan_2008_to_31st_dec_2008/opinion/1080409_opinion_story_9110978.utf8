	Tough cases, it is said, make bad laws. The reverse might equally well be true. Tough laws make bad cases. A good illustration of this is the storm in a teacup that affected the footballer, Jose Ramirez Barreto, who hails from Brazil and plays for Mohun Bagan, a famous Calcutta athletic club. In the second half of March, Mr Barreto was arrested in Calcutta airport just before he was to board a flight. The charge against him was that he was carrying foreign exchange far in excess of the permitted amount, and did not have the relevant documents regarding this money. By Indian law, it is mandatory for foreigners leaving or entering India with excess of $10,000 to make a declaration. Mr Barreto had failed to do this and he was apprehended. His only plea was that he was ignorant of this regulation. This, of course, could not be taken as a plea of innocence, since ignorance of the law cannot be taken as mitigating circumstances. The point, however, is not about Mr Barretos innocence or otherwise. It is about the very substance and content of the law under which he has been charged.        
	The law that has been used against Mr Barreto is a carry-over from an era when India faced serious foreign exchange problems, and hence various restrictions were imposed on the movement of foreign currency and on foreign exchange transactions. That era is now a distant nightmare. Indias foreign exchange reserves are now an embarrassment of riches. Many of the previous restrictions concerning foreign exchange transactions and the movement of foreign currency have been removed or relaxed. The question thus arises about the reasons for the existence of the law that stipulates that foreign nationals cannot exit or enter India with more than $10,000 without a declaration. It is difficult to quite understand the reasons behind persisting with this law (especially as $10,000 is not really a vast some of money), and the penalty associated with it. People smuggle things which are scarce and inaccessible. Neither of these conditions hold in the case of foreign exchange in India. The idea that anyone would want to smuggle foreign exchange does not seem logical. Mr Barreto could have been warned or the money impounded, but the existing laws do not permit such leniency. The case only demonstrates the absurdity of the way things are, and how heavily the past continues to hang over the minds of some people.

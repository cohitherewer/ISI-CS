	Vision of the rebels during 1857: Aspects of mobilisation, organisation amp; Resistance
  by Smita Pandey, Rupa, Rs 500  
	I must begin with a declaration of interest. I am a historian of the revolt of 1857, and my views on the subject have not only been discussed in this book, they have also been grossly misrepresented. This makes me suspicious about the authors competence to handle as complex and as nebulous an idea as the ideology of the rebels of 1857.  
	This work proceeds on the perfectly justified but not-so-new assumption that the rebellion against British rule in 1857 was not carried out in a fit of absent-mindedness on the part of the rebels and their leaders. They knew what they were fighting against and what they were fighting for. The author calls this the vision of the rebels. She is also right in saying that amazing aspects of this vision unfolded  envisaging the establishment of a Hindustan of Hindus and Muslims, a definition of identity not by family, community and territory but by being proactive in the fight against the firangis. Other historians have noted these aspects before Ms Pandey.        
	The problem has always been the tracking down of this vision. One of the sources used by historians has been the various proclamations and ishtahars that the rebel leadership issued to propagate their position and to boost the morale of the fighting men. Most of the major rebel proclamations have been translated and have been known to historians who have worked on the revolt. The book returns to the proclamations and to other well-known sources like the Foreign Department, Secret and Political Consultations, which are preserved and well-indexed in the National of India, New Delhi.         
	One of the points the author tries to make in the book is that the revolt was more extensive in terms of area than has hitherto been argued by historians. She writes, The extent to which this war spread across India  with vast tracts in the so-called quiescent north-west, an extensive swathe in the north-east, parts of Gujarat and the coastal regions, the inflammation in the South  particularly Hyderabad and extending up to Copal and the Raichur Doab made it a pan Indian movement and contradicts popular perception that it was confined to the north of the Narmada. It has become fashionable to try and extend the geographical spread of the revolt to beyond its core area  from Delhi to Patna and from the Terai to Jhansi. Unfortunately, there is as yet not enough empirical evidence to corroborate the claim that the uprisings outside the core area were as intense or had the popular support of the revolt within the core area. (Also, it needs to be pointed out that S.B.Chaudhuris Civil Rebellion in the Indian Mutinies, 1857-59  a book that finds no mention in the bibliography of Pandeys work  noted instances of the rebellion outside the core area.) It is ironic that having made her claim, the individuals that Pandey focuses on are mostly from the core area.        
	The book is terribly written. One chapter begins, The first war of Indian Independence was an eponymous event in the annals of the history of the 19th century as it harnessed the peoples urge for freedom in a gargantuan movement which encapsulated diverse ideologies with all its writings focusing on a paramount goal  war of the liberation of the country from the rule of the firangi lootere (foreign looters). Not only are the syntax and choice of words awful, the writer obviously does not know the meaning of the word eponymous.        
	I will end where I began. I have authored four books on 1857. Only one of these (not cited by the author) is on Mangal Pandey. Yet Pandey writes, Rudrangshu Mukherjees erudite analysis of 1857 is confined to defining whether Mangal Pandey was the first putative hero. The work of mine (Awadh in Revolt, 1857-58: A study of popular resistance) she does cite contains not a single line on Mangal Pandey.                          RUDRANGSHU MUKHERJEE

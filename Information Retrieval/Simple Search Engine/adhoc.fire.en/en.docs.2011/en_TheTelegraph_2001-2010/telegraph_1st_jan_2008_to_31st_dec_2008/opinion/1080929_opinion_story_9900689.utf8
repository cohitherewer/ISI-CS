	For higher education in West Bengal, a shift in priority from the making of priests to the making of schoolteachers might sound like an advance towards catching up with the present. But the end result seems to have remained the same: the growing popularity of Sanskrit as a subject of study in colleges. This year, 47 colleges have been allowed to start teaching Sanskrit, although geography beats Sanskrit in popularity, with 52 colleges being allowed to teach geography. Universities in Bengal, particularly Calcutta University, and the West Council of Higher Secondary Education have put their heads together and decided to promote these two subjects simply because the thousands of students who go on to become schoolteachers seem to think that studying them is the surest way of getting teaching jobs in schools. And the government is endorsing this popular notion even when statistics released by the school service commission have repeatedly proved it wrong. As a result, compared to the 52 and 47 colleges allowed to teach geography and Sanskrit respectively, honours and general courses in computer science have begun to be taught only in 11 colleges, food and nutrition in four, and molecular biology and biotechnology in just one college.        
	A couple of years ago, the chief minister had scolded his higher education minister in the assembly for promoting the education of priests by pushing Sanskrit in colleges at the expense of subjects with greater contemporary relevance and usefulness. (Geography, as a subject for higher education, is also on its way out in other parts of the modern world.) But now, the single most important factor that seems to determine what new subjects will be taught in Bengals colleges is what would make it easiest for schoolteachers to find jobs. And this too is founded on a mistaken idea of how the system actually works. What is most shocking is that this travesty of the principles of higher education is being kept up by none other than the state government.

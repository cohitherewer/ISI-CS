	In financial markets, Black Monday refers to Monday, October 19, 1987, when share prices all over the world fell precipitously. The crash started in Hong Kong, and then gradually moved westward through the different time zones, finally hitting the North America stock exchange. The Black Monday decline has been the largest one-day decline in history.        
	This record was almost beaten on Monday, October 6. Mounting fears about the worldwide financial crisis and its effects on the global economy sparked off panic-selling in virtually every stock exchange in the world. Again, the stock markets in Asia were the first to feel the brunt of the gigantic wave of selling, with share prices in Japan and Indonesia falling by almost 10 per cent. The tidal wave then engulfed European stock markets, with share prices in London recording their worst fall since Black Monday. Finally, while Asian brokers tossed and turned during a nervous night, the Dow Jones too tanked by over five per cent.         
	The sheer magnitude of the crisis has forced all major Western governments into taking remedial measures whose size and scope were unimaginable only a few weeks ago. Orthodox economic ideas and prejudices have been shelved with remarkable alacrity as several governments have announced coordinated steps to stem the rot. The lead has been taken by the British government, which has announced the mother of all rescue plans worth 400 billon pounds  that is a mind-boggling 11 zeroes following the 4. And history has been created with six of the worlds most important central banks, including the European Central Bank, the United States Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England, announcing simultaneous emergency interest rate cuts of half a percentage point.               
	As several sceptics had pointed out, the announcement of the Paulson plan, which was finally approved by American legislatures only a week or so ago, has failed to stem the rot in the American stock market. The contagion effect ensured that world markets continued to slide, culminating in the precipitous crash on October 6. Obviously, the question on everyones lips is whether these new initiatives will have a better fate.         
	It is instructive to examine the British governments initiative. It is by far the biggest and most comprehensive rescue of its kind, and there is talk that several other governments will soon announce similar packages. The British plan has essentially three components. The first component involves a possible government investment of upto 50 billon pounds in the banking industry. The second component involves offering as much as 250 billion pounds worth of new guarantees for bank debt, while the remaining 100 billion pounds is an addition to the existing Bank of England short-term loan schemes.        
	Perhaps the first part of this three-pronged attack is the most radical. In essence, it involves a partial nationalization of the banking sector with the government planning to buy preference shares in banks whose lendings are far in excess of any prudent limits, given their existing capital. So, it is imperative that these banks recapitalize. In healthier times, the banks would have sought fresh injection of private capital to increase their capital. But hardly any private investor is foolish enough to invest in banks these days, and so the government has had to become the investor of last resort. Even a small step towards nationalization may seem heretical in the land of Margaret Thatcher and New Labour. It is a sign of how drastic these times are that even many Americans are now saying that the American government too has to traverse the same path.         
	The offer of government guarantees for bank debt is equally important. Public confidence in banks is at an all-time low. Nervous depositors must be wondering whether it is more prudent to keep their savings under their mattresses. Of course, these fears can become self-fulfilling. If a large number of depositors withdraw their deposits in anticipation of a bank collapse, then the very act of withdrawal will surely force all undercapitalized banks to topple over. Hopefully, the knowledge that the government is standing behind the banks will restore creditors confidence in the banking system  though perhaps not in Iceland where the government itself is supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy.        
	An integral part of the crisis is that the short-term credit market has virtually disappeared. In normal times, banks typically take recourse to short-term loans in order to cover temporary deficits. But, now no entity is willing to lend to any bank because they do not know whether the lenders will be able to pay back the loans. This is yet another factor aggravating the banking crisis. The third component of the British governments strategy is designed to revive the short-term credit market.        
	There is not much else that governments can do at this stage. They have signalled very clearly that they are willing to commit unimaginably large sums of public money to shore up the banking system  the current bill for every United Kingdom taxpayer is 13,000 pounds. Unfortunately, public confidence is a very fragile thing. If enough people believe that these actions will work, then we will climb out of the crisis. Conversely, a large number of pessimists can also pull down the world economies even further.         
	If these governments had shown the same resolve even a couple of months ago, then the severity of financial crisis would surely have been contained. Today, the financial crisis has been aggravated because it is now almost certain that except for China and India, all the major world economies are on the brink of a recession. The real and financial crises feed on one another, thereby complicating the situation even further.              
	It is not surprising that parallels have been drawn between the present crisis and the Great Depression of the 1930s. But, surely, economic theory has progressed sufficiently to prevent worldwide crises of those magnitudes? Is it conceivable that we could actually experience yet again the trauma of those troubled times?         
	Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut answers to either of these questions. It is fair to assert that economists know what kind of policies to follow in order to control fluctuations in economic activity in individual countries. Implement expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in downturns and contractionary policies in upturns is a vastly simplified summary of appropriate policy prescriptions.         
	These would probably have been effective a few decades ago. However, the major economies of the world are now so intricately intertwined that fluctuations in one country spread rapidly all over the world. It is almost as if we have a single world economy. This makes it imperative for the governments in major economies to coordinate their rescue plans. Fortunately, the International Monetary Fund and world leaders seem to have realized this very quickly and are trying to carry out joint rescue operations. So, there is still hope that the world economy will limp back to a low-level equilibrium in the foreseeable future.

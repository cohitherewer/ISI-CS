	Something must have gone terribly wrong with a democracy in which an election turns into a humanitarian disaster. Kenyas president, Mwai Kibaki, claims to have defeated his political opponent, Raila Odinga, in the polls. But more than 300 dead and around 100,000 displaced Kenyans are the price the country has paid so far for this bizarre victory. The head of Kenyas electoral commission and the British foreign secretary  observing the elections and their aftermath with ineffectuality and alarm  have both declared that they do not quite know who has won. Monitors for the African Union and the European Union have also expressed their failure of trust in the results announced in the face of blatant and widespread procedural irregularities. The Americans have been a little more guarded in their condemnation since Kenya is a key ally in the fight against al Qaida in Africa. Messrs Kibaki and Odinga, together with the political parties they head and the tribal vote-banks they command, are trading charges against each other. Each has come to embody for the other a diabolical modus operandi that involves genocide, ethnic cleansing and systemic corruption. Hence, Kenyas churches as well as its slums are burning now. About 50 members of the powerful Kikuyu tribe (to which Mr Kibaki belongs) were burnt to death when members of a rival tribe set fire to the church that had sheltered the Kikuyus. Indians living in Kenya, numbering close to a lakh, are trapped in their homes or in temples, their businesses suffering grievous losses.        
	Yet, in 2002, Mr Odinga had helped Mr Kibaki in the latters landslide victory against the increasingly dictatorial Daniel Arap Moi. But, by 2005, Mr Kibaki had suffered an embarrassing defeat in a referendum on a new draft constitution that allowed the presidency to retain extensive powers. The pervasive corruption and cliquishness that he had come to stand for began to be opposed by the populist Mr Odinga, whose votes came mostly from the huge urban slums, where rival gangs clash constantly and people use plastic bags as toilets and throw them out of the window. The vision of hope born in 2002 has now become one of an uncontrollable regress into anarchy. Kenyas warring leaders must find a way of coming together again to find a civilized, parliamentary solution to this barbaric deadlock.

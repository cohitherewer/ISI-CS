	All over a cup of coffee                  
	Sir  My friend and I had stopped at the Caf Coffee Day in the South City Mall on June 25 around 10 pm. The coffee was excellent. But when we asked for our bill, the waiter calmly told us that the computer had crashed and they couldnt give us a bill. We asked for a handwritten cash memo, but were told that they had run out of those too. By this time, both the waiter and the person at the till were getting impatient with us for insisting on a bill. We did pay, but found it impossible to convey to the staff that it was absurd, and illegal, to demand payment without being able to provide a bill. Such brazenness cannot be carried off as urban cool.           
	Yours faithfully,        A. Sen, Calcutta 
        
	State the facts          
	Sir  One fails to understand why the Bachchans continue to give false statements regarding the assets they hold (Jaya lands in fresh trouble, June 25). The Bachchans must realize that they have a huge fan-following worldwide. They should be setting standards of honesty and integrity, not getting embroiled in false statements, wrong declarations and dubious deals.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The First Information Report against Jaya Bachchan, accused of filing a wrong affidavit to contest the Rajya Sabha elections, brings to mind several cases where legislators, entrusted with the duty of upholding the law of the land, betrayed the peoples mandate shockingly. In most instances, they managed to get off lightly, thanks to administrative leniency. The chief justice, S.N. Dhingra, had rebuked the Delhi police for not taking suo motu action against members of parliament involved in the infamous money-for-questions scam. The Lok Sabha secretariat had to file an FIR against the parliamentarian who was caught taking along a lady pretending to be his wife on a free air-ticket meant for spouses. Legislators, who have been trusted by voters to protect the law and failed to do so, should be given exemplary punishment, including the dissolution of their seats.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal, 
Dariba, Delhi                      
	Unsurpassable          
	Sir  It was with profound sadness that I learnt the news of historian Sipra Sarkars demise (June 26). I was fortunate to be her student, when I took my undergraduate and graduate degrees in history at Jadavpur University during the late Sixties and early Seventies. Although I moved to the US shortly after completing my studies in Calcutta, Sipradis influence on me has been enduring.           
	During the last three or four decades, I have known eminent historians and scholars from both sides of the Atlantic, but I am yet to see anyone with Sipradis level of understanding and comprehension of complex historical issues, combined with the ability to explain them lucidly. She had the gift of taking her students through any topic of modern political thought  from Machiavellis politics to Marxs historical materialism  with remarkable clarity. My only regret is that my classmates and I sort of took her for granted and failed to fully grasp what we were missing by not following up on her lectures with probing questions. Had I known what I know now, I would have made every effort to do full justice to her teaching through greater interaction with her both inside and outside the classroom. Thinking of Sipradi often reminds me of the words I had heard from the late A.W. Mahmood, who taught her at Presidency College. I once asked Professor Mahmood to name some of his most brilliant students. He ticked off many illustrious names, but ended by confessing, Still, nothing like Sipra.                     
	Yours faithfully,

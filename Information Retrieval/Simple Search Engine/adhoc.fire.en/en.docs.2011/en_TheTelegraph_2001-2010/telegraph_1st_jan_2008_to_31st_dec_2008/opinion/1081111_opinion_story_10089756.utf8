                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TIME TO BELL THE CAT                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Looking back at last week, that heady moment when the citizens of the United States of America stepped out of the box and voted in Barack Obama as their 44th president, the temptation to juxtapose India and our politics with that of America was all pervasive!        
	Senator John McCain conceded defeat early in the game and made a speech that re-affirmed that dignity and fair play are both alive and kicking as essential ingredients in democratic politics. He called upon his supporters to assist the new president in his endeavour to bring change despite differences on policy and other issues. He hailed the mandate as being historic. Cut to India  abuse and accusations would have taken centre stage, re-polls would have been demanded, guns would have been brandished, threats would have been hurled across podiums and on the small screen, parliamentary sessions would have been boycotted and adjourned, money wasted, actions stalled.        
	Senator Barack Obamas speech at the celebratory rally was hugely inspiring. What he said there affected people around the globe. It was as though planet earth had shared a victory because we all know this change could well alter the future course of action and partnerships between all countries in our fast shrinking world. Consensus could become a tangible reality. Collective redressal of international problems and disputes, between races, faiths, classes and creeds, could become the acceptable, democratic instrument for accelerating peaceful solutions to tricky, volatile and painful schisms. Cut to India  when did we last hear an awe-inspiring national address? What we get from our leaders is predictable rhetorical jargon and divisive politics, encouraged and endorsed by supreme silence on contentious issues. Parochial positions are never combated. Monsters are created and used to pander to vote-banks of one type or another.                 
	New dispensation        
	No decisive retort or action happens. Instead, a strategy of let-sleeping-dogs-lie overwhelms us. India gasps for breath to live another day as it is manipulated, used, taken for granted, mauled and betrayed by the elected representatives and their minions. Our politicians rule us as ruthlessly as our colonizers did. As a collective, with Gandhi as the selfless leader, we managed to free ourselves from the British. That was probably the last time India was ignited with fervour and hope, determined to bring change. Over the next six decades, India failed to deliver development because the administrative and legal model adopted by the men and women who were at the helm in 1947, was alien to our inherent culture and ethos. We are paying the price of that misfortune, and until we overhaul the divisive system and replace it with a clean machine, our rulers will continue to divide our people on grounds of class, caste and faith like the British did well  divide and rule  and India will falter.        
	Our leaders are regressive and find refuge for their transparent and obvious inadequacies by indulging in conservative posturing. When desperate, they play one faith against the other and salvage their conscience by prostrating themselves in front of their gods. The gods seem to have had enough of the hypocrisy, they have lost their patience, become tired of giving the anointed politicians benefit of doubt; so India is being punished for re-electing such shameless leaders.        
	Seeing palpable change taking place elsewhere in the world, sensing the vitality of a new generation of international people engaged in transforming their dreams into opportunities and realities, it makes one sad that India is lagging behind. The stranglehold of the administrative classes needs to be unravelled urgently. A purge is essential for a cleansing to be initiated. Who will bell the cat? Which political dispensation will lead the change?

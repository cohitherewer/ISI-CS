	The mysterious appeal of Rajput paintings, apart from their intrinsic elegance even as they depict the horrific and the macabre, lies in their catholicity. The images included in RAJPUT PAINTING: ROMANTIC, DIVINE AND COURTLY ART FROM INDIA (by Roda Ahluwalia, Mapin, 16.99) are most striking when they dwell on the mundane details of life. The moments from courtly and domestic life appear most surreal, when they are most resonantly realistic. A pet cat and a pigeon seem to fly out of the reach of a noblewoman (top left). A royal lady braves thunder, lightning and rain, walking past fearsome snakes to meet her beloved (top right). In between, a Pahari painting shows another femme fatale engaged in a bizarre ritual. Extreme left is an example of a Mughal illustration in Razmnama, a Persian translation of Mahabharata. An unfinished watercolour of Maharaja Jaswant Singh and his nobles looks like a charmed fossil (bottom).

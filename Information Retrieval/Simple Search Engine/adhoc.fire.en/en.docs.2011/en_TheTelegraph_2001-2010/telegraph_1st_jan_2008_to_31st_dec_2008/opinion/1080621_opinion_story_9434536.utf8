	From vada pav to suicide                  
	Sir  After claiming sole proprietorship over Mumbais vada pav, the Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, now wants a Hindu suicide squad to counter Islamic terrorism (Sena for Hindu suicide squads, June 19). Thackeray has claimed in the past that Hindus had been safe only during Shivajis rule (though its ally, the BJP, thinks it was Ram). Since the idea of the suicide squad is so close to his heart, surely Thackeray would like to become the supreme commander of the proposed squad. And what could be more glorious than leading the squad on a mission to eliminate terrorist outfits around Indias western border?           
	Yours faithfully,         N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad
        
	Discordant notes          
	Sir  Thank you for Somak Ghoshals brilliant article, Eine kleine light music (June 17), which drew attention to the current phase of changes that the Calcutta School of Music is going through. As a lover of piano music, I have often wondered why the CSM never clearly announced its programme details for the piano-loving public. There should be more publicity of pianists and piano concerts so that the appreciation of piano music can be revived in the city.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Manjusree Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Somak Ghoshal has captured very well how the Calcutta School of Music has evolved with the passage of time. The president of CSM, Dickoo Nowroji, must be congratulated for her efforts in bringing the much-desired changes, which include the introduction of popular light music as part of the range of courses taught at the school. Nowrojis comparison of the modifications in CSMs western classical music curriculum to the changes in the game of cricket is apt. One is reassured by Nowrojis vast knowledge of music, and there is no doubt that her efforts will make CSM more popular. Hopefully, we will soon see Hindi music-lovers queuing up to become students and members of this heritage institution.           
	Yours faithfully,        A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

            
	No mail is good news          
	Sir  The problem of email overload plaguing corporate organizations globally, including the creators of email themselves, applies to India too (Creators try to tame email monster, June 15). In-house chat messengers, with innovative emoticons, are used by IT-sector employees more than any application related to their work. Inane forwards are exchanged by colleagues throughout the day. Employees sitting in nearby cubicles prefer to message each other instead of walking up and talking directly. Some companies block access to certain websites, but this usually meets with the displeasure of employees who see this as an infringement on their choice. It would have helped if there was a uniform code followed by all companies to block certain sites. The restrictions are arbitrary and are imposed by some companies and not by others. The findings of the Information Overload Research Group should be applied to firms in India to reduce the loss of productivity to compulsive virtual communications.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Alekhya Chakrabarty, Calcutta

    
	Sir  It is all very well for global IT giants to fret over their Frankensteins monsters, but they dont seem to be doing much about it. A non-profit group should be set up by them to analyse the hindrances to work output caused by email and chatting during office hours. It must be ensured that mail service providers, while installing new applications that temporarily block email, do not add other distracting applications, such as linking email with chat and news sites.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Indrajit Ghosh, Hyderabad

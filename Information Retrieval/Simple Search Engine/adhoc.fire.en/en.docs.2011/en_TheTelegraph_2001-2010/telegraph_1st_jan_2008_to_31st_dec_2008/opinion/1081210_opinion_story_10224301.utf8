	The capitalist world has hurtled towards a major crisis since the failure of Bear Stearns in July. For a while, Indias inveterate optimists proclaimed its immunity to crises. Even the prime minister, when he spoke in Paris in September, saw only an upside for growth and thought that India would provide a stable platform for businessmen and investors. To his credit, however, he saw what trouble the banks were in; the following Monday, the Reserve Bank of India opened its chests to them. A fortnight later, he got the RBI to cut the repo rate, and boasted that all the questionable expenditure his government had provided for in schemes to feed vote banks would raise demand for goods and services and ward off the impact of the global downturn on India. He forgot that Indias exports, close to a quarter of its national product, would decline when their buyers were in trouble, and that Indian companies, which had been borrowing cheap funds abroad, would have to pay back much more as the government devalued the rupee.        
	All that folly came home to roost; not all the amnesia could ward it off. Labour-intensive export industries such as textiles and leather goods began to dismiss workers. Banks took the cash they were to lend to borrowers in distress, and parked it in government bonds instead. Finally convinced of the crisis, the prime minister took the reins of the finance ministry in his own hands at the end of November. Then last weekend, he announced a large number of fiscal and monetary measures. He has provided for a small increase in expenditure  just 6 per cent more on the Rs 2 lakh crore of plan expenditure. But he has introduced many detailed tax-subsidy measures to help particular industries. He has encouraged government departments to buy new cars so that the beleaguered car-makers could keep running for a few more weeks. He has promised exporters that though they must continue to pay service tax on commissions they pay to sales agents abroad, the tax would be eventually refunded. He has introduced an interest subsidy for exporters, but only if they are in labour-intensive industries. And he has persuaded the RBI to release funds for housing and small industries that will have long routes to traverse before they reach the intended beneficiaries.         
	This is generally true of his packet: it will generate so much red tape that it will be months and years en route, and only a part of it will serve its purpose. The prime minister is a perspicacious man; perhaps only he in the government understands what a serious crisis is in the offing. He is a kind and sensitive man; he clearly wants to do his best to save the economy from the crisis. Unfortunately, he is such a conformist that he has allowed his bureaucracy to blunt his good intentions.

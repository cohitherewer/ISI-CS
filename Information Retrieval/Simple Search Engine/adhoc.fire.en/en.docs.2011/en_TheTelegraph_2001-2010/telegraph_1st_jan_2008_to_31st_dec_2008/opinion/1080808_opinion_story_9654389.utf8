	Wayward men, women and children                
	The Bastard of Istanbul (Penguin, 11.99) by Elif Shafak transports the reader to the shores of the Bosphorus where beautiful, rebellious women break the Rules of Prudence scripted by a conservative society to chain smoke in cafs, sprint across streets in broken high heels, and have abortions. Retribution follows, but the women react by smoking even more cigarettes and cooking delicious dishes with golden raisins, dried apricots, figs, pistachios  and cyanide. The last ingredient is added with the man who sired the bastard of Istanbul in mind. When twenty-year-old Asya Kazanci is not drafting her Personal Manifesto of Nihilism, she ponders over the question of her paternity. The arrival of her American-Armenian cousin, Armanoush, results in a search into the past of the Kazanci family and the discovery of secrets in which the histories of Armenia and Istanbul are woven together inextricably. Shafaks style  understated, laconic, humorous  makes her novel extraordinary.                         
	Love and Biology at the Center of the Universe (Nal Accent, Rs 395) by Jennie Shortridge is a novel whose central question is: How does a good girl know when to finally let herself be bad? In the case of Mira Serafino, it happens when she finds that her husband has fallen for another woman. The plot gets marginally interesting once Mira leaves for an unknown future. But at the end, after some reflections on sex and reproduction, the novel is nothing more than a Hollywood drama where wayward husband cheats on good wife, causing heartbreak, only for the wife to come back on realizing that none of the men she has bedded after she left him matches up to him. This is the kind of novel that, when turned into film, makes teenage girls cry buckets.                         
	No one brews coffee and conversation like Karan (Diamond, Rs 395) reads as if the Koffee with Karan episodes have been transcribed by an utterly incompetent sub and sent off to press without any editing. The mistakes are too many and the conversations too incoherent at places to be discussed in any seriousness. Karan Johar and his guests deserved better.                        
	Child Develop- ment: Your Questions Answered (Byword, Rs 199) provides a comprehensive guide to raising children, with doctors, teachers, speech therapists and psychologists coming forward to solve the problems of parents with their young ones.

	About ten years ago, a newly-married couple, very much in love and splurging on a taxi ride home after a special dinner for which they had saved up, were stopped by two policemen on Red Road. Why were they being obscene in public? The couple, who had been sitting close together and gazing into one anothers eyes, were quite speechless. But the saga had just begun. They were first abused for doing things without being married  their protests went unheard  and then taken to the police station. The abuses continued, till the girl was permitted to ring her father, who came bearing their marriage certificate. Then they were freed.
    
	It is easy to imagine the disappointment of the policemen. There were no benefits to be had from this one. But also, one feels, seeing the barely suppressed excitement of the police whenever there is the suggestion of an intimate relationship, that there was somewhere an intangible sense of disappointed prurience. 
    
	This was years before the police had those other toys to play with  cellphones and competitive media. No doubt these have encouraged the lawkeepers to indulge their prurience with piety, but the insatiable mucking about in a love story gone wrong, or one that could be made to go wrong, is a trait that was always there. Couples sitting in parks know this too well; they are the focus of the laws attention, not the drug-sellers slinking past. It all went a bit haywire in the case of Rizwanur Rahman, but the tendency persists, unaffected. 
    
	The aftermath of the recent deaths in the Santiniketan hostel is a good example. A man walks into a hostel with a gun stolen from a policeman and shoots a woman. There are witnesses up to the minute that the man shuts the door behind a fleeing friend. It seems that alternative situations cannot be constructed, as, for example, that the woman had shot the man. Or that there was a second man, either invisible or in an iron mask, who floated in and out and accomplished a double murder in his passing. But the police appear to be intrigued, if not with the events but with their background. They have dug out a story that looks like one of unrequited love  and they cannot let go. It is not as if their unflagging interest in the matter and their ceaseless chatter about it will distract attention from the fact of a policemans unsecured gun. There is a grieving fianc in the offing, who, it appears, will have to cooperate further after having told the police his entire history, his routine of communication with his betrothed, even of his messages to the shooter. The police let the world know about every call made, every message sent from and received by the main actors in the tragedy. These could have been important had there been a mystery about the deaths. 
    
	Why do the police feel the urge to demonstrate their efficiency only in their search for love triangles and failed promises in situations in which there is nothing to look for? And why persist with private details when all that is happening is that two pairs of parents are grieving for their childrens painfully wasted lives?

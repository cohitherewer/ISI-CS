The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A strange and lonely feeling of unbelonging
                                                                                                                 A STRANGE AND LONELY FEELING OF UNBELONGING                                                                  
	Past Continuous By Neel Mukherjee, Picador, Rs 495        
	There is a bitterness  almost savage in its quality  about Neel Mukherjees debut novel that wrenches the reader out of his comfort zone. The only way to engage with this book would have to be from the gut-level. The beginning is familiar. The mothers funeral. You think of Camuss Meursault, you think of Bibhutibhushans Apu. As Ritwik waits before the electric furnaces of the Kalighat crematorium in Calcutta, his mind  and the narrative  does not become a montage of childhood and adolescent memories of the mother. Like Meursault, he goes through the bristling panoply of rituals, watching neighbours, relatives and street scenes.         
	The death of a parent induces a certain numbness. But in Ritwiks case, his mothers death, within days of his fathers, sets him free. In Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyays Aparajito, Apu feels something similar after he comes back to Nishchindipur and performs his mothers last rites. It is a realization that comes shrouded in guilt for Apu. Ritwik feels no guilt. He only knows that he must escape the festering mediocrity of his life in the city.         
	At the epicentre of the mediocrity lies the tiny flat on Grange Road, belonging to Ritwiks mothers side of the family, which he has been forced to call home ever since his parents moved into it with him and his younger brother. The memories that deny him refuge at the crematorium but pour out in an acid trickle afterwards emanate from this flat. They form a violent collage  petty squabbles by day and ugly fights by night, Ritwiks maternal uncles bashing up each other and sometimes their mother, but above all, his mother taking out all her frustration and anger on him.        
	The memories of violence come back to Ritwik even after he escapes to Oxford. So does his mother. The vision of the dead mother on the armchair in his room would have made Norman Bates happy, but it terrifies Ritwik, makes him lose control of his bladder. At Oxford, he drifts from Shakespeare and Keats and Dr Carters tutorials, to sharing a joint and some Calcutta stories with fellow student Gavin, to furtive gay sex in public toilets  preoccupations and actions characterized by purposelessness and disaffection. If his past in Calcutta was steeped in squalor and caught in the web of little lies told to friends at his posh English-medium school, Ritwiks present in Oxford is about a strange loneliness of the soul. All he cares about is to not lose the cover of anonymity that England gives him, to not have to revisit the dreariness of the past.        
	The act that gives Ritwik some satisfaction is writing. He is writing  though the reader is not told this until late into the novel  the story of Maud Gilby, who appears in a cameo in Tagores Ghare Baire, as Bimalas English teacher and companion. Miss Gilbys story, or rather, Ritwiks telling of it, runs parallel to Ritwiks own Bildungsroman through the length of Past Continuous. And this causes a problem. It is understandable that the author wished to make two flight-paths cross, but the two birds fly at widely different speeds. After the fourth chapter of Miss Gilbys story  which is just before she enters the household of Nikhilesh and Bimala  I stopped following its thread completely and concentrated on Ritwik. Once through with it, it was more rewarding to come back to finish the early-20th-century tale than having it interrupt, and get interrupted by, the Indo-Anglian journey of Ritwik.         
	This is not to say that the attempt to write back at Tagores novel is without its merits. The life of Miss Gilby prior to her appointment as Bimalas teacher is a happy blend of historical research and imagination. Once the gentle British lady lands up at Dighi Bari in Nawabgunj, however, Mukherjee (or should it be Ritwik?) merely puts down her version of the events outlined by Tagore (who does radical experiments with multiple narratorial voices).         
	In any case, Miss Gilbys raison dtre in the novel is not to help the author create his portrait of the artist as a young man. Her story holds clues to  and is, in turn, fed by  the one relationship that lends some beauty and meaning to Ritwiks life  his relationship with the old and frail Anne Cameron. Anne happens to Ritwik soon after his student visa in England expires, rendering him a virtual prisoner in this new land, without access to the benefits of the welfare state. Gavins offer of bed and board in lieu of caring for Anne Cameron in Brixton, London, comes as a godsend to him. It also lifts the novel to a different plane, and there is no greater evidence of it than in the prose, particularly in the descriptions of Anne in the bath, or flitting between lucidity and incoherence.        
	It is the incontinent, amnesiac Anne who carries the novel on the brittle bones of her shoulders. She holds out the promise of exorcising Ritwiks ghosts, by letting him see her own ghosts. Fumbling across the real and imagined elements of her speech, Ritwik learns about her son who had shot himself dead at thirty-two. Her sons love for birds becomes an obsession with Anne, who frightens Ritwik by teetering out into the garden, ostensibly looking for a rare bird. She was in India during the raj, and Ruth, her ornithologist friend from those days, gets transposed into Ritwiks story of Miss Gilby. Anne herself is a link to Ritwiks novel, but Mukherjee does not quite reveal whether the link is imagined, or merely discovered, by Ritwik.        
	The most moving image in the novel is of Anne floating into Ritwiks bedroom and switching off the bedside lamp. Ritwik, startled and feeling vulnerable, shouts at her and demands an explanation. As Anne goes away without answering, Ritwik breaks down, wiping his snot and helpless tears on the sleeve of the torn and threadbare blue kurta his mother gave him six years ago.        
	Past Continuous is inescapably about mothers and sons, but also about the difficulty and futility of looking for a pattern in lived experience. Ritwiks sexual encounters  with boys cruised from Kings Cross or the wealthy Arab arms-dealer who likens him to his son  can only heighten his sense of alienation, though they also push him to walk the mean streets obsessively. Without revealing the end here, it may be said that the culmination belies all promises of redemption, if ever there were any. The jigsaw comes close to sorting itself out, but stops short. Ritwik has, after all, never been comfortable with expectations, not even his own.        
	The novel has power and a rawness of feeling, and one can almost sense the emotional drain it must have been to the novelist. It could have been slimmer, though, had Mukherjee not got carried away by Rajput history and swadeshi advertisements in Miss Gilbys narrative.                     SREYASHI DASTIDAR

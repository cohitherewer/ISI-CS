	Take the availability of hardware. Personal computer is now common in Indian middle-class homes because of the low-priced desktops. It is also considered an essential learning tool, which can also be used for entertainment. The mushrooming PCOs, as centres of communication and entertainment, provide the public with easy access to technology even in small towns. Prima facie, digitization is no big deal, especially for the under-30 generation, who have learned to communicate on-line. With more non-copyright books and research papers being posted on the internet there is a growing market of digitized material waiting to be tapped.        
	But how do you tap the market? Segmentation of the market  prices, discounts, credits  that have been the traditional strategies of breaking into new markets does not readily apply to digitized materials. Often parallels have been drawn from the music industry but these dont quite fit because the Indian buyer always wants to see the product and feel it before he buys it. So how do you display the digitized product?        
	Bookshops are no answer because they dont have the space for computers where potential customers can see what they want to buy on computer screens. And all this doesnt even touch on other crucial factors like prices and discounts. No bookshop would agree to rent out space if there is nothing much for them.        
	The solution to all this would be is advertising, as is done for audiocassettes. But this has limits in markets like ours. There arent enough journals and magazines where such materials, meant for the top end of the market, can be advertized. Newspapers and popular magazines will not entice the right customer. Direct selling to institutions would be the other option, but it is always more expensive with no guarantee of returns.        
	Finally, how much of the digitized material will be available in regional languages? Google now offers its search results in major Indian languages. So we can presume that practically everything will be available in all regional languages with time. The biggest hurdle to accepting digitization into the knowledge industry is our mindsets. It wont be easy for those, brought up on the printed word, to make the jump to the digital world.

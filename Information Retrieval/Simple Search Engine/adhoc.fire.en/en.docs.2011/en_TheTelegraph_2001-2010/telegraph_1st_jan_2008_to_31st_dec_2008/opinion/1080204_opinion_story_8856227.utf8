                                                                                                                                    GREY MEN
                          
	The Reserve Bank of India has so little to concern itself with, and so many words to spread out its concern over, that its pronouncements invite a big yawn. Last weeks policy statement was outstanding in this prolix tradition. In a week that saw the biggest collapse in the stock exchanges recent history, the governor of the RBI was unmoved and inactive. His American counterpart had reduced his bank rate by an extraordinary 75 basis points; Indian industry has for some months showed clear signs of a slowdown. But none of this stirred Y. Venugopal Reddy. He has only a few months left before he retires. His long innings will be remembered for too little action taken too late and justified in too many words.
    
	The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, M. Damodaran, on the other hand, is a man of few but well-chosen words. He inherited a big office that excelled in red tape; at least one of his board members had specialized in handing out condign punishment, explained in long and obscure judgments, to firms whose crime was most doubtful. Damodaran tried to bring fresh blood into Sebi. He tried to recruit management graduates; most did not stay long, for international banks offer them salaries many times greater, but still it was a good try. Under the RBIs pressure he banned participatory notes; but he also tried to develop domestic derivatives markets. He saw the ways in which Sebis regulations had made raising money in the Indian capital market unattractive and tried to ameliorate some, although he did nothing to remove the rationing of public issues and the attendant underpricing which makes them unattractive. Above all, he was learning, and he was prepared to act. Just when he was getting on top of his job, his term came to an end, and he announced that he was not interested in extension.
    
	Men can seldom outgrow the institutions they head; these two mens underperformance was not entirely their own. But the two came out of a fishpond that the Central government confines itself to when it goes fishing for chairmen of regulatory bodies  the pool of old bureaucrats, retired or close to retirement. Both headed institutions that call for considerable knowledge of the relevant industry. Lack of knowledge leads to timidity and unwillingness to act; despite the difference in their innate ability, both men showed signs of both weaknesses. They were ultimately the choice of the prime minister. He himself is innately cautious, and tends to choose people of his kind. But for once he should go out of his inner circle and look for people with experience of the financial industry. He is said to have approved of the report of the Percy Mistry committee, which envisages the emergence of India as a financial superpower. It will never do so as long as its regulators are grey men from Delhi.

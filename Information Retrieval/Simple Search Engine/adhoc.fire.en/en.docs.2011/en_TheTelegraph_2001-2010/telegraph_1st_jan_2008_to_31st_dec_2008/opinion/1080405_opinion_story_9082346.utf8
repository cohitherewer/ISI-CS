	Got the message?                  
	Sir  I cannot agree with the findings of researchers at Indiana University about mens response to love signals sent out by women (Feeling flirty? Spare the men, March 31). The conclusion that men mostly misinterpret the sexual signals cannot be taken to be universally applicable. A flutter of eyelashes or a coy smile is never lost on the Indian male. Indian literature is replete with stories in which girls impress boys with the hint of a smile or a meaningful glance. In the real world too, only the very foolish among males would miss such signals from the fairer sex.           
	Yours faithfully,         S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 
                  
	Unheroic death          
	Sir  The circumstances leading to the murder of Delhis high profile encounter specialist, Rajbir Singh, assistant commissioner of police, expose the unholy nexus between law-keepers and law-breakers (Boycott of tainted officers funeral, March 26). After all, the lust for wealth afflicts not merely criminals. While Singh is credited with the gunning down of many offenders, it is obvious that he had had dealings with the underworld as well. If the top cops of India are so tainted, how can the people of this country ever hope to get justice? The government needs to set up a high-level committee that will expose corrupt police officials who misuse their power to mint money.           
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi             
	Sir  Rajbir Singhs sins caught up with him when he got killed by Vijay Bhardwaj. In most cases, those who make money in dishonest ways despite the respectability their profession accords them can never enjoy the wealth they accumulate. Singh too suffered this fate at the hands of Bhardwaj, who has confessed to the crime.           
	Yours faithfully

	Sir  The murder of ACP Rajbir Singh raises many questions about the Delhi police. Simply boycotting his funeral does not make saints of police personnel. Most of them are, in all probability, as dishonest as Singh turned out to be. The media had made a hero of Singh by documenting the way he brought down one feared criminal after another. Now that Singhs darker side has been revealed, the media are agog with stories of fake encounters staged by him. Till the time Singh was in the limelight, the crimes he committed were overshadowed by his powerful persona. Consequently, he never got punished for the misdeeds that are surfacing after his death.           
	There are many honest police officers in India who are shy of media attention. As a result, they do not get credit for their work in this media-ruled world. Only media savvy encounter specialists like Singh walk away with the honours. The media should take a lesson from Singhs fall from grace and try to highlight the deeds of the unsung heroes.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Many in Salt Lake may have noticed that some unscrupulous gas dealers are asking for bribes from customers if they want to have the cylinder delivered within a fortnight of booking. My neighbour actually paid the bribe that was asked for, but he then found that someone who had outbid him had received the cylinder. I, like my neighbour, have been waiting for a cylinder for the past ten days but the dealer says it may take up to 20 days. I suppose this is how the bid is opened. Is it not the responsibility of the companies supplying gas to see that cylinders are delivered on time without harassment?          
	Yours faithfully,         S. Chowdhury, Calcutta

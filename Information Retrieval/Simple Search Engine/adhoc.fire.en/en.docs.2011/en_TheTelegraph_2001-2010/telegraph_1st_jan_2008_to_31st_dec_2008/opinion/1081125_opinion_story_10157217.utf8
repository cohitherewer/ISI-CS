	Yesterdays darling is suddenly todays villain. Such are the vagaries of Indian cricket. M.S. Dhoni took over as Indias cricket captain with great expectations from the spectators and the selectors. He has already fulfilled some of those expectations with a run of victories in both the one-day and the five-day varieties. But on Thursday, at what had initially appeared to be a routine meeting of the selection committee, there was, according to reports, a major set to between the captain and members of the selection committee. The issue was the exclusion of R.P. Singh. The selectors unanimously wanted Mr Singh to be dropped because of non-performance. Mr Dhoni, the captain, would have none of that. He wanted Mr Singh to be included, even though the reasons for his insistence are not clear. The confrontation came to such a pass that at one point  again according to reports  Mr Dhoni told the selectors that they should look for another captain. This encounter seems somewhat bizarre since the convention is that the captain, normally, gets the team he asks for. The word normally is important since it assumes that the skipper will not make unreasonable demands. (In Indian cricket, even unreasonable demands by captains have been conceded to by the selection committee, provided the captain wielded enough clout, as Sunil Gavaskar once did.) Mr Singh, whatever may be his talents, is very obviously out of form, and the selectors were probably not entirely unjustified in suggesting that he should go back to domestic cricket and regain his touch. The selectors should stand firm and not allow Mr Dhoni to become a monster who gets his way by throwing tantrums.        
	Mr Dhonis other grouse is that the proceedings of the meeting of the selection committee were leaked to the press. He considered this to be rather humiliating. Again, it is very difficult to comprehend Mr Dhonis attitude. Why should the process of selecting the Indian cricket team be treated like a state secret? Cricket is Indias most popular sport: public money and public interest are both heavily involved in the game. For this reason alone, the selection of the Indian team should be transparent. Mr Dhoni had the opportunity during the meeting to rationally explain his position. If after that he failed to win his point, he should have accepted his defeat like a man. Instead, he threw out a threat. This displays a certain immaturity on the part of Mr Dhoni. He has the impetuosity of youth: the strength of this is apparent when Mr Dhoni bats or when he is on a winning streak as a captain. But he needs to curb it when the swing of the ball is against him. It will make him a better batsman and a better captain.        
	The underlying message of this episode is that the Indian cricket team needs a strong coach like Greg Chappell who has no time for stars or monsters.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ROOT OF ALL EVIL                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	India is a land of sharp contrasts  a failed state where governance has become just another means of holding onto office; a vibrant and energetic social and economic mobility lost in the anarchy of inferior infrastructure; a broken-down machine unable to administer justice, law and order, along with a civil service that has become impotent, offensive and incapable of enforcing the rule of law, as it either kowtows to its political authority or tries to sabotage it.        
	The frontpages of the dailies bring this alarming reality into the privacy of our homes. Corruption is widespread in the highest quarters, blatant in word and despicable in action. There is an amorality that affects the citizenry when it sees a member of the council of ministers running amok and getting away with dreadful misdemeanours all because a government desperately wants an irrational coalition to carry on.        
	Ministers must be dismissed from office till proven not guilty, regardless of whether they are partners in government and the dismissal could herald the demise of the United Progressive Alliance government. They must be compelled to abide by the rules that they make for us and prevented from breaking them with impunity. The government merrily accuses citizens of all manner of alleged deviations and harasses them till they either drop dead or prove themselves to be guiltless. Therefore the officials, too, need to be put through the same process. Hypocrisy runs riot amongst the ruling class. This is why India has been overwhelmed by this disease that no doctor is willing to address and cure. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam will coalesce with anyone if it can sit in cabinet in Delhi and hold the potentially lucrative ministries. Thats the sad truth. Equally, conniving and inept bureaucrats must be either put to pastures or transferred back to work with the poorest of the poor, and made accountable.                 
	Games people play        
	Scurrying for cover with every revelation of corrupt practices does not augur well for the top leaders of this nation. Prime ministers, ministers, chief ministers, all diminish in stature in the eyes of the larger voting public.The dignity of their chair and office gets diluted for them. They cease to be respected as the awe disappears. The trickle-down effect has worked in such a way that the public sees no wrong in breaking the law consciously because their leaders are doing it all the time. The driver of a three-wheeler once asked for a ridiculous amount to take me, during a transport strike, from the railway station to my home. I retorted with irritation saying that I belonged to the city, knew where I was going and was clearly not a tourist. His response was apt: Maam, first fight a crusade against our leaders who eat up crores illegally and then tell me not to charge a hundred rupees more than the true rate. He was dead right and I was the silly prima donna.        
	We are an ingenious people. We know how to tamper with computerized billing at the source, how to grease the palms of the administration, and we have learned well how to survive in a land of artificial shortages that are enhanced by those who rule. Will anyone take cognisance of these realities? Will anyone enforce the rules in the book? Will any leader put his or her head on the block and pledge to stop playing the balancing act to condone corruption in the highest places only to stay in power? The simple answer is No. That would rock the status quo along with the many small private dinghies, clawing parasites, anchored in the protected bay. Political blackmail seems to be the name of the coalition game. Without the dignity of purpose and the sanctity of the oath of office, these people continue to exploit and hold to ransom the patience and the lives of over a billion human beings.

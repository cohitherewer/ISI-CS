   YEAR THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
   A look at 2007, or rather, a doctored version of it
        
	Shilpa Shetty was expelled from the sets of Big Brother after a Google Earth satellite picture taken in the bathroom revealed her to be Amitabh Bachchan in drag. Bachchan said he was under the impression that he was shooting for a chocolate ad. 
 
	 Pratibha Patil became the 12th president of India, and the first ever head of state to be able to communicate with the dead. There is, however, no truth in the rumour that she is being considered for the post of the Defence of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts after last incumbent Amycus Carrow was returned to Azkaban. 
 
	 The first-ever Indian Idle contest was won by Rahul Dravid, who took 41 balls to get off the mark at MCG. 
 
	 Plans were announced for a film version of the world rsquo;s first novel, Lady Murasaki rsquo;s The Tale of Genji, with Ashok Todi in the lead role.
 
	 Encouraged by the record-breaking sale of candles in 2007, the Candle-makers rsquo; Association of Calcutta (fondly called lsquo;CaCu rsquo;) announced an sms-poll to find the five most protest-worthy issues. 
 
	 Taslima Nasreen won the Nobel Prize (for literature, silly!). Humanity witnessed the most garish baluchari sari in the world, the Nobel jury had fatwas pronounced on them, ten copies of the unexpunged Dwikhandita were auctioned and the proceeds distributed to an unnamed Calcutta charity run by one Idris Ali. But Taslima disappointed Calcutta by taking up residence in Delhi rsquo;s Chittaranjan Park and commenting that the enclave has more buddhijibis than the whole of Calcutta.
 
	 India met Pakistan in the final of the first Twenty20 World Cup. Misbah-ul-Haq hit Joginder Sharma for a six in the last over to win the match for Pakistan, reminding people of Chetan Sharma and Javed Miandad in Sharjah. Speculation was rife that no ldquo;Sharma rdquo; would get into an Indian ODI squad ever again. Fearing for their safety, the Indian cricketers changed their hairstyles before returning, under the guidance of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Sehwag and coach Lalchand Rajput, however, had to be left out of the styling session on account of their baldness. 
 
	 Following the World Cup exit and T-20 loss, Jhulan Goswami was made coach of India rsquo;s cricket team (for men). Goswami called for a camp in Calcutta, where the main exercise involved catching the 9.15 AM Ranaghat local into the city.
 
	 Putting an end to months of speculation, the Bachchan family announced that Abhishek Bachchan was not getting married to Aishwarya Rai. Rai, in the meantime, has been caught up in the annulment of her marriage to a tree. Environmental activists are demanding that heavy maintenance be paid. 
 
	 Nicolas Sarkozy was elected president of France, and took oath to keep the nation entertained. He and his wife Cecilia celebrated their marriage anniversary at the Paris Disneyland, where, ignoring security warnings, the president rescued a young woman from a tilt-a-whirl which had developed a technical snag. It was later revealed that the woman was none other than the supermodel-singer, Carla Bruni.
 
	 The Calcutta zoo launched an innovative project of putting volunteers inside a cage for animals to look at. The first volunteers were Kusum Das and Rumpa Das, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, who spent a day inside a cage within the chimpanzees rsquo; enclosure. The chimps tried to strike up a conversation, but the Dases were too scared and not the least bit friendly. Babu, a young male chimp, was noticed urinating and catching it in his mouth. According to primatologist Jane Goodall, this is a sure sign of boredom among chimps.
 
	 Expressing his anguish over Nandigram, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said: ldquo;My commiserations with the next of kin of those incapacitated in the calamitous misadventures in Nandigram. What goes around, comes around mdash; such is the rotund disposition of world. Each of the perpetrators of atrocities will be paid back in his own coin. rdquo; It is learnt that when the CM was in school, they taught English at the primary levels.
 
	 The Monster.com ldquo;stuck-in-the-wrong-job rdquo; award went to the police bosses of Calcutta. The right job for them, Monster.com suggested, would have been marriage counselling.

	Old order changes                  
	Sir  Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his young team have done a commendable job in winning the ODI series against Sri Lanka (India bag series, Aug 28). It must be borne in mind that India won in Sri Lanka in the absence of senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and the dashing Virender Sehwag. This is proof enough that the present Indian team has been shaping up well under its able captains guidance and that the boys can win tournaments without experienced campaigners to guide them.           
	But it is not as if Dhonis team is free of problems. The teams middle order often shows signs of brittleness, and, like the West Indies, fails to put up big scores on the board on a number of occasions. This happened in the first and last match in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. This is certainly an area of concern and Dhoni along with the coach, Gary Kirsten, needs to look at it closely. Dhoni, his immense talents notwithstanding, must also continue to hone his leadership skills so that he can serve the team well in the future.           
	After the Indian teams performance in one-day internationals in the island nation, there can be no doubt about the fact that this indeed is the side for the future. While the Test side, led by the seniors, floundered against the spin magic of Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis, Dhonis young guns blunted the spin threat to beat the Lankans in their own den. The national selectors should therefore look to draft in as many young players as possible, not only in the Twenty20 squad but also in the ODI and Test teams. They have no reason to keep an ailing Tendulkar in contention in the hope that he will break new records. Tendulkars selection to the national side must be based on merit rather than on sentiments. This holds true for the other ageing stars like Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly. There is no doubt that the Big Five have contributed immensely to the cause of Indian cricket. But they should now be told that the time has come to retire. In fact, the decision to bid adieu to the game must come not from the selectors but from the senior players themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa 

                
	Sir  The Indian ODI captain, M.S. Dhoni, cannot be faulted forreposing full faith in his young turks. The entire nation was witness to the dismal performance of senior players in the Test matches in Sri Lanka. There is no doubt about the fact that the likes of Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and so on are now ready to step into the seniors shoes. The Board of Control for Cricket in India should find ways to politely remind the senior players to exit the game.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  India may have beaten Sri Lanka in the one-dayers, but it was certainly a close shave. The Indian team went into the last game knowing that they had already won the series. Their dismal performance shows that the players were not serious about winning the last game. What other factor can explain Indias failure to chase down a modest target of 216 runs in their alloted 44 overs? Despite the series win, there are a few chinks in the Indian armour that need to be filled. For instance, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir were woefully short of runs. Singh, inexplicably, has been appointed the vice-captain. Was this done to prevent him from getting dropped? When will we stop pampering stars and select teams only on the basis of performance?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  Youngsters may have scripted Indias success in Sri Lanka, but this does not signal the end of the road for old fogies like Sachin Tendulkar. His godfathers in Mumbai will ensure that he is still around to break Brian Laras record of being the highest scorer in Test cricket. What is unfortunate is that Tendulkar too seems to be playing for the record only. When he retires, his departure will not be termed as glorious but as a good riddance.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Still on top          
	Sir  The king of pop turned 50 recently (Once a superstar, Jackson turns 50, Aug 30). I wish The Telegraph had given more prominence to this bit of news. The man, after all, is one of the most important musical icons of his time. His versatile genius has helped him win accolades from his fans all over the world. Not only is he a successful artiste, Jackson has also been a major musical inspiration for performers across genres. He also supports numerous charities on a global scale.           
	However, Jackson has also paid heavily for his fame and fortune. In November 2003, the singer went to trial for his alleged molestation of an underage adult male. Jackson had pleaded not guilty, and two years later, his innocence was established when the jury ruled in his favour in the dispute. What is most admirable about Jackson is his indomitable strength, resilience and integrity with which he continues to face his detractors who harass him by publishing distorted facts. Surely people will stand to gain by emulating this wonderfully gifted, but humble, man.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is not often that one gets to meet a good Samaritan in real life. Imagine my surprise when I met one the other day. Rabin Adhikary, a rickshawpuller, found my wallet after I had left it on the seat of his vehicle. Unsure whether the wallet would be returned if he deposited it at the local thana, he handed it over to someone he trusted, who returned it to me the same day. Needless to say, the contents of the wallet had not been touched, although Adhikary is a poor man. If only we had more people like Adhikary, the world would have certainly been a better place.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Upal Mukherjee, Calcutta

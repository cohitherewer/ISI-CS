	The leadership of the Congress has gone into denial mode after the partys defeat in Karnataka. There has not been a meaningful response from any responsible Congress leader. This, despite the fact that any electoral defeat carries with it a moral responsibility that goes beyond an inner party post-mortem. It is very clear that electoral successes have deserted the Congress. Today, there is hardly any state where the Congress can say it will win on its own. Such a situation imposes on the Congress the moral responsibility of seeking a fresh mandate from the people. The Congress cannot continue to lead the United Progressive Alliance on the basis of an electoral mandate that is becoming brittle with every passing day. It can also no longer depend on the Left which has, in the name of providing support, sabotaged every important policy initiative taken by the prime minister and his colleagues. The only honourable alternative before the Congress is to go to the people. The Congress should call for early elections, and time them so that the voting takes place before the year is out.        
	Elections in the autumn also make political sense. By that time, the steps taken by the government to control inflation would have taken effect. Moreover, the predicted good monsoon would have brought food grain prices down. It would be the best time to ask the people for their votes. One major achievement is needed to make it the talking point of an election campaign. The UPA, if truth be told, has no such achievement, on any front. Manmohan Singh should sign the Indo-US nuclear deal, face the withdrawal of Left support and call for elections. This way, there will at least be one achievement to talk about even though the Indo-US nuclear deal is not a vote-catcher. But something is better than nothing, and beggars cannot be choosers. Even if the Congress calls elections at a time of its own choosing, it can only mount a very weak campaign under the given circumstances. The Indo-US deal can provide the Congress with one calling card.        
	There is one more thing to consider. In many democracies, incumbent governments are seeking re-election as they near the end of four years instead of waiting for the full five years. There is no reason why this should not happen in India. The Congress may well discover that the longer it waits to go to the polls the more calumny it will gather.

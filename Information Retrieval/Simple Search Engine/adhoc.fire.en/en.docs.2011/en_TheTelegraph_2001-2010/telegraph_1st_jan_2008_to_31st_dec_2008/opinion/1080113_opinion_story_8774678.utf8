                                                                                                                                    A NEW GRESHAMS LAW
                             
	Bad money drives out good money: thus reads one of the laws of economics, named after Gresham. A similar law needs to be propounded for the activities of very important people in Calcutta and West Bengal. That law should read bad principles drive out good principles. The good principle states that it is proper and human to show sympathy and concern for people who are in difficulties or are the victims of some calamity. The bad principle asserts that it is necessary to be seen showing the concern and the sympathy. Ironically, the man in the West Bengal government who knows the most about Greshams Law, the economist-turned-finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, is also the best illustration of the second, slightly altered, law being proposed here. Followers of Mr Dasguptas remarkable career will remember how, at one time, driven by the chaotic state of Calcuttas traffic, he himself assumed the role of a traffic policeman. He could be seen at important traffic junctions directing the flow of traffic. It was a funny, if touching, sight, to see the states finance minister in the guise of a traffic cop. Mr Dasguptas intentions were noble, but surely it was not his appointed duty in life or in government to manage traffic on Calcutta streets. Fortunately, Mr Dasguptas enthusiasm for managing traffic evaporated after a few days.
    
	It would be unfair to single out Mr Dasgupta as the only person who illustrates the new law. The law has many followers, as can be seen from the number of important and well-meaning people who throng to any place where a disaster has occurred. Witness the fire in Burrabazar yesterday. The governor, the finance minister (of course) and Mamata Banerjee (no surprises there either) and other dignitaries went to see the devastation caused by the raging fire. There can be no doubting the intentions and the concern of these people, but it is possible that their visits hindered the work of quelling the fire or at least distracted officials from doing what was, at that moment, their most important duty. A broader societal manifestation of the same tendency is visible in the number of relatives, friends and acquaintances who form a crowd in a hospital when a dear one is critically ill. Their visits serve no purpose, but they cause inconvenience to the immediate family, to the hospital staff and sometimes even to patients. The famous injunction, they also serve who stand and wait, is not something that most Bengalis  or most Indians  quite appreciate.
    
	There are some signs that this tendency might change. There is a new hospital in Calcutta set up by the cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty that strictly enforces the number of persons who can see a cardiac patient. The word strictly is deliberately underlined. In other hospitals such rules exist but are honoured only in the breach. What is important is that proper behaviour in a hospital or during a disaster can never be dictated by rules and protocol. There has to be an enlightened awareness that weighs the pros and cons between the show of concern and propriety.

	 Even in the nations finest moment, petty politics did not take a backseat. Upon Abhinav Bindras return home with gold from Beijing, the shooter was taken, en famille, for the mandatory photo-ops with the president, prime minister, and of course, the Congress president. They were accompanied by no less than the sports minister himself. After the meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Father Bindra is supposed to have requested MS Gill to arrange for a meeting with the leader of the Opposition as well. The minister is said to have refused it point-blank, saying he could not, and would not, do so. Though surprised by the ministers response, Bindra Sr thought it fair to level the political score and used his own resources to fix an appointment with LK Advani. A day later, the gold-winner, along with his parents, met Advani. No photographs appeared in print the next day.               
	 Guess who has been at the receiving end of Advanijis benevolence recently. None other than MF Husain, whose paintings of nude Indian goddesses made Advani and his parivar-members see red some time back. Husain is reportedly desperate to get back to India, having had his fill of Dubai and London. He is known to have enlisted the help of a youngster who has Advanis ear. Advani, it seems, has not made up his mind yet, but a section of the BJP think-tank feels that a pro-Husain stance could help him project a liberal face. And this time, no one can say that he has upset the sangh hardliners. Because, in Jammu, RSS chief KS Sudarshan has just got some Muslim men to flag off one of the yatras to Amarnath.                      
	 There could not be a better study in contrasts. The Madhya Pradesh polls are less than three months away and the principal parties  the Congress and the BJP  have gotten busy, though in rather different ways. Each week, one or the other BJP bigwig, be it Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj or Rajnath Singh, visits Bhopal to take stock of the preparations. And almost every week, one from the state Congress leadership flies out of Bhopal to Delhi. Once there, he patiently waits for some direction from Rahul Gandhi or other high-profile AICC netas. Not unexpectedly, wary Congressmen in the state are apprehensive that their remarkable poll preparedness will show in the results too.                            
	 Surprise, followed by more surprise. The Rashtriya Lok Dal leader, Ajit Singh, raised many eyebrows when he cocked a snook at the Congress and joined hands with Mayavati on the eve of the trust vote. On the floor, the three RLD MPs duly voted against the government. Now the Jat leader is said to be under tremendous pressure from his constituents who want no truck with the Dalit-dominated BSP. Singh is now considering allying with the BJP. The latter seems willing, and a marriage might be on the cards.                      
	 At home, India is very different from what it is in the world. However ham-handed the management of domestic affairs, there is little trace of it in international fora. It was Indias forthright defence of the interests of the developing countries in the face of American blackmail that choked the Doha talks of the WTO. An unsually prescient Pascal Lamy, WTO director, was naturally in Delhi soon after to meet the PM and industry heads to convince India of the need to break the impasse. He suggested that both India and the US try to understand each other at a political level since agriculture subsidy and the related issues were political first, then technical. He signed off with a plea that both should look carefully at whats on the table. Kamal Nath, Union trade minister and Indias man in Doha, promptly shot back, There is a lot on the table. But what is on the table is not on my plate. It should be on everybodys plate.                      
	 Talking of plates, there was not much on anyones at the lunch hosted for journos by Veerappa Moily, chairman of the AICCs media department. To top it all, the weather was horrible, and Rahul Gandhi did not show up. When parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi hosted a dinner, his aides promised a better menu and venue. On offer was Fish Moily, which caught everyones eye, tasted great and lasted long, even after the newsmen went for generous helpings. In Congress circles, Moily and Ravi are not seen to get along very well. The choice of Fish Moily left the scribes wondering if Ravi was trying to get back at his detractor.

	 The queen of oomph, Rakhi Sawant, has decided to rise above her hemline and meet the occasion. After an ugly spat at the birthday party of a rising star, as reported in this column, actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan have fallen out, and are now refusing to reconcile. But when the hot Rakhi has sworn to bring them together, it is likely that the ice will melt sooner rather than later. Her POA is to call on them individually, give a little pep talk perhaps to help them patch up. Being a very grounded person, Rakhi is, of course, aware of the challenge confronting her. After all, they both are fierce. One is a tiger, the other is a cheetah, and yet another (Khan) is a lion. But she is hopeful because they are all number one in the industry, so today or tomorrow they will be friends. Her maths may be weak (three stars No. 1 at the same time!), but at least, her intentions are noble.

                 GWYNNE DYER
               
	More than two years ago, when Kenyas current opposition leader, Raila Odinga, quit President Mwai Kibakis government, I wrote the following: The trick will be to get Kibaki out without triggering a wave of violence that would do the country grave and permanent damage...Bad times are coming to Kenya.
    
	The bad times have arrived, but the violence that has swept Kenya, since the stolen election on December 27, is not just African tribalism. Kikuyus have been the main target of popular wrath and non-Kikuyu protesters have been the principal victims of the security forces, but this confrontation is about trust betrayed, hopes dashed, and patience strained to the breaking point.
    
	Nobody wants a civil war in Kenya, but its easy to see why Odinga rejects calls from abroad to accept the figures for the national vote that were announced recently. If Odinga enters a government of national unity under Kibaki, as the African Union and the United States of America want, then he is back in the untenable situation that he was in until 2005, and Kibaki will run Kenya for another five years.
    
	If Odinga leaves it to Kenyas courts to settle, the result will be the same: there have been no verdicts yet on disputed results that went to the courts after the 2002 election. So when the opposition leader was asked by the BBC if he would urge his supporters to calm down, he replied: I refuse to be asked to give the Kenyan people an anaesthetic so that they can be raped.
    
	Despite the ugly scenes of recent days, Kenya is not an ethnic tinderbox where people back their own tribe and hate everyone else. For example, it is clear that more than half the people who voted Kibaki into the presidency in the 2002 election were not of his own Kikuyu tribe, because the Kikuyu, although they are the biggest tribe, only account for 22 per cent of the population.
        
	Emotional appeal
    
	Kibakis appeal was the promise of honest government after 24 years of oppressive rule, rigged elections and massive corruption under the former president, Daniel arap Moi. His victory was seen as the dawn of a new Kenya where the bad old ways no longer reigned. It is his abuse of their high hopes that makes the current situation so emotional.
    
	Most of the leading reformers quit Kibakis government in 2005, and in the weeks before last months election their main political vehicle, the Orange Democratic Movement, had a clear lead in the polls. That lead was confirmed in the parliamentary vote on December 27, which saw half of Kibakis cabinet ministers lose their seats and gave the opposition a clear majority in parliament. But the presidential vote was another matter.
    
	Raila Odinga won an easy majority in six of Kenyas eight provinces, but in Central, the Kikuyu heartland, the results were withheld until long after the vote had been announced for the more remote regions. Observers were banned from the counting stations in Central and the central tallying room in Nairobi  and on December 30, Samuel Kivuitu, the chairman of the electoral commission, declared that Kibaki had won the national vote by just 232,000 votes in a nation of 34 million. 
    
	It stank to high heaven. Ridiculously high turnouts were claimed for polling stations in Central and 97.3 per cent of the votes there allegedly went to Kibaki. It was an operation planned to return Kibaki to office while keeping a facade of democratic credibility, and local people were not fooled.
    
	But Kibaki is digging in, and innocent Kikuyus  many of whom did not vote for Kibaki  are being attacked by people from other tribes. Meanwhile, the police and the army obey Kibakis orders and attack non-Kikuyu protesters. It is not Odinga who needs to accept the result in order to save Kenya from calamity; it is Kibaki who needs to step down.

	The latest Bushism is that it is bad to talk to terrorists. It was made in Jerusalem to the members of the Knesset (one of the worlds great democratic assemblies) in celebration of Israels 60th anniversary. Moreover, George W. Bush compared negotiations with terrorists to trying to talk to Hitler (the false comfort of appeasement). After his Knesset speech, Mr Bush made a few other stops, and speeches, in west Asia. In Egypt, he used the World Economic Forum to urge the Arab states to promote freedom at home and resist Irans nuclear aspirations, so that the light of liberty may shine brighter. He also reiterated his commitment to achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This last add-on was presumably a response to the intense criticism that his remarks on talking to the terrorists have sparked off in the region.        
	Nobody who has been listening to the American president, and watching his ways with the light of liberty since Afghanistan, is likely to be surprised by the Knesset speech. Mr Bush is being wonderfully consistent, matching word to deed. But responses to this particular point made in the speech have been twofold: in and around west Asia, and back in Mr Bushs own country. And the presidents words were definitely double-edged. Even while he was talking to Israel, he was also talking at Barack Obama. Mr Obama had once declared that he saw no harm in negotiating with the heads of Iran and Syria. So the Democrats see Mr Bush as having done something that is considered to be in bad form  use a foreign audience to make a point about a domestic matter. Mr Obama has also taken this opportunity to clarify his stand on Iran. This has resulted in the significant statement that he does agree with Mr Bush, on the deludedness of talking to terrorists, when it comes to an organization like Hamas. Mr Obama has also pointed out how Mr Bushs speech could have helped the Republican White House candidate, John McCain. This makes the speech doubly unethical. Both the Palestinians, for whom too this is an anniversary of sorts, and the Egyptians are unhappy with the Knesset speech. The former prefer American neutrality to intervention in talks with Israel, while the latter feel interfered with in their Palestinian negotiations. Hence, as Bushisms go, this one has been taken rather more seriously by the world.

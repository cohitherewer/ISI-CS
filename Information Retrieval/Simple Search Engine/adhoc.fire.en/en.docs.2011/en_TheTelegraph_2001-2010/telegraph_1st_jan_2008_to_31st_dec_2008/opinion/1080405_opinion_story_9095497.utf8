	The undeclared worldwide war between the upholders of freedom of opinion and those of religious sanctity has warmed up on the European front. Two years ago, a Danish cartoonist depicted Prophet Mohammad wearing bombs in his turban. It was a deliberate insult, designed to hurt Muslim sensibilities: Sunnis, who form the preponderant majority in the community, even disapprove of pictures of their messiah. They were understandably offended. And to put bombs, which were non-existent in those times, in the prophets turban added to the offence. Muslims protested vociferously. Undaunted by the protests, the cartoon was reproduced in Dutch and German papers  all in the name of the right to freedom of expression. Recently, a Dutch film producer has made a film entitled Fitna (Arabic for evil), based on extracts from the Quran, to prove that the holy book preaches fascist intolerance towards non-believers and sanctions punishments like beheading, stoning to death and cutting off the hands of offenders. He intends to put his film on the internet  all in the name of the right to freedom of expression. The governments of Denmark, Holland and Germany are in a quandary: if they ban the film, they will be censured by their own citizens; if they do not, they will cause resentment throughout the Muslim world. Danish products have already been removed from markets in Middle-Eastern countries.        
	There are large number of Muslims in Europe (and in the US). They come from different countries. In France, they are largely Moroccans and Algerians: in Germany, they are Turkish; in England and Scandinavia they are Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. They speak different languages. Their common meeting places are mosques, which now exist in all large cities, where they assemble for Friday prayers. Their only common link is adherence to their faith, Islam.        
	Does the right to freedom of expression extend to deliberately hurting others religious susceptibilities? Are followers of different religions justified in taking offence at the slightest criticism of their belief? I think it is a legitimate subject for civilized debate, but in no case should it extend to fisticuffs or other forms of violence.        
	Little time, much to do        
	Patience is considered a virtue, impatience a minor vice. People are born in one category or the other. It is a rare individual who, if born to bear things with equanimity and take things patiently, can cultivate a temperament which compels him to get going in a hurry. Similarly, it is seldom that a temperamentally impatient person teach himself to wait and watch without getting upset. Those traits are not gender-based  both men and women belong to either of these categories. In my school days, we used to recite a doggerel with multiple variations. One went as follows:        
	Patience is a virtue         
	Find it if you can        
	Seldom in a woman        
	Never in a man.        
	However, if a girl recited it, she changed the last two lines to: Always in a woman/ Never in a man. If the reciter was a boy, he turned it round to: Never in a woman/ Always in a man                
	I was born impatient. My wife rubbed it on by often calling me bay-sabra or Kahla (impatient) Singh. It holds true in my old age. No sooner do I get up in the early hours of the morning, I start fretting about what I will eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner; what I must get through in my reading and scribbling; who I will see in the evening and who I will avoid. If my expected visitors are more than five minutes late, I start getting irritated and am often rude to them when they arrive.        
	Obsession with punctuality is an outcome of impatience. Patient people take their own sweet time to do things. They are usually late in arriving at parties; this adds to their importance. While the punctuals are fuming and fretting, the patient gets away with a cursory Sorry to keep you waiting. How are you doing? and then keep smiling throughout the evening. That is why so many of our netas make it a habit of being late for their appointments.        
	I have become a slave to time. I keep a watch in my pocket which I consult every hour or so. In my bedroom I have four clocks, one on every wall. So I have in my sitting room: one wedged between books on shelves, another, an ancient timepiece, on the wall, one on the mantlepiece, and yet another on the window facing the dining table. When I have visitors, I keep glancing at the time-piece and wonder if it is time for them to depart.        
	The patient people are winners down the line. There can be no doubt they make better lovers than the impatient, who are ever-eager to get over with it. Mirza Ghalib put is succinctly: Gashgi Jabr talbi  love demands patience, and Tamanna beytaab  desire is impatient.                
	When it comes to making love, impatience can be a disaster. What to do? Some solace from the poet, George Granville:                 
	Patience is the virtue of an ass,        
	Who trots beneath its burden andcomplains not.

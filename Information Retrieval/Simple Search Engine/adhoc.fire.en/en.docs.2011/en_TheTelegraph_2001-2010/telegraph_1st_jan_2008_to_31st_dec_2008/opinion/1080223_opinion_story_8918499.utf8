                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Through the glasses, darkly                  
	Sir  The picture captioned, Blot on the country, on the frontpage of The Telegraph (Feb 15) well brought out the duplicity of a pseudo-patriotic outfit like the Bajrang Dal. At a time when globalization has pervaded almost all facets of Indian urban life, attacking Valentines Day revellers is hypocritical. Moreover, the Bajrang Dal worker seen hounding the foreigner wears a Western-style denim jacket and dark glasses. Sporting Western clothes himself, what right has he to blacken the face of a foreigner for celebrating Valentines Day?           
	Yours faithfully,         Narayan Das, Calcutta

	Sir  Darjeeling is in trouble again, as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha tries to pressurize the government into removing Subash Ghisingh from his post of administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (Ghisinghs life line cut, Feb 21). From time to time, there continues to be similar flare-ups across India over the demand for separate states for different ethnic and religious groups. Unless the Centre decides to deal firmly with the issue, the country will continue to experience such reactionary backlashes. In Darjeeling, for example, the tension over the claims for the creation of a Gorkhaland has been simmering for a long time. Now members of the GJM want Ghisingh removed because he is content at getting the Sixth Schedule status for the hills instead of having the region recognized as a state.           
	Such protests can be done away with altogether if the Centre makes its stand clear to the hill people. There is a limit to which a country can be divided up as every other community asks for a state of its own. At the same time, if groups have valid reasons to feel disgruntled with the way they are treated, they must be granted a new state.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Tourism has always been a major source of revenue for the people of Darjeeling (Tourists in bandh trouble, Feb 21). Judging by the way things are going, one wonders whether tourism will continue to thrive in the days to come. The political turmoil in the hills is deterring more and more people from going there. A few days ago, when I had to rush to Darjeeling to visit my mother, I found the roads blocked. I learnt that people of one political party had torn off the festoons of another party, and so the latter had stopped all vehicles on the highway. Situations like this have come to be expected.           
	If these disruptions continue for long, then tourists will think twice before planning a trip to Darjeeling. The loser, in such a case, will ultimately be the very people who are protesting so vehemently now. It would do them a lot of good to think carefully over the consequences of their actions.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is that time of the year when students and their parents are worried stiff over the board examinations. As the examinees try to steady their nerves, parents, teachers and examiners should form a support system to help them. The existing educational system in India is taxing enough. Also, the proposal to introduce the system of grades for all board examinations across the country is still pending. But the expectation of parents from their children is scaling frightening heights. Pressure from parents and peers adds to examination stress. I think every Indian parent and member of examination boards should watch a movie like Taare Zameen Par to become more aware of the special needs of growing children. The boards should create help-lines to counsel students during examinations.                    
	Yours faithfully,

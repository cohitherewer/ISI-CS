	Wisdom, foreign and Indian                
	If Better is Possible (Orient, Rs 295) by John Buchanan is a total surprise. It is a readable book by a cricket coach. It also scores high on sense of humour (who would have thought of Buchanan as a funny man?). When he was appointed the coach of the Queensland cricket team in 1994, the fundamental question, apparently, was, Who was this bloke...one of [whose] main claims was that hed scored a duck on just about every ground in Australia? Some of his key messages are worth pondering. One of them is: Do not expect the stars of our community to display all the values, behaviours and attitudes that we would like to have, but are unable to live by ourselves. This ought to ring a bell or two with Indian cricket fans. The Calcutta IPL team is in good hands, it seems.                
	 Intern: A Doctors Initiation (Penguin, Rs 350) by Sandeep Jauhar is an account of the authors internship in a New York hospital  a period he remembers even after a decade, the way soldiers remember war. It is not a novel, but reads like one. Jauhars experience is harrowing, to say the least, amid charges of incompetence and fellow interns crumbling under pressure and quitting. The young doctors trial leads him to question every assumption about medical care. It busts many myths about healthcare in the West. The author should write an equally hard-hitting book about India.                                
	 Leave Disco Dancer Alone (Yoda, Rs 350) by Sudha Rajagopalan might fox you with its title, but the subtitle  Indian cinema and Soviet movie-going after Stalin  comes to the rescue. It is an enriching and interesting book. The authors use of Gramsci and Stanley Fish would have made the book a heavy academic one, but for the accounts of working-class Russians and filmi anecdotes. It is common knowledge now that Raj Kapoor was an important catalyst in the Indo-Soviet friendship, but without Rajagopalans book, how many would know that a Russian had laid down his life trying to get a ticket to Disco Dancer?                        
	 Uncle Sams Nuclear Cabin (LeftWord, Rs 95) by Prabir Purkayastha, Ninan Koshy and M.K. Bhadrakumar is for those who are still trying to figure out what the Lefts opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal is all about. The three leftist scholars argue forcefully, railing against the Nato and the BJP alike. But do they have the power to persuade doubters?

	A newspaper published an article on the manager of an insurance company alleging that employees had levelled charges of misappropriation of funds and corruption of the computer system against him. The man lodged a defamation case against the editor of the newspaper. The Kerala High Court held that the case, under Section 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code (defamation), could not be lodged against the editor because the essential ingredient of the offence of defamation is making and publishing an amputation which is defamatory. The court held that the editor is responsible only for the selection of the news item, which is already made and is also not responsible for publishing the newspaper, which is the job of the publisher, so he cannot be accused of defamation (Mammen Matthews vs M.N. Radhakrishnan).  
	Fatal delay        
	A medical student died after undergoing surgery and the attending surgeon was accused of criminal negligence. The Andhra Pradesh High Court held that the patients death on account of wrong judgement did not give rise to criminal liability in this case. The patient was aware of the gravity of her disease because she was a medical student and she had herself delayed the treatment because she could not arrange funds for the surgery. The court absolved the surgeon of criminal negligence, especially since the patient died despite being given proper medication and care (Katcheria Venkata Sunil vs Vanguri Seshumamba, doctor).                            
	Policing time        
	The police asked for the custody of an accused person when it filed the final report on the case, after completing investigation. It contended that the person may have a connection with the accused persons who are absconding or have knowledge about the hideouts and places where the arms are hidden. Rejecting the contention, the Madras High Court turned down the application. The court held that the application for police custody at this stage should be made strictly in accordance with the law or it shall constitute a breach of a fundamental right (right to life and liberty; Article 21) guaranteed by the Constitution of India (State of Tamil Nadu vs Sundaramoorthy).       SOLON

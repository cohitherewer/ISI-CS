	Mother courage                  
	Sir  Although Bilkis Bano won her fight for justice after six long years, yet the verdict of the Mumbai sessions court, convicting 12 of the suspects and giving life term to 11, is a landmark judgment (Braveheart, Jan 24). It proves again that justice delayed is not necessarily justice denied. But the question now is whether the pending cases of the other victims of the Gujarat riots of 2002 will also be taken up and the guilty punished. The question is especially pertinent in the context of Narendra Modis recent re-election as the chief minister of Gujarat. After his victory, a section of the people of that state can no longer feel safe. Modi seemed to have turned into a caring and competent administrator almost overnight. But the new mask of benevolence cannot hide the face that was behind the Gujarat riots. Moreover, by electing him again, the majority of Gujaratis have also proved their support for the barbarism that was unleashed upon Muslims in the state. In this situation, the onus lies entirely with the judiciary to deliver justice to the victims.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  Bilkis Bano represents the indomitable spirit of Gandhi who, like her, also hailed from Gujarat. It is heroic of her to carry on the legal fight for six years against such odds as the state governments repeated attempts to sweep every misdeed under the carpet, protect the perpetrators and destroy the available evidence. Unfortunately, during these six years, the Central government did nothing to protect Bano against those threatening her in Gujarat and trying to obstruct the path of justice. Now that Bano has won the case, the least the Centre can do is honour her courage with an award.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Kattari Anand Naidu, Chennai

                
	Sir  Every Indian woman should be proud of Bilkis Bano for her perseverance, determination and firm conviction in the judiciary. It was easy for her to break down completely after what she had to go through. But the memory of her daughter, who was butchered in front of her eyes by the Hindu mob, must have egged her on to get justice. Bilkis has proved that people can rise above any adversity if they are strong enough.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ankita Bonidar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After Bilkis Bano, every victim of the 2002 Gujarat pogrom should get justice  only then can the judiciary of the country be said to have performed its duties well. It is also the responsibility of the Union government to intervene and reopen the cases that the Gujarat government had arranged to be closed on the pretext of lack of evidence. The Centre cannot absolve itself of guilt simply by blaming the Narendra Modi government. During the campaign for the Gujarat elections, the sympathy that Sonia Gandhi and her partymen showed towards the riot victims can hardly be called genuine. It was no more than a ploy to win over peoples affection to get their votes. The fact that the courts had to intervene in the Bilkis Bano case and transfer it out of Gujarat is an indictment of the Centre as well. The Central government should above party politics and think of national interests.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiv Nadar Karthik, Chennai

      
	Sir  After all the jubilations among the followers of Narendra Modi for his success in the elections, it is perhaps time for them to feel afraid. With Bilkis Bano getting justice, Modis past might just catch up with him.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta

                
	Card tricks          
	Sir  I am a senior citizen having a savings account with HDFC bank, Gol Park branch. I noticed that on December 11, 2007, Rs 29,000 had been withdrawn from my account online by some mobile refill company unknown to me. I rushed to the bank, lodged my written complaint and the bank officials admitted that some accounts are indeed being hacked. The lost amount was returned to me. But on December 24, another Rs 5,000 was drawn from my account. This time, the bank returned Rs 425 and gave me the phone number of the hacker. Who is accountable if somebody breaks into a bank locker? Will the bank give the name and address of the thief and ask the client to follow up? Hacking is just a sophisticated way of stealing. Having allowed netbanking, the bank is responsible for protecting the money left in its custody.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Nandita Ghosh, Calcutta

      
	Sir  It is amazing how banks manage to invent means of duping their credit card customers. They deliberately send credit card statements late and then force people to cough up late fees. I am the holder of four credit cards for the last 14 years, three of them Citibanks. For the last couple of years, Citibank has invented a unique way of penalizing me on and off for late payments even when the cheques are dropped on due dates. The bank argues that I need to deposit the cheque at least three to four days in advance to allow for the inter-bank clearance period. For the last two years I have sent emails to the banks customer-care division whenever I was penalized under similar circumstances. Every time the bank has expressed surprise at such unforeseen occurrence. However, the harassment continues in spite of the repeated promises to rectify the system.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan K. Sarkar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Recently, when I tried to withdraw money from my savings account with the United Bank of India using one of its ATMs, the machine declared the process cancelled. However, by that time, I had already entered the amount I wanted to draw. The next day, when I visited the ATM again, I found that the amount had been deducted from my account. I quickly visited the head office of the bank and registered a complaint. The bank acknowledged its mistake but said that the amount will be credited only after a week. I was in dire need of money at that time. I feel angry that I was made to pay for a mistake I did not commit.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarojini Basu, Calcutta

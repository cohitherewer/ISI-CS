	It has become fashionable among Indian artists to prove that their heart bleeds for the environment. Artists in the West have done so for a long time, so can Indian artists be far behind? Chandra Bhattacharjee is a figurative artist and, like most artists trained in Calcutta, his figure drawings are competent. Bhattacharjee is a popular artist and it is understandable why he is so. We love figures. Of late, some of his paintings have been quite compelling. However, one cannot use this adjective to describe Galerie 88s current exhibition titled, Fe2 O.nH2 O aeons visible (till today). Bhattacharjee has painted a procession of faces of young men, some of them turning away. These large canvases are framed with grilles, the kind so often used to ward off burglars. Sometimes there are giant flowers behind the grilles. One of these waxy blooms is being slain by a dumper truck, while another grows behind the iron grilles. These paintings make a rather weak case for going green. Bhattacharjees smaller works are more telling. We tend to forget that small can be quite as impressive as big.

	Entry denied        
	I was refused entry to the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on November 14, the second evening of the Thumri Rang festival organized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, despite informing the people concerned that I was representing The Telegraph, which had been invited to review the programme. The reason given was that the hall was already full. A large number of people, all waving invitation cards, demanded entry when I arrived. Enquiries revealed that this situation was created as invitation cards were issued far in excess of the auditorium capacity (about 635 seats). Informed sources said at least 1,600 cards were printed and most of these were distributed. This led to clashes between the security staff and the angry invitees and the police had to be called in. Matters grew worse on the next evening and Joya Biswas, the senior-most woman sitar player of the nation, was caught in the melee and fainted. Such irresponsible and illegal conduct by the Akademi is a serious matter. The authorities in Delhi and the concerned government ministry should enquire into this incident, as it involves an institution as prestigious as the Akademi, and take necessary actions.

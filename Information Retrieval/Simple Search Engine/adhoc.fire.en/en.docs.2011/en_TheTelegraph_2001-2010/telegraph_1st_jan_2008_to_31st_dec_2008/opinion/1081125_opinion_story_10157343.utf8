	The Pakistani establishment does not believe in the myth of Sisyphus. Months after it unsuccessfully tried to clip the wings of the Inter-Services Intelligence by attempting to bring it under the civilian control of the interior ministry, it has again taken up a similar job. This time, the political wing of the ISI has been disbanded. That the political leadership is doubtful about pulling this off is apparent from the fact that there have been no major announcements on the matter. This seems to be an acknowledgment that it is impossible to make any alteration in the said agency without the armys cooperation. General Ashfaq Kayani, obviously, likes it that way. The policy of dissociating the army from political matters is his idea. First, the army was kept away from the electoral circus. General Kayani has followed that up by removing his men from political positions and by reforming the ISI. The dissolution of the ISIs political wing will take place under the eagle eye of his appointee, General Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the new chief of the agency.        
	This apparently simple point of agreement between the civilian and military establishments of Pakistan will do many things for many people. It will help Asif Ali Zardari to live up to the expectations of his new friends (the United States of America continues to be one of them), whose generosity will determine the economic wellbeing of Pakistan for a while. It may also improve the image of the general in the eyes of the donors at a time when revelations of the ISIs involvement in terror attacks in neighbouring countries and the armys dealings with the allied forces in drone strikes within have shown the army command in dark colours. General Kayani would also be placating the civilian establishment, for which the ISIs political wing has been a source of great fear. By putting to rest these suspicions, the army can guard not only its own space, but also its own freedom to spend, now under threat because of Pakistans new obligations.

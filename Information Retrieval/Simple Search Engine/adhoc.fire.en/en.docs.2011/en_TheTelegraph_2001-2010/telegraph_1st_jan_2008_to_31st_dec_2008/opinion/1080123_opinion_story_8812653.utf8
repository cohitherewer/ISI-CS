             - Two concessions by China have been exaggerated in India
    Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar
                          
	It is entirely possible, given Chinas ways, that Beijing deliberately released its annual trade figures a day before Manmohan Singh arrived on his first official visit after becoming prime minister. Those figures constituted a landmark in Sino-Indian relations: in 2007 China became Indias biggest trading partner, replacing the United States of America, which held that position for several years in a row. When Chinas president, Hu Jintao, was in New Delhi 14 months ago, Hu and Singh resolved that Sino-Indian bilateral trade should cross the symbolically significant mark of $40 billion by 2010. It is a pointer to where things are headed between the two Asian giants that this target has been reached two years ahead of schedule.
    
	As it happened, in the thick and glitter of a prime ministerial visit, the media accompanying Singh took only scant notice of the giant leap in bilateral trade. Strategic thinkers back in New Delhi chose to dwell on the imbalances in Sino-Indian commerce instead of the galloping trade figures. 
    
	Public discourse about Indian strategic thinking on China has oscillated between fear and dislike of the neighbour to absolute glorification and euphoria. As a result, Indians are consistently deprived of a comprehensive assessment or choice of ideas about what is undeniably becoming the most important of Indias foreign policy priorities. In the Seventies and Eighties, the Soviet Union was the most important external relationship for India. In the Nineties and well into the first half of this decade, the US came to be on top of South Blocks foreign-policy agenda. Barring unforeseen changes in geopolitics, China will be the biggest foreign-policy challenge for New Delhi in the next decade and well ahead. 
       
	It is not easy for those who lived through Indias humiliation in 1962  especially for those in the government and in the military  to accept this reality of the 21st century. But India is not alone in experiencing this dilemma. There is Vietnam, which went through a similar experience in the hands of China. Japan and Russia have lesser, but similar, difficulties in coming to terms with China as an emerging superpower. Such difficulties notwithstanding, China cannot be wished away, and the challenge of engaging with it must be tackled head on. Not surprisingly, during Singhs stay in Beijing, its leadership took several steps that will make it easier for India  both psychologically and in terms of atmospherics  to cement a better understanding with China. If only the United Progressive Alliance government has the vision to take new neighbourly initiatives.
    
	Two seeming concessions by China have been grossly exaggerated in public in India, and in New Delhis usual effort to project every prime ministerial trip abroad as an unprecedented success. The nuanced enunciation of Beijings position on New Delhis quest for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council has been trumpeted in India as a change in its favour.
    
	Such a claim demands amnesia on the part of those who remember the godfather-like, decisive role that China played in ensuring that the African Union could not come to an agreement on supporting an effort by the Group of Four  India, Japan, Brazil and Germany  in 2005, when a G-4 effort had a reasonable chance of crossing the first hurdle towards security council reform, namely that of getting a UN general assembly resolution passed in support of changing the composition of the security council. It was the lack of African support  53 votes in the general assembly, largely engineered by China  that actually sank the G-4 effort and led to the gradual withering away of the four-nation bid for permanent seats at the UNs high table.
    
	China has now concluded that any meaningful reform of the security council is way down the road, especially with a US presidential election on the calendar and in the absence of any US position on reforming the council that is embraced either by the Democrats or the Republicans in the 2008 bid for the White House. Therefore, Beijings leadership decided that there was no harm in agreeing to a paragraph in the vision statement by Singh and the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao. At the core of this vision statement was a non-committal assertion that the Chinese side understands and supports Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the UN, including the Security Council.
    
	The second exaggeration was on Chinas professed support for the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. The foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, did his best in Beijing to defend the truth without appearing negative in the face of an onslaught from the media travelling with the prime minister. They were determined to interpret 12 words in a six-page vision statement referring to civilian nuclear cooperation as a declaration of support for the Indo-US deal. 
    
	The operative sentence read: As two countries with advanced scientific capabilities, the two sides pledge to promote bilateral cooperation in civil nuclear energy, consistent with their respective international commitments, which will contribute to energy security and to dealing with risks associated with climate change. Public discourse in India has almost entirely omitted the significance of part of the sentence that refers to consistent with their respective international commitments. That implies that China, as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, reserves the option  is committed, some would say  to oppose the nuclear deal with the US at the Nuclear Suppliers Group in its present form.
     
	Thus, it was left to the prime minister to intervene personally during the visit in order to bring some semblance of reality to fanciful public interpretations that China was about to swear by the Indo-US nuclear deal. It is a tribute to the prime ministers commitment to the truth that he set the record straight on his flight back to New Delhi. I cannot say I have got a firm, definite answer, he told reporters who asked if China was going to support Indias case at the NSG. When the issue comes before relevant agencies, I do not think China will be an obstacle. I cant say I have an assurance today, Singh clarified. It is to Chinas advantage, however, that it has played its cards right on these two issues of key concern for New Delhi and created an atmosphere in India that is undoubtedly conducive to better Sino-Indian engagement. It is for India to reciprocate if it does not want to miss an opportunity for better relations with Beijing.
       
	China is now in the middle of a quest for market economy status from its major trade partners. The US, Japan and the European Union have, so far, declined to accord this privilege to Beijing. India could steal a march over them and gain goodwill  just as the Chinese have done with UN reform and the nuclear deal  by immediately offering China market-economy status. In any case, India will follow once the major Western countries have offered China this privilege and then get nothing in return for such an act. Why not behave like the Chinese, for a change, and get an upper hand in the bilateral relationship by being pro-active instead of reactive?
    
	In the days following Singhs trip to China, a number of Chinese think-tanks have proposed a variety of options to overcome what New Delhi sees as problems in Sino-Indian economic relations, including the growing trade deficit on Indias side. One of these proposals is for joint ventures in India to produce goods for export to third countries. If India does not look at these proposals seriously and act on them an opportunity to correct imbalances in bilateral relations would have been lost, just as valuable opportunities for finding solutions to bilateral political problems were frittered away in the run-up to the 1962 border war.

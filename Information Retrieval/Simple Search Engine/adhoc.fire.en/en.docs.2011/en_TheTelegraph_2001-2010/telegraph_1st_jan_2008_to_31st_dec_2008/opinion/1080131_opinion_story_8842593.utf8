	In a college library in the city, a young mans face contorts as he looks at some graphs on his computer screen. A moment later, the librarian walks up and admonishes him, saying, This is no place for such things. The youth looks glassily back at her, evidently hurt at her lack of concern for the fall in his fortunes. He was following the movement of the BSE sensex on a trading day. Such is the thrill of the stock market, of the easy, do-it-yourself approach to financial benefit, that young students have been lured into this trade, often making of it a full-time occupation. There has emerged a new breed of small investors  middle-class women (primarily housewives), students and senior citizens who are discovering in share-trading an alternative mode of gainful employment in a professional domain where they are the boss. It requires little more infrastructure than a television, a telephone and, optionally, a computer. 
    
	It is true that a lot of economic research lies behind charting market trends. Institutes offering courses on this have mushroomed across the city. But many of the members of this new, heterogeneous business community make investment decisions based not on any sort of informed judgment, but on hearsay, on the judgments of other people, often of questionable reliability. The past fortnight has been trying for this community, what with an already unpredictable stock market recording a critical slump whose magnitude had been foreseen by few.
    
	Like most issues concerning the market, opinion is divided on whether the fall signals merely a correction in a market that has sustained a considerably long bull run, or whether the Indian stock market is now already a bear market. More important, will this crisis mark the wiping out of these small investors with little funds to survive in a market of steadily falling prices?
       
	There is vanity in the relentless pursuit of failing causes. In actions committed against reason, against better judgment, against the happiness of oneself and ones own. What follows is that story.
    
	Ten years ago, Barnali Mitra was undoing her past. Strong-willed and fiercely independent, life as a stay-at-home mother and wife felt purposeless once her children grew up. Encouraged by her husband, and by the growing need to keep up with a competitive affluence that is the bane of the middle class these days, Barnali began dabbling in the stock market. It seemed simple enough at first  she had her husband to guide her and a kindly old broker, who would give her safe tips on what scrips to buy and keep for posterity. She was happy in the knowledge that, while those pieces of paper lay locked up in her cupboard, somewhere, by some frightfully complicated process, money was being churned out, money to which she could stake a claim by virtue of those scraps of paper. Then, in 1999, what was just another first in television history became for Barnali a turning point. The business news channel, CNBC-TV18, was launched. Now she could not only track market trends and stock updates as they took place, but she also had access to tips from the best advisors and market-players in the country. From a passing interest, the stock market became for Barnali a respite. The change was gradual, but its effects drastic. 
    
	She started with a run of good luck. Profit  most of it notional, some in cheques  gave her the confidence to take bigger risks. As the money kept pouring in, confidence began swelling into conceit. The household was neglected, initially at will, and eventually because of the unswerving commitment that the pursuit of wealth and a continuing hold over it demands. Believing that getting the best tipsters amounted to a knowledge of the dizzying complexities of the market, she started investing her profits into more stocks, opening accounts with more brokerage firms, sometimes opening more than one account with a firm. She bought a car. Friends turned to her for stock advice, and she began managing accounts for some of them. Like a drug, the market gave her an adrenalin rush. Perhaps it was the filthy lucre that lured her. But more probably, it was her new freedom, the finding of a new voice. 
    
	Things started going downhill from this point. The larger her scale of operation, the greater her profits, but also the more unmanageable the losses she was incurring. She realized that it was not enough to have an impressive portfolio, market forces were driven by too many other factors. Not enough became the dictum on which Barnalis life revolved. The profits were not enough, for the losses had to be made up. The brokers were not enough, because the tips were never entirely foolproof. Staring at the TV screen displaying changes in stock prices for eight hours everyday was not enough. Tracking the world markets was equally important. 
    
	Passion lies somewhere between fear and anticipation. For Barnali, what began as something to keep herself busy has turned into a consuming obsession. Her life now revolves around figures, calculations, matching balance sheets. She is accountable for her own transactions and also for the portfolios of others that she had offered to manage in foolish moments of self-importance when she had felt quite invincible in the heady wins of her investment gambles. 
    
	She wakes up at all hours of the night to follow movements in the American Dow Jones index and in stock exchanges around the world. She is up at the crack of dawn to watch morning shows on business channels. On a day of especial panic, her trading decisions begin as early as 7:30 in the morning by calling up her advisors and, for the most part, just seeking assurance about the steadiness of the market. She veers wildly from unshakeable confidence to an almost childlike need to be reassured. There are tears of rage, of desolation. A financial loss becomes personal, with angry phone calls to brokers who have not made profitable decisions for her. It is a vicious cycle now, one she cannot get out of even if she wants to. It is no longer about profits, but about making up losses.
       
	There is a short story by D.H. Lawrence, called The Rocking Horse Winner. It is about a household where the walls whispered the want of money, about a family that had all the comforts, but in which there was so much unspoken bitterness, so much imaginary lack. The mother would complain of her bad luck. There must be more money  I remember that refrain from the story. Then, I think, her little boy goes on a frenzied pursuit of luck. He gets it while riding his rocking-horse. I dont remember how it ends, perhaps not very happily. Thats been my story for a long time, laughs Barnalis older son.
    
	She has a software fitted into her computer that reproduces the stock market terminal. From cash-trading she has entered a more complex playing field  that of futures and derivatives. I do not understand much of all this, for her grief, as well as her occasional euphoria, has become self-contained in a feeble attempt at coming to terms with the new shape of her life.
    
	There are different ways of dealing with anxiety. While my mother makes hers psychological, I turn to books. But often both of us are left feeling nervous and helpless.

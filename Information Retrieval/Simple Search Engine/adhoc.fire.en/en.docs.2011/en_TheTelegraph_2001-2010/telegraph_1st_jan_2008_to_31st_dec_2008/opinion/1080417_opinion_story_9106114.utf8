	Sporting spirit                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has rightly commended Bhaichung Bhutias decision to refrain from running with the Olympic torch (The torch of conscience, April 5). It is obvious that no right-thinking person can remain aloof in a civilized society when innocent people are subjected to atrocities.That Bhutia should show solidarity with a community living close to our northern borders comes as no surprise.Whatever our political compulsions might be, a policy of appeasement has its limitations as well. Indias firmness with China in not allowing it to aerially monitor the Indian trail of the Olympic torch is a welcome stand.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Bhaichung Bhutia deserves praise for protesting against Chinas occupation of Tibet. Sport, like most things in life, cannot be separated from politics. So the possibility of remonstrations over Chinas hosting of the Olympics was always present. Incidentally, South Africas isolation from the world of international sports contributed to ending apartheid there. We are being told that Tibet has always been an integral part of China. Ethnically the Tibetans are not Chinese; their language or culture is also different from those that are followed in China. Would China then explain on what grounds it considers Tibet integral to the Mainland?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Michel Foucault said in the Eighties about the Solidarity Movement in Poland against communists: If we raise the question of Poland in strictly political terms, it is clear that we quickly reach the point of saying that there is nothing we can do. We cant dispatch a team of paratroopers, and we cant send armoured cars to liberate Warsaw. I think that, politically, we have to recognize this, but I think we have to agree that, for ethical reasons, we have to raise the problem of Poland in the form of a non-acceptance of what is happening there, and a non-acceptance of the passivity of our own governments. I think this attitude is an ethical one, but it is also political; it does not consist in saying merely I protest, but in making of that attitude a political phenomenon that is as substantial as possible, and one which those who govern, here or there, will sooner or later be obliged to take into account. Substitute Warsaw with Lhasa and we see the obvious similarities. Bengalis regard themselves as intellectuals and love to flaunt their knowledge of Foucault. Bhaichung Bhutia, who is perhaps unaware of Foucaults work, seems to have appropriated what Foucalt recommended better than many of these intellectuals.

	Ash Wednesday          
	Sir  First it was Firpos, and now Mullickghat. The fire that razed the 125-year-old Mullickghat flower market is the latest in a series of incidents that highlight the appalling lack of safety measures in and around old buildings in Calcutta (Missing: Bengal blooms, April 13). Mullickghat market was the largest flower market in eastern India. Other than being steeped in history, it was also a photographers delight, with its quaint alleys and rows of flower-sellers with heaps of tuberoses and marigolds in their stalls. That such important components of Calcuttas history are being destroyed out of sheer negligence and disregard for the past is shameful. The government should immediately restore old landmarks and bring them up-to-date with modern safety norms while keeping their antiquity intact.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Dangerous destination          
	Sir  Scarlett Keelings mother could never have imagined that she would be blamed for her daughters death by the Indian media. It is true that Fiona Mackeown acted irresponsibly by leaving her teenage daughter alone in a foreign country with a tour guide.           
	However, have the media done the right thing by blaming Mackeown for the circumstances that lead to her daughters rape and murder? Many teenaged girls indulge in drinking and partying. They may become addicts, or even get pregnant because of their misdemeanours. But does that mean that they would have to pay with their lives for their waywardness? Besides, this is not an isolated incident, but one that is common in most tourist destinations in developing countries that have modelled themselves on the West. MacKeown is surely paying heavily for her lack of judgment and it is unfair to blame her for an eventuality that she must never have imagined possible.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In the aftermath of the murder of British teenager, Scarlett Keeling, the Goa government should immediately crack down on the sale of illegal drugs and arrest drug-peddlers in the state. Illegal migrants from Russia and Israel have settled in Goa, and many of them deal in drugs for their upkeep. The authorities need to make it clear that tourists interested in illegal and immoral activities are not welcome in Goa. The states crumbling infrastructure and filthy beaches are, in fact, drawing tourists who are more of a nuisance than value to Goas economy.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa

                
	Sir  The murder of Scarlett Keeling proves that Goa has become a den of sleaze and crime. Not very long ago, Goa was a favoured destination of tourists. But the murder shows that things have taken a turn for the worse since then. Worse, the police initially tried to pass the crime as death by drowning. The murder, along with negative publicity surrounding the botched up probe, will surely hamper Goas tourism potential. Instead of portraying Goa as unsafe, the Indian media should ensure that security is tightened for the visitors. This will encourage tourists to continue visiting the state that was once famed for its beautiful beach resorts, friendly locals and a rich history.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Bardez, Goa

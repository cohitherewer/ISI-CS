	Bad news about the economy is so sudden that its implications have not yet sunk in. All that has registered is the rapid rise in inflation. This blot on the rosy picture is none to the authorities liking; they would rather that the people forgot about it. They have blamed the outside world for it, and told the people that the pain would be over soon  that relief was only as far away as the next harvest. Their credibility was dented when the bumper wheat harvest came and went. But they do not have to give up; there will always be another harvest. Now they are waiting for the kharif. The longer they wait, however, the worse it will get. For they are not reading all the signs together. Inflation is only part of the picture. It has to be read with the decline in the growth rate. Only six months ago, gross domestic product growth exceeded 8 per cent; the authorities dreamed of 9 per cent, 10 per cent, and so on to euphoria. Now it has slipped below 8 per cent. They dream that it will resume its upward climb. But there is no law that growth rates that go down must go up  within months at any rate. Trade cycles generally take some years to turn around.         
	If an economy runs short of goods and prices start rising, it can always import; the world is so much larger. Unlike in previous crises, this government is sitting on mountains of dollars, and could import all it wanted. But in an effort to please the common man, the government has kept domestic prices of oil and grains so much below world prices. In foodgrains, it ran down stocks; in oil, it underpriced domestic output and raided its own oil companies treasuries. The result is that imports are too costly, and cannot help the government bring down prices. Not content with low domestic market prices, the government has been providing grains at even lower prices to the ostensibly poor; actually, most of the difference between ration and market prices is siphoned away by politicians and their protgs. But the cost is borne by the government. It is running a deficit that brings back memories of the Seventies and Eighties. It has fed demand with its fiscal deficit, and run down expenditure in infrastructure to make itself marginally more popular. It has thereby fed inflation, and bought itself unpopularity amongst a much broader section of people.         
	What is most tragic is the government is paralysed by the spectre of the looming disaster. It is not prepared to cut down its own expenditure to fit its revenue. It would not raise the value of the rupee to make imports cheaper. It hesitates to raise interest rates to chase inflation. What it knows to do best is to wait and hope.

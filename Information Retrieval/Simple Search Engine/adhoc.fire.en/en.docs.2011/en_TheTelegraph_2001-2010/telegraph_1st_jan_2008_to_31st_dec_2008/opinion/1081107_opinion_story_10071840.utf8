	Doctrine of disaster                  
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas article, Politicians in cassock (Oct 31), does not offer a sensible analysis of the flare-up of communal sentiments in the country of late. The author comes across as a patron of Hindu extremists and an apologist for the incompetent Orissa government; he is not enraged so much by the inhuman tortures inflicted on Sister Meena Lalita Barwa or the subsequent denial of justice to her, but by her testimony before the media. Should she have approached the same police and administration that had chosen to remain inactive after the event?           
	Dasgupta also seems to believe that a 29-year-old educated nun cannot speak for herself; and that the politicized bishops had made her a pawn to suit their political ends. Dasgupta appears to justify the rape by citing the saffron camps favoured reason for any atrocity committed by Hindus  forcible religious conversion. He is also driven by the apprehension  a thoroughly misplaced one  that the churches run on foreign funds are sure to have some hidden political agenda. He ought to know that countries that fund Indian churches issue no directives on forcible conversion.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The whole world is aware of how Christians are being persecuted in India. It is only people like Swapan Dasgupta who are blind to the phenomenon. Dasgupta calls the archbishop of Cuttack a politically combative person because he fought for justice instead of bowing to the threats of Hindu fundamentalists. Giving the raped nun a platform to talk about her trauma was indeed a political gesture; but it was a fitting reply to the politically motivated agenda of hatred against the Christians.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta, despite all his struggles to the contrary, ends up writing an extremely biased article. One has to read it to believe that the unfortunate incidents of Kandhamal could be so grossly misrepresented. One wonders what gave the author the impression that Christians in India are having a pleasant time and are exploiting their minority label. Hindu fundamentalists love to belittle the works of missionaries crying forcible conversions, and Dasgupta is no exception           
	Yours faithfully,       
I.P. Sarto, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is Swapan Dasgupta himself who sees the world through political lenses while blaming others for politicizing every trivial issue. And that is why he failed to realize that Sister Meena Lalita Barwa had to come out and talk about her humiliation because, like many of her brothers and sisters, she too had lost faith in the administration. It is not pity or political benefits that she was asking for, but justice for herself and for the thousands languishing in the refugee camps in Orissa. But justice is hard to get when the government itself becomes an agent of Hindutva. It is difficult to buy Dasguptas theory of the political dealings of the church, since the latter has its own system of punishing men of its order found guilty of political foul play.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  What does the phrase, colossal bad taste, in Swapan Dasguptas article, stand for  for the denial of justice to a raped nun, or the fact that she chose to talk about it to the media? When columnists like Dasgupta blame a persecuted community for the attacks faced by it, the pitiful condition of the minorities in India today is made perfectly clear. No surprise, therefore, that outfits like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad are not mentioned, let alone being apportioned blame.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Paul Kaichappa Mosley, Bangalore

                
	Sir  For centuries, majority Hindu groups have exploited and oppressed the minorities in India. And among the intelligentsia, voices such as Swapan Dasguptas justified this extremism by calling the followers of faiths other than Hinduism opportunistic or mercenary. The Constitutional right to practise the religion of ones choice does not bar anyone from choosing a faith for purely commercial reasons. If our tribal communities have been converting to Christianity only because the church would ensure them the basic amenities, then Dasgupta has no right to call them rice Christians. He should instead have criticized the government for failing to provide them with food and other benefits. What is happening in Orissa would only push the minorities towards extremism to protect their rights. Views such as Dasguptas would stoke these sentiments further.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Joy Besra, Berhampore, West Bengal 

                
	Sir  Opposition to conversion by outfits like the VHP and RSS does not amount to a bid to preserve national identity, whatever Swapan Dasgupta might feel. The agendas of these Hindu groups are theological at best and extremist at worst. Dasgupta is also wrong in alleging that the churches are hurting indigenous faith and tradition by making tribals convert to Christianity. In fact, it is the church that is helping tribal communities survive and preserve their customs and traditions.          
	Yours faithfully,

	A country cannot choose either its neighbour or the kind of government that the latter has. New Delhi would like to have a democratic regime in Dhaka. But a stable Bangladesh is more important for Indias diplomatic and strategic interests. The warm reception that the chief of the Bangladesh army, General Moeen U. Ahmed, received in New Delhi is an indication of how India views the current regime in that country. It is no secret that General Ahmed is the real power behind the interim administration in Dhaka. But it would be wrong to see in New Delhis position a betrayal of Bangladeshs democratic hopes. The fact that India has to do business with the military regimes in both Pakistan and Myanmar does not detract from New Delhis commitment to democracy in either country. India has reasons to be satisfied with some of the steps taken by the interim government in Dhaka, especially with those against Islamist terror groups. Also, it is important for New Delhi to send out the signal that the policies of a government in Dhaka, rather than Bangladeshs domestic politics, are what matter in relations between the two countries. 
    
	However, the army-backed administration in Dhaka has done little to resolve two issues that are crucial to Indias security concerns. Recent events suggest that militants from Indias northeast continue to use Bangladeshi territory for their shelters and arms training camps. The other issue relates to illegal migration of Bangladeshis into India. The resumption of the train service between Dhaka and Calcutta after 43 years can signal a new beginning, but relations between the countries may yet be strained by Indias security concerns. Successive governments in Dhaka have shown little interest in solving the problems. Such attitudes have only worsened Indias security concerns. General Ahmed has the opportunity to change that record. What the present regime does about these issues can shape the policies of the next democratic government in Bangladesh.

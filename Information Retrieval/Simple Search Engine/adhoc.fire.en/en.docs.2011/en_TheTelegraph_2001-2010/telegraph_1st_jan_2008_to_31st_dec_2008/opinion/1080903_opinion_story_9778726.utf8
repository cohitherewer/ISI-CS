The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Landing a deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LANDING A DEAL                                                    
	The settlement of the Amarnath controversy, for now, was the result of rare pragmatism  both on the part of the government and of the Amarnath Shrine Board. For its part, the government realized that it needed more acumen and political will than what the Union home minister possesses to get anywhere close to sealing a deal with a party with which a deal was possible. As for the shrine board, which has climbed down on its demands with surprising magnanimity (starting with the clamour for the resignation of the governor and ending with that of the special superintendent of police), its willingness to put a seeming end to matters is no less commendable. Its basic purposes of being heard, seen and felt by a greater multitude having been achieved, the board has agreed to the most practical solution made available by the governors office. The controversial 40 acres of land will now be managed by the shrine board during the months of pilgrimage, and its ownership will rest with the government. In strictly functional terms, that was what was happening ever since the shrine board came into being. The deal changes nothing on the ground except giving power to the voice of dissent in Jammu and the confidence that, if push comes to shove, the voice could become as overwhelming as that on the other side of the Pir Panjal.         
	The acquiescence of Jammu does another thing. It heightens awareness of the recalcitrant Other. The Hurriyat, as expected, has rejected the accord. So has the Peoples Democratic Party, which, having so diligently stoked the controversy on the land deal, has no reason to back it now. The PDP had hoped to gain maximum political mileage on the issue, which it could cash on in the forthcoming elections. It has ended up according the entire political space in the valley to the hardliners in the Hurriyat who will interpret any attempt on the part of their newfound ally, the PDP, to return to the mainstream as a sign of betrayal. The battle lines will become stricter by the time the election commission decides to hold elections in the state. The renewed cry for azadi has destroyed the middle ground in the valleys politics. Not even the National Conference, despite talking so much sense, can hope to recapture it.         
	The political polarization, deftly achieved over the Amarnath land, will have its echoes in the general elections, now that public sentiments in the state have freely mingled with those beyond its borders. But elections are things that come and go. What will be more permanent is the damage done to the image of the Amarnath yatra and the syncretism it stood for. Unless, of course, the shrine board retains its spirit of accommodation and allows the local people in the valley to continue playing the part they have always done in the history of the pilgrimage.

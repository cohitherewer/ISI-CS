                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TAMING INFLATION                                                    
	William Simon, a former assistant secretary of the US treasury, once said, Unless someone bites the monetary bullet, we are destined to pay the inflation penalty. Now, the Indian economy is having to, and the Reserve Bank of India governor, Y.V. Reddy, is making sure that industry and the banking system does so too, even if he has to press their collective jaws together. In his first quarter review of the monetary policy for 2008-09, Mr Reddy announced a steeper-than-expected interest hike of half a percentage point, and an increase in reserve requirements  the cash reserve ratio  by a quarter of a percentage point. The first measure targets inflation directly, and the second indirectly, by making it harder for banks to continue expanding credit at the current scorching pace. Since April, the central bank has increased the repo rate  at which banks borrow from the RBI and which is used to indicate a preference for tightening liquidity  by a cumulative 1.75 per cent; likewise, it has increased the CRR by 1.5 per cent in that same period. But inflation has stubbornly refused to come down, and not just for reasons beyond the central banks control. Despite high interest rates, credit has grown: not just from banks, but also in commercial paper.         
	While commodity and raw material prices  particularly oil imports  and food prices have added substantially to inflation, demand growth has not abated. Even as the RBI has tightened policy, the government has loosened fiscal policy: the farm loans waiver and the anticipated implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission that will put even more cash into farmers and salaried employees wallets, and reduced excise and customs duties so that industrial growth would not suffer. The result has been to leave Mr Reddy with the unenviable task of waging a lone battle against inflation. Even when monetary policy was previously tightened, finance minister P. Chidambaram asked banks to reconsider raising interest rates, especially for housing, and complicated the RBIs task.         
	So in his latest monetary policy statement, Mr Reddy has decided to lay it on the line in no uncertain terms. First, he points out that the ability of the banking system to absorb past policy rate and CRR increases is demonstrated by the fact that demand growth has not fallen. So an overheating of the economy is still a distinct possibility, and he will raise rates accordingly. Second, credit quality may become a casualty as bank credit expands so fast that it threatens the banks capital and depositors. If banks will not address it, the RBI will inspect or audit banks to ensure financial stability. That implies possible restrictions on specific business activities. In support, his policy statement lists several past instances where he has pointed to potential risks to banks and the economys health, but has been ignored. If invasive surgery is required, he will not hesitate. Banks should listen to him.

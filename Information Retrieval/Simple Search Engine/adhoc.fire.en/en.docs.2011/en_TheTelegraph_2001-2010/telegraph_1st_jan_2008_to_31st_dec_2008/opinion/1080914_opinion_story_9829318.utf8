	 Marriage has its compulsions, a political marriage more so. Dalliances with the Samajwadi Party have made it necessary for the Congress to welcome its friends friends, and they obviously include the Bachchans. Which explains why the first family of Bollywood suddenly had the Congress jump to its feet when Raj Thackerays sena cast the first stone. Both the Congress president and the AICC gen-sec in charge of Maharashtra are supposed to have spoken to the Maharashtra CM to give protection to the Bachchans. It is, of course, the cardinal duty of all CMs, whatever their political colour, to give protection to endangered citizens like the Bachchans. Vilasrao Deshmukh, however, had his own compulsions. Like the Bachchans, his son, Riteish, is also a creature of the silver screen and vulnerable to stone-throwing. Thackeray is supposed to have warned Deshmukh of similar behaviour from the sena on the release of films starring his son if he took up cudgels on behalf of the Bachchans. But then Deshmukh was spared the dilemma of choosing between son and Sonia when the Bachchans themselves bended backwards to accommodate Raj in his rajya.                
	 There may be doubts about the PMs political sagacity, but there is none about his phenomenal patience. The Union cabinet met to discuss the Orissa violence, and Manmohan Singhs colleagues took off on a tangent. The gathering found, as usual, Shivraj Patil to be a bore. So the minorities affairs minister, AR Antulay, decided to cut him short. There was much relief, but then Antulay went on his own trip recollecting how he used to tackle the communal virus as the Maharashtra CM during Indira Gandhis era. After a while, Antulay was ticked off by fellow lawyer Kapil Sibal, and then his session began, and then anothers and then anothers.                            
	 The Kosi flood, which is doing wonders to the political careers of both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, is playing a spoiler for others. It is the reason why the president may not have her iftaar party. Last year Pratibha Patil resumed the practice of hosting iftaars after a gap of five years when APJ Abdul Kalam was president and would have none of it. Those opposed to the idea think the president must not be seen laying out a lavish spread when thousands still do not know when the next meal is going to be airdropped.                            
	 And you thought politicians were the only ones to make much ado over the opening of a roadside kiosk or a culvert over a public drain? Then read this bit about the Gymkhana club. The watering hole of the top brass of the armed forces, babudom and the diplomatic corps had a formal re-opening of an old gents toilet, which had been closed for renovation. The opening was quite an event, with the club president doing the honours. Lest members forgot the historic event, a notice was put up, which said that all members, including lady members were cordially invited. It reminded male members that since ladies will be present, they should not indulge [sic] in using it (the toilet, one gathers).                             
	 Violence in the Kashmir valley is not the only thing bothering the young and the young at heart. The government ban on SMSes is hurting as well. It has robbed lovers of the joy of exchanging private notes. It has also ended the circulation of SMS jokes, which did their bit to lighten the mood. May be the governor has more plans up his sleeves?                            
	 While in Chennai a few days back, the Congress president went missing. For more than an hour, she could not be traced by anyone in the party. In those desperate hours, Sonia Gandhi is supposed to have been dining in the Raj Bhavan with an old friend, who, some years ago, had been removed by a family coup from leading a well-known newspaper in the South. This lady, together with another heading a major national daily, are among Sonias personal friends. Thats flower power!                            
	 Text messages from the Lok Sabha Speaker or the Presidents office are now pass. But the hardened journo was floored last week to find a message in his inbox providing phone numbers to contact if a central/ Delhi Govt/ PSU/ Bank employee demands bribe for any official work in Delhi. Are things changing?    
	FOOTNOTE      
	 Its a peculiar problem of plenty with the Congress in Madhya Pradesh. There are political stars who are chief ministerial material, but none of them is willing to contest the assembly polls. Take the AICC gen-sec Digvijay Singh, who was CM for 10 years. After his defeat in 2003, he vowed not to contest or hold office for 10 years. His current status, Diggy Raja says, is not a breach of that promise since it is not an administrative post. Take again Kamal Nath. He would be happy to be CM, but does not want to contest. Incredible? No. If the Congress wins, his associates from Chhindwara would happily vacate a seat for him. Then there is Jyotiraditya Scindia, who cannot take interest in such plebeian matters unless 10 Janpath ordains it. There is also Suresh Pachauri, the state party chief, who quotes an informal party convention that forbade state unit chiefs from harbouring ambitions as they inconvenience supervision. Truly, a no-win situation.

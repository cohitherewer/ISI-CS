	This is not the first time Raj Thackerays supporters have disrupted a railway board examination. They did it in November 2003, when Mr Raj Thackeray was still part of the Shiv Sena. Now he heads his own Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, but the purpose of the last, more organized and violent assault on 13 railway board examination centres in Mumbais suburbs was exactly the same  frightening away candidates from outside Maharashtra, especially north India. It is amazing that the government should allow MNS goons to get away with such an attack in spite of the partys record of violence and disruption. Having founded the MNS on the premise that the Shiv Sena had fallen from its earlier glory, Mr Raj Thackeray has taken it upon himself to revive the Shiv Senas regional chauvinism in a more strident vein. His alleged remarks against the show of arrogance by people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during Chhathh prompted a petition in the Patna civil court earlier this year, and Jaya Bachchan was cornered for daring to speak publicly in Hindi. His one-point agenda inspires violence  the clash with Samajwadi Party workers this year and the assaults on north Indian vendors and shopkeepers, for example, are the only kind of politics the MNS knows.        
	Although Mr Bal Thackeray is displeased with his nephew, evidently the government, even when it is run by the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress, is hesitant to control a regional chauvinist with a popular following, whether it is uncle or nephew. The uncle may not like it that the MNS is trying to usurp the Shiv Senas position in the aviation union, as Mr Raj Thackerays championing of ousted Jet employees indicated. Whatever its reasons, the government has allowed Mr Raj Thackeray to incite the worst kind of regionalism with freedom. His words and actions, his whole agenda, violate the Constitution. The chief ministers condemnation of the examination violence comes a little too late, and the deputy chief ministers promise to give all victimized candidates government jobs is exactly the kind of palliation that would further upset the system. Politicians from all over India have expressed outrage, demanding the banning of the MNS and government action against Mr Raj Thackeray. But far from being a mental case, as Lalu Prasad has called him, the MNS chief knows he has tapped into too basic an instinct to let go easily.

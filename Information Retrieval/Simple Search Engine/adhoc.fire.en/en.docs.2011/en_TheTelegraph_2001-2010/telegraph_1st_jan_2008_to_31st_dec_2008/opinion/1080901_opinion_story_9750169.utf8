	Public concern                  
	Sir  Andr Bteille is right in saying that our public institutions, including educational bodies, have deteriorated because of corrupt politicians and unscrupulous bureaucrats (Public and private, Aug 27). The government has monopolized public sectors and this has led to a steep decline of standards in every State-owned institution. When public institutions and industries were set up, the government ensured that they had no competitors. As a result, there was no motivation for public industries to perform exceptionally. In addition, whereas a private company is accountable to its stakeholders, a public sector unit is managed by bureaucrats under a minister.           
	Politicians, as we all know, are always keen to undertake populist policies to the detriment of public companies. The bureaucrats who run them also seldom have any interest or obligation to set a premium standard of service. A public institution, therefore, is inherently doomed to failure.           
	The governments priority should be to encourage as much privatization as possible, be it in industry or education. Universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford are all private universities. Stiff competition among private telecom companies has led to a price cut in mobile phones in India. Similarly, competition among private universities can bring about similar positive changes in Indias higher education set-up. However, care should be taken to ensure that private educational institutions are free of archaic government regulations. Otherwise the bureaucracy may use its power to thwart private universities in order to ward off competition.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The old belief that government enterprises are for public good and private enterprises are for personal gain cannot be accepted anymore. Jawaharlal Nehru supported public institutions because of his philanthropic intentions. His support might have borne fruit, but for political interference, lack of accountability and corruption. My father, a member of the Indian Civil Services, shared Nehrus views. As a result, after the coal mines were nationalized, he insisted that I join the coal industry. I obliged him and during my two-decade old stint, I have been a witness to the nepotism, inefficiency and political interference that are the bane of every public sector company. Top bosses dance to the tunes of influential ministers while senior bureaucrats are offered plum posts. It is time the governments embarks on an privatization drive. Only that can arrest the countrys economic slide on account of its inept public enterprises.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Art attack          
	Sir  Every time Maqbool Fida Husains art is questioned by Hindu fanatics, evidently upset by the artists flagrant denigration of their religion, the media take the artists side (Ram warriors smash Husains works, Aug 25). It is often argued that eroticism is an integral part of sacred Hindu texts. But the truth is Indian eroticism is only a product of the exoticism attributed to it by the West. Husains works represent this Western imagination. His nude paintings thus sell well in the global art market. Whenever devout Hindus have protested against Husains paintings, as it happened in New Delhi recently  they have been branded as communal. In India, secularism carries a twisted logic: instead of giving every citizen the right to practise his or her religion freely, it implies the obligatory suspension of all religious sentiments.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Arvind D. Tapkire, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The forced expulsion of Taslima Nasreen and now the vandalism at an art exhibition featuring Maqbool Fida Husains works make it clear that the government bowed down to the pressure exerted by religious bigots. The United Progressive Alliances priority is to secure its vote bank. It flaunts its flimsy secular credentials as it cannot sacrifice the minority vote. The omission of Husains name from the India Art Summit itself is a clear indicator of this. It is therefore too much to expect that those who vandalized Husains paintings will be brought to book by the present government.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The English Olympic contingent returned with lots of medals, unlike Indian sportsmen who won only a few. Expectedly, the British athletes were received warmly by their countrymen. In India, the medallists, apart from earning fulsome praise, were also promised millions for their success by the Indian Olympic Association (Warm welcome for heroes, Aug 27). Indias performance at Beijing Olympics with only three medals has been praiseworthy, but the IOA should have desisted from showering cash prizes on the winners. It is unnecessary for a poor country like India to greet Olympic medal winners with riches. Instead, the government and the IOA should use the money to sponsor needy sportsmen so that India can welcome many more medallists back home in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,

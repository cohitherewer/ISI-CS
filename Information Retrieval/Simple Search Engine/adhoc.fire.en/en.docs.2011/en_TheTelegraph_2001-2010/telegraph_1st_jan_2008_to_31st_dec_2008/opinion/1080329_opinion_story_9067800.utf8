	The photographs in Subir Chatterjees recently concluded exhibition, Elsewhere (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, March 7-24), were, in a sense, free objects. Each image had been stripped of its baggage of specificities  captions, categories  enabling the viewer to look at it through pure mediums such as darkness and light. This sense of deletion, and a marked preference for mood rather than minutiae, were the hallmarks of the exhibits.        
	Be it the photograph of a solitary goblet against a darkening window, or the image of men and bicycles on a shady street, with alternate bands of light and shadow patterned across the walls of buildings and arches surrounding them (picture), the context of each image was not what was visible, but the intangible, such as the memories and relationships that defined each object in the pictures.        
	This process of deletion, of distancing, and the continual attempt to extend the boundaries of photography beyond the recording of reality, are critical aspects of Chatterjees work. As is the emotional tone of the images, which, more often than not, is sombre, suggesting that the underlying narrative is one of stillness and longing for a private world that is now perhaps lost for ever.

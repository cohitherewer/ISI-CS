	The Reserve Bank of India is the countrys wisest institution; at any rate, it speaks in words of wisdom. Pure wisdom is always right, so the wise never admit a mistake. But with a new finance minister in Delhi and a new governor in Mumbai, the nuances have begun to change. Nothing reflects this change so well as the governors statement on Saturday. It relegated Chidambaramian bravado to the last paragraph, and tempered its manic optimism with a warning that painful adjustment is inevitable. Those in pain know it; they would want to know what the RBI is doing about it. It has been taking various measures in this direction since September. The measures were triggered off by the failure of Bear Stearns, whose failure placed ICICI Bank at some risk. Since then, the RBI has done much to extend credit lines to banks and to reduce the rates at which they borrow. They have borrowed; in the RBIs lingo, the liquidity adjustment facility window has been in an absorption mode since November 18. But they have not been lending as much as they could with the liquidity the RBI has put at their disposal. Meanwhile, enterprises in expanding areas of the economy have been running out of cash. The RBI has given banks food, but it cannot make them feed others.        
	In the measures it announced on Saturday, the RBI has reduced its lending rates by 1 per cent. But its main aim has been to relieve the liquidity stress that is being felt in particular pockets. Thus, it has extended credit to Small Industries Development Bank of India to pass on to small enterprises, and to National Housing Bank to pass on to mortgage lenders. In a more controversial move, the RBI has changed the risk classification of certain housing loans, and promised to do so for other bank loans as well. In other words, as borrowers fail to repay and the risk of default increases, the RBI has told the banks to regard loans to them as less risky. It is moving the goal posts, to such an extent that it is legitimate to wonder whether the RBI will win the game only to lose the series.        
	Indias economy, dominated by banks, is inevitably subject to the risk that their high leverage poses. As it goes into a depression, businesses will fail, and bank loans to them will turn bad. The RBI is trying to conceal this process by turning yesterdays bad debts into good debts today. This sort of reinterpretation of reality may come naturally to politicians, but in the countrys prime regulator, it is extremely dangerous. The RBI may give banks as much credit as it likes. But it should keep their accounts squeaky clean, so that it is possible to know exactly how bad the situation is.

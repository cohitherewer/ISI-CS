	Poor development                  
	Sir  In his scathing criticism of the new Bangalore international airport, S.L. Rao has brought to focus how major infrastructure projects in India almost invariably fall short of the expectations of their target users (Kinds of interest, June 2). The government lacks the motivation to make strident investment decisions, and instead sticks to conservative, risk-averse ventures. There is an urgent need for the government to pull up its act and stop giving the go-ahead to substandard infrastructure projects. It must show, through its investments, that it is making an honest effort to improve the nations economic future.           
	Yours faithfully,         Kaushik Chatterjee, Calcutta
        
	Without merit          
	Sir  It would be ideal to set up another unit of the Indian Institutes of Technology because they are stellar academic institutions. But to dedicate the new unit exclusively for girls would be a retrograde step (All-girls IIT in PMs court, June 9). Further, the proposed IIT should not be named after any political figure, its name should be suffixed by the name of the city in which it is set up, in keeping with the tradition of naming the IITs. Arjun Singhs renewed efforts to please the Gandhi family are falling flat, as much with the family as with the public.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Does Arjun Singh have nothing better to do except to continue dividing the country in as many ways as possible and mess up the education system? His reservationist policies have triggered violence and unrest within the student communities in all the institutions of higher learning. Now he wants to divide the educational institutions further along gender lines. What next? Admission on the basis of skin colour, length of nose, height, region and so on? Should someone like Singh be allowed to hold the entire countrys education system and the future of our younger generation to ransom?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The president, Pratibha Patil, appears to have forgotten that she should set an example of impartiality and encourage equality among the people of her country, instead of dividing them on grounds of gender. Arjun Singhs endorsement of Patils idea of an IIT exclusively for girls is not a surprise. He has always been the sycophant par excellence. The move to create an IIT on such bizarre grounds will be detrimental to the principles of an institute devoted to academic excellence.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Vivek, Calcutta

                
	Sir  If the girls-only IIT, proposed by Pratibha Patil and eagerly seconded by Arjun Singh, were to be set up, would it be able to stop promising girls like Toya Chatterjee from ending their lives (City girl hangs herself at IIT, June 1)? Toya, by all available accounts, was a meritorious student, as most of her fellows at IIT Kanpur were. But everyone in the IITs are so engrossed in their studies and dreams of successful careers that nobody has time for classmates who are in dire need of a patient ear and some empathy. One wishes that Patil and Singh would spare a thought for girls like Toya who are trying to survive in the demanding IIT campuses before putting forward their harebrained plans.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Seema Guha, Calcutta

                          
	Erratum          
	This refers to the article, A riddle wrapped in silk inside a vault, which appeared in 7 Days on June 8. Girish Shahane has been quoted in the article. But the quotation should have been attributed to Govind Shahani, a professor in Mumbai. We regret the error.  The Editor

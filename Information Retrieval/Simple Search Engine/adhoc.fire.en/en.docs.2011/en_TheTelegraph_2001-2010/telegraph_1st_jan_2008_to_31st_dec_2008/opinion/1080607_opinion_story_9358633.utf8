	A clean strike                  
	Sir  This year, the World Environment Day made some sense. Air and sound pollution was considerably low, thanks to the bandh called by the Marxists on the same day. Ironically, even though Calcuttans had to take yet another bandh in their stride, they were spared their daily doze of toxic fumes and ear-damaging noise, even if it was for half a day. It is a pity that Calcuttans have to depend on strikes to enjoy a breath of fresh air. Doesnt this say something about the leftist governments commitment to rid the ailing city of its foul air?          
	Yours faithfully,        Sunil Chatterjee, Calcutta 
        
	Royal success          
	Sir  The Rajasthan Royals deserve praise for winning the inaugural Indian Premier League (Royal crown on IPL hit show, June 3). A lot of the credit for the teams success should go to their skipper, Shane Warne. It was Warnes tactical skills that helped his team win a number of close contests, including the final against the Chennai Super Kings. The IPL final proved that a captains ability to lead and manage a side are as important as experience and talent to win in this form of cricket. The Rajasthan Royals winning the tournament may have surprised those who had put their money on fancier sides. However, Indias cricket-loving public need to thank Warne and his boys for the entertainment they provided in the course of the tournament.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The IPL final saw the Rajasthan Royals beat the Chennai Super Kings by three wickets. Shane Warnes team, the least expensive side in the competition, showed that perseverence pays dividends in cricket. While some star-studded teams failed to enter the last four, the unfancied Royals ended up as winners. Of course, the IPL threw up other surprises as well. Who could have thought that Shaun Marsh would emerge as the tournaments highest run-getter? Marshs success only goes to show that young cricketers are more likely to succeed in this form of cricket. The IPLs success, one hopes, would help cricket replace football as the worlds favourite sport.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I hadnt for a moment doubted the IPLs potential to succeed. Ever since it started, the IPL had attracted a lot of attention. While some people had welcomed the idea, others had assumed that interest in the league would fizzle out in a couple of days. The critics have now been left eating their words.           
	For the fans, the IPL was a novel experience. Unlike international tournaments, where one gets to support only national sides, here in the IPL, the people could root for a number of players and sides. Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians were my personal favourites, although I also watched with interest how the other teams played. What was particularly exciting about the IPL was that most of the games were closely fought. Here is wishing that the next edition of the league is an even bigger success.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Indian cricket board reportedly made more than Rs 350 crore, thanks to the hugely popular IPL. Is there then a case for the board to introduce a further truncated version  T10 cricket perhaps? Each side would get to bat for 10 overs and every game would last for two hours. Three matches will be held each day, and the games would be known, appropriately as morning, matinee and evening shows. The proceeds could go to poor farmers so that the BCCI president-cum-Union agriculture minister can keep his vote bank happy.                    
	Yours faithfully,

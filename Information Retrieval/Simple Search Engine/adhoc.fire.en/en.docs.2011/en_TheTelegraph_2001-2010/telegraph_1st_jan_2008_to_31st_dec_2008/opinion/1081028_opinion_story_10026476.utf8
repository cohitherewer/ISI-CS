	If teachers in private schools and colleges have problems at work, then whom should they turn to? A national teachers tribunal set up by the Central human resource development ministry. Unsurprisingly, none other than the said ministry had posed the question and then come up with this answer. So, yet again Arjun Singh has been thinking up ways in which to intervene, benevolently of course, in affairs and institutions where the States presence should be minimal. This particular ministry, whoever its minister and whatever the nature of the regime at the Centre, has always had a troubled relationship with the idea of autonomy. The thought of letting schools, colleges and other institutions of higher education create and sustain their own ethos brings out deep-rooted insecurities in this ministry, which does not quite like letting go of control. The Indian institutes of technology and management have faced the brunt of this tendency at several levels, from questions of fees and the reservation of seats to matters relating to syllabus and pedagogy. It is now the turn of private schools and colleges, urban and rural. Eighty per cent of Indias schools and 70 per cent of its colleges are privately run (that is, receive no financial aid from the State). It is significant that the proposal for such a tribunal is being framed by the Centre in terms of a concern for the labour rights of teachers in these institutions.        
	It is time the Centre, together with the state governments (West Bengal particularly), radically thought through its role in some important sectors of civil society. And education is definitely one of these. Here, the State can set up certain basic standards and parameters, and even make sure of the existence of proper infrastructure. But after having done so, it must know when to withdraw and let the institutions fend for themselves. This is also true for the private teachers labour rights. The basic issue of minimum wages, or conditions of employment and dismissal can be laid out by the State. But the administration of these schools and colleges, and the various problems that could arise in them, should be dealt with by the institutions themselves, with the support of the standard judicial machinery when disputes have to be resolved. Like wise parents in the lives of their adult offspring, the State should be clear about when to make itself absent.

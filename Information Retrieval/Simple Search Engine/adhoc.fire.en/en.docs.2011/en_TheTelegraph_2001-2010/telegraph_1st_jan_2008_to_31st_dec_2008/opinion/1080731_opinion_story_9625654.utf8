	Why is it so impossible  and indeed, quite painful  to imagine Keats, Shelley and Byron as Victorian gentlemen photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron, with their Arnoldian side-whiskers or Tennysonian beards, their grim wives and unsmiling children? My dear, they have been spared that d-d-dreadful fate by D-d-death, John Bayley, of the legendary stutter, had told me once during a Keats tutorial.        
	Yet it need not have been so. The Young Romantics would have been in their forties when Victoria became queen in 1837  Keats in his early, Shelley in his mid, and Byron in his late forties. But they were all dead between their mid-twenties and mid-thirties, and how different the character of English poetry would have been if each of them had had a normal lifespan. The visual appearance, the look, of Romanticism would have been different too. Wordsworth, of course, outlived them all (dying in 1850), and part of the saving glamour of the early-dying poets is that they didnt live to become boring and conservative like Wordsworth  though Im not quite sure that is fair to him.        
	For these younger poets, death was the key to a kind of mythically everlasting youth, making them almost of the same order as Narcissus or Adonis, rather than letting them remain ordinary dead folk. This kind of myth-making began in 1770 with that precocious and penniless young maker of fake medieval ballads, Chatterton, attaining instant martyrdom at 19 by killing himself in his London attic. Suicide, consumption or public injustice makes the myth even more potent. When the Romantics wrote about Chatterton, each poet saw himself in him.         
	It is also bizarre how the deaths of the Young Romantics remained poetically intertwined with one another. Byron wrote about Keats being snuffed out by an article (referring to the cruel reviews of his poetry); and Shelley, Byrons intimate friend, who wrote a great elegy to Keats, drowned in a boat called Don Juan with Keatss volume of poems in his jacket pocket. Shelleys ashes ended up in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, where Keats was also buried. And after Keatss death, Coleridge recalled in his unstoppable table-talk that long before Keats was ill, he had once shaken the boys hand and remarked immediately after they parted, There is Death in that hand. Most people at table that evening thought Coleridge was making this up.         
	Keats, Shelley and Byron were all beautiful young men. But it is not just physical beauty that death preserves in these darlings of futurity (Chattertons phrase). The intensity and fineness of their writing, and the revolutionary charge of their politics (they would have all been Leftists today) are also made proof by death against the comfortable numbness that comes with age. We mustnt forget that when Keats wrote To Autumn in 1819  the year of the Peterloo Massacre, when Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and George Eliot were born, and the stethoscope was invented  he was excitedly starting a life of poetry and not serenely ending it.

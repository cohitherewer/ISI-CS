                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FEAR TO ROCK THE BOAT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The State has clearly lost all credibility with the people. Nearly everyone you speak to says that the successful encounter with the terrorists who triggered the recent Delhi explosions, was fake and arranged, and was staged to save the face of a government incapacitated while dealing with such issues in recent times, a home minister in denial and under attack because of his failure to handle eruptions of different kinds across India. Nobody trusts the home ministry and the various agencies and authorities mandated to ensure law, order and peace. The crackdown in the capital was so quick and efficient that it just was not credible as the confessions came out with ease on our television screens. Indians tried to swallow the story but disbelief overwhelmed most.        
	Delhi refused to recognize and address the Jammu and Kashmir flare-up with the political immediacy that the situation on the ground demanded. The flip-flop was suicidal. Had the Congress broken with the Peoples Democratic Party, walked away from a failed alliance and stood apart, ethical and correct, it would have given the people in the state a clear assurance that vote bank politics was a thing of the past and that the renewal of faith and a reconstruction of peace and normality were far more critical than sitting in the treasury benches of a state in turmoil. In that case the Congress may have proved itself as a saviour and the future victor. Petty politics, greed to remain in power till the last possible moment, faulty intellect, a gross lack of ideas and alternatives, a deep-seated fear of rocking the boat lest they be turned out on their face into the fog  all these seemed to have compelled the unforgivable error of judgment on the part of the Congressmen.                
	New mantra        
	In Mumbai, the chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, looked on without remorse or disgust as the streets were taken over unconstitutionally by the men of Raj Thackeray. As they spelt out their threats and paraded on the streets, defeating every rule and tenet of the laws of India, a weak and scared Shivraj Patil in Delhi, comfortably ensconced in his privileged environs, barricaded and safe, was unwilling to stop the horror. Indians watched the tragic farce being enacted day upon day, with the authority condoning all that is illegal and unwarranted in any civil society. The two questions being asked are why the chief minister has not been asked to step down and return to his constituency, and why the home minister continues to be insulated from his unjustifiable failures.        
	Cut to the states that are not ruled by the Congress or its allies in the United Progressive Alliance. The conflagration of violence against Christians and their churches in Karnataka and Orissa was sickening. I cannot recall any such brutal incident in those states over scores of years. Therefore, what was it that could have forced the seeming harmony and relative calm into a volatile, intolerant, illegal assault that pierced the plural and diverse fabric of both the states? Famed as a progressive and buoyant state, Karnataka has regressed with these acts that are unconstitutional and which the chief minister from the Bharatiya Janata Party did not diffuse immediately and permanently. This first-ever BJP government to put its roots down in a state south of the Vindhyas has managed to destroy the ethos, amity and the harmony of the people. The new mantra of the National Democratic Alliance seems to be  dictate, polarize and rule, force the minorities to fall in line and live the life of second class citizens in their homeland, create fear, disregard their intrinsic sensibilities of plurality, break other faiths, talk economics and distract the critical onslaught. How will India respond? Will she embrace divisive politics or will Akhand Bharat prevail?

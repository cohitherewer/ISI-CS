                                                                                                                 WEAPONS OF MASS COMMUNICATION                                  ALL EARS      To be or not to be a Blackberry                                                  
	In the world of mobile phones, the Blackberry is a tragic hero. For it has suffered a cruel reversal of fate. It was received with great fanfare because it combined the features of a highly-advanced mobile phone with that of a computer. In the time of global terrorism, this uniqueness itself has become its fatal flaw. The Indian government has proposed a ban on the device because emails sent out from it cannot be intercepted for security reasons. The Blackberry is feeling lost. To be and not to be a mobile phone: such is the crux of its existence.        
	This dilemma itself, of being a phone yet not to behave like one, reveals the extent to which information technology has evolved. The mind of its users, too, has evolved. When the mobile phone was introduced in India following economic liberalization in the Nineties, it reached an exclusive clientele. It was expensive and too sophisticated for mass consumption. But it caught on gradually. Economists correlated access to mobile phones and the rising development index.         
	In May 2007, The Economist reported how mobile phones had revolutionized fish-markets across Kerala between 1997 and 2000. The pre-mobile days were fraught with uncertainties. A huge catch of sardines one day did not always turn out to be a lucky haul. If every other fisherman had been showered with sardines on that particular day, the price of fish in the local markets would tumble down. There was little sense in taking a chance at other coastal markets. For it was impossible to guess the rates in those markets. Even if the rates were good enough, by the time the fishermen had sailed down with their booty, the freshly-caught sardines were likely to start rotting.        
	Mobile phones changed things radically. The fishermen had the option of checking out the local as well as the coastal markets before sailing ashore. This information helped them not only to fetch better prices, but also to minimize the loss of time and keep their catch fresh.         
	In urban India today, such a life-transforming impact of the mobile phone sounds like a fable: distant, modest, even prelapsarian. Mobile phones are now ubiquitous. The cheapest things that you could get in the Great Indian Free Market are call rates, costing less than a rupee, to say nothing of the bonus talktime. This not only means greater connectivity, but also a better economy. In one of the many optimistic formulations of Western economists, an extra 10 mobile phones per 100 people in a typical developing country leads to an additional 0.59 percentage points of growth in GDP per person. As economist Robert Jensen put it: Information makes markets work, and markets improve welfare.        
	Information also makes terror work. Scores of mobile phones have been used as detonators in bomb attacks. The mobile revolution has been enmeshed in a more sinister counter-revolution, where information yields perverse power and destroys, not improves, welfare.         
	Last year, Mohammad Haneef, an Indian doctor working in Australia, was held on the suspicion of terrorist activities because he had given his SIM card to one of his cousins, accused in the unsuccessful Glasgow attacks. With striking similarity, Aftab Alam Ansari, a CESC employee, was picked up in connection with the 2006 Uttar Pradesh blasts. Ansari had allowed a stranger to make a call from his phone. That call-record had come up in the course of the investigation.         
	There have been other instances in which camera phones were used as means of blackmail and coercion. Recently, Srabonti Ghosh and her daughter were murdered in Jagacha because they were allegedly blackmailing a couple after framing them in a sleaze racket with images taken on her phone. Mobile phones have also turned blackmail into an instrument of justice, as sting operations conducted by the media have shown. For young people, the mobile phone not only promises a pot-pourri of entertainment (FM radio, mp3-player) but is also sometimes an accomplice. A couple of days ago, a friend was taken aback by the sight of a schoolboy painstakingly photographing pages somebody elses class notes with his mobile.         
	As markets become freer, human intelligence, too, starts opening out in unforeseen ways. The mobile phone, which was once the key to a better-connected world, is outgrowing its original use. Merchants of the free market, of welfare and of terror now benefit equally from its myriad prospects.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

	 Ugly Duckling (Revenge Ink, 12.99) by Amita Mukerjee is the first title to be released by Revenge Ink, the Paris-based publishing company set up by the author and her brother. This is the story of the travails of Mia Makarand, an Indian-American translator trying to make it big (or just land a job) in Paris. Irreverent and funny, there is an attractive sauciness in Mukerjees writing. But, perhaps because the authors own literary career as a publisher-writer hinges on this book, she tries too hard. The caustic wit is overdone from the second page onwards. Constructions such as: I retreated into my shell like a tortoise. Into my burrow like a rabbit. Into my sheath like a shell-shocked penis, while amusing, can get tedious if applied to convey every change in mood or movement of the principal character. One is still prompted to read on, though, because Mias brand of bitterness with the world is intelligent and entertaining. With better editing, this would be an enjoyable  and shorter  novel about the lives of a bunch of smart working- women in Paris.                          
	 The Untold Charminar: Writings on Hyderabad (Penguin, Rs 399) edited by Syeda Imam is a collection of essays that captures the changing landscape and culture of Hyderabad, a city whose past is as magical and entwined in the grandeur of the Mughals who ruled it, as its present is multicultural, hi-tech and diverse. With contributors like William Dalrymple, Shyam Benegal, Mark Tully, Nagesh Kukunoor and many others, this anthology is a veritable treasury of fascinating anecdotes on Hyderabad. There are, among others, tales of the elaborate sartorial tastes of the nawabs, how the kulcha (a type of fried Indian bread) found itself emblazoned on the flag of the first ruler of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah, and also the story of Ramlu, the decrepit owner of a quaint pickle shop who became an inspiration for the poet, Shaaz Tamkanath. The Untold Charminar is a valuable book that chronicles the people and places that make up old as well as modern Hyderabad, and the tales that contribute to the citys unique charm.                          
	 The Silent Raga (HarperCollins, Rs 395) by Ameen Merchant is as tumultuous as the progressing notes of a night raga. For a debut novel, it is written with surprising ease and maturity. This is the story of two Tamil-Brahmin sisters brought up in an orthodox south Indian village and the choices they make with regard to their past. The novel has been shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize this year. Indian classical music pervades the story, shaping not only the structure of the narrative, but also the lives of its main characters. This is a finely wrought story of tradition and its necessary compromise in the pursuit of fame.                          Solutions For The Worlds Biggest Problems: Costs and Benefits (Cambridge, Rs 495) edited by Bjrn Lomborg collates analyses of 23 global problems  classified under broad categories such as economy, environment, governance, and health and population  and proposes solutions for their eradication, or, at least, mitigation. Leading economists, advisors to the World Bank, professors of law, and environment scientists make up the panel of contributors to this collection. The lack of intellectual property rights, terrorism, pollution, global warming and drug abuse are only some of the many challenges that are discussed. The inter-relations between problems and the need for the inclusion of the public in tackling these issues are emphasized. This book, though heavy with charts and statistics, adopts a functional, hands-on approach to explaining these global problems and recommends practical solutions for them.

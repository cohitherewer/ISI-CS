	Tigers are no longer burning bright in Indian forests. The number of tigers, according to the latest and more reliable census, is down to a meagre 1,411. The word reliable is used advisedly, since the new figure is based on the scientific method using camera traps. Previously, the tiger census in India was prepared on the basis of pugmarks that is now considered to be bogus. The pugmark census is based on the assumption that it is possible to track impressions of all tigers simultaneously in India. From such data individual tigers can be distinguished and counted. The problem with this method is that tigers cannot be identified in this way even in an environment as restricted as the zoo. The more scientific method involves fixing of camera traps in forest paths frequented by tigers. The tigers electronically trigger off the camera and the pictures reveal stripe patterns that are unique to individual tigers. These identifications are used to estimate tiger populations in an area. The camera trap method is definitely more accurate than the pugmark census. The tiger count arrived at by this method reveals an alarming decline in the tiger population of India.        
	The reasons for this decline are not difficult to pin down. Encroachments by homo sapiens have drastically eroded the natural habitat of the panthera tigris. The decline of the forest cover has inevitably led to a dramatic decline in the number of animals that are a natural prey of the tiger  the deer, for example. The tiger has been forced to attack cattle and even, sometimes, humans. This has resulted in the utterly spurious argument that tigers and humans are opposed to each other. In reality, both tigers and human beings have co-existed. Poaching and sheer greed are two other factors that contribute to attacks on tigers. Poaching can easily be eliminated by better policing on the part of forest officials and by exemplary punishment of offenders. The most important reason, however, is official  and even societal  ignorance and indifference. It is often said that a country like India cannot afford to spend any of its resources on tigers. This myopia overlooks the factor that saving the tiger is an integral part of saving the environment. The tiger is an apex species, at the top of the food chain. It is also an indicator species whose healthy numbers attest to environmental health. Men are dependent on tigers.

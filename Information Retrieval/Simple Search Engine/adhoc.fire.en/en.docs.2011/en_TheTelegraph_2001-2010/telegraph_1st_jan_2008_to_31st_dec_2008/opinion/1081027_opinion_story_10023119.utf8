	The political drama in Thailand is advancing along predictable lines. The Thai supreme court has sentenced the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, to two years in prison for the misuse of political office and corruption during his term. The ruling comes as a shot in the arm for the Peoples Alliance for Democracy that has been conducting a violent agitation against the ruling Peoples Power Party, whose government is seen as Mr Shinawatras proxy rule. He was ousted in 2006 and his Thai Rak Thai Party disbanded. The judgment will do no immediate harm to Mr Shinawatra, who fled months ago to the United Kingdom from where he has been functioning for a while. His extradition will not happen in a hurry. But the ruling will do severe damage to the authority of Somchai Wongsawat, who has been holding ground with difficulty after the dismissal of his predecessor, Sundaravej Samak, and who is Mr Shinawatras brother-in-law. Thailand has already witnessed the spectacle of the prime minister clambering over the fence to save himself from agitators. The judgment may now have him on the run. His government is discredited, and he has no support from the army. Worse for him is the recent sympathy shown by the royalty to the protesters.        
	The anti-Shinawatra movement has divided Thailand down the middle. Mr Shinawatra enjoys the support of the rural poor, who form the majority and want a return to his regime of debt relief and cheap loans. In contrast, the upper- and middle-class PAD supporters are determined to purge Thailand of Mr Shinawatra and his corrupt practices. But the alternative they suggest  a parliament where legislators will be appointed  will guarantee Thailand neither democracy nor a corruption-free order. By befriending the rural poor, Mr Shinawatra had tapped into a problem that has to be attended to if Thailand wishes to see the back of him, and for good.

	Peoples president                  
	Sir  Barack Obamas win is historic not only for the African-American community but also for coloured people across the world (A dream alive in our time, Nov 6). Going beyond the consideration of race, the world at large would benefit from Obamas term at the White House if he keeps the promise of a mature leadership that he has repeatedly made during his campaign. As the president-elect, Obama will have to steer the United States of America away from a politics of confrontation, intervention, fear, hatred and unilateralism towards peace, harmony and justice. The tottering economy also needs to be fixed. One way of going about this would be to end the on-going war in Iraq. The Bush administration has already squandered a fortune to sustain a needless war in Iraq, apart from creating scores of enemies across west Asia. Obama would be able to inspire some measure of trust and confidence in the bigger players of the Middle East if he sincerely tries to end the conflict in Iraq.           
	Having said all this, I am aware that the Bush administration has been extremely good for India. It made a sustained effort to forge a strong bond with our country  by starting the outsourcing boom, signing the nuclear deal and forming better military ties. But the US has not bestowed this largesse on us from the goodness of its heart. All this is part of the new US strategy of using India politically and militarily to counter the rise of China. India should be cautious of being used as a hedge against China. Once the euphoria subsides, Indians would watch out for Obamas policy on Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,        Saptarshi Ghosh, Middlesex, UK     
	Sir  Barack Obama has given a fitting riposte to Arnold Schwarzeneggers tasteless suggestion that the former should put on some flesh if he is to take on the onerous task of presidency. By electing a coloured man their president, Americans have proved that it takes more than muscles to get the most important job in the world.           
	Yours faithfully,         Nandini Saraf, Calcutta      
	Sir  Hard work and perseverance can conquer every hindrance, and Barack Obama has proved this beyond any doubt. Coming from a humble background with little experience of diplomacy, he won the elections on the strength of his tireless campaigning. Now that the much-awaited change has arrived at White House, Americans can hope to see better days. Apart from sorting out the present economic crisis, Obama will also have to reinvent a new foreign policy and improve his countrys fallen image before the international community.  
	Yours faithfully,        Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune      
	Sir  A win like Barack Obamas is only possible in a really free country like the US. Indian politicians have a lot to learn from this election. It was heartening to note the Stars and Stripes, carried by huge gatherings to the concession address of John McCain as also to the victory address of Barack Obama. For ordinary Americans and their politicians, the nation comes before self-interest. So they chose to bear the national flag instead of flaunting their party affiliations. Indians can only dream of a future when political parties would learn to accept victory and defeat with equanimity.           
	Yours faithfully,        Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta      
	Sir  Even more distinction has been added to Barack Obamas already historic win by the fact that never for once did the president-elect play the race card during his campaign. This should give Indian politicians something to think about beyond their divisive vote bank strategies.          
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi     
	Sir  By electing Barack Obama as their 44th president, Americans have given us the hope that Indians, too, would perhaps put aside caste, creed and religion and vote for change and progress in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. As the sacrifices of Martin Luther King and his fellow-fighters have not gone to waste, so Mahatma Gandhis vision will also bear fruit. The old guards of our country should retire gracefully and make way for the young to come up and lead the nation.           
	Yours faithfully,        Omar Luther King, Delhi      
	Sir  The American elections have proved what a literate and evolved democracy can achieve. In the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson passed the voting act, allowing blacks to vote for the first time. Amazingly, in a span of four decades, the community has moved from fighting for basic rights to leading the richest and the most powerful country in the world.           
	Yours faithfully,        Sumantra Banerjee, Calcutta
      
	Sir  The emphatic win of Barack Obama may be a sign of change, but the global media continue to wax eloquent on Obamas race and colour more than the things he has promised to do in his tenure at the White House. Some of the media have even insinuated that the fight was between black and white. Instead of upholding Obama as a young, hard-working man with a vision and commitment to regain the lost image of his country, they overemphasized less important issues. Thankfully, Obama himself proved to be the biggest leveller: he never put race before merit in his campaign and now that he has made it to the White House, he is sure to avoid that path.  
	Yours faithfully,       
Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

	Death by hanging                  
	Sir  Two people hanging out of a crowded train died when they crashed against a transformer post between Belgharia and Dum Dum stations recently (Train bursting at seams, two passengers die, Nov 20). Accidents have become a regular affair in local trains on the Sealdah line. The number of trains on this route is inadequate and this leads to overcrowding and raises the chances of accidents. Passengers have little choice but to board crowded compartments and hang on for dear life to reach their destinations during rush hour. To lessen the risk posed to their lives, Eastern Railway authorities must introduce extra coaches, increase the number of trains and remove defunct electric posts with immediate effect.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After the death of two passengers, Rajkumar Mahato and Kallol Sarkar, near Belgharia station the other day, the railway authorities hastily dismantled the killer transformer pole. But this alone is not enough and the railways have a long way to go before it makes passengers lives safe. Many signal posts and poles, each of them a potential killer, remain dangerously close to the tracks and the authorities have made no attempts to relocate them at a safer distance. There are also not enough trains running in the Sealdah-Barrackpore sector. In the few crowded trains that ply, commuters are forced to travel by hanging from the doorway. Merely filling posts through railway recruitment examinations conducted all over the country will not do. The railways ministry must understand that apart from generating employment opportunities, it also has the responsibility to make railway journeys safe and comfortable for passengers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The mishap near Belgharia has once again highlighted the indifference of the railway officials towards the plight of daily commuters. Belgharia station, like many other stops, faces several problems, including overcrowding and poor maintenance of level crossings. Trains often run late as well. Constructing a subway will reduce the risks posed by these level crossings. As for the problem of trains running late, the authorities should think of providing refunds to passengers, following the examples set by many railway networks in the West. Extending the Metro facility from Dum Dum to Barrackpore might also help ease the congestion in the trains on this route. People at Belgharia station continue to suffer because of these persistent problems, and lives continue to be lost even as politicians get busy with other ambitious projects.           
	Finally, a word on the blockade of railway tracks by agitated passengers after the accident in which two people got killed on November 19. Their anger is perfectly understandable, but they should remember that blocking tracks and disrupting services will not serve any purpose. Things can only improve if the concerned authorities and politicians are made accountable for their failures.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The fatal accident involving two commuters at Belgharia station in a Sealdah-bound local train has once again trained the spotlight on the issue of passenger safety. Similar tragedies have occurred in the past too. Rajen Hazra, a resident of Sonarpur, had been grievously hurt after he had fallen on the tracks after hitting a signal post in February this year. A bleeding Hazra lay unattended for a long time and finally succumbed to his injuries as he could not be taken to a hospital on account of a protest organized by irate passengers. This time too, angry commuters had put up a blockade after the accident thereby inconveniencing many others who travel on that route. I commute by train regularly from Howrah station every day, and the journey threatens to become more difficult with every passing day. The number of bogies is inadequate, and crowds make disembarking a harrowing experience. The authorities have also never deemed it necessary to put an end to ticketless travel. In the Howrah-Burdwan section, many people travel without tickets and usually get down at Liluah from the opposite side. The popularity of train travel has increased because many like them see it as a free ride. If this menace is not checked immediately, it will only increase the volume of passengers further and result in losses for the railways. If the onus of ticket-checking is passed on to a private agency, things will take a better turn and revenues will increase. A number of railway stations are being upgraded as model stations, but have the authorities thought about how to handle the swell of passengers? It is not possible to increase the frequency of trains so introducing 15-bogie shuttle trains is possibly the only way to end the ordeal for passengers. The frequent passenger deaths in trains are only a grim reminder of how unsafe commuters lives have become on account of the callous attitude of authorities.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Rajkumar Mahato and Kallol Sarkar died tragically in the accident at Belgharia. But I was surprised to note that the railways authorities did not announce a compensation for the victims families. After all, isnt the railways responsible for the freak accident? Had the pole been removed earlier, two lives could have been saved that day.          
	Yours faithfully,

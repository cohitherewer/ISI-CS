	Where the streets hold no hope                  
	Sir  Calcuttas roads can turn an optimist into a cynic. Every time I step out of the house, I am greeted by honking, smoke-spewing vehicles. Then there are traffic snarls and accidents  caused by people breaking rules with impunity and cops turning a blind eye. The pavements and sidewalks, full of hawkers, stay under water for weeks, every monsoon. The promises of new flyovers, hawker eviction drives, alternate fuels and an improved sewerage system remain unfulfilled. If this is not cause for despair, what is?           
	Yours faithfully,         Anagh Pal, Calcutta 
        
	Freedom song          
	Sir  The story of Kashmir Singh, who was recently freed after spending 35 years in Pakistani prisons on charges of spying, is the stuff of novels (Home to shy wife after 35 years, Mar 5). Singh had been handed the death penalty in the Seventies but survived because the sentence, for some reason, had not been carried out. Ansar Burney, the Pakistan human rights minister, met him during a visit to a Lahore jail. He then took up Singhs case with President Pervez Musharraf, who pardoned him. At a time when democracy is all set to make a comeback in Pakistan, Singhs release would help improve Pakistans ties with India. It is also possible that Musharraf decided to pardon Singh to show the world that he cares. If only Musharraf made such magnanimous gestures frequently, other Indian prisoners would be able to win their freedom as well.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Kashmir Singh is now a free man. But there are others from India who remain behind bars in Pakistan. Successive Indian prime ministers have done little to free our jawans imprisoned in Pakistan. Indira Gandhi did not insist on the release of Indian prisoners before she signed the Simla Agreement in 1972, although her government released over 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war as a gesture of goodwill. New Delhis betrayal of its armed forces has been legendary. In the war with Pakistan just after Independence, Jawaharlal Nehru declared a unilateral ceasefire scuppering the gains made by the army on the ground. Indian soldiers are languishing in Pakistani jails because of our governments indifference.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

      
	Sir Kashmir Singh may have lost 35 years of his life rotting in Pakistans prisons. Today he has tasted freedom at long last. The governments of both India and Pakistan should now strive to prepare a list of PoWs and then release them. Such a gesture will generate goodwill among the citizens, bringing the two nations closer to each other. However, only innocents should be pardoned, and not those who have been jailed on the account of crimes such as espionage and militancy.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar made his detractors eat humble pie once again (Master of century blasts doubters, March 3). Tendulkars performance in the finals against Australia have silenced the likes of Sanjay Manjrekar who had begun to doubt his abilities. It is a pity that Tendulkar is made to stand trial repeatedly by his countrymen, despite his contributions to Indian cricket. Manjrekar got the timing of his barbs completely wrong this time. I hope that he will now think of retiring from the world of cricket-writing. I would also request the Indian skipper to take away Tendulkars contributions in the finals and see where his team stands. That would stop him from asking Tendulkar to contribute regularly with the bat.          
	Yours faithfully,

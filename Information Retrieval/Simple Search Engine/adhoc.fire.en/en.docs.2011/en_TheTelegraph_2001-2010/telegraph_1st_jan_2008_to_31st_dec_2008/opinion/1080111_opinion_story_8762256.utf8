                           Mitra in Galpo Hekimshaheb
              
	Though there is no dearth of rich theatre scripts in Bengali, publishers willing to back English translations of the same are sadly few, unlike Bengali poetry or fiction. Perhaps it has to do with the linguistic challenges that dialogue presents, perhaps it is simply because there are fewer readers of plays as texts and those who want to perform these plays get their own vernacular versions made. Indeed, of the 70 odd plays of Manoj Mitra, including classics like Alokanandar Putrokanya (The Children of Alokananda), Shobhajatra (The Procession), Chhayar Prashad (The Shadow Palace) and others, several have been translated into Hindi, Oriya, Assamese or Tamil but only two, Banchharams Orchard (Sajano Bagan) and Royal Encounter (Rajdarshan) have appeared in English. And it was left to the publisher of Banchharams Orchard  Seagull Books  to bring out a collection of his plays called The Theatre of Conscience. 
    
	Here, translated by Mousumi Roy Chowdhury, are three of Mitras best plays: Galpo Hekimshaheb (The Tale of Hekim-shaheb), Chak Bhanga Modhu (Honey from a Broken Hive) and Chhayar Prashad. According to Roy Chowdhury, these plays are similar because they all address issues such as violence, justice and ethics and can be called theatre of conscience, where conscience is not restricted to its instrumental moral sensebut in the larger sense of consciousness.
    
	There is an elaborate introductory note by the translator and the appendix includes a priceless interaction between theatre scholar Samik Bandyopadhyay and Manoj Mitra, reprinted from a Seagull Theatre Quarterly. The interview throws light on several aspects of Mitras works (for instance, his propensity to weave a plot around one particular element  a tree in Hekim-shaheb and Chhayar Prashad, a chariot in Shobhajatra), his childhood, his career and his views on acting, direction and the problems facing theatre today. 
    
	Roy Chowdhurys translation, however, falls short of expectations. Perhaps, because Mitras style is not easy to reproduce in English and the many associations triggered by certain Bengali words are lost in translation. Roy Chowdhury claims, I have tried to attend very closely to the corporal sense of the language in the plays, i.e., the alliterations, the rural speech patterns, the violence, the rhythms, but there are several instances where one wonders whether the translated dialogues could not have been improved with better substitutes for certain words. 
    
	In Hekim-shaheb for instance, when the Juggi snarls, mere mere tattu kore diyechen, the word colt (beaten us into colts) is hardly appropriate. A colt as a young horse is associated with promise, vigour and virility, quite the opposite of tattu which is a small species of horse and implies a reduction in size and wealth. Perhaps pony would have been a better alternative. The translator, however, does a commendable job in the introductory notes of the plays. She records the genesis of Hekim-shaheb from Mitras chance discovery of an ancient Hekimi text and recounts the way in which a small newspaper item triggered the writing of Chak Bhanga Modhu. Mitras approach to historical plays, the play on kingship and parenthood in Chhayar Prashad, responses of other directors to Chak Bhanga Modhu are all recorded in this collection. Roy Chowdhury dwells at length on the character of Dwaipayan, highlighting his social status as a marginalized transvestite in The Shadow Palace and his passion for other outcasts. The role, memorably played by Mitra himself, is certainly one of his greatest literary achievements. However, Roy Chowdhury omits the parallel Mitra drew between Dwaipayan and the concept of the ardhanarishwara. Uninitiated readers of this English translation of Chhayar Prashad may miss out on the implication that as ardhanarishwara, Dwaipayan represents the perfect balance of masculine and feminine qualities  of the powers of creation and protection conjoined.

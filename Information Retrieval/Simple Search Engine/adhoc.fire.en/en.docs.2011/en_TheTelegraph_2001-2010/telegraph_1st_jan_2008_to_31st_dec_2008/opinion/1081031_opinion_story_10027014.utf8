	Major threat                  
	Sir  Until the arrest of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur appeared on front pages of national dailies, the electronic media remained rather standoffish about the Malegaon blasts (Terror net scoops up fiery Sadhvi, Oct 25). Most news channels were not half as thorough in their coverage of the terror strike that shattered the Muslim-majority areas of Malegaon and Madosa as they were during the Gujarat blasts a few months ago. In the wake of this disinterest came the knee-jerk reactions of certain leaders of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, as they became anxious to dissociate themselves from Pragya.           
	First, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, denied knowing Pragya at all, although she had been associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad, a student arm of his party, BJP, and the Durga Vahini, a womens wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in the 1990s. Then it was the turn of Ajay Singh, son of the Congress leader, Arjun Singh, to insist that the sadhvi had nothing to do with Swami Avadheshanand Giri, her mentor, just because the father and son duo happen to be Giris followers. If politicians in India are able to cover their tracks with such impunity, is there any reason why the common people should feel reassured when the police claim to have identified the terrorists? For all we know, gullible members of the minority community may be pulled up and presented as criminals, even as the real culprits go scot free.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Musheer Ahmed Mubarki, Kharagpur
                
	Sir  Is it only the prerogative of non-Hindus to be violent, and that too unprovoked? This must be the question troubling many members of the majority community across the country. People are probably equally alarmed by the ease with which religion is, from time to time, turned into an instrument of indoctrination. The preachings of some holy man or woman can make ordinary god-fearing individuals instantly forgetful of their humanity. In India, low rates of literacy and the misuse of religion for vote bank politics make ordinary citizens so that much more vulnerable to the wiles of fake preachers like Sadhvi Pragya.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Pramod Gupta, Delhi

                
	Sir  Sadhvi Pragyas suspected involvement in the Malegaon blasts should make the saffronites think twice before turning the minority community into a scapegoat every time a terror attack takes place in the country. After a series of blasts ripped through Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi earlier this year, Muslims were the first to be targeted by the authorities. In the same way, the Malegaon attacks became the ideal excuse for banning the Students Islamic Movement of India for alleged terrorist activities. The political establishment may foster this kind of stereotyping but the media, too, must accept their share of the responsibility. Hopefully, the Sadhvi Pragya case would set the standards of journalism higher. Newspapers and TV channels should be more prudent and not give in to the easy way of blaming Muslims for all perceived extremist attacks.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohd Mubarak, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The Malegaon blasts expose everything that is wrong with the police in India. Their initial reaction to this tragedy was to put it all down to a leaking gas cylinder  a preposterous piece of guesswork. When no evidence to support this claim was found, the next best thing was to blame the Muslims. Finally, the administration has been forced to eats its words since Sadhvi Pragya, and her coterie, appeared on the scene.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The alleged involvement of Hindu outfits in the Malegaon blasts should jolt the administration to take stock of the ground realities. So far, the line of investigation followed by the police has been based on the understanding that all terrorists are, as a rule, Muslims. The idea has been so firmly embedded in the popular consciousness that the death of Bajrang Dal workers while making crude bombs in Nanded (April 2006) and Kanpur (August 2008) went almost unnoticed. Hindu far-Right demonstrations routinely feature men flaunting guns, tridents and other weapons, but raise little hue and cry in the media. Would the media remain equally unfazed by a similar gathering of gun-totting Muslim youths? Political leaders like Bal Thackeray and Narendra Modi make inflammatory comments, bordering on hate speech, on the minority community. Other than the liberal intellectuals, the rest of the country does not seem to be much perturbed by their views.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ram Punyani, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Perhaps for the first time, the face of Hindu terror has been revealed in a major way with the arrest of Sadhvi Pragya and her accomplices for masterminding the Malegaon blasts. This incident has opened up a whole new front in the governments fight against terror. So far, the United Progressive Alliance was accused of being soft on terror. It is now quite apparent that the government was not ready to demonize the Muslims under pressure from the Opposition. On the contrary, it is expedient that the UPA cracks down on saffron terror severely. In view of the anti-Christian attacks, and the recent arrest of some Hindu extremists, the government ought to take stern action against the offenders.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The president next door
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE PRESIDENT NEXT DOOR                          - Chile is one of the unpublicized success stories of Indian trade        Diplomacy - K.P.

	In diplomacy, neighbourhood matters. It certainly does for India in Chile. Across the road from the residence of the Indian ambassador on a street called Burgos in the Santiago neighbourhood of Las Condes is the house where Michelle Bachelet has been living since she was elected Chiles president two years ago. When Bachelet moved into the house in 2006, the Indian ambassador, Susmita Gongulee Thomas, welcomed the president as her neighbour with a bowl of chicken curry that the envoy cooked and sent across the road. The president responded by sending a hand-painted scroll to the ambassador with a note of thanks.         
	For 57 years, Indias successive ambassadors to Chile have lived in the same house on Burgos Street. With the rising social and other demands on the Indian embassy in Santiago and with new, better and more modern residences springing up in the Chilean capital, South Block approved a proposal some time ago for the ambassador to move to a more spacious house in another neighbourhood. Then, shortly after Bachelet was sworn in as president in March 2006, she moved into the house opposite the Indian diplomatic residence. Quickly, the ambassador dropped all plans to look for a new house.         
	The seat of Chiles presidency is the Palacio de la Moneda (Mint Palace). Many Indians of this columnists generation have considerable emotional attachment to Chiles presidential palace because of the unforgettable images of the aerial bombing of that palace during the military coup against the socialist president, Salvador Allende, in September 1973. Allende committed suicide in La Moneda Palace. It also served as the presidents residence  the Chilean equivalent of Rashtrapati Bhavan  between 1845 and 1952. Since then, Chiles presidents are allowed to find a suitable house of their choice elsewhere to live in. La Moneda is now used only for official functions and that is how Bachelet became the Indian ambassadors neighbour two years ago.              
	The rejection by Thomas of the plans for a new house in favour of staying put on Burgos Street was a perceptive decision by the ambassador which has altered the balance sheet of Indo-Chilean relations. By the time Bachelets four-year term in office ends in 2010, it could have the effect of having changed the content of ties between the two countries. Earlier this month, when preparations were in their final stages for the visit of the Indian president, Pratibha Patil, to Chile, an Indian business delegation that was accompanying Patil discovered in New Delhi that they were having trouble getting their visas to go to Santiago. Rules in Chile required that the Indian businessmen first procure an invitation from their Chilean associates. Even then, these Indians could get only single entry visas valid for one month. It amounted to a discrimination of sorts because Americans do not need visas at all to visit Chile. Businessmen from major Asian countries are entitled to get special APEC visas because their countries are members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group. But Indians had to run around in circles to do business with Chile.        
	The problem of getting business visas was an issue that the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had personally raised with Bachelets predecessor, Ricardo Lagos, when he visited New Delhi in January 2005. But nothing came of it despite efforts by the chambers of commerce in both countries and business houses keen to increase trade and investment. So, in the run-up to Patils arrival in Santiago, the Indian ambassador mentioned the problem to her neighbour. And sure enough, a few days before Patil left New Delhi on her maiden foreign tour, orders were issued in Santiago dispensing with the requirement of an invitation for Indian businessmen. They will also now get six-month multiple visas to visit Chile.        
	Indian businessmen are keen to travel to Santiago because Chile is one of the unpublicized success stories for Indian trade. Chile was the first Latin American country to sign a trade agreement with India: that was 52 years ago. But the agreement lapsed 10 years later and although a new pact was initialled in 1972, the aftermath of the coup detat against Allende and Indira Gandhis distaste for the ways of General Augusto Pinochet meant that the trade agreement was, in fact, redundant. At the end of 1994, the Chileans formally terminated that pact.        
	In 2004, before Thomas left India for Chile, it was agreed at a series of meetings in the commerce ministry in New Delhi that a concerted effort would be made to change the composition of Indian exports to Chile  from traditional handicrafts and such to motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and the like. The effort has paid off.         
	In 2003, bilateral trade was just $292.8 million. By last year, this figure had touched nearly $2.2 billion. Today, Maruti cars and Telco commercial vehicles are seen frequently on the roads of Santiago. Indian pharmaceutical products are sold in medical stores across Chile. These figures do not include Indian exports of $32.7 million last year to Chiles Iquique Free Trade Zone in the northern part of the country. One in 15 companies operating in the Iquique Free Trade Zone is Indian.        
	Indian diplomacy must pay attention to Chile in the next few years and make the most of Bachelets commitment to fostering relations with India because Chile is a country whose economic survival is linked to trade. According to estimates given to this columnist in Santiago in the last fortnight, 65 per cent of Chiles gross domestic product comes from trade. An additional 15 per cent comes from services. Trading countries tend to look abroad for integration. They recognize huge markets abroad for commerce and investment. Chile offers India a pattern for bilateral relations in Latin America similar to what Singapore offers India in Southeast Asia. And that includes a wide range of sectors, including defence. New Delhi has successfully exploited the opportunities offered by Singapore. It is now time to do the same with Santiago.         
	While Indias efforts for a free trade agreement and a bilateral investment protection agreement with the United States of America are languishing, it makes sense to look at Chile as a springboard for Indian commercial entities to go to both Europe and the US. Because Chile has FTAs with Europe, Canada, Mexico and the US, those markets levy zero tariffs for most products exported from Chile.              
	At the end of Patils visit to Santiago, the firm impression carried back by Indian journalists is that Bachelets Chile is looking to India for leadership in many areas. There is a deep realization among Chileans that like much of Latin America, they too did everything that the Americans and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund wanted them to do in the aftermath of the collapse of socialism worldwide, hoping for growth. But growth proved elusive and the hopes of the people for prosperity turned out to be illusory.        
	Many Chileans now look at India as a model for development. More important, they feel an attraction to international structures that India, Brazil and South Africa are together trying to create, such as their joint IBSA grouping or BRIC  Brazil, Russia, India and China. Chileans are aware that the countrys small size makes it impossible that it would be a big player on the global stage, unlike the BRIC or IBSA States. In the Seventies and Eighties, Indira Gandhi actively promoted relations with countries that looked up to India for leadership. These later became the bulwark of support for India at the United Nations and in fora like the non-aligned movement. There has been a breach in that policy after the Cold War ended. It is time to revive that policy, and an ideal candidate for India to make that beginning with is Chile.

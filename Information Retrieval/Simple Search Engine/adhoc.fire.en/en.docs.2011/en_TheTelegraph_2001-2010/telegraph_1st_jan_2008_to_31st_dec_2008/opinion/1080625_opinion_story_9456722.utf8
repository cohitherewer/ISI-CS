The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | state of crisis: I 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATE OF CRISIS: I                                                     
	Uncertainty has no logic, but it fuels speculation. This is the principal reason why, for reasons of good governance, uncertainty needs to be stemmed before it becomes too late. There can be little doubt that the fate of the present government has become uncertain from the moment the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, articulated in no uncertain terms his desire to push through the Indo-US nuclear deal. Mr Singh is to be congratulated for displaying his intransigence against threats by communists  who support his government but are not part of it  that they will withdraw their support. The stand of the prime minister, alas, could not have come at a worst moment. To compound the political uncertainty, there is looming before the government an economic problem that demands immediate and strong handling. (The Telegraph will analyse the dimensions and implications of the economic problem in another leader to appear tomorrow.) Unfortunately, political uncertainty is not the best of conditions to take measures that are strong and, therefore, not necessarily popular.        
	The political uncertainty is somewhat self-created by the government. This is not because the prime minister has decided to be firm. On the contrary, it is because he is not being allowed by his own party to be firm enough. Mr Singh and the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, should tell their Left allies  if they at all deserve that epithet since they have blocked or tried to block every initiative of the present government  that enough is enough, and that the Left is welcome to withdraw its support if it so wants. Even without the Lefts support, the government is not in any immediate danger if it has the support of the Samajwadi Party. Mr Singh will also recall that the government of P.V. Narasimha Rao, of which he was the finance minister, did not enjoy in its last years a full majority in Parliament. The Rubicon of a falling government can be crossed when the time comes. The fear of that should not give the government a seizure that renders it ineffective.        
	The alternative is to sign the deal and to go for early polls. But a government stricken by paralysis also cannot take this extreme step. In both spheres, politics and the economy, immediate decisions need to be taken to transform the impending crisis into an opportunity. For this, decisions are required: decisions that may be harsh and unpopular. Mr Singh should be freed from the shackles of factionalism, backbiting and the greed for office that is endemic among Congressmen. As his own master, Mr Singh can then steer the government and the country out of a crisis. If faint heart never won fair lady, inactivity induced by fear never made a leader. Having dug in his heels, Mr Singh must now march in the direction of his own choice. India expects.

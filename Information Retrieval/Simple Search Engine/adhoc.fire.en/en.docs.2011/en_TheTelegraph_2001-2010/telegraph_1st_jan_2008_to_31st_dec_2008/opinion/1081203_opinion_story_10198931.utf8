                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The old   cant wait
          A year has passed since a law to protect the elderly came into force. But despite its many worthy features, it has been unable to deliver speedy justice, says Nibedita Roye                                                        
	When Shakuntala Mondal (name changed) lost her husband in a train accident, she was offered a job in his office. However, Mondal nominated her only son Rahul for the job as she believed that he would look after her for the rest of her life. What she did not know is that in her old age, her son would actually throw her out of the house.        
	Such cases are a dime a dozen in our country. To make sure that elderly people are not subjected to mental and physical neglect and cruelty, the government passed the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act (MWPSCA) on December 6, 2007. The law aims to provide speedy and inexpensive justice to elderly folk who have been ill-treated by their children or been deprived of maintenance. It has a host of worthy features, including provisions that enable parents or grandparents to claim maintenance from their children or grandchildren, and childless senior citizens to claim maintenance from their legal heirs.        
	Experts point out that the Act is a huge improvement on the existing maintenance laws under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), the law under which maintenance cases for elderly people were filed so far.        
	However, although a year has passed since the MWPSCA came into being, its effective enforcement remains a problem. Section 11 of the act says that the enforcement of the order of maintenance shall be done in the same manner as provided in Section 125 of the CrPC.        
	However, this means that the aggrieved persons have to once again face the difficulties in the present system relating to the execution of the order of maintenance, says senior advocate Ranendra Nath Bhattacharya of Alipore Judges Court, Calcutta.        
	The main difficulty, explains Manabendra Mondal, executive director of Socio Legal Aid Research and Training Centre, an NGO that deals with family disputes, is that after the magistrate gives an order of maintenance in favour of the petitioner, the contesting party often flouts the order by defaulting on paying the claim.        
	The petitioner then has to file a separate execution suit for the recovery of the maintenance amount within a period of one year. He or she also has to ensure that a notice be served on the defaulting party, asking him to show cause as to why a warrant should not be issued against him. All this boils down to extra legal expenses on the part of these elderly litigants, says Mondal.        
	Moreover, enforcement agencies are often negligent or dishonest about serving summons on the defaulting party. The latter influence or bribe the police to delay the service of summons. Bhattacharya mentions the case of one of his own clients, who, aged about 65 years, got a court order directing her son to pay her Rs 5,000 every month as maintenance. However, the son not only flouted the order but also used illegal means to manipulate the police into delaying the service of notice upon him.        
	Finally, Bhattacharya moved for an order to showcause the officer in charge of the police station, after which the son appeared and made the payment. But the entire process took a lot of time and entailed a lot of harassment for my client, says Bhattacharya.        
	Legal experts like Bhattacharya feel that the procedure for filing separate execution cases for the recovery of maintenance amount should be done away with since the defaulting party has already been served an order that directs him to pay maintenance.        
	There are other ways in which elderly litigants who wish to claim maintenance are given short shrift. For instance, when a defaulter receives a notice to pay up, he can pray for the recall of the notice by paying just a part of the arrears in the maintenance amount. In this way, he can, in fact, indefinitely prolong the process of paying the maintenance and the arrears.        
	Arun Kumar Kundu, a Calcutta-based lawyer, says that one of his clients, a retired school teacher, had been awarded Rs 1,000 a month as interim maintenance from his eldest son. But not a single penny was paid to my client, says Kundu. After six months we started an execution case for the recovery of maintenance to the tune of Rs 6,000. However, on each date for payment, my clients son would pay only Rs 500, and get away with it.        
	Experts feel that the attitude of the court also needs to change in this regard. The general attitude is that since the petitioner has initiated proceedings to recover maintenance, he or she should accept the part payments being made. Rarely, if ever, do the courts issue a warrant, directing the opposite party to pay up the entire dues at one go. This again is a hindrance to getting speedy justice, says Kundu.        
	The act does allow an interest of not less than 5 per cent and not more than 15 per cent to be awarded on the maintenance claim. But if huge arrears pile up or if the maintenance is paid in dribs and drabs, merely awarding interest on the amount is of little use.        
	The other big impediment to properly enforcing the MWPSCA is that though it provides for setting up separate tribunals to adjudicate these cases, none has been constituted so far. Section 7 of the act says that state governments must set up one or more tribunals in each sub division and that the tribunals should be presided over by an officer not below the rank of a sub-divisional officer of a state. But even after a year, no tribunal has been set up. As a result, even lawyers are continuing to file maintenance cases for the elderly under Section 125 of the CrPC, and not under the new act.        
	Clearly, while the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act is a step in the right direction, the law will give little relief to elderly people unless steps are taken to ensure its effective enforcement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From doodles to dreariness
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FROM DOODLES TO DREARINESS                              VISUAL ARTS

	All artistic families are artistic in different ways. Wry humour is perhaps the only possible response to the exhibition of paintings by the late Gobardhan Ash and his family (Journey continues, Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, November 25-30). Sandip Sarkar, in the catalogue essay, is reminded of the Tagores of Jorasanko and the Huxleys of Britain in relation to the Ashes of Begampur. It is difficult to decide if this hyperbole was more depressing than the show that followed.         
	Beginning with a doll-like figure in Gobardhan Ashs signature style, the exhibition moved on to works by his grandson, Jyotirmoy, who seemed to be the most prolific in the family. There is little to recommend in Jyotirmoys acrylics. He seems to be endlessly fascinated with the female anatomy and its most hackneyed associations. Creation depicts a single flower growing out of the pudendum. Captive shows a caged bird in the foreground and the imprint of bloody palms on stained glass behind. The lack of thinking is telling. Jyotirmoys other preoccupation is ancient history, particularly the rock sculptures of the Buddha, to which he returns with the regularity of a fixed routine. So though this series starts off with promise, the endless proliferation of the same motif begins to pall soon.        
	The other grandson, Chinmoy, is equally besotted with female nudes. The lurid blues and reds are as shocking as they are mind-numbing. And titles like Wild Beauty and Love Whisper do not leave much to the imagination.        
	Arunima, Gobardhans daughter, is more accomplished, although a little too steeped in the Santiniketan school, and particularly in the manner of Benodebehari Mukherjee. Her paintings are dappled with bright colours, alluding to Mukherjees collages. Gobardhans wife, Annapurna, is striking in her composition in gouache (The eye); otherwise she remains a faithful follower of her husband.         
	Of the sons, Nirban Ash is the more mature artist. The free play of colours  angry red, melting yellow and sedate green  gives a bristling edge to his abstract works. The figurative works are less riveting, more inclined towards the banal. Little of interest can be said about (his brother) Deborshi Ashs Happy Mood series. The inspiration for his spindly-eyed beauties is obviously Jamini Roy. These are executed with dogged precision. Deborshi paints, according to his profile, woman and states of their souls, moods, gestures and postures, and adds trees, flowers and birds in a very simple form. After such self-proclaimed simplicity, what criticism?        
	Finally, with a sigh of relief, one comes to the master himself, but there too lies disappointment. The little of Gobardhan Ash that was on display was not representative of his oeuvre. There were the brooding, solitary figures (picture) and the political art from the Fifties (Comrade), with the unmistakable tint of earthy brown and yellow ochre. But these were too few and too predictably Ash, like the rest of the portraits or the landscapes. The pen-and-ink sketches, interspersed with quotes from religious texts, compensated for the lack of novelty, but then these were perhaps just doodles by a prolific artist rather than serious works of art.

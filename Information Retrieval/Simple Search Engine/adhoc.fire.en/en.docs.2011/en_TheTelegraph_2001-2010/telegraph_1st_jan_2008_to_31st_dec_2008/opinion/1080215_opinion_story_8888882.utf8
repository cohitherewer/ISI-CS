                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Bengal's pride                  
	Sir - It feels great to have yet another boy from Calcutta bring honour to the city. Calcuttans would be proud to celebrate the success of Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, who beat top international golfers to win the Emaar MGF Indian Masters tournament ("Calcutta gets a new hero", Feb 11). Chowrasia's victory would provide a much-needed boost to a sport that does not usually get the publicity it deserves in India. Players like Chowrasia, Arjun Atwal, Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh must perform consistently for golf to have a larger following in India. Consistency is also what Chowrasia needs for his dream of playing in the US PGA tour come true.           
	Chowrasia's achievement is all the more remarkable because of the struggle that has gone into it. From his humble beginnings at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, where his father used to tend the course and he used to practise by candlelight, Chowrasia has certainly come a long way. His story reads like a fairy tale, only it is not make-believe. As such, Chowrasia is an inspiration not only to sportsmen but also to every young Indian. He has proved that lack of money does not always stand in the way of success, if one is dedicated enough.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Titas De Sarkar, Calcutta

                
	Sir - The whole of India is pleased with what Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia has achieved for himself and for the country. Yet, when the new golf champion arrives in his hometown, Calcutta, nobody is there to welcome the hero. Like any other citizen, he stands unnoticed in the taxi queue and takes a cab home ("Hey, cabbie! A hero in your backseat", Feb 12). Can such a thing happen in Calcutta, which is supposed to be a sports-crazy city? Does this mean that the only game Calcutta is really interested in is cricket? If Calcutta is prejudiced towards a single game, then such an attitude does not say much for the 'sporting' spirit of the city. If Chowrasia does not get popular attention then the game he represents will not get sponsorship, and this will adversely affect the future of golf in India. If Calcuttans continue in their partisan mindset they will be causing a great damage to Indian sports.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir - Golf is a game that, like polo, has always been associated with the wealthy and the famous. The common perception is that the idle rich play this game to while away their time. As such, the rise of Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, who lived in a modest home inside the premises of the RCGC, is spectacular indeed. Chowrasia must be congratulated not simply for winning the Indian Masters tournament in Delhi, but also for not letting the glamour associated with golf intimidate him. With such strength of mind and character, Chowrasia is bound to go places in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.N. Roy, Calcutta

                
	Marching glory          
	Sir - Watching the Republic Day parades disrupting traffic in the capital, Khushwant Singh speculates on whether this "extravagant exercise" can be done away with ("The day of the people", Feb 9). I wish Singh had lived in Calcutta to witness the marches that take place not just on January 26 but whenever political parties feel like demonstrating the 'power of the people'. Recently, I failed to reach the funeral of a dear friend in time in spite of the driver's desperate manoeuvres to get me to the burning ghat by alternative routes. I later learnt that the the streets were choked that day because of some men sitting on a dharna in Sealdah. The city comes to a standstill even if one or two roads are affected by marches since arterial roads are so few.           
	As we can do little about this state of things, maybe we can think of a plan to make the boring marches interesting. How about the men yelling in tune with blows of bugles? Political parties might also think of making their cadre march army style. In place of slovenly men trudging along, we will then have people marching in measured steps, as in a drill. That will at least be a pretty sight.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir - The editorial, "For better, probably" (Feb 2), could not quite argue the case for couples who might refuse to obey the legislation making registration of marriages mandatory. It is no use arguing about whether the State is justified or not in intervening in the private lives of individuals. Those who live in society might as well abide by its norms. If we allow our bosses to control our working lives, we might as well let the State sanction our marriages. Moreover, as a document of State consent, a marriage registration certificate provides protection in case of any harassment in future. To ensure that all marriages are registered, the government should raise the fine for not registering, and not issue ration cards to the children born out of wedlock.           
	Yours faithfully,      
G.C. Biswas, Barasat

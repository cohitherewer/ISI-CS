	In India, most nursing homes and hospitals, government or private, have to transform themselves radically, at every level, in order to become PHLA friendly. People living with HIV/AIDS continue to be stigmatized and discriminated against in Indian society, and the healthcare sector is no exception. The Centre has now been compelled by the Supreme Court to send out a circular to all states and Union territories to ensure that no hospital turns away people living with HIV/AIDS. The implementation of this circular will be monitored by the apex court, and this might prove to be a great deal of work. The Centres instructions range from the sensitization of the health sector against stigma and discrimination and free treatment at anti-retroviral therapy centres (the setting up of which by state governments is also mandated by this circular) to ensuring that every HIV+ person gets foodgrain at highly subsidized prices, together with jobcards and employment under the national rural employment guarantee scheme. Given that such schemes, apart from government healthcare, in a state like West Bengal are all in a shambles, the comprehensive pulling up mandated by the Centres circular begins to sound like another one of those well-intentioned impossibles.        
	Yet this is how the work must begin. PHLA are sent away from hospitals because of a combination of ignorance, misplaced moral attitudes and the lack of proper infection control measures including universal precautions. The problem is therefore both with individuals and with institutions or systems, and have to be tackled at both levels. This is a question of concerted awareness-raising as well as infrastructural transformation. Everything, from the need for proper pre-test counselling to the availability of gloves for everybody potentially in contact with HIV+ persons and safe disposal of waste, will have to be attended to here. And everybody, from the top doctors to ward staff, cleaners or technicians, to administrative personnel, have to be made less ignorant, and more humane. This, in turn, cannot happen in abstraction from general social change. It is deeply ironic, and rather alarming, that the Centre sends out such an all-encompassing circular when its own thinking on HIV/AIDS, and its links with homosexuality, continues to be mired in the most shocking prejudice and ignorance.

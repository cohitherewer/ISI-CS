The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Vishnu, Shiva, and is that Mr Plod? 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       VISHNU, SHIVA, AND IS THAT MR PLOD?                                   LIVING SCULPTURE      How temple workmen in Bengal had fun with Western art and style                                    From top: Hangseshwari temple, figures at the Chandranath temple and at the Lakshmi Janardan temple				                                       
	It was a wonder that burst upon me on a sleepy spring afternoon. There is no other way to express my open-mouthed reception of the Hangseshwari temple in Bansberia. I was not a tourist, I had gone to Tribeni in Hooghly district on some work, and that had nothing whatsoever to do with temples. I was a little surprised at the insistence of the lady who was helping me in my work that I see the temple even within my limited time.         
	I had heard of it, but nothing prepared me for its size and quite extraordinary architecture, with 13 minars (ratnas?) like dazzling white, folded lotuses, reminiscent of the Kremlin in shape. I have read since that it is a temple built on Tantric principles, commissioned by Raja Nrisinghadeb Roy and completed by his wife around 1814-15. At that moment, though, I knew nothing while gazing at the astonishing mixture of exquisite woodwork, stone and brick. The ceiling of the entrance framed in wood and floored in marble was like a muted Persian carpet. The deity was resting, I did not see her.         
	Next to her magnificent abode, even more amazingly, was the terracotta ekchala temple of Ananta Basudev, built, I read later, in 1649 by Raja Rameshwar Datta, its compact, perfect shape covered with the finest carving. A temple to Vishnu, its arches and pillars reminded me of the Islamic architecture of north India. Looking at the Hangseshwari temple through one of its arches (picture), I was no longer sure of where I was.        
	I was better prepared for the surprises of the Chandranath temple in Hetampur, Birbhum, having been told that the terracotta carvings on its outside surface even had Queen Victoria among numerous European-style figures. It was still startling to see the heraldic device of Imperial Britain staring at me from a lintel of one of the entrances of the temple to Shiva. And it was not just that so many men and women were obviously European  is that Mr Plod from Noddys Toyland or Robert Clive in the picture?  but also that the modelling of the figures, in contrast to those of mythical and legendary origin, was distinctly naturalistic, strongly Western, that struck me. It is as if the local workmen not only seized upon the fresh stimuli for subject-matter provided by the Europeans they saw around them, but were also taken with Western art and style. They must have had fun, experimenting.        
	One of the experiences that had prepared me for Hetampur was my wonder-struck discovery of the Lakshmi Janardan temple in Surul, Birbhum. I had gone there as unprepared as I had to Bansberia. Gods and goddesses, kings and queens are surrounded by people from all the lands of the world. In a peaceful, almost hidden corner of Birbhum, men and women from across the seas chat, queue up or simply look on, while gods and mythical heroes continue with their business (picture). Even the art consecrated to religion could not resist the rich variety that life offered.                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

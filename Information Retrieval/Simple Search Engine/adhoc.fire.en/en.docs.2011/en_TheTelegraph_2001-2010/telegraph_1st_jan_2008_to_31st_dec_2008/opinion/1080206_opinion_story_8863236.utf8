The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | May Not Be Right Always
                                                                                                              MAY NOT BE RIGHT ALWAYS                                  WORDCAGE - Stephen Hugh-Jones                                            
	There it was, in the first leader, no less, of what used to be Britains grandest newspaper. The paper was comparing last months Socit Gnrale fiasco with an earlier one: the mistakes that one rogue trader made in Singapore might have destroyed a venerable British institution, but its impact (the leader-writer meant their impact, but let that pass ) on the global economy was modest. What was this intended to convey?         
	That though the affair put an old British institution at risk, yet...? Or that, though it actually destroyed such an institution, yet...? If you happen to remember that Barings Bank was indeed brought down in 1995 by a rogue trader, you know the answer. But suppose you dont? You then face a sentence of impenetrable ambiguity. Why? Because the writer put might have when basic grammar demanded may have .        
	Might have leaves things uncertain: did X happen or not? May have looks equally vague, but in this particular may have..., but use (though not others) it is definite: X did indeed occur.         
	This misuse of one for the other is now widespread. The present-tense misuse of might for may is even commoner. To grammarians this too is flatly wrong, but it leads less often to ambiguity. If you say So-and-so might be a fine cricketer, but hes ageing, its clear you mean that he is a fine cricketer, but..., not that he might become one, but....Yet what about I might like your dog, but it smells. Do you mean that you do like your friends dog, but, alas, it does smell? Or that you could come to like it, but it smells, so you probably wont?         
	So its not just that the grammar is always wrong, but that the result is often ambiguous. Stick to may have and may and you avoid both those errors.                
	Parallel misuse        
	Theres a parallel misuse, but, curiously, the other way about: may have is often wrongly used for might have. Imagine this in a crime report: Driving a fast car, the bank robbers may have got away. Does that mean (as it should) that they were in fact in a fast car and  though we arent sure yet  may indeed have escaped? Or (as the reporter probably meant) that if theyd been driving a fast car they might have escaped, but they werent and they didnt?        
	The grammatical rule is crystal-clear. In this sort of sentence, use may have if, given certain conditions (driving a fast car), the event youre talking of (got away) perhaps happened, perhaps didnt, you arent sure. Use might have if it could have happened, but in fact, you know, it didnt, because the conditions werent met  the getaway car was, say, an ancient Ambassador.         
	Old readers of this column may recognize that example (or indeed might recognize it: in this usage either word is permissible, though might implies less likelihood than may). But I make no apologies for this second visit to the topic. The abuse of might and may is epidemic, its misleading and it should be stopped.         
	No apologies to the London Times either, the source of my opening quotation. A once highly literate newspaper, which recently ran a headline that included the redneck-American misusage CITY LAYS IN RUINS, deserves all the correction it may get.

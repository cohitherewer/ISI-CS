	President-elect Barack Obama has inherited the in-box from hell, but you could practically smell the fear in some other quarters as he listed his top priorities in his victory speech in Chicago: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. There will be general rejoicing if he can end the wars and solve the financial crisis, but a planet in peril is shorthand for climate change, and some peoples oxen will be severely gored if he acts decisively on the global warming agenda.        
	First off the mark with an attempt to limit the damage was the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper. The very day after the election, Harper proposed a joint pact on climate change whose real purpose is to protect Canadas dirty oil. That is the phrase Obamas advisers have used to describe oil imported from northern Albertas tar sands region, which has a far higher cost in terms of the carbon dioxide emitted in its production than conventional oil.        
	A national ban on the import of unconventional oil would be an attractive and politically cheap move for Obama, who needs to demonstrate his commitment to cut US greenhouse gas emissions but will be seriously short of money for big domestic projects until the recession ends. Tar-sands producers in Alberta are scared, and Prime Minister Harper is from Alberta.        
	Harpers strategy is transparent. He wants a climate-change pact with the United States of America in which Albertas dirty oil is exempted from controls on the grounds that it contributes to that other American national goal  energy independence. In return, he would negotiate a common cap-and-trade system in which American and Canadian users of fossil fuels would have to pay for their emissions.        
	Obamas response to this offer will depend on where he is on the learning curve about climate-change strategies. Does he realize that Albertas oil is Americas for as long as the US wants it, deal or no deal? More importantly, has he been seduced by the strategic myth about energy independence?                
	Ready bait        
	Since the Arab oil embargo at the end of the 1973 war in the Middle East, energy independence has been a mantra in US domestic politics, although little progress has been made in reducing American dependence on imported oil. Insofar as this quest drives the US to reduce energy consumption and to seek non-fossil fuel sources of energy, it serves the cause of cutting greenhouse gas emissions  but it also reflects a mindset that has led to really bad strategic decisions.        
	It is not 1973. Back then, the Arab oil exporters had relatively small populations with low economic expectations, and could easily forego their oil income for a few months. Since then, populations have grown and their economic expectations have risen even faster. Today, there is no major oil producer that could afford a lengthy interruption in the cash flow from its exports.        
	That means the US has no need either to kowtow to the oil-exporting countries or to control them militarily. It can buy all the oil it wants if its willing to pay the going price on the world market. Energy independence is about ending dependence on imported fossil fuels because they involve shipping huge amounts of money abroad, not because the supplies of fossil fuels are actually liable to be cut off. To the extent that the goal of energy independence encourages the growth of alternative energy sources within the US, it is a useful element in a strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but not if it is used as a pretext to replace imported oil from allegedly unreliable sources with dirtier oil from a friendlier source.        
	Stephen Harper is appealing to the stupid version of the energy independence policy: maybe the Arabs wont sell you their oil, but the Canadians always will. It will be instructive to see if Obama falls for it.

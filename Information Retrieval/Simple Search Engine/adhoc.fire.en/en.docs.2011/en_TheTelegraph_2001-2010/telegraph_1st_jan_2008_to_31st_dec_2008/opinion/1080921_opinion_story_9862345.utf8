                          This was a chintan baithak with a difference. The recent national executive meet of the BJP will be remembered for the absentees, rather than for those who were present. Sushma Swaraj was missing, apparently, laid low by toothache, although her parivar rivals suggested that her dard lay in the fact that she was denied the credit for the Karnataka success. Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katiyar played truant as well, to protest the BJPs hobnobbing with Ajit Singhs RLD in UP. The glamour brigade, comprising Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha and Navjyot Singh Sidhu, stayed away and there was non-cooperation from the Gandhis too  Maneka and her son skipped Bangalore, reportedly miffed over the BJPs reluctance to project Varun as a GenNext leader. Grim-faced partymen insisted that the absentees were not missed, but we think that there is cause for some more chintan about the fall in attendance.                                 
	Rahul Gandhi seems to be keen to impart gandhigiri Bigg Boss style. Nearly 200 office bearers of the Youth Congress and the NSUI have been cooped up in a house on Raj Path and are being introduced to the Mahatmas way of life in a six-day training camp (which ends today) organized by him. Mind you, the camps a serious affair. The day starts and ends early, there are yoga sessions, flag hoisting and a simple breakfast followed by discussions on how to solve the countrys problems along with lectures by luminaries from politics, media and the development world. The students cook, wash their own clothes, and cigarettes, alcohol and non-vegetarian food are banned from the premises. The strict food regime is surely improving the candidates health, but one wonders whether all this will help the country find another Mahatma in the future.                        
	 When behenji isnt busy fixing her rivals, she spends her time discovering new ways to keep the babus in check. The other day, the UP CM paid a surprise visit at the state secretariat 10 in the morning. Expectedly, the attendance was thin, as the babus were taking their own sweet time to report to work. A fuming Mayavati ordered the elevators to be switched off, forcing the bureaucrats to climb five floors. Needless to say, those in the lower rungs  the peons and other small fry, for instance  could barely hide their glee and must have secretly blessed Mayavati. She must have been smiling herself, watching on the closed-circuit TV installed in her room how senior officials huffed and puffed all the way to their floor.                             
	 Pushpa Kamal Dahal, aka Prachanda, came, saw, and (almost) conquered the capital, thanks to his sense of style. On his maiden visit to India, he kicked up a storm in Delhis fashion and political circuits, which couldnt have enough of Prachandas natty suits. He had Delhis intelligentsia eating out of his hands, till he spoke at the India International Centre. Prachandas speech left the disappointed audience wondering why his oratorial skills were not as good as his suits.                            
	 Lucknowi tehzeeb and the pehle aap culture is alive and well, among  would you believe it?  the Congress rank and file. After a Congress working committee meeting, senior partly leader ML Fotedar saw Rahul Gandhi approaching, and made way for the young MP. The public school educated Rahul would have none of it and insisted that the older Fotedar should go ahead. But a loyalist like Fotedar, who had served under Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, would commit no such indiscretion. However, the wise old man soon realized that the prolonged courteous exchange had gone too far for Rahuls liking and quietly stepped ahead. Now isnt that what is known as a step in the right direction?                            
	 A lot has been said about Shivraj Patil and his inordinate fondness for changing clothes frequently. Now listen to the irrepressible railways ministers take on the matter. Lalu Prasad is reported to have given the home minister this piece of advise during a cabinet meeting : Aapko nahane aur kapre badalne se to hum rok nahin sakte magar aap ek kaam kariye. Aap ek hi rang ke kai suit banwa lijiye aur ek din mein ek hi rang ke suit badal badal kar peheniye (I cant stop you from taking a bath or changing clothes but you must do something. Get some suits stitched of the same colour and change from one to another as often as you want in the course of the day).                     
	Guru Ramdev has competition from the Kapoor khandaan. No, we are not suggesting that Ranbir Kapoor has started giving yoga lessons, but his cousin, Kareena, has dreamt of starting a yoga school for underprivileged and physically challenged children. And whats more, the grapevine has it that sister Karisma too is supposed to be a partner in this healthy venture. The school, one learns, will be like no other and will boast state-of-the-art equipment and qualified professionals to look after the needs of its special students. Now it is not known whether Kareena wants the children to have size zero figures as well, but it is true that the two sisters have not been able to decide on a name yet. Someone had suggested Lolo amp; Bebo, but Kareena is supposed to have smiled without denying it. Perhaps Chhote Nawab Yoga centre will do just fine for a name. It will surely bring a bigger smile on Kareenas face.

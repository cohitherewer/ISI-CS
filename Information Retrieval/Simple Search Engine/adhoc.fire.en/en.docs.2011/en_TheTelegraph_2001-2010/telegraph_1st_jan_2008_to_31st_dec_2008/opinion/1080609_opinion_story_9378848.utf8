	We had the experience but missed the meaning.  T.S. Eliot, The Dry Salvages              
	A setback will remain a setback unless the correct lessons are drawn from it. It is clear that the CPI(M) has suffered unexpected losses in the panchayat polls in West Bengal, although it is not yet clear, in the absence of detailed results, if its vote share has actually gone down. Such psephological niceties apart, it will not be unfair to draw the conclusion that a substantial number of people in the villages chose to cast their ballot against the communists. It is no longer possible to say, as it was before the polls, that the CPI(M) has complete dominance in the rural world of West Bengal.         
	From the various statements made by the top leaders of the CPI(M) at the state and the central levels, it is obvious that the setback is being put down to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments industrialization and its related land acquisition policy. As a result, a not-too-heavy hand has been put on the pause button of the policy of land acquisition. The inevitable consequence of this is a go-slow on large-scale industrialization, since without land there can be no manufacturing industries. Without going into the merits and demerits of this line of thinking, attention needs to be drawn to the lesson that is not being drawn by the comrades even though it stares them in the face.               
	There is a bizarre inability on the part of the CPI(M) leadership to comprehend or accept (or both) that what has gone against them in a very important way in the rural world is the partys dependence on the politics of terror. This terror, even though it is most visible during elections, is not something that is unleashed only during polling-time or at every crisis faced by the party, but it is something practised by the CPI(M) cadre every day in subtle and not-so subtle ways. Killing, arson and rape are not the only instruments of spreading terror, there are other forms to which the rural folk are subjected in their day-to-day existence. The events in Nandigram and the coverage they received on television brought the ugly face of the CPI(M) into the drawing rooms of the middle class, and also made many left-leaning intellectuals forsake their erstwhile, somewhat craven, loyalty to the CPI(M).         
	There has been no acknowledgment or admission that the violence of the cadre could have played a part in the complete rout of the CPI(M) in Nandigram and in its defeats in other parts of West Bengal, even in areas considered to be red bastions in the not-so distant past. Yet look at the evidence: in Nandigram it only took a CRPF officer (Alok Raj) to rein in Lakshman Seth, the local MP and boss, on election day for the people to come out and vote in the manner they wanted to. (The question may well be asked: why was Seth so eager to stop Raj from performing his duties?) I think it would be labouring the obvious to say that in the months preceding the elections, the CPI(M) had used its cadre to settle Nandigram. Unfortunately, such efforts boomeranged. This should not be taken to mean that those opposed to the CPI(M) in Nandigram were innocent of the use of violence. The important point is that the situation there was a law-and-order problem, which was resolved not through dialogue or the deployment of the law-and-order machinery, but through the use of the party machinery. The party chose to do this and the government stood by as a willing accomplice.         
	Why did the party choose thus? My answer, and I have said this before in these columns, is that the CPI(M) knows no other way of coping with dissent save through a show of force. This is in the partys DNA and part of its ideological lineage. To say that it made a mistake in its use of terror would be to surrender a very critical part of its identity.         
	The other question that needs an answer is: why did this show of defiance and protest against the CPI(M)s terror happen now? The answer is twofold. One is that the people of West Bengal have become more conscious of their rights and entitlements. It is ironic but true that 30 years of communist rule are responsible for this growth in consciousness at the lowest level of village society. The CPI(M) may well be paying the price of its own success. The other is that the people in the villages are now aware that their sufferings and protests are no longer isolated affairs. They are immediately projected on TV screens and the pages of newspapers, and their cause is now taken up in a big way by urban intellectuals. Both these factors are relatively new in the political culture of West Bengal. The politics of violence will no longer work in the state. If the CPI(M) refuses to accept this, it will be further digging its own grave.        
	The CPI(M) leadership refuses to face this reality because its mindset is caught in a time warp. Like members of a Flat Earth Society, the comrades will not accept that West Bengal and the world have both changed. It is no longer possible to get away with what the party did in the Seventies and Eighties. The expectations are different and the party is always under the eyes of the media. Most people, including members of the intelligentsia who marched in protest against the violence in Nandigram, agree that industrialization is fundamental to the development of West Bengal, and that land is required for industrialization. That land can only come from agriculture.              
	Any attempt to take land away from those who own or till it even if compensation is paid will inevitably create social discontent, since a great deal of passion and sentiment is always attached to land. This is especially true in West Bengal where the Left regime, under a so-called land reforms programme, created layers of usufructuary rights in land. Faced with the first spurt of discontent, the CPI(M) responded in the only way known to it  violence. It paid the price in the first elections that followed. To take this as a negation of the policy of industrialization is to fool oneself. It was a negation of the mode of managing discontent.        
	The signs are ominous because they suggest that the CPI(M) is not only stuck in its old ways, but also that even the few attempts that were being made to break out of an antediluvian ideology are being put on the back-burner. Witness the call for a bandh last Thursday: a knee-jerk reaction to the oil price hike. This is exactly the way the CPI(M) reacted 10-15 years ago. It had seemed that in the last five years, as a rider to the policy of industrialization, the bandh culture was being abandoned. That appears to have been a delusion.        
	It came as no surprise that Mamata Banerjees bandh call followed immediately. She did what she has learnt from the CPI(M): the politics of disruption and violence. If this looking-glass war continues, and if the CPI(M) remains smug in its use of terror, the dark ages can be welcomed back again in West Bengal. Every state deserves the politicians its people vote for.

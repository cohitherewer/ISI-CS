The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a future that could be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A FUTURE THAT COULD BE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Heaven knows what the state elections have in store for this nation, but every which way, they will produce a result that will be of no good for the people of the state concerned. Rajasthan could have been a win-win for the Congress, but rumour has it that those in charge of the ticket distribution did a deal with the Opposition, the BJP, and gave weak Congress candidates tickets instead of those who could have won, made oodles of money for the convenient transaction, and felt satiated with their personal gain. This is the Congress. It is a party that looks desperately for defeat in the realm of victory. Its leadership is insecure and lacks loyalty and commitment. It is self-serving and clinically dishonest. Its members, men and women, bow low in front of the leader, but waste no time at all in demeaning the highest party office as they look for self-aggrandizement elsewhere. They are the most pristine symbols of hypocrisy.        
	Party secretaries, the so-called heavies of the Congress, who sit in Delhi, at 24 Akbar Road, and operate the states, are hugely insecure as they watch Rahul Gandhi address and attempt to rectify the malaise. Privately, they mock him and his concerted, intelligent attempt at bringing in a corrective that will rejuvenate and reinvent a party that has diluted its essence. These people realize full well that they are not part of the future scheme and cannot even begin to comprehend the restructuring. For them who rule today, muscle and money power is what delivers the goods and all else is of no import whatsoever. They cannot think beyond their noses or look beyond the predictable. Lazy, and on some dole or the other, they are busy laying out as many banana skins as they can on the path of Rahul Gandhi because they see themselves redundant in his scheme. Idiotically, they believe they are fooling those in power! Self-delusion of the worst kind is their present indulgence.                
	Great churning        
	However, somewhere deep down, they know that are not a part of the future and are therefore, busy taking care of themselves. Lies, deceit, deals and blackmail are all important ingredients of their prevailing strategy. The Congress is in the throes of being destroyed. The silver lining is that the younger lot is grabbing the opportunity to regroup, cleanse and re-order the political ethos and management of a potentially secular and all-inclusive political dispensation.        
	Speculation on the possible results of the forthcoming assembly polls swings from one end of the spectrum to the other. Some believe the Congress will win all the states, bar none, but an equal number of political scientists seem to be convinced that the BJP will carry Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi primarily because Mayavati and the BSP will split the traditional Congress vote bank. There is, in all of this, a maverick position for the general election, that hopes for both a Congress and a BJP defeat, allowing for a third front to rule from Delhi, a coalition that has no homogeneity whatsoever but one that comes together yearning for power.         
	There are those who feel that at a time when the world, and therefore India too, is in an economic decline, we may as well experiment with the many elements that are raising their untested heads because we have really nothing to lose at this juncture. The belief is that a motley dispensation at the Centre should not last more than 18 months to two years, a period when the world will be working to come to terms with the challenges thrown up by the great economic churning. We must prepare to restructure and restore our polity. Lessons of the past will hopefully map out the trajectory for a better, balanced and relatively austere future, one that will be based on international consensus that respects plurality and diversity.        
	Inshallah!

	Gandhars new production, Kachher Manush, comes from a Marathi original, Mitra, by Shirish Athwale. Translated by Kamal Sanyal and Bijoylakshmi Barman, it is a fairly straightforward, even simple, problem play, with a single-point agenda in which Athwale creates a troubling social situation and tweaks it to a touching, feel-good resolution. A widower harbouring casteist disdain for Dalits lives alone, his children busy elsewhere on their careers. When a garland of shoes is found on an Ambedkar statue, local Dalits riot, which he resists, bearing the brunt of their wrath instead, beaten by them into near-paralysis. A long period of physiotherapy and recuperation follows, under the supervision of a seasoned therapist who, ironically, is Dalit. When the patient learns of her background, he throws a fit, but has no option but to submit to her regimen. The drama basically revolves round them and the revival he undergoes. Filmmaker Gautam Halder does little by way of direction, because Debshankar Haldar and Bijoylakshmi Barman take over the characterization: he with a virtuosic display of physical disability (rendered risible by a telescoped two-minute jump-cut recovery to normal movement), she in her typical beatific smile. The son and daughter appear, only to underline two-dimensionally their artificiality or lack of time.

	Devotional amour  
	Both as poetry and as music, keertans stand out among the popular music traditions of India. Some specimens are still heard as part of the light classical repertoire of Hindustani classical singers. But the wealth of Bengali keertans lies woefully ignored, or is, at best, used for geriatric entertainment. Nupurchhanda Ghosh did the devotional genre a service by dusting some of the old favourites and laying them out for the appreciation of a largely-elderly audience at the Aikatan auditorium of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre on June 27. The creations of Dwija Chandidas, Jnanadas, Gobindadas are easily some of the best poetry written in Bengali where it is often difficult to distinguish between amorous and devotional love (for instance in the song, Kalachand-er baame chand-badani daanralo). The singers narrative interventions, variation of the tempo and emotive style reinforced the conversational and interactive quality of the songs. The amplification was overdone for the small auditorium (more like a lecture theatre), and ruined the effect of songs like Krishna-naame benche ache). The khol-and-mandira accompaniment provided the effect of authenticity, but the same cannot be said for the keyboard. The keyboard player should certainly shun the habit of jumping from one synthetic instrumental sound to another.

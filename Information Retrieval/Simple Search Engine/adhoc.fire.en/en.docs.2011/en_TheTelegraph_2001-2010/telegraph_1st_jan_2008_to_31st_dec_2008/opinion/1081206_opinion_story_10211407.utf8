The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | anxiety of proof
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ANXIETY OF PROOF                                                          
	A proof is not acceptable unless it is manifest and demonstrable. There is no point in the Indian governments saying, through unattributable sources, it has proof that the ISI was involved in the attack on Mumbai. In fact, this kind of campaign is self-defeating since it leads to the obvious conclusion that the Indian government actually has little or no proof about the involvement of either the ISI or the Pakistan government. If the government of India is serious about creating global opinion to exert pressure on the Pakistan government, it should make public the information available to it instead of engaging in leaks that cannot be attributed to responsible and identifiable official sources. If, for security or some other reasons, the government is unable to do so, it should act on the evidence without spreading such unproven allegations.        
	What needs to be admitted by the Pakistan side is that the attack and the attackers originated in Pakistan. This much is clear from the evidence available in the public domain. What does not follow from this evidence is that the government of Pakistan or the ISI is directly involved in the assault on Mumbai. To show this, very different kinds of evidence will have to be presented. What is also true is that the Pakistani authorities cannot deny all responsibility. There is enough documentation to show that within Pakistan there are camps and centres for training terrorists. This has been pointed out to the Pakistan government by India and the United States of America, but very little action has been taken against such training centres. In fact, the impression that is gaining ground is that the Pakistan government is rather smug about the existence of terrorist training camps within its country, and that the ISI sometimes tacitly, sometimes overtly, rather encourages these camps and uses the trainees. This situation creates very valid grounds for suspecting an ISI involvement in the attack on Mumbai. But there are many steps to cover in order to convert suspicion into proof. It would behove the Indian government not to speak before those steps have been adequately covered.        
	After every terrorist outrage, an Indo-Pak war is only a sabre-rattle away. This time it is no different except that, because of the scale of the attack, the decibel level of the rattle is higher. But a war is easily spoken about than declared. It requires preparation. Part of this preparation is intense diplomatic activity to convince the world that India has every valid reason to go to war against Pakistan. For such diplomacy to be convincing, proof is needed that the Pakistan authorities are deeply implicated in the terrorist offensive on Mumbai. There might be a case  and this may sound discordant in this time of near hysteria against Pakistan  for helping the present government to combat terror within its own territory. There are other options to ponder before taking up the call to arms. War cannot be the first or the only option.

	Rogue medics                  
	Sir  It is time a ban were imposed on organ transplantation and trade, since these are, more often than not, misused (Easy prey, Jan 29). Every time an organ (unless infected) is removed from a living persons body, his general health is affected. This is because every constituent of the human body has some important function to perform. There is no substitute for any organ or body part either. Legislation should permit medical treatment to only repair, and not replace, damaged body parts.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  A doctor with a criminal bent of mind would find it profitable to run a kidney-transplant racket. Such an illegal practice would allow the medic to earn a lot of money at the cost of his ignorant, and often illiterate, patient. In Gurgaon, such a racket, set up by a doctor named Amit Kumar, had been flourishing for a while. The police have now busted the racket, and the doctor is now on the run.           
	Such discoveries, in fact, expose the limitations of Indias healthcare system. The police too are guilty of apathy  they seldom take action against the perpetrators when the victims happen to be poor people. Further, the long time taken by the Indian legal system to deliver a verdict emboldens criminals to commit such crimes. Given the situation, it is hardly surprising that doctors continue to indulge in such murky business in many parts of the country.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  The fact that Amit Kumar managed to run his illegal business despite having a police record spells out the truism that criminals in India cannot operate without the support of authorities. After the discovery of the murders in Nithari, there had been attempts to bail out the owner of the house in which the crimes took place. This time too, it seems that Kumar could not have given the law the slip without an informant letting him on to the plans of the police. The other, perhaps even more serious, matter is the eternal denial of justice to the poor. This is evident in the manner Kumar and his rich clients exploited the poor labourers for their body parts  the organ traders extracted the patients kidneys without their knowledge or permission. In a poor country such as ours, all these problems are closely bound together and not one of them can be remedied by itself.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
K.C. Chakraborty, Durgapur

                
	Sir  Doctors like Amit Kumar ought to be handed the death penalty for violating the right to life of unsuspecting people. Even if it is true that some of the donors were willing to part with their kidneys, they must have decided to take such a step out of desperation. The least Kumar could have done is to compensate the donors adequately. The lid was blown off this crime when some of the victims lodged a complaint with the police in Moradabad. The police are now on the look out for Kumar, and the politicians have declared that justice will be done. But Kumar has managed to evade the law, till now. This does not inspire confidence in the integrity of officials.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Lucky escape          
	Sir  Some people get away with their crimes and Harbhajan Singh is one of the lucky few. Harbhajan had no business monkeying around with Andrew Symonds, bringing the game into disrepute and lowering the credibility of Indias players. Yet, cricket pundits in India, particularly those in the media, chose to rush in to defend a cricketer who had indulged in unsportsman-like behaviour.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.S. Parasuram, Calcutta

      
	Sir  There is no need for Indian cricket fans to rejoice over the victory in the case involving Harbhajan Singh (Bhajji not out, over to ODIs, Jan 30). At the conclusion of the independent appeal hearing in Adelaide, Harbhajan was charged with a (reduced) 2.8 level offence and fined 50 per cent of his match fee. Whether Harbhajan is guilty of racially abusing Symonds remains unclear. Singh, reportedly, used the phrase, Teri ma ki, against Symonds. It is true that sledging by Australian players often forces their opponents to respond in an aggressive manner. But even then, Harbhajans conduct cannot be condoned. What is more shocking is the manner in which the Board of Control for Cricket in India flexed its financial muscles to save Harbhajan from serving a ban. The off-spinners on-field behaviour has often been frowned at. The BCCI should have cautioned Harbhajan for his conduct. Instead, it chose to protect Harbhajan with the full knowledge that he was guilty of misconduct. Some board officials even tried to make light of the situation by saying that the difference in language had led to a misunderstanding. Cricket, it seems, is no longer a gentlemans game. The International Cricket Council should not encourage such events if it is serious about reviving the games real character.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

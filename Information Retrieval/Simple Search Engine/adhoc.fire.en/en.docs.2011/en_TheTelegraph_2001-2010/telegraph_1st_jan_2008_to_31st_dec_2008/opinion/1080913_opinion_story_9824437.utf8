	The legend of Lalan Fakir (c. 1774-1890), like those of most pre-modern Indian icons, constitutes such a maze of apocrypha that to glean the few grains of factual truth in it seems quite impossible. In fact, the deeper truths of his life may lie within the fictional tales spun around him by his disciples and in oral forms like the village puppet play on Lalan that I once had the privilege of subtitling for Doordarshan  mediums truer to his essence than hard biographical information can ever hope to be. So, Sudipto Chatterjee does the right thing when he declares his intention in Man of the Heart to get to the man rather than waste time deliberating historical details. Paradoxically, he has spent ten years in fieldwork digging up the Lalan tradition in Kushtiya (Bangladesh) to come to the conclusion that the stories tell more than the histories!        
	And it is in the most imaginative leaps of his bilingual solo show that we glimpse those rare flashes of creative insight that separate an artistic search from just research. The high point is the visualization by director Suman Mukhopadhyay of Lalans famous Arshinagar song. The black backcloth parts for the first time to reveal panels of reflecting tin foil, while Chatterjee sings carrying a full-length mirror, which immediately catches the light sources and bounces them all around and at the spectators, implicating them as the neighbour in the lyric and involving them in Lalans game of identifying self through the looking-glass.         
	On a more comic and directly political note, he raises his white chador to screen and smirk at small video projections of conservative priests, Muslim and Hindu, on his right and left respectively (he has enacted these clips himself), to emphasize the similarity of fundamentalism of any kind, and Lalans place suspended between them  free, belonging to both faiths, yet reviled by both. Chatterjees voice is his most powerful performatory weapon  he delivers Lalans songs full-throated like a baul and without an off-note, backed by dotara, ektara and khol. But because Chatterjee prepared the script for an American audience, at many points an Indian or Bengali viewer may feel that he explains and simplifies too much in his English narration. If anything, the supertitles for the lyrics require fuller and better translation, while the commentary needs pruning. After the interval, he even approaches conference mode, turning to scanned images and footage, which contradicts his stated purpose to avoid docudrama. On the whole, however, it is a stirring performance.

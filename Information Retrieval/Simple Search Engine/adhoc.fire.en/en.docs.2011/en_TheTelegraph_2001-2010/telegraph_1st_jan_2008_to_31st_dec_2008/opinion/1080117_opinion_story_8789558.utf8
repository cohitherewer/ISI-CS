	There is no need to panic, but it is too early to relax. There is absolutely no alternative to fighting bird flu relentlessly. It has broken out in Birbhum and South Dinajpur, and although the virus has not mutated within humans (as it had in 1918, killing 40 million people all over the world), prompt action is the only way to prevent a disaster in a densely populated country like India. Almost 40,000 chickens have died over ten days, and from yesterday the culling of about 3.5 lakh country and broiler chickens, ducks and pet birds has begun. Apart from ensuring the thoroughness of this operation, the government will have to be alert on several fronts. Most of the affected poultry belong to poor rural and suburban families, where the birds mingle freely with human beings, especially children. The government must have a clear sense of how to keep poor and mostly illiterate people properly informed about what sort of precautions to take and what to look out for. 
    
	What is needed is vigilance as well as sensitivity. To most people, the poultry they keep at home are precious sources of earning, and the flu itself, in spite of the dying birds, is less real than the threat of losing ones livelihood (main or supplementary) for a few months. So, the compensation money for the culled birds must be properly distributed  without avarice, corruption or mismanagement. Basic habits of hygiene, like washing hands, burying dead birds properly and protecting children, should be instilled without delay, and proper channels of communication thought out for this using local networks and institutions. Ignorance and frayed nerves must be handled alike with care, but with firmness as well. Larger farms and hatcheries, no matter how privatized and state-of-the-art, should be kept within the purview of vigilance. An eye towards profit, or fear of losing custom, must not deter large-scale stakeholders from following stringent regulations. There must also not be any suppression of information, however alarming. The movement of poultry and the patrolling of the border, though easier said than done, should certainly be a priority. Given the regularity with which bird flu breaks out in India, most of the preventive measures should become a matter of habit among poultry-owners rather than being perceived and practised as emergency measures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An idea of India that straddles the popular and the exorbitant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AN IDEA OF INDIA THAT STRADDLES THE POPULAR AND THE EXORBITANT                                                                
	Maqbool Fida Husain By K. Bikram Singh, Rahul amp; Art, Rs. 9,999        
	No, painting is not done to decorate apartments, Picasso had said once, It is an instrument of war. It is Maqbool Fida Husains singular achievement to somehow find himself repeatedly, and unabashedly, in both halves of Picassos claim. He is today one of Indias most highly priced artists, decorating some of its most opulent apartments. He robustly calls himself an Indian brand; even someone with less-than-rudimentary exposure to art would recognize a Husain. And he is always in the news, managing to bring out the worst in both the Hindu and the Muslim Right through a mixing of religion and sexuality that straddles the popular and the exorbitant. So his paintings continue to be the instruments of many a mindless war. Husain lives virtually exiled from the very country, the arrival of which on the international art scene he was among the first to embody.        
	This massive tome by K. Bikram Singh,  a civil servant, lecturer in history and film-maker  brings together many reproductions of Husains art (most of them of excellent quality) from every phase of the artists enormously prolific career. These pictures illustrate 12 chapters of informative, jargon-free and often insightful commentary. But the book could have done with some ruthless editing, curbing Singhs copiousness, making the volume less difficult to hold in ones hand and read.        
	Singhs method is a fairly readable combination of biography, historical context and a form of interpretation that often abandons chronology to provide a sort of motif-index to Husains vast and varied corpus. The elements of Husains visual lexicon are identified, their evolution mapped through relevant illustrations, and their meanings pieced together by teasing out connections with biography and history. Singh quotes rather more regularly from academic critics than he need have. He has his own, semi-formal way of writing about art and artists, and their contexts, which is substantial enough for the intelligent, lay reader whose interest in art is not rigorously academic. Besides, Singhs love for Husains art gives him a personal access to, and familiarity with, the work that have their own value, even if one finds oneself expecting more concision and sharpness in this kind of a documentary and critical endeavour.        
	Top right is one of the 1981 Portrait of an Umbrella series, done with ink on wood, that Husain describes as a homage to the common man. Singh gathers around this poignant conjunction of words and image other uses of the umbrella in Husains art. He shows how this motif is associated with the artists grandfather, Dada Abdul, who had been like a mother to this motherless child, an elderly and fragile figure of love and grace that haunts Husains pictures. Next to it, on the left, is an elephant drawn with a sketch pen on paper in 1954. Like his more famous horses, the elephant has also become a recurring element in Husains iconography, somewhere between the comic and the mythological: No chiaroscuro has been used to convey volume. Husains drawing does not need such devices.        
	Below these two drawings, on the right, is a finely Matissean, untitled, felt-pen-on-paper drawing from the late Seventies that is part of Husains ongoing fascination with Varanasi, which he first visited in 1960 with his artist friend, Ram Kumar. For Husain, it is a city that blends history, mythology, eroticism and death in a riverine flow of time and lines that brings out his most refined draughtsmanship. The Varanasi works also show the imaginative openness with which this devout Sulemani Muslim  a minority within a minority  can enter the universe of Hinduism and make it part of his own creative language.        
	Top left is the untitled, 117x115 cm, oil on canvas of 1964 that is often referred to as the Three Faces of Nehru. Husain made three such large paintings of Nehru, all around the same time, and only one of which is a single portrait informed with melancholy and reflectiveness. They attest to Husains continuing engagement with the idea of India through a perpetual play with its hallowed icons.         
	Bottom left is a photograph of the Arabic alphabets Haa, Meem and Qaaf painted in English and calligraphic form on the main door of Husains house in Dubai. Haa is linked to the artists surname, and his repeated experiments with Islamic calligraphy  mixing the figurative and the anti-figurative  are a homage to his early education as a Muslim child sent away to Siddhpur and placed under the care of his stepmothers father who was a priest.        
	This book is a testimony to Husains relentless inventiveness. It reproduces some 350 works out of a growing corpus of more than 10,000 paintings, apart from murals, toys, films and designs for jewellery and nursery furniture, and the cinema hoardings that were his initiation to painting. Husains sumptuous palette is amply represented in Singhs book, the scandalous price of which does manage to stand good taste on its head  a feat that is not beyond its subjects skills.

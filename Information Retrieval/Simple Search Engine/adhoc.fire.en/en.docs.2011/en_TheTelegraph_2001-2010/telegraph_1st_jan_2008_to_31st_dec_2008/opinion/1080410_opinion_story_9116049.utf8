	The judiciary and the government are oddly divided in Britain over what to do with migrant professionals. In November 2006, the Home Office suspended its highly skilled migrant programme, introduced in 2002. The HSMP allowed individuals with exceptional skills in the more exalted professions  mostly doctors, engineers and financiers  to come to Britain to look for a job or set themselves up as self-employed. But the government soon realized that many of those coming into Britain under this programme were ending up driving taxis or working in restaurants. So new rules were imposed, creating a points-based immigration system that allowed extension of initial stay based on criteria like earnings in the United Kingdom, age and educational qualifications, together with an English language test. This sudden action based on the governments second thoughts played havoc with the lives of about 90 per cent of the 49,000 who had availed themselves of the HSMP. They faced being thrown out of the country after staking everything in their lives to come and work in Britain. This has been deemed unjust by a high court judge: the governments change of mind is not only unlawful but also an abuse of power, and therefore conspicuously unfair.        
	That Gordon Browns immigration policies, taking up from where Tony Blair had left off, are moving close to a Conservative position became clearer with the recent House of Lords select committee report on the impact of immigration. It concludes that immigration has little or no impact on the economic well-being of the British, and therefore endorses the Conservatives demand for a cap on immigration. Defining well-being in a strictly utilitarian way, the report asks how much richer newcomers made those who were already in Britain before them  the answer being, not much. Perhaps the division between the judiciary and the government is part of the shift, in the public discourse on immigration, from political arguments over culture and race towards economics, from the legacy of empire to the promises of globalization. Immigration is at an all-time high in Britain now, and will account for most of its population growth in the next few decades. As multiculturalism in ordinary life makes British society less racially charged, ethnic penalties will continue to be paid until Britain learns to manage its residual xenophobia.

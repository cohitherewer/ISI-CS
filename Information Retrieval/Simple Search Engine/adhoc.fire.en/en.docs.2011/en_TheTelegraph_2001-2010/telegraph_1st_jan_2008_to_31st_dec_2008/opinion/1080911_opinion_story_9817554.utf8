The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Comfortably numb again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       COMFORTABLY NUMB AGAIN                                                                  
	KP has a name, but she wouldnt tell you what it is. First names are pass, it seems, just as Ladies Nights have become in Calcuttas clubs and discos. A successful professional, KP lives with her boyfriend (My guy, she calls him affectionately), and feels despondent if she were to miss even one Friday evening at Soho. She knows why Special Nights have become more popular than Ladies Nights: for women like her, the dance floor  with its swaying bodies, smoky haze and spinning lights  has become a comforting and more equal space.        
	Yet she knows that her sense of inclusion in such a public space is unreal, as are the men who lounge, smoke and dance around her there. They wouldnt leer at her off-shoulder dress, brush against her accidentally or ask if they could be her friend. Not any more. Perhaps it has to do with the fierce bouncers, as well as the changing perceptions among menfolk of the relationship between women and leisure. But this fairness, this sense of respect and solidarity, is confined within the gleaming interiors only.         
	The bits of the city that KP can see through the frosty panes as she grooves to the music remain cold and inaccessible. KP is still asked to produce a marriage certificate every time she decides to move house. She still cannot buy her cigarettes if she is passing through Kasba, and can only do so when she reaches Jodhpur Park. She would also love to be able to drink alone in a bar or restaurant  something she can never do in Calcutta. She is also tired of having to be careful about her safety whenever she has to take a bus or the Metro to work.         
	So the moments spent on the dance floor are special. It is an intimate yet eerie time: she is left with no one but herself, happily tasting the possibility of a freer, fuller life as she dances.         
	But she knows that this moment would pass, as it invariably does, week after week. The lights dont last the night, the throb of the music is quiet after a while, leaving just the men and women with one another. The men become different people once they step outside into the world. The women, the high and the flush slowly fading, wait for a taxi, a car, friends or lovers to take them home  allowing the numbness gradually to take over their insides again.

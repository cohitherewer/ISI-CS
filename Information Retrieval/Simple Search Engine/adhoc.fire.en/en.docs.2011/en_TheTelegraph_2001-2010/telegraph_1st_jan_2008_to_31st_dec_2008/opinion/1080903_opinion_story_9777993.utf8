	When reiteration does not work, a disguised threat might. The All Assam Tea Tribes Students Association and the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam have at last got their heads together to begin a joint movement to force the government to pay attention. The strength of the communities they represent lies, in this case, in that they are traditionally supporters of the Congress, forming a firm and big vote bank. Now they have a charter of demands, and have made it clear that their favoured party will have to do something about it before the parliamentary elections if it wants the votes. The demands are mainly for development and representation. The tea tribes have asked for Rs 500 crore for development, a quota in government services and three ministers instead of one in the state assembly. But equally important, long fought for, and violently contentious is the demand for scheduled tribe status for the tea tribes.        
	The confusion and feeling of injustice surrounding this last demand are not new. Workers for the tea gardens established by the British were brought over from the tribal communities of central and eastern India. Exploited and abused, these indentured labourers, consisting mostly of Santhals and a number of other tribes, were given other backward classes status after independence. Still one of the poorest, most neglected, educationally backward and oppressed population segments in the state, the tea tribes have been asking for scheduled tribe status in the hope of improving their situation. The objections of the Central government to the demand are many: they are not in reality one tribe, and having left their own lands they have lost their tribal characteristics, and so on. Ranged aggressively against them are the states STs who are afraid of having to share their privileges. But the most important thing is that a large group of people in the state are trying to make their voices heard for the righting of historical wrongs. The Congress might need to think of ways to address their unhappiness.

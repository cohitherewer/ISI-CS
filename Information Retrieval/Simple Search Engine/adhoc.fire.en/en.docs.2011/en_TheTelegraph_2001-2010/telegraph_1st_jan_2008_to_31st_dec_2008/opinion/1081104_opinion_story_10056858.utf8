	These times of alarm and anxiety have coloured the worlds reaction to the latest figures of growth in the domestic product of the United States of America. The media have read recession into them. But recession in the US, as defined by National Bureau of Economic Research, entails a fall in gross domestic product in two successive quarters. There is only one quarter of decline yet, so the world has to wait another three months before recession is recognized. Output of goods and services declined at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent, or a quarterly rate of less than 0.1 per cent  hardly something to write about, especially since it had increased by an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the second quarter. So the aggregate figures do not carry much of a message.        
	What is remarkable, however, is the composition of the decline  it is largely concentrated in peoples consumption. They bought 3.1 per cent less goods and services in the third quarter. Their purchases of durable goods fell by 14.1 per cent, and of non-durable goods 6.4 per cent. They bought 0.6 per cent more services, though it is difficult to see what these might have been, except for relaxing massages. Residential investment fell by 19.1 per cent. Usually, recessions start because frightened or depressed entrepreneurs reduce investment spending. Investment has fallen by one per cent, but it is consumers that are leading the current downturn. If they are cutting consumption expenditure, investment cuts cannot be far behind.         
	Consumption is easier for governments to stimulate; all they have to do is to reduce taxes or increase social insurance subsidies. And that is what the US government is proceeding to do. Anticyclical policies will soon be sailing full steam. Everyone is well aware of this. And yet the sentiment is depressed. The reason is twofold. The minor reason is that the US government has been running large deficits during the George W. Bush years; increasing them further will create financing problems. That need not worry the US since the world uses the dollar as its international currency  it is safe at least until the world loses confidence in the dollar. The major reason is that since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, the US has had no financial regulation worth the name. In the following years, mammoth hybrid financial companies grew up which are now failing. They are being rescued or propped up; but there are not enough bigger institutions that can rescue them. The government is pumping money into those that are still standing, and giving them instant banking licences so that it can help them. But indiscriminate funding is not necessarily effective assistance. Meanwhile, economics does not have a tried and tested solution to the institutional collapse. So the US may be in for a prolonged downturn; but economics will emerge out of it renewed and refreshed.

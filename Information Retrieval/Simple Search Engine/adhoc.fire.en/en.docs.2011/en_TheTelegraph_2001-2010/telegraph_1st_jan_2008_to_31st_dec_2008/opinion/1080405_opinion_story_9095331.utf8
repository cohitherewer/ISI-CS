The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Theatre of laughter, worth forgetting
                                                                                                                 THEATRE OF LAUGHTER, WORTH FORGETTING                              Ananda Lal      THEATRE                                                
	As more Bengali groups opt for comedy as a sugarcoated pill to facilitate easy digestion of their serious proclamations on life  a choice influenced partly by the desire to draw audiences back to the auditoriums  their comic strategies afford greater scope for comparison of commonplace as well as distinctive devices. The latest productions by Rangroop and Saubhanik provide just such a terrain for analysis.        
	Rangroop member, Jayanta Mitra, dramatized Byaram Biram from Bhagirath Misras short story, Daktarer Asukh, while Ashok Basu wrote an original play, titled Phakka, for Saubhanik. Both plays share the commendable theme of transforming materialistic men into altruistic humans, but both proceed toward this goal through the formulaic intervention of an eccentric but totemic character, and culminate in resolutions that seem too rosy to be believable. The result, in both cases, is a conventional comedy, not especially radical.        
	Byaram Biram begins on a high, with hilarious yet realistic scenes (picture) in the outer room of a clinic. Viewers will readily appreciate the interminable wait for the doctor to arrive and the patients fidgeting in a cramped space, only to be told that the doctor cannot come that day. A big surprise greets the protagonist, Golokpati, when he finally gets to consult the gastroenterologist, because the latter confesses to having the same chronic ailment (dysentery). In a fine inversion, the doctor asks Golokpatis permission to join a club  to which Golokpati belongs  that has compiled an invaluable map of easy-to-access toilets in Calcutta.        
	However, Mitra and the director, Sima Mukhopadhyay, cannot keep up this breezy satire on our medical profession after a mysterious Dhanwantari suddenly appears inside the chamber and tries to sensitize the doctor. The perceived compulsion of having to say something moralistic takes precedence, so the doctor must turn over a new leaf. While Mitra himself acts well as Golokpati, he looks terribly stereotyped in his Chaplin moustache, a clich in Indian farce. Gopa Nandi is more natural as his dead wife who still bullies him from beyond.        
	Phakka also criticizes the growing acquisitiveness in our society through the figure of an affluent man afflicted with depression because there is nothing left to buy with his millions. A local troubleshooter, Gandhi (a name as mythic as Dhanwantari), becomes his guru, apparently exploits his wealth, but turns into an agent for his change. Ultimately, he learns that there is more to life than possessions and, thus converted, sets out to undo the wrongs he had wrought. The progression, therefore, is more or less the same. Chandan Dass direction varies from entertaining caricature (Sutapa Chakraborty as the paan-chewing housewife) to the loosely rehearsed (the laughing-club episodes), but unfortunately Basus script is not too creative.

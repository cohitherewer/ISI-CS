                                                                                                                 GOING BOTTOMS UP                           - A state budget must analyse the efficiencies of expenditure         Commentarao   S.L. Rao                          Small help                                              
	State government budgets must say what outcomes they expect to achieve. Any analysis of state finances must similarly consider the efficiency of the expenditures in achieving desired social and economic objectives.        
	Karnataka has been a good example of fiscal prudence and good management. But even Karnataka has focussed only on revenues and expenditures and improving revenue productivity, not on improving efficiencies of expenditures and the consequent structural, systemic and procedural changes that are necessary. This is true of other states.         
	Karnataka augmented revenues by reforms in excise, especially on alcohol and property tax collections and getting state-owned enterprises to become self-sufficient, not a burden on state revenues. Growing subsidy burdens are a matter of concern. Karnataka tax reforms significantly improved revenue productivity of taxes, that is, taxes generated better revenues due to changes in the tax base, efficient administration and enforcement reach, collections and compliance. Simplification of sales tax and subsequent introduction of value-added tax helped improve revenues. Non-tax revenues went up because of the reduction in budgetary support to state-owned enterprises, and a voluntary retirement scheme that reduced employee costs. State-owned enterprises improved their performance, notably the Karnataka Road Transport Corporation.         
	Other states can also similarly improve revenues. The unwillingness of politicians in power and the higher level bureaucracy to surrender perquisites made available by enterprises owned by their departments has prevented granting greater autonomy to professional management. Bureaucrats run them. Privatization is the only alternative. It will stop the drain on state government resources and add the much-needed capital to state finances that can be used for infrastructure and social programmes.        
	Karnataka innovated especially in the sphere of housing and alcohol taxes. Phasing out stamp papers resulted in substantially better property taxes. Computerization of registration made supervision and compliance much easier. The formation of a central valuation committee avoided local discretion that was a big source of leakage of tax revenues. The periodic revision of the market value of properties also led to the state getting a share of rising property values.               
	But Karnataka, like other states, has done little to make motor vehicles pay according to their demands on the infrastructure and resources of the state. Automotive traffic requires vast government expenditures on roads, and their maintenance bears but a smaller tax burden. Incentives and disincentives on the use of crowded roads, regulating traffic in densely populated areas by high entry charges, substantially higher motor vehicle taxes to pay for the required infrastructure, high charges for roadside parking, apart from parking in public places, could generate revenues for road construction and maintenance. Automotives are heavily subsidized by revenues from other sources, and this needs correction.        
	In Karnataka, all wholesale trade in alcoholic liquors was nationalized. Producers had to sell to the state-owned company and the retailers had to buy only from that company. As a result, the claim of seconds in collusion with excise officers was stopped. Revenues from this excise shot up. Other measures on arrack and others reduced their illegal manufacture and sale. Such innovative solutions are possible in all states for items which have big revenue potential. But they demand willingness on the part of the political authority to plug such holes. This is difficult when in many cases they are the personal beneficiaries of such revenue leakages.        
	The Central government has begun to show budgets for outcomes as well as for outlays. This is an essential innovation for all state government budgets. However, outcomes cannot be attributed to only the spending department. States must identify and lay down what must be done by all departments that affect the outcome. For example, in considering outcomes from expenditures on education, it is not enough to lay down how many schools are to be constructed. Other related issues like the provision of drinking and toilet water, blackboards, computers, appointment of teachers, target drop-out rates, quality of teachers, expected examination results, and so on, must also be laid down. Some of these would require the coordinated efforts of other departments.        
	One cannot consider a states finances in isolation from the social and economic policies of the state, desired outcomes and expenditures, institutional structures of responsibility, accountability, performance measurement, pushing budgets down to each implementing individual and department, and the role of local authorities in spending and ensuring the achievement of outcomes. The pinpointing of individual responsibility for outlays and outcomes would help in improving performance. Measuring performance through these indicators is another means to achieve budget objectives. The delegation of spending powers to local authorities and developing budgets from bottom-up instead of top-down will help increase accountability and participation. State budgets and analyses of state finances must include such evaluation of desired outcomes.         
	User charges more related to costs of service will augment revenues and reduce expenditures. For example in power, free or below-cost pricing to farmers needs examination. Its purpose, the targeted beneficiaries, the quantum and the seasons must be laid down. If it is to help only small farmers, it should be specified, for example, as available only for one pump set per farmer household. It must also be related to the groundwater availability in that water basin, and the crops to be grown with groundwater. Groundwater withdrawals should be metred and even charged for, however nominally. Unfortunately, it is the better-off farmers who have the pump sets. Their political clout has prevented even monitoring their use of groundwater, let alone regulation and the charging of tariffs for groundwater used.               
	Electricity distribution results in a major financial burden on the state because of inefficiencies, theft, poor maintenance, non-existent commercial or enterprise culture, and administrative control instead of decentralized authority. It is another missing element in state budgets that do not quantify the cost because of these lacunae. Government ownership is at the root of the problem. That foments indiscipline, political interference that is against efficiencies, cost-based tariffs and the reduction of electricity thefts. Most state distribution entities make losses. The answer is to distance government from management. Since this is unlikely in the present administrative setup, the owner has to change.         
	Charges for irrigation waters, like groundwater usage and its pricing, has not been dealt with anywhere except in Maharashtra. It is set to pass legislation to regulate water in the state. It is a model that other states could usefully replicate. What is essential is the political will to implement such legislation.         
	The analysis of state finances and their annual budgets must deal with efficiencies of expenditures. For example, most states have very low indicators of human development if the major cities in them are not included. Low HDI status is a result of an administrative system that is not accountable for results and is not structured to deliver best results. Planning, budgeting and execution are made in the state capital with little involvement of the bottom-level local administrations that have to implement them. Despite the introduction of panchayati raj, in practice, financial authority has not reached the lowest levels. State legislators do not want such authority to move downwards. If they lost that authority, legislators fear that they will have little to do, and little to offer their constituencies, apart from losing the opportunity to leach off some of the expenditures for their own uses. The result of over- centralization is that programmes for health, education, nutrition and employment never fully reach their targets of delivery and quality, leading to a low level of human development.         
	Government finances must always be related to what they are used for and how well.

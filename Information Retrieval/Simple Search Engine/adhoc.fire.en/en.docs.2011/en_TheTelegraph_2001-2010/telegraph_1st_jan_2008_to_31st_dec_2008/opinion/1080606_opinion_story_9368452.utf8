	Under Her Spell: Roberto Rossellini in India By Dilip Padgaonkar, Viking, Rs 550                
	This is a delicious book about a few extraordinary people who, by ordinary standards, were disastrous for one another. Among all the great Italian film-makers whose surnames end with ni, Rossellini (whose centenary was celebrated only a couple of years ago) is perhaps the one whose work is viewed the least today. In his teens, Padgaonkar had read everything about him in old film journals picked up from a sleazy kabadiwala in Bombay. Later, after he had finished studying at the Sorbonne and returned to Paris in the late Sixties as a foreign correspondent, Padgaonkar and his wife met, and were befriended by, Rossellini at the exotic Indo-Gallic salon of Jean Riboud and his Bengali wife, Krishna. What followed were an abiding interest in, and a compassionate affection for, this mighty and impossible Italian, whom Truffaut referred to as his Italian father and Fellini remembered as a ceaseless Maestro di vita in the most human sense of the word.        
	Indeed, Rossellinis was a life  informed by generosity, damage and genius  that Fellini could have done justice to. But Padgaonkar, with his personal acquaintance with Rossellini, his cosmopolitan career, his clever use of other peoples writings, and his crisp, light prose, manages to concoct the right tone for picking up one thread in a chronically messy and Rabelaisian life, and then spinning a delightful and moving story out of it. This is the story of Rossellinis journey to India in the mid-Fifties (with a hundred kilos of spaghetti in his luggage), and its human and cinematic consequences. It would therefore be a pity if this mix of film and social history and pure gossip is read only for the scandal that lies at the core of it: Rossellinis encounter with Sonalini Dasgupta, the transatlantic and Indo-European shockwaves it sent out, and its long and tragicomic aftermath. This is grand theatre  Goldoni, Marivaux and Evelyn Waugh rolled in one  with none less than Anna Magnani, Ingrid Bergman and Jawaharlal Nehru among the dramatis personae. And the lives of geniuses, and of those who are drawn to them, transcend their own sordidness and become the stuff of excellent and entertaining art.         
	But Padgaonkars telling of this story also weaves in an effortlessly readable account of a particular phase in Rossellinis cinema and in Italian neo-realism, just as it documents Indian lives and mores in the Fifties, the moralism and the xenophobia, the intimate histories of Nehruvian socialism, and the European dolce and not-so-dolce vita in deft and idiosyncratic detail. It is wonderful to know that Sonali and Roberto fled to Paris and started their life there in Henri Cartier-Bressons apartment on, of all streets, the rue Casanova. Here, the bed they slept on rested on piled-up telephone directories. When Roberto rang, from India, his then wife, Ingrid Bergman, at the Raphael Hotel in Paris to warn her of what he still maintained were unfounded rumours about him and Sonali, Ingrid knew that he was lying: As I sat on the bed, I could feel the smile spreading right around up to my ears. I was so pleased. For him. And for me. And Anna Magnani  great actor, ex-mistress and old faithful  had once warned Sonali, Watch out! Hes a big, ignoble slut, an incredible son of a bitch. Kick him in the ass now and then.         
	The dignity, allure, firmness and intelligence with which Sonali reckons with such advice turn what could have been terrible abjection into a genuine human mystery. Known for her long silences, while Roberto was a compulsive and irresistible talker, she is the lovely reticence at the heart of this book.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DARK AND DINGY MEMORY LANES                          - If Kumartuli changes, it will be because the city and its people are changing
										      ART MART                                                
	Kumartuli, with its generations of artisans engaged in making clay idols, has secured a place in the lexicon of Bengali culture. The dingy lanes, muddy corners, puddles, tarpaulins and rows of painted, unpainted and half-painted idols of the ten-armed goddess frozen in the act of killing the demon, her four wards and their carrier animals, in unabashed nudity towering over the artisans silently kneading clay or mixing colours  the collage has been preserved in advertisements, documentaries, literature and films. Somehow, the lack of modern civic amenities seemed to reinforce the authenticity and exoticism of Kumartuli. The dim corners of the artists cottages, the leaking roofs, the bamboo lofts and the scattered pots of paint and lumps of clay have constituted a cultural motif  mixing the rawness of art with traditional sentiments.        
	But what if, after its proposed renovation, the narrow alleys and dark workshops are suddenly transformed into a sophisticated artists colony?         
	Sumit Sengupta, of the 66 Palli puja committee, feels that the renovation will eliminate the nostalgia that automatically attaches itself to the name of Kumartuli. Sengupta has been visiting Kumartuli for years and is hopeful about the proposed changes; but he wonders whether the spontaneity of involvement will remain intact  particularly the bonds that are forged while making ones way through the difficulty and chaos of the place. This rubbing of shoulders with everyone is an integral part of the spirit of the carnival. A well-ordered, spick-and-span Kumartuli may make things a little too easy for the organizers, and that is sure to drastically reduce the excitement of taking the idol home.         
	Like Sengupta, Pralay Sen, the 65-year-old organizer of a Park Circus puja, feels that bringing idols from Kumartuli is an exercise replete with festivity. Members of puja committees from all over the city throng the place, with clamour and confusion ruling the show, alongside the tiffs with artisans and haggling with porters, the fear of the clay-idols melting in the rain  are a fitting preamble to the four-day extravaganza of the puja. One of Sens observations is that the younger generation  used as they are to metropolitan comforts  will enjoy the improved conditions more than old-timers like him. The young people who frequent shopping malls will always prefer a better system of delivery, and maybe materials which are less messy than clay.         
	One such young puja enthusiast is 25-year-old Debjyoti Karmakar of the Muhammad Ali Park puja. He is too practical to get carried away by nostalgia. He enjoys going to Kumartuli with his friends and elders and is fascinated by its ambience, but that is only when hes feeling frivolous. He fails to see the justification of retaining the dark lanes and dilapidated huts for the sake of preserving cultural heritage.         
	The renovation is still under consideration; but if Kumartuli changes, it will be because the city and its people are changing, as are our definitions of festivals. So far the place has defied time, perhaps suggesting the immutability of art and culture. It is a matter of speculation if the authorities will consider preserving some parts of the heritage of Kumartuli. Even if they do not, maybe some of the artisans cottages will recreated and put on display at some theme puja. The site of artistry will then metamorphose into artificiality.

	Model marriage                  
	Sir  The All India Muslim Womens Personal Law Board deserves congratulations for introducing its own version of the nikaahnama (All-women bid for talaq rights, Mar 17). Finally, Muslim women may have a say in their marriage and be given the authority to divorce their husbands. The unhappy irony, though, is that the success of this conditional nikaahnama depends entirely on its approval from the patriarchal Muslim community. One hopes that Muslim women will get a step closer to personal freedom with this model of marital contract.

	Driven away          
	Sir  It is sad for democracy that Taslima Nasreen is being forced to leave the country (Stressed Taslima to leave, March 18). Hounded out of Calcutta, a city she had made her home, she has been living under house arrest in an undisclosed location in Delhi since November. The Telegraphs report mentions that her health has suffered because of the severe curtailment of her personal freedom. She appears to have been denied proper medical care. The treatment meted out to the writer is in gross violation of human rights. Although the government can now very well claim that Taslima left of her own accord, it still cannot escape blame for leaving her with no choice but to take the decision to leave the country. Fundamentalists would see this as a victory. But this does not bode well for the countrys future. All the tall talk of secular democracy and fundamental rights has been proved to be hollow. Much worse is perhaps to come. Be it reservations in this or that category, or looking the other way regarding illegal immigration across the eastern borders, each decision taken by the current government is motivated by the vote bank and the need to appease minority communities. Taslima Nasreen is a victim of this vote-bank politics. One fears that from now on, Indian writers and artists would be treated similarly by the Central and state governments to appease fundamentalists, of whatever hue.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The last few months of Taslima Nasreens stay in India were very turbulent, so much so that the government had to put her in a safe house. This, she claims, was equal to a house arrest. However, these arrangements were made by the government purely in the interest of Taslimas security, and the author should not forget that. By criticizing the country that had given her refuge when she needed it, Taslima has shown her complete lack of gratitude (Taslima leaves with a threat, Mar 20). India is not ruled by religious fundamentalists. In fact, the outrage against Taslimas writings have been mainly expressed by Muslims. Thus, when she heaped scorn on the supposed secular nature of our democracy, Taslima was really attacking people of her own faith. The Indian government, no doubt, also has to take some of the blame for this fiasco. It should be more careful about taking another countrys troubles on its own shoulders in future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Salman Amanullah, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  There is nothing more unfortunate than the way in which the exiled Bangladeshi writer, Taslima Nasreen, had to bid goodbye to India after facing a virtual house arrest from the government. Even the Left, which claims to be open-minded, had to bow to fundamentalist pressures for the sake of votes when it refused a free stay to Taslima in her preferred state of West Bengal. Is she ruing the fact that she did not accept the Gujarat governments invitation to be its guest?           
	Yours faithfully,

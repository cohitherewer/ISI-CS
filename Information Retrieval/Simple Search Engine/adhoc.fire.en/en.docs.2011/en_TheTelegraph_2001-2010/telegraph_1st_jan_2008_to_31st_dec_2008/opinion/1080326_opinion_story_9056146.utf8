                                                                                                                 TOUGH CALL                                                    
	In Pakistan, democracy has leapfrogged forward with the appointment and the swearing- in of the new prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani. The move puts to rest obsessive speculation over the matter and opens the way ahead for the next round of hard decision-making. There is no doubt that Mr Gilani, Pakistan Peoples Party vice-chairman and former speaker, is a compromise candidate. He scored over the PPP front-runner, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, in being a less high-profile and more acceptable face to both Asif Ali Zardari, who now guides PPPs destiny, and the coalition partners, who had reservations about Mr Fahim. But if prime ministers have always been vulnerable creatures in Pakistans political history, Mr Gilani is doubly so. He has to live with the threat of being replaced by the suave Mr Zardari, whose political pragmatism has forced him to keep his prime ministerial ambitions on hold for now. There is also the constitutional amendment that gives the president the right to dismiss governments, and which the new government (in the absence of a two-thirds majority) cannot immediately overturn. Even if he wanted it, Mr Gilani cannot avoid a confrontationist course with the president, which the reinstatement of the chief justice and the supreme court judges will inevitably initiate. It is unlikely that a reconstituted supreme court will not question the validity of Pervez Musharrafs claim to being president or try to circumscribe his authority. In theory, cutting down the president to size may be all that the new government intends to do, but the political role that the moment demands may be a tough call for a man who is expected to take the cue from political leaders working behind the scene and also to balance the interests of party and governance.        
	Mr Gilani has an unenviable job on hand. He has to keep the army and the intelligence agencies on a leash and yet tame the rogue taliban on the borders and prevent further bloodshed. There are already Uncle Sams men at his door questioning how the new government wishes to reconcile the popular yearning for making peace with rebels with the nations commitment to fighting the war against terror. Above all, there is the economy, so long a victim to the States larger concerns of waging wars on different fronts. It is not without reason that Mr Zardari has thought it wise to let Mr Gilani hold the baton for a while.

	Politics and leadership are not about having a stentorian voice, displaying the art of oratory and making dramatic gestures in parliament. Mr L.K. Advani, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is deluded if he thinks that politics and leadership are defined by these qualities. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has demonstrated what political leadership is about. It consists of having a vision for the country, the courage to stand firm by that vision and the ability to carry the nation forward in tune with the vision. While Mr Advanis partymen together with the comrades screamed, shouted and engaged in theatre, Mr Singh in his quiet way rewrote the terms of Indian politics. He showed that by remaining committed to do what he thought to be right for the country, he could earn the confidence of his party and the Lok Sabha as the prime minister of India. Mr Singhs commitment and subsequent actions revealed his belief that he does not need a mediator between his conscience and what he considers to be the best for India. He remained true to his beliefs and his conscience and thus won the trust of the nation. Here I stand. I can do no other, Martin Luther said when he fought papal orthodoxy. Mr Singh implied the same thing when he decided like Martin Luther that it was neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience.        
	In contrast, Mr Advani took his party to an unprincipled opposition to a deal that his party should have supported. Having voiced his opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal in no uncertain terms, Mr Advani then got cold feet when it occurred to him that if Mr Singhs government fell, Mayavati of the Bahujan Samaj Party and not Mr Advani himself would be occupying centre stage and making a bid for the prime ministership. Thus Mr Advani was left in a kind of no-mans land that is so typical of an unprincipled position. Mr Advani, in the eyes of the nation and even of his admirers, failed an acid test: he failed to put the nations interests over the lure for office. His actions and those of his party revealed that beyond street-fighting under the banner of Hindutva, the BJP behaves like any other provincial party from the cow-belt. The BJP is ill cast to meet the demands of modern politics. It will remain perpetually on the fringes, never in the mainstream, of the making of modern India.

	Pay up                  
	Sir  The recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission promise a bounty for public servants, but the reality is not as idyllic. Following the pay commission report submitted last month, service chiefs pointed out the loopholes in the proposed structure of increment for the armed forces (Army wants pay review, March 26). While the pay commission recommendations make the entry-level salaries for officers attractive, the charm wears off as they move up the hierarchy. Soldiers seem to be the worst hit. A subedar major  the highest rank to which a jawan can be promoted unless made an officer  would earn an allowance of Rs 1,000 after serving the army for about 26 years. It is a shame that those who are responsible for protecting the nation should be treated so summarily, and have to ask for more in a pathetic, Dickensian manner.           
	Since these complaints failed to cause a bureaucratic stir, it was left to Manmohan Singh to admit that members of the defence forces have been unfairly treated by the pay commission and that the taxpayers would not resent paying these valiant men the compensation they deserve (Sweetened pill, April 23). This is a timely salvo from the prime minister. The armed forces are vastly superior to the civil services, run by our astonishingly inept bureaucrats. The filepushers engaged in government services are yet to imbibe the professionalism that is expected of them in a country fast modernizing itself.           
	It is not for the service chiefs to plead their case. The public and the media should lend their support to the defence forces.           
	Yours faithfully,         Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, 
Waunakee, US  
	Sir  The Sixth Pay Commission seems to have opened up a Pandoras box. The army feels cheated by the recommendations. Its hopes  raised by last years visit of B.N. Srikrishna, who headed the commission, to the Ladakh plateau  have been belied. Since the Fifth Pay Commission Report, Indias per capita income has increased considerably. This growth should have been uniformly reflected in every section of the public sector services. Unfortunately, only administrators at the top seem to be enjoying the fruits of change.           
	The present pay commission advocates extra pay for better performance. However, it does not clearly explain how performance is to be judged in the public sector, where there is little accountability, and whether there should be independent agencies to carry out such assessments. Possibly, the commission believes that its own example, and not just its recommendations, would serve India well. The pay commission has set new standards by completing its job earlier than expected, and that too without using the entire budget allotted to it.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The government should take heed of the frustration among the defence personnel. Given the growing threats in the border regions, the rise of Islamist terrorism and the Maoist movement, the armed forces of India have to remain more alert than ever before. A good pay packet could go a long way in helping matters. But the Sixth Pay Commissions recommendations fall far short of expectations. The commissions refusal to have any member from the armed forces on its board has ensured that it continues to remain oblivious to certain realities faced by army men. Most soldiers and officers below the rank of colonel are forced to seek work post-retirement. This highlights the inadequacy of their present salaries. A lot needs to be done. Pension schemes for army men should include provisions that allow them to collect rations.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Our games, their games          
	Sir  Supriya Chaudhuris excellent article bemoaning the absence of a sports culture in India brought to mind a moment from the past (Cheque de! India, April 15). In the Eighties, I noticed a fascinating scene in the city of Donetsk (Sergei Bubkas native town) in Ukraine, where I spent five months attending a training course. There was a lake at the centre of the city where members of a family across three generations took rounds in their smart track suits and sports shoes. Both the young and the aged partook of this exercise regime with unfailing regularity. Little wonder their country is one of the most advanced in sports. There were well-equipped sports shops and gymnasiums along with sports grounds in every neighbourhood. Despite the political turmoil, the country produced top athletes and tennis players. If the sports culture of a nation reflects its progress, India offers the most skewed picture.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Ranjit Kumar Guha Ray,

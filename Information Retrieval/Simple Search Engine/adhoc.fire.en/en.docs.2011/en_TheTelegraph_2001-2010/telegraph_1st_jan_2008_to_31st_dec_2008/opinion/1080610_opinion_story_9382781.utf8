	India improved its position slightly between 2006 and 2007 on the global corruption index conducted by Transparency International. It moved up from 72 to 70 among 180 countries, with a score of a little over three on a scale of 10. Now that two high-profile ministers in two different states have allegedly managed to get caught out  in one case, almost  the nation has been afforded another glimpse into the depths of corruption in which the business of public officials and politicians is mired. Nothing has been proved so far against Ajay Vishnoi, the Madhya Pradesh minister for public health, family welfare and Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation, who has resigned from the cabinet in a show of morality. Such moral postures suit the Bharatiya Janata Party. He was reacting to the extensive income-tax raids on his house, his brothers office and his wifes homeopathy college, together with several other official sites. Income-tax officials have claimed to have seized money, papers and assets, as well as to have located land bought in the name of relatives of bureaucrats in the health department. These raids were a follow-up of similar ones on department officials during September last. For the Congress, this is good news. The party had been crying itself hoarse over the corruption in the government health sector in Madhya Pradesh and now feels that it would be an important issue in the assembly elections coming soon. Only Mr Vishnoi is certain that all this fuss is just to taint him before the polls.        
	Unfortunately for the Congress, there is little to choose between parties where corruption is concerned. The education minister of Assam, Ripun Bora, has been caught by the Central Bureau of Investigation actually trying to bribe one of their officials. The definition of corruption for the international corruption index is the misuse of public office for private gain. As things stand, Mr Vishnoi may or may not be guilty of that. But Mr Bora has gone a step further. He was trying to bribe the CBI off the murder case of the student leader, Daniel Topno, in which he is one of the chief suspects. The Assam chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, has dropped Mr Bora from the cabinet like a hot brick, and he has been arrested. The Congress has decided not to take any other steps against the former party spokesman. It does seem rather strange that a suspect in the murder of a student leader should be the education minister of a state. Perhaps the definition of corruption for index-making is touched with innocence.

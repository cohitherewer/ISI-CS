	It is especially disappointing when a painfully achieved fragile balance is threatened. The deadlock in Jammu and Kashmir, manifested through protest marches, violence, police firing and deaths, with bandhs for over a week, has in it the potential to strike the rawest chords among the people. That this situation has come to pass is the result of blindness and manipulation in two spheres, religion and politics. Its root lies in the 40 hectares of forest land in Baltal which was supposed to have been given to the Sri Amarnath Shrine Board to accommodate shelters for Amarnath pilgrims. Angry crowds protested against the giving of Kashmirs land to outsiders, and Hurriyat Conference factions found in this a readymade popular cause. The former governor, S.K. Sinha, who pushed through the allotment, was chairperson of the shrine board, as of the board of the Vaishno Devi temple. These are positions that all governors of the state take up. It derives from the law legitimizing a Hindu governor and a Muslim chief minister for the state. The latter, in turn, is ex officio chairperson of the wakf board and wakf council. It is as if, in the search for balance, the administrative set-up and religious boards have had to be divided into compartments, leaving scope for the balance to be transformed into a potential for communalization.        
	The new governor, N.N. Vohra, who took charge when the violence had begun, and the chief minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, have worked out a formula by which the grant of land has been revoked and the responsibility of providing the pilgrims with shelter given to the state government. But the effects of this are yet to show, both on the streets and in the assembly. The Bharatiya Janata Party and Vishwa Hindu Parishad have exploded into action, demanding a cancellation of the revocation, while the anti-grant protestors are insisting on an official order of revocation. For the Congress chief minister, this is a bad time. The Congresss partner in government, the Peoples Democratic Party, which seems to have backed the grant of land at first, has neatly pulled out, leaving the Congress little option but to face a floor test. The National Conference, having called for revocation, cannot be seen to come to the rescue of the Congress. And the separatists have found a useful point of conflict. In Jammu and Kashmir, the price of blindness is a heavy one.

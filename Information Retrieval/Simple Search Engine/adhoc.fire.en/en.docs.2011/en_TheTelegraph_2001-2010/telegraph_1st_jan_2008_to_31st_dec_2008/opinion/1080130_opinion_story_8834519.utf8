                 Fifth Column - Sumanta Sen
               
	Development was Narendra Modis mantra in Gujarat. It is the same mantra that the chief minister of Tripura, Manik Sarkar, and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have chosen for themselves in the state that will go to the polls on February 23. Even before the Election Commission had announced its schedule, the Marxists and their Left allies had announced their candidates and launched their campaign asking people to vote positively, [to] vote for development. There is no doubt that the response to the slogan will be watched keenly by comrades in West Bengal, for it is the same issue for them as well.
    
	The situation is of course different in the two states. No small car factory is coming up in Tripura, nor are there proposals for giant projects like steel plants or a chemical hub. But roads linking interior areas of the state with Agartala have been constructed and agreements have been signed with Japan and China for utilization of forest resources like bamboo. A longstanding demand of the people will be met soon when the first train in the state will run from Manu to Ambasa, covering a distance of 109 kilometres. In Agartala, a station designed like a palace has been built and the people have reasons to feel happy. Running railways is of course the responsibility of the Centre. But a party, which has been in office for three five-year terms without a break since 1993, is naturally taking credit for having brought the iron horse to the state, thus opening a new chapter in Tripuras progress towards a better future.
        
	Take stock
    
	Elsewhere in the country, development is an issue that political opponents generally do not fight over. But that does not seem to be the case in Tripura where the Opposition apparently has taken a cue from West Bengal. The Congress is yet to produce its nominees for the election but is losing no opportunity to caution voters that to be misguided by the CPI(M) would mean allowing it to go in for further corruption. 
    
	With no Mamata Banerjee around there has been no physical resistance to the efforts of the state government, but the Congress has chosen what it feels is a more useful weapon. It goes about creating doubts about whether the fruits of development will reach the whole state or a chosen few. The only problem is that people have still not forgotten the mayhem they had witnessed during the Congress rule from 1988 to 1993. Nor are they unaware that the Congress remains a divided house. 
    
	Bickerings are a part of any pre-poll scene and in that respect Tripura is not presenting any unusual picture. What, however, does appear unusual is that for the first time in recent memory, violence is not an issue occupying centrestage. And for this the ruling Marxists can certainly congratulate themselves since they have been able to keep the extremists at bay through political and administrative measures. Their tribal opponents are no longer a united force and if any thanks is due for this, it should go to the CPI(M) and its frontal organization, the Gana Mukti Parishad.
    
	Election time marks the hour for political parties to take stock of their standing among the masses. For the Congress in Tripura, it should once again come as a sad reminder of the fact that its influence remains restricted among the Bengali community alone. It is certainly not a happy situation for a national party to be kept at arms length by the original inhabitants of a state. In none of the Indian states does the Congress enjoy much support among tribals at present but in Tripura the party has never been able to find even a toehold among the tribal population. The central leadership of the party would do well to take note of this, particularly as it is currently seeking ways in which tribals all over the country can be roped into its folds.

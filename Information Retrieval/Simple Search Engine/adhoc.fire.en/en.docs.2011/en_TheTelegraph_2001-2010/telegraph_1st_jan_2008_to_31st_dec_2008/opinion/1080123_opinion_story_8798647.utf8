                 WORDCAGE - Stephen Hugh-Jones
               
	Did he really call him a monkey? I suspect he did. Im wholly behind any side playing Australia, and not solely for unworthy reasons: in any sporting contest, Im for the underdog. And the idea of Australias cricketers whining  officially!  about sledging would raise a horse-laugh from a corpse. Still, I prefer the judgment of the match referee, Mike Procter, who studied both sides versions, to the rush-to-judgment of either countrys sports reporters or cricket nabobs.
    
	Yet suppose Harbhajan Singh did indeed voice the dreadful word, just how dreadful really was it? A fortnight and a famous victory in one good-spirited Test match later, we can judge this as an issue of language, not national or ethnic pride or nastiness. And well see that circumstances truly do alter cases.
    
	Ten years ago, an able black woman hoped to become the Labour mayor of London. She confided her view of rival hopefuls to a friendly, and female, Guardian reporter: Boring white men, and older. Racism, sexism and ageism in one sentence. The Guardian, that pillar of political correctness, printed it without, I suspect, even noticing.
    
	Did it matter? The lady, in the end, never even made the candidates list. But I doubt that that, or the size of vote she might have got, had anything to do with her, lets say, lack of tact. All her unkind adjectives applied, even in 1998, to me. Yet frankly I didnt give a damn.
    
	Rightly not. No boring, white, male oldies were likely to suffer a damn. Plenty of women, plenty of non-whites have suffered in Britain from crude prejudice. Not so people like me. Many, its true  Im one  have suffered from ageism, now enshrined in an quot;anti-ageist quot; law of the Blair era, which, like much else of his, did the reverse of what it purported to do. But what one youngish woman said to another over lunch is hardly to blame for that. 
    
	Language comes in a context. What counts is not simply what is said, but by and to whom, where, when, how  and why. Of course, what one man sees as a joke another may not: Sardarji stories must become wearying if youre a Sikh. But lets keep things in proportion.
    
	Some 45 years ago, I didnt. I was foreign editor of The Indian Express, in then-Bombay. A local weekly, Blitz, savaged me and another British journo with WHITE CUBS TURN INDIAN EXPRESS INTO DAILY FARCE. I didnt mind the slur on my competence: Id shaken up, not least Indianized, our foreign coverage, and I reckoned it showed, for the better. CUB? Well, at 28, so be it. But WHITE? Id never supposed that the history of Britons in India had earned us freedom from racist counter-attack. But Id never imagined a leftish paper splashing it all over a headline. I was enraged.
    
	A few years ago, at my request, Blitz amiably sent me a photostat of the page. Ive framed it, to hang (alongside the Queens commission to her trusty and well-beloved SH-J as a conscript second lieutenant, I fear) where you may expect. Proportion had returned. British racism has indeed harmed many Indians, but not vice versa; if some Indians are anti-white, why worry?
    
	Im less sure about anti-black: I heard too much from African students in my Mumbai days. But Harbhajan Singh is a cricketer, not a might-be landlord or girlfriends father. Whatever he said, he didnt bellow it through a megaphone. In contrast, take Sunil Gavaskars view that Procters judgment was a white man taking the white mans word against that of the brown man. A comment not made (perhaps) by a young cricketer, in mid-field, in the heat of battle, but coolly, days later, in a big newspaper, by an older, far more famous one  who, however brown, in his days was often given not out by white umpires rejecting the appeals of his white opponents. If I were Procter, Id think I (definitely) deserved an apology quite as much as (maybe) Andrew Symonds did.

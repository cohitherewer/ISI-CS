	The middle path                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court has come up with a sensible verdict on reservations, given the exigencies of our times. After upholding the constitutional validity of reserving 27 per cent government jobs for other backward classes, the court could not have struck down a similar quota arrangement for Central educational institutions (Quota but skimmed, April 11). This ruling is going to give rise to insoluble problems. It will never be easy to separate the creamy layer from the rest. Such a distinction will lead to a lot of corruption. Many would lie about their economic status to secure the privileges. The court has shown great insight in declaring that reservations cannot continue in perpetuity and that there should be a periodic review. While the Centre is yet to review the progress made by the beneficiaries of reservations so far, the number of castes and tribes in the backward list has been swelling. It is unlikely that the ruling party, forever trying to appease its vote banks, would be too keen on the review.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshobhya, Mysore 

                
	Sir  Ideally, in an egalitarian society, there should be no reservation, and merit should rule. But thanks to a bunch of self-interested politicians, the next best thing that Indians have is the quota, now with the creamy layer kept outside it. It is true that the real benefits of reservation should reach those who need it most direly. Then why keep the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes immune to the exceptions made in case of the creamy layer? Why would well-off SC/ST families get privileges that are meant only for the neglected members of the community?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

      
	Sir  The apex court verdict upholding reservations for OBCs in the Central educational institutions is a major victory for the United Progressive Alliance government. The court has pre-empted any possibility of double-dealing by excluding the creamy layer from the purview of the reservations. This ruling upholds the spirit of equality enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Reservation is mired in controversy, but it is undeniable that the backward castes continue to be oppressed. There is also an equal possibility that deserving candidates from the general category would be unable to secure admission to premier institutions because of reservations. This dichotomy reflects, rather than contradicts, the nature of democracy in India. Being democratic involves taking decisions through debate. The 93rd Amendment and Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 try to capture the complexities inherent in affirmative action. There is no reason to consider this ruling absolute, since the government, following court orders, would periodically review the progress of the OBCs. Even at the risk of dreaming too big, we can hope for a time when reservations would become redundant.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.R.K. Pillai, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  It is a good idea to exclude the creamy layer from the reservations to ensure maximum benefit to the largest number of people. However, it remains to be seen how effectively the government would be able to implement this ruling. Institutions of higher education are expected to increase seats by 54 per cent over three years so that the number of general seats does not get badly skewed. But the change must be accompanied by a parallel hauling up of the infrastructure  increasing the number of teachers, providing placement to that many more students and so on. Hopefully, the government will keep these requirements in mind before implementing the ruling.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Soumyendu Sekhar Roy, Assam 

                
	Sir  Reservation for the OBCs in Central educational institutes, excluding the creamy layer, is perhaps not an effective solution. The steep fees at most institutions of higher learning are going to remain beyond the reach of the poor, even if the creamy layer is kept at bay.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
G.C. Biswas, Barasat

                
	Sir  The Supreme Court verdict on reservations is balanced, but the exclusion of the creamy layer should be extended to government-service and to electoral politics. Politicians from reserved categories will not like the verdict, given that many of them come from this layer. All reserved categories, like the SC, ST and OBC, should be merged into a single category with an annual review of how the castes and tribes are faring.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The media cannot praise the Supreme Court for keeping the creamy layer out of reservations, and also ask for merit to be given priority in admissions to institutions of higher learning. The truly meritorious would never be afraid to compete equally with others. If reservation is to be introduced at all, its benefits should reach everyone below the poverty line, whatever their caste.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  There should not be a separate cut-off for OBCs for admission to institutes of higher education. If under-performers are allowed to get in with lower marks, they will fare poorly in the examinations, and hinder the chances of deserving candidates from the general category.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

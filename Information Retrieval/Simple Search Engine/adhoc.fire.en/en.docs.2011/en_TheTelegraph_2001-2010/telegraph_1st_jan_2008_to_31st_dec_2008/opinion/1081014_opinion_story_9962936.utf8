	Like distant Khairlanji in 2006, Vatoli village in Andhra Pradesh too should enter public memory as a shameful reminder of the brutalities committed in India in the name of caste, class or religion. Six people of a family belonging to the minority community were burnt alive while their neighbours, with whom they apparently shared cordial relations, slept undisturbed. The crime has been blamed on outsiders, but in the severely polarized world in Indias cities, towns and villages, it is no longer possible to ascertain who exactly is an insider and who the outsider. The carnage in Vatoli follows the communal disturbances in one of its nearest towns, Bhainsa, which continues to be under curfew since the last two days. The incident, together with the previous ones in the area, has given political leaders from both the majority and minority communities the pretext to raise the political pitch before the elections. They have promised action if the culprits are not caught by the administration, which, anyway, has been snubbed by the call for an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation. In other words, just as in Orissa, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the communal fire here, carefully lit, is not going to be doused till the maximum political advantage has been reaped from it.         
	The political front that stands to gain the most is the sangh parivar, which has already seen a sharp improvement in its fortunes in the local elections held in Orissa after its anti-conversion drive. It obviously hopes to replicate its success in the other states where its foot soldiers are doggedly at work, exploiting prejudices, old hatreds and animosities. Little wonder then that the prime minister sounded a worried man at the National Integration Council meeting. In Andhra Pradesh, where the Bharatiya Janata Party has so far been unable to make a dent, the communal card could change the tide. The Hindu Vahini is trying its utmost. Its purpose will be served if leaders of the minority community like Assaduddin Owaisi carry out their threat of equal and opposite action.

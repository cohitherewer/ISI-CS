The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | bACK TO THE BARRACK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BACK TO THE BARRACK                                  Fifth Column - Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	Whether Musharrafs empire is crumbling fast or not is not quite the point. What is significant is the emerging contradiction in Pakistans political system. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who was handpicked by President Musharraf as the army chief, opened the heart of the army to the new government in an unprecedented move with a detailed briefing on security issues, including the war on terror and the situation in Pakistans tribal areas. The briefing, reportedly, was attended by cabinet ministers as well as by leaders of the ruling coalition.         
	Some quarters have described the briefing as a routine affair. The defence minister, ChaudhryAhmed Mukhtar, stated that Yousaf Raza Gilani, the new prime minister, had instructed Kayani to be present at the briefing. Whatever may be the case, it is evident that Kayani is trying to distance himself from his mentor, Musharraf. He seems to be keen to give the impression to Pakistans civilian rulers and to the world that the Pakistan army is now an apolitical institution.        
	In fact, in one deft stroke, Kayani has outmanoeuvred his detractors by pushing the civilian rulers forward to deal with security issues, thereby coolly passing on the baton to the elected government. Such a step, Kayani hopes, would shield the army from the criticism that it is not being subservient to the government.                
	Changing times        
	Questions could be asked as to whether Kayani took Musharrafs permission to do what he has done. It is likely that Musharraf was not consulted in this matter. Kayani met Musharraf that same day at a memorial service. Musharraf sat on the dias, and was flanked by Kayani and his fellow generals. But it seems unlikely that the two discussed strategies during such a solemn occasion.        
	It is not yet time for Musharraf to call it a day. But he has to lie low for a while. One false step on Musharrafs part may result in his losing the armys support to save the chair. It is increasingly getting difficult for the army to play ball in Pakistans political arena. It has created too many enemies for itself and should now be ordered back to the barrack.        
	In a clear departure from the Musharraf era, Kayani has ordered his men to dissociate themselves from politics and concentrate on their professional duties instead. That Kayani means business has been proved by his decision to transfer Nadeem Ejaz Ahmed, a Musharraf loyalist, from the capital to a mofussil, thereby restricting his powers and sphere of influence.                
	Repair job        
	Kayani appears to have detected the fault lines of the past that are confronting the Pakistan army at present. These fissures have undoubtedly undermined the armys professionalism and endangered the lives of soldiers in the cities and the countryside.        
	If Kayani is serious about letting the army play second fiddle to the government and accept the supremacy of civilian rulers, then one can be hopeful about Pakistans future. However, given the nations history and the conduct of its ambitious generals, one sincerely wishes that Kayani will not fall into a similar trap and seize power in a coup before the end of his tenure as army chief.         
	Hopefully, Kayani will not be forced to abdicate or make way for another man who would take Pakistan back to the days of confusion, anarchy and instability. Kayani, thus far, has proved that he is an astute professional. He has also shown that he has the necessary skills to handle the countrys politicians as well as the president. However, only time will tell whether the army chief, elected politicians and the general-turned-president can work together to change the fate of this nation.

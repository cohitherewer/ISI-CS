            Business blues				 
             
	What happens in the first quarter (January-March) largely determines the buoyancy of the Indian publishing scene for the rest of the year. This is because it is the peak selling season, and not just due to the weather and the book fairs  the Calcutta Book Fair, the two-yearly Delhi International Book Fair, and several other book fairs in other states  but rather because the annual grants have to be exhausted before the end of the financial year in March. On a rough estimate, nearly half the annual turnover of the major publishers comes in these months and so, too, the cash collections, which are crucial for a trade that runs on perpetual credit. This means the book business is not evenly distributed throughout the year. What are the implications of these one-off sales and collections and what can be done by publishers to ensure a more equitable distribution of business?
    
	Cash strapped businesses require stringent budgeting, but with publishers this is much more so, simply because there is little flow of funds after the main selling season is over. This means that publication of new books, especially by first-time authors, is either not accepted or inordinately delayed. Most of the fresh investment goes into reprints of the backlists or sure-shot sellers like glitz, sex, crime or non-books by celebrities that are sponsored either by themselves or their patrons. Or else, publishers prefer investing in reprint rights of books that have been turned into soap operas or professional texts widely used in British and American universities and therefore having good chances of acceptance in Indian universities. Many authors dont realize that about 80 per cent of non-fiction books are commissioned. 
    
	Poor liquidity has led to subsidized publishing in a big way. That is, authors pay for their works to be published or at least arrange for copies to be bought back that would pay for the cost of production and other overhead expenses. This is not a phenomenon confined to India but is fairly widespread in Britain as well, where small and medium range publishers regularly solicit manuscripts and guarantee publication; what they dont advertise is that authors would have to pay for their books to be published on the basis of cost estimates prepared by them. It is doubtful whether authors get paid any royalties; all they get is the satisfaction of seeing their book in print.
    
	What can be done to spread retail or cash-across-the-counter sales? More bookshops is the pat answer, but it isnt easy because the economics of retail bookshops leaves small margins for the new bookseller who has to pay a high premium for prime locations. One solution is direct selling to institutions and individuals through e-commerce, or by advertisements in magazines. For small publishers with lower overhead costs, this seems to be working well. This is the short-term solution; the long-term is to improve the quality of education because in India there is a link between education and book sales: over 90 per cent of the books sold relate to the knowledge industry.

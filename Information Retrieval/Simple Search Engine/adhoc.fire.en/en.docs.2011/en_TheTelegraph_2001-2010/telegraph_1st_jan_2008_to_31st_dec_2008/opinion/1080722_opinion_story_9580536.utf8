	A Nobel laureate may condemn divisiveness as dangerous, when showing it to be a result of giving the Islamic identity of a Muslim person automatic priority over all other affiliations, priorities and pursuits he may have. But for politicians in India, such divisiveness may be useful, and the danger in it a small price to pay in the race for power. When the chips are down, as they are now, one of the quick-fix solutions for the leaders of the country is to conjure up the bogey of the minority communitys displeasure. The case of the Indo-US nuclear deal has been no exception, with the Communist Party of India (Marxists)s M.K. Pandhe and the Bahujan Samaj Partys Mayavati inaugurating the discourse with statements that the minority community will see the deal as anti-Muslim. The CPI(M) was quick to disown Mr Pandhes remarks, but the way the party is cuddling up to the BSP, it does not look as if it is seriously displeased with the BSP chiefs line. And that line is very clear. It sees the minority community purely in terms of its religion, and not as citizens of India with the right to debate over national interests. This kind of argument projects Muslims as being anti-American, anti-Bush, and therefore against the nuclear deal, because that is supposed to be against the interests of Muslims worldwide. It is shameful that the CPI(M) and the BSP should deliberately bring in communal markers in order to polarize support for what is a foreign policy decision aimed at enhancing Indias energy security. The deal has nothing to do with anyones religion, and it is misleading to bring in questions of religion into the discussion.         
	This politicking by secular parties is even more shameful in the light of the efforts of certain Muslim organizations to dissociate religion  that is, their religion  from the discussion around the deal. Some groups have made clear that they are against the deal because they think it is not in Indias long-term interest, just as any non-Muslim citizen might do, and not because they think that the deal is anti-Muslim. There is no denying that there is a certain amount of disaffection regarding the deal, as Shahid Siddiqui has demonstrated. But that could happen in the case of any major policy decision. What is to be condem- ned is the communalizing of such disaffection  and the eagerness of politicians from all communities to do so whenever they think it expedient.

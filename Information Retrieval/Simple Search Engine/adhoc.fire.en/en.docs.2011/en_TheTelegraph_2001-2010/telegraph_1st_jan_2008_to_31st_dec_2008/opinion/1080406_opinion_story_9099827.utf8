	Somehow, life is always more colourful in the South. There is, unfailingly, high drama around the gravest as the most trivial of incidents, and film-style dramatics on the part of politicians are as normal as dramatic declarations in real life by hordes of filmstars. Even an affair as dampening as a quarrel over river waters can ignite chauvinistic passions that result in damaged buses, blocked inter-state routes, ransacked offices and hotels, blacked-out television channels and shut-down film shows. But the disagreement between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the latters Hogenakkal combined water supply project near its border with Karnataka has also brought out actors in their droves in both states. Dazzling stars sat down to an eight-hour fast in Chennai, in protest against what is being seen as Karnatakas unjust obstruction of Tamil Nadus drinking-water project for the arid districts of Dharampuri and Krishnagiri, and the closing- down of Tamil films in Karnataka. They had with them the best wishes of the state assembly.         
	For thousands of fans, this was a thrilling show  free, and in the open air. Rajanikanth himself, the icon beyond all others, was present and gently vocal, whatever secret hesitations he might have had, having been born in Karnataka and succeeded in Tamil Nadu. Organized by the South Indian Artists Association, the protest also starred Kamal Hassan, Murali and Arjun, the top Malayalam star, Jayaram, apart from glamorous starlets such as Trisha and Nayantara, and actors-turned-politicians, Sarathkumar and Vijayakant. In a state and region that boasts a string of showbiz personalities-turned-politicians in the highest positions  not even the present chief minister and his rival are exceptions  such a show could hardly be less political than it was aesthetic. And the film fraternity in Karnataka was not to be outdone. The Karnataka Film Chambers of Commerce organized an anti-Hogenakkal daylong dharna by technicians, directors, producers and distributors, together with the members of the late icon Rajkumars family, Parvathamma, and actors like Raghavendra and Puneet. Kannadigas had their open day with stars too.         
	The Hogenakkal project had been agreed upon in 1998, apparently on the understanding that the respective riparian states would not interfere in one anothers drinking water projects as long as they used only the water allotted to them from the Cauvery. Karnataka has completed its drinking water project for Bangalore. It is perhaps the imminent assembly elections in Karnataka, now under presidents rule, that have inspired interested parties to confuse the issue. Where the film industry is so intimately connected to popular life, as in the South, it also has to bear the brunt of provincial chauvinism. Tamil films and television channels were shut down in Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu retaliated in kind. There is now likely to be a short period of peace. The chief minister of Tamil Nadu has agreed to not to proceed with Hogenakkal until the polls are over in Karnataka. But peace or war, the South can always depend on its stars to come out on cue.

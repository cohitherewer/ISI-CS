	John F. Nash, a brilliant mathematician, was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 1994. Game theory, the area of work that brought Nash the award, was originally developed by yet another mathematical genius, John von Neumann (in association with Oscar Morgenstern) in 1944. However, it was Nash who refined the Neumann-Morgenstern idea and gave it a form that appealed to economists.         
	To clarify the nature of Nashs non-cooperative game theory, as it is called, consider two neighbours, A and B, faced with a garbage disposal problem. In the absence of municipal facilities, a reality faced by the city of Calcutta, A chooses Bs courtyard for getting rid of his garbage and B reciprocates. Each individual employs the best strategy available to him, given the best strategy of his rival. The result is an outcome known as a Nash equilibrium. The rivals end up in a situation that can be improved upon. However, improvement calls for cooperation  that is, converging to a discussion table to figure out a better way of living.         
	In 1953, Nash devised a neat way out of the problem, so long as there were only two players in the game. His ingenuity lay in the demonstration that any cooperative, hence superior, outcome of the garbage disposal problem or similar games might be achieved within the boundaries of non-cooperative behaviour. To figure out how this works, let us expand on the set of available strategies for A and B by supposing that each owns a ferocious pet dog. Person A threatens B that he would let his dog loose on him each time he steps out of his home unless he desists from his current mode of garbage disposal. And B reciprocates with the same threat.               
	Given these threats, the instinct for self-preservation makes both parties see reason and begin to cooperate. Cooperation takes the form of bargaining, since each wishes to contribute as little as possible towards hiring, say, a disposal agency. However, so long as the threat strategy stands, they would be averse to giving up on the bargaining process. Further, given that there may not be a unique solution to the cooperative process, it is often necessary for an arbitrator to help the rivals arrive at an acceptable resolution of the dilemma. Nashs non-cooperative solution to the bargaining problem requires that the arbitrator command prestige and authority to prevail upon the rivals to accept the focal point to which he leads them.         
	Nash was able to demonstrate that if all the stated conditions for the two- person bargaining game are satisfied, a unique cooperative solution to the problem is achievable with the help of non-cooperative threat strategies. Unfortunately, the solution does not work this way when there are more than two rivals, since alternative coalition possibilities emerge leading to deeper problems, studied initially by Neumann and Morgenstern.         
	The recent Singur crisis in West Bengal can be viewed as Nashs two-person bargaining game. Despite the fact that there were several political parties involved in the confrontation, they had grouped into two clearly discernible camps, to be referred to as the state government and the Opposition. What was at stake was the industrial revival of the state, for which the Tata group was brought in with special privileges. However, for the Tatas to operate, land had to be acquired, thereby unsettling a large number of farmers. Economic development implies social change, a change that involves human beings. Even if embarrassing, it is best to appreciate the fact that development, even if it benefits a large number of people, cannot prevent inconveniencing a smaller number at the same time.         
	This fact has clearly been borne out by the Singur imbroglio. While acquiring land, the compensation that was paid to the farmers was not adequate, even though it was higher than the price prevailing at the moment. The price increased several times as the main factory and ancillary units began to take shape. As the Singur area develops with rapid industrialization, it will improve the lot of innumerable people. Such benefits may or may not accrue to the initial losers.         
	This is the human face of the problem. On the other hand, the two-person bargaining game it gave rise to had large political gains and losses at stake. The state governments point of view needs little explanation. But the Opposition has far more to gain compared to the state government, given that in recent times it was almost marginalized in the state. It did make some gains in the panchayat and municipal elections, but they were not enough. Real strength needs to be demonstrated in the legislative assembly and the parliament. And this means increasing the Oppositions vote-share in the upcoming elections. However, votes cannot be increased unless the population identifies the Opposition to be fighting for a cause that will benefit them.         
	The return of lost land, therefore, was made the issue. In order to force the state government to participate in the bargaining process, a threat strategy was required. The Singur siege, including the blockade of the Durgapur Expressway, was the Oppositions threat strategy. The threat was made credible by preventing workers from entering the Tata factory. Moreover, the demand for the governors presence during discussions reflected the need for an impartial moderator whom both parties respected. The Tatas decision to close down the factory sine die amounted to handing out on a platter a natural counter-threat strategy to the state government. What added credibility, in this case, was the decision by the Japanese engineers to move back to their country.         
	The entire nation has seen what these threats led to. There were several rounds of discussion, and finally an agreement emerged, as predicted by Nashs theory. The immediate result is that the siege platform is being dismantled and the expressway is free for traffic movement. These are gains for the state economy, needless to say.               
	However, there is now a fly in the ointment. It is unclear how the Tatas are looking at the agreement arrived at by the rival parties. Besides, the local panchayat has stated that it will not demarcate land for dispossessed farmers outside the project area. Reality, alas, rarely fits the theory exactly. Nonetheless, how worried should people be about the future of the project? The land located inside the boundary of the project is no longer fit for cultivation. Even if it is returned to the farmers, they will wish to sell it back at the market price, either to the Tatas or the entrepreneurs who plan to invest in the ancillary units. From the beginning, this was the game plan of the Opposition. Everyone concerned knew that the land would be sold off  first, because the quality of the land has changed and, second, because it is a contradiction to locate an agricultural community within an automobile industrys area of operation.         
	It is very unlikely now that the Opposition will organize yet another siege. If it does so, there is little doubt that the Tatas will leave, thereby implementing the state governments threat strategy. The state government will lose a lot, but the Opposition will lose far more. If the Tatas leave, the blame will fall squarely on the Opposition. It will be wiped out from this states political horizon forever. The Opposition is politically alert and understands this. It is very doubtful, therefore, that the predictions of the Nash solution will not be fulfilled. And if they are, the Singur event will justifiably be looked upon as a classic text-book example of the power of the Nash theory. Non-cooperation can form the basis of cooperation.

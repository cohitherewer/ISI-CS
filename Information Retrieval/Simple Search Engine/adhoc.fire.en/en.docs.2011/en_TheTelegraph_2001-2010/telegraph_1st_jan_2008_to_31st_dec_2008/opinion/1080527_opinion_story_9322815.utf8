                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE END IS NEAR                                  Malvika Singh                              
	I felt vindicated with the election results of Karnataka. There had been a lot of arguments about how the fight between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress was going to be pretty much even and how the return of S.M. Krishna, the former chief minister of Karnataka, was going to consolidate the Congress vote. All these optimistic speculations were typical of a party that shuns any negative news which may well be true. I had taken bets with a few close confidantes and friends that the Congress would get somewhere between 65 and 80 seats, but closer to 65. The Congress has won 80 seats, thus proving my speculation correct to an extent. Yet when I had announced my guess, some serious analysts had looked at me as though I were a flighty number-dropper without any understanding of caste equations and other such political realities. I was dismissed with benign, condescending smiles and glances that spoke volumes.        
	There was no way the Congress could have won in Karnataka. Congress is a party that spends the better part of its waking hours digging knives into the backs of its own party fraternity, one that has mastered the art of being deaf to the truth lest it disrupts the comfort and complacency of the power hierarchy at its headquarters at 24 Akbar Road in Delhi. It is a party that has ceased to hear what its workers and supporters try to tell it following their interaction with the public. Insulated from the changes that are happening silently under the surface, and aided by stuck-in-a-groove, overconfident political analysts belting out theories that belong to the recent past, the top leadership is isolated from the people. The poll results in almost all the states of this country are beginning to expose this sad reality.                
	Death knell        
	The mismanagement of ticket distribution, last minute, unplanned changes in nomination, the inability to reach out to those in the field, listen to them and alter the faulty Delhi-centric strategies that are prepared by a few favoured advisers  all these factors have come together and destroyed the Congress. It seems clear to anyone watching the political scene in a non-partisan way that the trusted men and women, who were fresh and young when Rajiv Gandhi first came to power but who today are old and out of sync with the shifting politics of 2008, are desperately fighting against each other to survive within the party instead of fighting their political opponents over national issues. They are not thinking beyond what serves their personal interests and have deliberately kept the rulers misinformed. They need to be crucified if the Congress intends to reinvent itself to face a new generation. The Congress is falling into the many traps that are planted by insiders and by some opponents from the outside. It is headed straight towards disintegration.         
	The BJPs victory in Karnataka did not happen out of nothing. The party had worked for its success. If it manages to run a competent government and deliver the goods to the citizens of the state now, it will return again with a complete majority. If it does not perform well, it will be hurled out. That is the change. Anti-incumbency for the heck of it  aaj aap ki baari, agle baar hum  is a chant of the past, something that the Congress has not yet accepted.         
	The United Progressive Alliance government has exposed itself. Its performance over the last year in particular has showed it up as dithering on crucial issues it had professed to believe in. Had it stood by its positions, not crumpled under pressure from the Left and had allowed a midterm poll, respect for the Congress would have been far greater than what it is today. It became a sorry victim of its bullying coalition partners and is facing the consequences of its indecisions now.

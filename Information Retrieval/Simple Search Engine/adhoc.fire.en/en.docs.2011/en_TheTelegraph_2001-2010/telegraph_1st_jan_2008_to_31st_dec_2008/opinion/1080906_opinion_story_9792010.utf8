Datta-Ray                                                      
	The outcome of Gopalkrishna Gandhis imaginative initiative, setting a new benchmark for gubernatorial involvement in crisis management, may not matter much to Mamata Banerjee since Singur, like Nandigram, is only another stop on her relentless march to the Writers Buildings. That is a legitimate enough destination for a politician whose stamina evokes admiration and who brings to her mission a gift for histrionics that her adversary, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, cannot hope to match.        
	He would baulk, for instance, at draping himself in a burqa to be photographed offering namaz at the start of the Ramazan fasting. Seeing the picture in Wednesdays newspaper, I wondered what prayers she muttered in that unlikely garb. What prayers, for that matter, did Jaswant Singh intone (and in what language?) as he stood in a yarmulke, the Jewish skull cap, with closed eyes and cupped hands at Jerusalems Wailing Wall? Such gestures are less acts of faith than intended to inspire faith  in Ms Banerjees case, in the 25 per cent of West Bengals population that is Muslim. This is the CPI(M)s natural constituency, not only because 70 per cent of Bengali Muslims are said to live below the poverty-line and Marxists champion the deprived, but also because Left Front West Bengal is still a haven of secular stability without the witch-hunting that disfigures Gujarat and Orissa.              
	But with Didi on the rampage, Bhattacharjee must look to his laurels both as saviour of the poor and upholder of secularism. Determined to snatch both, the plump 53-year-old Trinamul Congress leader has also given notice of other causes tucked away in the folds of her sari in case Singur fails. Her only purpose being to dislodge the Left Front, collecting the gratitude and votes of people on the way, it makes little difference if already enriched cultivators, speculators and brokers benefit more than actual cultivators from the sale of surplus land she is demanding. They will be indebted to the fragile hotchpotch of dissidents, malcontents, rebels, ideologues, opportunists and careerists who have flocked to her standard and to which she seeks to lend gravitas by inducting a sprinkling of bureaucrats, entertainment folk and academics.        
	Mamata Banerjee knows how to keep this motley crew titillated. Who can forget the drama when she knotted a black shawl round her neck like a noose at a huge rally and threatened to strangle herself because the Congress had allegedly sealed a secret electoral pact with the CPI(M)? But instead of strangling herself, she flung the shawl (or one very like it) at Ram Vilas Paswan, then Union railways minister, in the Lok Sabha for supposedly ignoring West Bengals needs. Her indefinite fasts begin in a blaze of publicity and peter out in obscurity. Since she knows that cars are made in Bavaria, she was probably also aware that the red band round her head to signify a close encounter with death recalled the red ribbon that Napoleons not-tonight-Josephine wore round her neck to proclaim that the guillotine had nearly severed it.         
	Durga Prasad Saroj, a Samajwadi Party MP who dared to question the womens representation bill, is probably even more of a dyed-in-the-wool MCP for the experience of Didi dragging him by his shirt collar from the well of the House. The well is where she alone is entitled to squat, scream and pelt the Speaker (or was it the Deputy Speaker, Charanjit Singh?) with scraps of paper. The media play up these antics and the public laps them up. Its another matter though whether they add to her credibility as a potential chief minister.        
	Perhaps that is why she grasped the political lifeline that Gandhi threw her. A readiness to talk indicates an anxiety to project a more responsible image. It also betrays an anxiety to avoid blame for thwarting efforts to end West Bengals stagnation. Though still refusing to call off her blockade, she reiterates she has no objection to the Tatas and welcomes industrialization. Her suggestions of an alternative site for ancillary industries and a willingness to reduce the magic figure of 400 acres also sound conciliatory. She had probably begun to realize even before the tragedy of a cultivators suicide that voters see her as a major obstacle to the states regeneration.         
	In previous incarnations, Ms Banerjee has been a minister of state at the Centre in P.V. Narasimha Raos Congress government and a cabinet minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayees National Democratic Alliance coalition. Now girding for battle for her home territory under her own colours, she has a third card  apart from poverty and secularism  to play. Without overtly invoking provincial passions like the Shiv Sena or invisible Amra Bangali idealists, the peasants cause projects her as the voice of long-suffering rural Bengal. Though no Left Front constituent will admit this, the ethnic element was a powerful factor in facilitating their sweep to power in the late Seventies when the communists were seen as a 100 per cent indigenous force pitted against a Congress that was at Sanjay Gandhis beck and call and the tool of a Centre that Bengalis equated with the Hindi-Hindu cow belt.         
	As the Congress virtually faded out of West Bengal politics, the CPI(M), combining unspoken parochial loyalty with ideological fervour, looked like an unstoppable force with only Trinamul opposing its advance. But the Trinamuls sun seemed to be setting lately: having lost the Calcutta municipality in 2005, it lost more than half its MLAs to the CPI(M) in the following years assembly election. Quietly mortgaged to traders from outside the state though it might be, the Hammer and Sickle seemed destined to fly forever over the states political landscape.         
	But not with a rumbustious Didi seizing on Nandigram and now Singur to stomp the comeback trail. The hamhandedness displayed by Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen has given her the chance. The duos sudden  if commendable  lurch towards capitalist reconstruction was never properly explained to either party cadre or communist supporters and sympathizers. Nor were the substantial gains that have already accrued from the Nano plant, with expectations of more. The government cannot even categorically repudiate Ms Banerjees 400-acre figure and provide a convincing alternative: it dithers between 47, 167, 254 and 334 acres. People still want to know why the House of Tata, high priest of the free market, could not buy its own land at market prices instead of relying on the government to invoke an archaic law. Why did Bhattacharjee absurdly promise to acquire only one-crop land when there arent even land records with such clear specifications?               
	The mystifying award of huge projects to a little-known Indonesian group inevitably prompted talk of kickbacks. The suspicion that people linked to the government or ruling party expect to make a killing from what Didi calls the 500 acres of lowland available on the other side of the road further tarnishes the CPI(M)s reputation. Nandigram famously moved the governor to cold horror. Like Ratan Tata, Gopalkrishna Gandhi is also caught in the middle between two political contestants.         
	Capitalizing on bungling to score thumping victories in both Nandigram and Singur in the May panchayat polls, Ms Banerjee warns she will now take up the cause of small retail (Bengali) shopkeepers who feel their livelihood is threatened by supermarkets and shopping malls owned by outsiders like the Ambanis and Goenkas. This is mobilizing the ethnic vote; its also moving from country to town. After two frustrating stints in New Delhi, Mamata Banerjee knows there can be no real power without a base: she must capture and control the state. For West Bengal, too, it is time for a change after 30 years of communist domination. But one cannot help but wish the prospect did not suggest jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.

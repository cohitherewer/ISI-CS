The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | silence is scary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SILENCE IS SCARY                                  Malvika Singh                              
	India seems to have lost the headstart it once had over all other developing nations in the middle of the last century. From the era of the Nehrus and the Nassers, there has been an intellectual decline in the leadership of this nation-state as well as in the realm of governance. There seems to be no value, ethics, belief or fundamentals alive that the men and women, who are elected by us to govern the country, abide by.        
	A rapacious, greedy and intellectually limited political class has managed to corrupt the polity. When the younger generation of political leaders attempts to rebuild a new mechanism from the base to ensure a strong future, they are mocked by the elders in power, who remain in the gaddi despite a large zero on their report card. The failed politicians and leaders need to be ejected out of the system and all the self-serving manipulators put to pasture, making way for another, fresh dispensation that does not carry the negative baggage of the past two decades.        
	The demand for an independent Gorkha state has begun to boom in no uncertain way. It is when the governance and civil society fail to deliver the basics  roti, kapda, makaan, education, health and employment opportunities  and then stall the freedom of expression in an effort to put a veil on their own inability, that demands from neglected communities rise out of the mire and break the personalized, comfortable status quo of the ruling class. The Gujjars are asking for their rights in Rajasthan and that protest could well spill over to many other states. Closures, bandhs and blockages, whether of railtracks or of borders between states of India, are creating havoc in both society and polity. The silence that resounds in the home ministry in Delhi is scary, to say the least.                
	Soft state        
	If the son of the home minister is conducting his business from his fathers official residence, and the father does not make a public statement rejecting the malpractice, how can such a home minister call for law and order? Why can he be entrusted with the task of ensuring that our borders with China remain intact across Arunachal Pradesh or Sikkim? Why should he be allowed to remain silent and not explain his non-action? Why does the prime minister not demand a time bound inquiry into this kind of soft functioning that has made India vulnerable? People and countries flex their muscles when they see a weak government and a flabby state. China will not lose this opportunity to get the better of India. Why is the United Progressive Alliance government blind to these glaring realities?        
	Had the Manmohan Singh government signed the nuclear deal with the United States of America in August last year, and had the UPA stood up and confronted the tactics of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that was desperately wanting to scuttle the deal, we would have been a stronger entity and China would not be bullying us on our borders. We would have been an important, albeit new, member of an international club of nations and that, in itself, would have been a deterrent to Chinas bullying. But  the eternal but we allowed ourselves to be emasculated by our elected representatives who held the citizens to ransom.         
	Whichever way you look at the scene in India today, the situation is depressing. A weak government at the Centre has allowed the worst possible blackmailing tactics to win over sensible politics. This is the reason behind the Left Front getting the upper hand in the parliament, the Gujjars throwing life in jeopardy in Rajasthan, the Maoists increasing their numbers in the hinterland, the escalating Naxalite violence, and the demand for Gorkhaland. The government continues to be silent on these issues, unable to speak out or act. Is this not a perfect definition of a soft state?

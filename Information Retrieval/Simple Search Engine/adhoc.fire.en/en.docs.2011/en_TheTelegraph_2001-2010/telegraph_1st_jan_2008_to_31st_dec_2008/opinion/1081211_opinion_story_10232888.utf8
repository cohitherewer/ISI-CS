	Mumbais attacks are big news here. Xinhua, the official news agency, had at least three reporters covering the attacks, so the Chinese people got a thorough account of what was happening. Many Chinese who wanted to visit Mumbai are now having second thoughts on seeing the pictures of the Taj on fire and a blood-stained CST platform. Travel agents confirmed that many group tours to India had been cancelled. Those who have friends in Mumbai have written to them asking them to take care, Mangmai (Mandarin for Mumbai) seems like a dangerous place.        
	The papers reported that altogether seven Chinese were evacuated from the Oberoi and Taj Mahal hotels, including a general manager of the Chinese oil company, Sinopec, and a chef. Apparently, there are almost 1,000 Chinese working in Mumbai. They were getting constant updates and emergency contact numbers on their mobiles from the consulate there, informing them not to move out. One of them, a telecom engineer, was reported as saying, It is a religious conflict. We will not go back out on the street for a long time.        
	The Chinese take on the attacks has come through quite clearly in the reports emanating from Delhi and Pakistan. The Indian governments allegations against Pakistan have all been carried. So have the Pakistan governments responses. But the space given to the Pakistani version far outweighs that given to the Indian one. Almost every statement by any Pakistani minister has been reported. Thus, while yesterdays papers carry a brief report about the Mumbai police releasing details about the identities of the killed terrorists, there is a longer report quoting Pakistans foreign minister asserting that Pakistan does not want war but will defend itself.                 
	War cries        
	Earlier, Sherry Rehman, Pakistans information minister, was quoted declaring that Pakistan would not allow its soil to be used for terror acts, and that the armed forces have expressed their full confidence in the government. The Pakistan media has played a responsible role. The paper also quoted Condoleezza Rice in Islamabad cautioning India not to take steps that would worsen the situation and expressing satisfaction at Pakistans response.        
	The overall impression an ordinary Chinese would get is that though India accuses Pakistan, there is really no proof that the attack originated from there. The clinching evidence came from a huge oped piece in the China Daily profiling Ajmal Mohammed Amir, the terrorist captured in Mumbai, his family background, age et al, with one crucial revelation  there is no proof that he is Pakistani. The article quotes profusely from Pakistani sources to conclude this.         
	Interestingly, the only Indian voice to be heard in the press here was at complete variance with the shrill war cries back home. O.P. Rana, who works with the China Daily, wrote in his column that the most potent weapons against militancy are not guns and jails but social equality and education. Pointing out that Pakistan was already fighting the war against terror within, he asked Indian leaders to seize the opportunity to jointly fight militancy instead of breaking off all contacts and thereby playing into the terrorists hands. Finally, he asked the Indian government to ensure that innocents dont fall prey to the marauding band of jingoists, who have been targeting Muslims for all the ills in the country.        
	China has its own terrorism problem  the East Turkistan groups in Xinjiang. While they claim to be fighting for religious freedom, China says they are linked to al Qaida. After Mumbai, Chinese security experts are talking about the need for extra vigilance in Xinjiang.

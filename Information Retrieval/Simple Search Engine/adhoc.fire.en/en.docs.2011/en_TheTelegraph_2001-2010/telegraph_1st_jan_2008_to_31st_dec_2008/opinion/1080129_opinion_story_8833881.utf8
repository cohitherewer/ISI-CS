The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Grey thoughts in a green shade
                                                                                                              GREY THOUGHTS IN A GREEN SHADE                                  CHANGING COLOURS      Even when a tree needs to be felled, the CMC is loath to provide permission                                                   
	Whenever I look back to my childhood days, I find them strangely suffused with a greenish glow. This verdant tint has a palpable quality to it that makes it impossible for me to dismiss it as a clichd poetic association I have picked up from my readings. When I delve deeper into my memory, I discover the source of the light  it is the deodar tree that has stood in our garden for as far back in time as I can remember.         
	I had quite literally grown up in the shade of the deodar. Its dark green foliage brushing against the back end of our house caused the rear rooms to be bathed perpetually in an emerald light, making it easy for me to imagine as a child that I lived in an aquarium. Years later, when the childhood ability to glean happiness out of everything had waned, the deodar was my only true friend. Standing tall at about twenty feet, with its topmost leaves disappearing into the sky, that tree remained the still point of my turning world.        
	But the world, alas, cannot bear very much of reality. And so one day my parents announced that the deodar has to go. Its roots have entered the founding blocks of our ancient house, thus weakening it considerably. A violent storm might cause the tree to topple over, thus crushing our house beneath it.         
	For all my resistance to the felling of the deodar, I had to acknowledge my parents point. Stoically I prepared myself for the day when I would be faced with a terrible blankness in the place where the deodar had been. But it now seems that fate, in the shape of the CMC, has willed otherwise.        
	My parents travails started when they submitted a written petition to the CMC about three years ago to cut down the deodar. A few men duly came on inspection and said that even though the tree cannot be felled altogether, its branches should be pruned in a way as to arrest further growth. Before vanishing on this promising note, they kindly recommended the case to the forest department.        
	The forest department gave my parents a form of application (which has the remarkable title, The Kolkata Gazette, Extraordinary) to be submitted along with photographs showing the extent of the damage done by the tree, and the original plan for the plot of land on which our house and the deodar stand. With regard to the second requirement of the form, my parents faced a blank wall. Since my father is already fighting a case against my uncle over property rights, he was advised against submitting the plan. Meanwhile, the roots of the deodar made steadier inroads into the house and cracks appeared on the ground floor.         
	Whenever I watch trees along the roads of Calcutta being chopped off indiscriminately. I think about my old deodar. The CMC does not care to think of the environment when it can strike lucrative deals with realtors who find the roadside trees in the way of their plans for an uglier Calcutta. But it has a tendency to grow righteous when dealing with powerless men like my father. As a tribute to its piety, the deodar stands proudly where it has stood for over fifty years. As for me, it is no longer the still point. For it sways dangerously during every storm, as I watch my parents growing visibly pale.

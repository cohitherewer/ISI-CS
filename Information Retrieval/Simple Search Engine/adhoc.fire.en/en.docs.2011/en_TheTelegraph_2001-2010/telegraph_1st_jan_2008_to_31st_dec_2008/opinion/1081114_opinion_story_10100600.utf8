The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Habits die hard
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             HABITS DIE HARD                                  Malvika Singh                                    
	Margaret Alva, like many other politicians, was the product of a dynasty and a system of hand-me-downs. She would, like many others, want that easy tradition to continue in the next generation so as to ensure a family representative in the ranks of the next group of rulers. Seeing the attempt of Rahul Gandhi to de-personalize and democratize the party  as he resolves to enlarge the base with anonymous men and women committed to building a vehicle for change  leaders from the older generation, like Margaret Alva, Digvijay Singh, Ahmad Patel and others, seem to have become insecure about their political future and that of their offspring and adopted heirs. They can probably sense that an upheaval is imminent, because the degradation within the Congress is forcing a collapse of earlier party structures. Reinvention is frightening, to say the least, and nightmares of retirement appear to have scared the 55-plus lot of leaders. Reacting in different ways, some are buying and selling while others are busy digging knives into the back of their colleagues.                
	Step back        
	It is nearly impossible for professional politicos in India to give up politics for whatever it is worth because they have no other skill or expertise apart from manipulation. Present- day India symbolizes the truth of their failure. As a result, hitherto privileged politicians with nothing of consequence on their report cards are desperately shifting gear now, building invisible bridges with the Opposition, and trying to keep themselves entrenched somewhere in the mire that is the political arena today. The same goes for the general secretaries in charge of the many Indian states. They all have their personal agendas, their relatives to recommend and their corrupt methods of wheeling and dealing. They manipulate and distort realities in order to perpetuate the horrors that have infiltrated into the Congress over the last few decades. Not one of them is willing to step out of the line and fight the disease from within. Having realized that their comfortable future may be in jeopardy, these men and women are flexing their tired muscles and hitting out desperately with the wrong end of the stick.        
	To let go with grace is something that the Indian politician needs to learn. The squabbling, old politicians are exposing their profound disconnect from the new India, which is a changing, shifting and progressing reality. Maybe this is the moment for all those who are unhappy, displeased and disgruntled to step back and leave the stage empty for the young to occupy.

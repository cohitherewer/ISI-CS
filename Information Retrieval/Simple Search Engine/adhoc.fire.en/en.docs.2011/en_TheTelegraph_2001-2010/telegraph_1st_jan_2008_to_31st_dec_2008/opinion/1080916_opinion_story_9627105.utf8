	As the attention of Indians remains focused on the political duel in Delhi and terrorist attacks, it is easy to forget that a dangerous bomb is ticking away in the north-eastern corner of the country. Having suffered years of indifference from successive Central governments, a sense of alienation and frustration is strong there now. This is bound to affect the Indian polity sooner or later.         
	Although the north-eastern states share only 2 per cent of their borders with the Indian mainland and the rest with the neighbouring countries of China, Myanmar, Bangladesh Nepal and Bhutan, they are hopelessly dependent on India. They have the means, and the roads, to help them connect with the surrounding nations but are handicapped by the Central governments lack of interest, as they see it, in their cause. The Stilwell Road, for instance, that forms an important link between the Northeast and the Asian subcontinent, has been lying closed for years. Its reopening would unlock a wealth of opportunities for the Northeast. But the Union government would not be bothered.         
	Stilwell Road is actually a network of three major routes  one between Kunming to Wanding in southwest China, which was later extended till Lashio in Myanmar, and another from Ledo, the last railhead in Assam, to Bhamo in Myanmar through Lashio. The road thus passes through three countries  India, Myanmar and China. The international link was disrupted when India converted its portion of the road into National Highway 153, Myanmar made the section upto Myitkyina into a two-lane highway, and China converted its share into a six-lane expressway. Although there have been intermittent talks in all three countries regarding the restoration of the roadlink, they have failed to yield any result.         
	Most people in the Northeast believe that it is India which is mainly responsible for the deadlock on Stilwell Road, depriving the Northeast of several advantages that its re-opening would ensure. If opened, Stilwell Road would be a direct link to Thailand and as such, it is of immense promise so far as tourism is concerned. And if the stretch from Pangsau Pass to Myitkyina can be made motorable, the Northeast will get a direct access to the economic zones of southwest China. This will also bring India physically closer to the Asean countries, boosting trade ties between them. Above all, a Stilwell Road in use will help the Northeastern people to get over their sense of isolation by offering employment opportunities.        
	On the flip side, India thinks that with the volatile Myanmar and the unpredictable China on either side, an open Stilwell Road will add to its security concerns. It may, in fact, lead to increased insurgency in the area as the smuggling of arms becomes easier.         
	The choice is between keeping the Northeast bound by land and gagged by the army with a restive population inside, or exposing it to threats from the neighbours. Instead of remaining struck on the horns of the dilemma, India should decide, and decide fast, keeping in mind the rising discontent in the mind of the north-eastern people.       PHALGUNI MATILAL

	Making an unpalatable point about performance while heading a coalition government requires confidence. The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, seems to have quite a lot of it. The one message that he wants to send out is that Bihar is changing. In the much-awaited reshuffle in his council of ministers, Mr Kumar dropped 10 ministers, of whom three from the Janata Dal (United) and two from the Bharatiya Janata Party were of cabinet rank. The BJP ministers held the portfolios of health and sports, art and culture respectively. He also inducted 19 new ministers and altered the portfolios of a few who were not dropped. Without their say-so, of course. Whatever local reasons are being shown for each case of dropping or changing, the general message is clearly linked to performance. Mr Kumar took over as chief minister two-and-a-half years ago on the basis of a popular vote for change, and he obviously wants his government to deliver. The BJP high command cannot be happy, but it has had to swallow Mr Kumars decision. The BJP state unit is furious, and the butt of their anger is the deputy chief minister, Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP.         
	Mr Kumar would not have underestimated the strength of the reaction to his decision. For his decision, based on the primacy given to performance, is not only extraordinary in the context of Bihar but also strikingly unusual in the whole of India. Bihar seemed to have become hopelessly dysfunctional, a forest of lawlessness, caste conflict, and exploitation, sliding down to the bottom of the countrys development ratings. Perhaps Mr Kumars confidence stems from the fact that in the months that he has been in power he has managed to make a difference. There is some truth in his claims that the law and order situation has improved, infrastructure is improving with roads being built, and politics, instead of being purely caste and community centred, is now becoming centred on development. It may be that the new entrants to his council obliquely reflect his motto of Development with Justice. Among them are six from the economically backward classes, two Dalits, four from the other backward classes and two from the minority community. Two ministers from the same community have been dropped. By dropping non-performing politicians and enlarging his coalition with groups that lacked a big share in the power structure, Mr Kumar may also be trying out performance with justice.

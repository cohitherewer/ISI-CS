	The Indian federal system has not done too badly. It has anchored a Centre strong enough to ensure uniformity in basic public services. It has also given states leeway and provided room for experimentation. The balance between the Centre and the states has, however, been upset by the disappearance of parliamentary majorities and the consequent subjugation of the Centre by regional parties. Although it is now 30 years since majorities declined, the current combination is the worst the country has to bear.         
	Boilers hold hot steam under pressure; if they leak or burst, they can cause deaths and terrible injuries. The steam they generate may be carried in pipes, which can be equally deadly. In the early days, mishaps related to boilers were frequent enough for the government to concern itself with. So in 1923, the government of British India passed an act that required all boilers to be examined periodically by government inspectors. To this day, every boiler with a capacity of 5 gallons or more, and steam pipe with a diameter of 10 inches or more or bearing pressure exceeding 1.2 pounds per square inch over atmospheric pressure must have a certificate from a government inspector before it can be used. Although an amendment converted these imperial measures into republican ones in 1951, the spirit of the act has changed little. And like many administrative measures of the British age, the working of the Boilers Act has changed for the worse. Boiler inspectors expect factory-owners to come and fetch them in luxury cars, wine them and dine them, and reach them back with a handsome baksheesh. The inspection is now just a formality. It is routinely dispensed with if the owner of the boiler is a public enterprise and is unlikely to pay a bribe. Like most controllers jobs, that of a boiler inspector is now an enviable sinecure.         
	Meanwhile, both boilers and their owners have changed. There is keen competition amongst boiler-makers, and one of the parameters they compete on is the safety of their boilers. So boilers are much less likely to burst or steam pipes to bleed today. There are also firms that provide the service of inspecting boilers and pipes and keeping them in good condition. For most purposes, the job of a government boiler inspector has become redundant. That suits them even better, for now they can receive handsome illegal rewards for doing nothing. So the Central government piloted an amendment last November which would delegate the inspection of boilers to private-sector specialists. It has not, however, been able to bring it into force because of the opposition of some state governments, led by West Bengal. Its boiler inspectors belong to the ruling party, which is uniformly protective of its wards. This is how useless party members are kept in their jobs and enabled to bask in luxury.

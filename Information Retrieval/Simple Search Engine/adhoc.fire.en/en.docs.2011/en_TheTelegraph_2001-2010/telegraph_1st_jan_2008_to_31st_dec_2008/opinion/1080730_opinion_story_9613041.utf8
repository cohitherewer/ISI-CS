The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | India under attack
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       INDIA UNDER ATTACK                          - The Kabul blast signals dangers ahead on Indian soil					 					      Kanwal Sibal                        In front of the Indian embassy in Kabul, July 7, 2008				                                             
	The blasting of the Indian embassy in Kabul shows the depth of animosity in Taliban-ISI circles towards our diplomacy in Afghanistan. For Pakistan, Afghanistan is the strategic backyard and any Indian presence there is an intrusion and a threat. Afghanistan gives to Pakistans military planners strategic depth, a concept that assumes both Pakistans political control over Afghanistan and the elimination of Indian influence from this vital space. General Musharraf had strongly opposed the opening of Indian consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad as potential platforms for intelligence operations inside Pakistani territory from the west. Pakistan still believes that India is interfering in Baluchistan. Pakistans vulnerabilities in the west makes it paranoid about Indias intentions in enlarging its footprint in Afghanistan.        
	Any Indian success in winning the goodwill of the Afghan population through well-targeted development projects that meet grass-root needs of education, health, transportation, roads, power and so on, will require added effort by the ISI-Taliban tandem to turn local sentiment against India. Therefore, to hobble Indias activities as much as possible would be logical. Understanding between Hamid Karzai and India has grown, whereas misunderstandings between Karzai and Pakistan have deepened. This makes the situation even more unpalatable for Pakistan.              
	Karzais public accusations against Pakistani involvement in terrorist activity in Afghanistan have persisted, the acrimony sharpening with Pakistans charge that he was transferring the responsibility of his own failures on to Pakistans shoulders. The United States of Americas efforts to resolve differences by convoking General Musharraf and President Karzai for talks under its auspices did not bear fruit. Pakistan cannot abandon its ambitions in Afghanistan, and pursuing them will bring about a clash with any Afghan leadership not under its control. The US cannot resolve the inherent tensions rooted in the Pashtun population straddling the Durand Line (whose legal life has ended), the traditional autonomy of the tribal areas where the writ of the Pakistani state runs weakly, and the extremely backward social and economic conditions of the region that allow extremist, unenlightened religious thinking to flourish, of the kind that al Qaida and the Taliban represent.        
	A civilian government in Pakistan does not solve the intrinsic problems of the triangular India-Afghanistan-Pakistan relationship. A non-military government cannot abandon Pakistans strategic compulsions so long as the India-Pakistan relationship is not transformed from that of confrontation to cooperation. The Pakistan military will not be ready to alter its strategy of obstructing an Indian role in Afghanistan and in Central Asia in order to prevent India hedging in Pakistan from both east and west. Pakistans ambitions to play a pivotal role in this region, taking advantage of its geo-political location and its Islamic linkages remain, as projects to link Central Asia to the Karakoram highway and to Gwadar show. The Pakistan-China nexus behind this strategy cannot be overlooked.        
	The restoration of democratic rule in Pakistan complicates matters in some ways. The civilian government would prefer to use political means to deal with the problematic tribal areas, both to demarcate itself from General Musharrafs policies and to show greater sensitivity to the accusation that Pakistan was fighting its own population at the USs behest. The risk of the talibanization of Pakistans mainstream society cannot be diminished by appeasement. But the use of force to combat this ideology in a declaredly Islamic State presents a problem, even under the cover of fighting terrorism, especially for a representative government. The political softness of the civilian government towards the religious extremists increases the threat to India, Afghanistan and the US forces.         
	The Pakistani military has for long used extremist religious forces as political instruments to further its strategy in Jammu and Kashmir and in Afghanistan. With the civilian set-up fractured by internal rivalries and unable to adopt a common position on some constitutional issues that impinge on the role of the president, elements in the Pakistani armed forces have room to pursue their disruptive agenda of extending clandestine support to the Taliban, of interference in Jammu and Kashmir (as the recent upsurge in terrorist acts there shows), not to mention incidents on the Line of Control that threaten to erode the ceasefire. This is a way for these elements to assert their independence within the system and make the government aware of the limits of its policy on India. Beyond countering the good understanding between Karzai and India, to balance any fall-out in Afghanistan of improved India-US ties, elements in Pakistan cannot but feel the need to develop counter-leverage there, best provided by the Taliban.        
	But Pakistan cannot too openly attempt to destabilize Karzai without antagonizing the US and others involved in costly and arduous efforts to pacify Afghanistan. But it can try to manipulate the situation in its favour. It has vast experience in running with the hare and hunting with the hound. It can, in some measure, cooperate in preventing the organization of support to Afghan militancy from Pakistans tribal areas by using force, though this has proved to be politically and militarily expensive, compelling the government to seek a way out through negotiated agreements with religious extremists, which have not worked and have, in turn, provoked criticism that Pakistan was going soft on the terrorists who were taking American lives. Pakistan has to guard against mounting American clamour for strikes by its forces against terrorist bases in Pakistani tribal areas in view of ineffectual Pakistani action.              
	Pakistan tries to distinguish between al Qaida groups operating in Afghanistan from Pakistani territory and the Taliban. It is willing to act against the former as foreigners, but has hesitation about the Taliban who have cross-border ethnic links. More important, the Taliban are the instrument for preserving Pakistans influence in Afghanistan, a barrier against the non-Pashtun ethnic groups there, as well as a roadblock to Indias ambitions. Pakistan therefore can keep Karzai under pressure by giving clandestine support to the Taliban, while ostensibly acting against the militant cadre under American pressure, balancing two contradictory interests and practising the art of denial that it is so adept at.        
	An embassy is the most important symbol of the sovereignty and dignity of a state abroad. Blowing up an embassy is akin to a declaration of war. The objective is to increase the costs of our existing presence in Afghanistan and hamper its extension. India cannot be frightened into reducing its presence in Afghanistan, yet it has to take cognizance of the new scale of threat and heightened security needs. Karzai has publicly accused the ISI of complicity, and our side has endorsed this and even spoken of retaliation. Yet we have proceeded with the fifth round of the composite dialogue and talks on confidence-building measures.         
	There is a mismatch between provocation and response. If India continues to stoically absorb the wounds, more will be inflicted. Already the basis of our engagement with Pakistan is changing, requiring introspection about why the earlier assumptions were going wrong. If Pakistan is accused of terrorism against us, then it cannot be a co-victim of terrorism along with us. The dividends from the civilian takeover in Pakistan for us are not apparent. In search of friendship with Pakistan, no doubt desirable, we must not allow our mental defences against it to be lowered. That makes us more vulnerable. The blast in Kabul should warn us of the dangers ahead on our own soil.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sleeping giant braves the mice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SLEEPING GIANT BRAVES THE MICE                                  No stone has been left unturned for the Bayern Munich match today. After all, the Germans must know that Indian football is in safe hands, writes Uddalak Mukherjee                                        
	Days before Bayern Munich were to play Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake stadium, personnel from the company in charge of supplying electricity to the grounds went hunting for mice. A few years ago, during a World Cup qualifier between Japan and India, a rodent had caused a short circuit in a sub-station, plunging the stadium into darkness and the country into shame. This time around, the company is taking no chances. It has asked a pest-control unit to rid the feeder stations of not only mice but also lizards, cockroaches and other such nuisances so that the match, scheduled for this evening, can take place without any interruptions.        
	The stadium has also been given a quick scrubbing. Earlier, the state sports minister met officials from Bengal Peerless (which has been instrumental in bringing Bayern to town) and the Indian Football Association to pore over the details. Leaking toilets had to be fixed, transport organized, a soil test of the ground done, and so on. After all, the Germans had to leave with the knowledge that football is in safe hands in India. Even if it was only for a night.         
	The Calcutta Police have been kept busy too. The cops have wracked their brains to design a dazzling invitation card for the para football tournament, which Oliver Kahn inaugurated on Sunday afternoon. The card had Michael Ballacks face on its cover. Ballack quit Bayern years ago and plays for Chelsea now. Everyone knows this, save our cops.        
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan were locked in a battle with the All India Football Federation. The AIFF had earlier decided that the Indian club would not be able to field their new recruits  eight from the Tata Football Academy, one from Viva Kerala and another from Salgaocar  for the Bayern match. The inter-state transfers, the AIFF argued, are scheduled to start from June 3, before which Mohun Bagan cannot register its outstation players. Hence, the federations initial stubbornness in letting Mohun Bagan field these footballers in the Bayern game.               
	To make matters worse for Mohun Bagan, the club had already released its national players for the preparatory SAFF Cup camp. For a while, it looked as if Anjan Mitra, the club secretary, would have to put his spikes on. But then, the AIFF relented. It informed, as late as last Friday, that Mohun Bagan could field its new players. The countrys controlling body for soccer, however, refused to release the national players from the camp. It also made sure that the national team takes on the visiting Chinese Taipei side on the very day that Mohun Bagan plays the German champions. The uncertainty over the availability of players must have affected Mohun Bagans preparations. Two games on the same day also makes unfair demands on the time and energies of Indian football lovers. But then, for the bungling federation, these are minor lapses.        
	The dismal state of football in India is evident not just from the countrys Fifa ranking. A lot can be deduced from how football events, such as the match between Bayern Munich and Mohun Bagan, are managed in this country. Football in India has always been about deteriorating rankings, dangerous unprofessionalism, shoddy infrastructure and institutional indifference. Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, during his maiden visit to India last year, had described India as a sleeping soccer giant. The prelude to the game between Bayern Munich and Mohun Bagan shows that the slumber remains unbroken, and very little has changed.         
	So what has drawn a top European club like Bayern Munich to the quagmire that is Indian football? It is quite simple really. Bayern Munich is playing Mohun Bagan in Calcutta because it makes perfect business sense. In a globalized world, the development of new ties between cities or nation states are premised, as a rule, on the potential to do business with one another. There is always the need to explore and establish newer trading avenues. And agencies, be they sporting or cultural, act as critical facilitators to this end.         
	Nirupam Sen, the Bengal industries minister, knows this well. He toured Germany last month, selling Bengal as a lucrative business destination for German industry. Sens Great German Project, one hears, is likely to bear fruit. There is now talk about a German firm investing in a proposed biotechnology park in Kharagpur. The automobile giant, BMW, has been sounded out for a car spare-parts project, also in Kharagpur. The prospects of a German beer factory in Bengal seem bright too. If all this comes true, the credit must go to Bengals improved business climate, and to Sen for using football as a contrivance to forge a crucial business link between Munich and Calcutta. Unfortunately, in this great project to attract German industry towards Bengal, it is football, and not commerce, that has been given the bit role.        
	The schedule points to this fact too. Social and business engagements invariably outweigh footballing matters on occasions like this. The Germans, who had been busy holidaying in Bali, have got the drift too. Bayern, understandably, has arrived in India not only without some of its key players, but also with a shoestring group of just 11 professionals. To top it all, there is not a minutes practice scheduled at the ground before Kahn, Z Roberto and their lesser known colleagues line up for the kick-off this evening.              
	Of course, the right noises are being made to make it appear that Indian football is about to be resurrected, courtesy Kahn amp; Co. Kumar Shankar Bagchi, MD, Bengal Peerless, stated that the company is keen on improving the standards of Indian football. The companys intentions are certainly noble, but it is doubtful whether the proposed academy at Burdwan  a joint venture by the German club and Peerless  or the exposure gained by our players through fixtures such as these would be able to salvage the game in India. The TFA, incidentally, run by one of Indias most successful corporate houses, has failed to deliver in this respect, after showing some initial promise. Moreover, other reputed clubs (So Paulo FC, FC Bochum, PSV Eindhoven, among others) have played in Calcutta in the past. But the plan of making Indian football clubs play international sides has not arrested the countrys footballing slide.         
	Utpal Ganguly, the IFA secretary, favours such corporate benevolence nonetheless. Corporatization, he says, can free football in India of the problems of inadequate funding, non-transparency and amateurishness. But even he is aware of the hurdles that lie in the path of Indian football corporatizing itself. The AIFF for one  notorious for its fief-like mentality  is unlikely to allow corporate bodies a free run on its sacred turf. Corporate houses themselves are (in)famously capricious. A few discouraging results on the field would invariably see the big players place their money on safer ventures: the Indian Premier League, for instance. Quite a few clubs in the country are now owned, partially or fully, and run by corporate houses. But they have not quite managed to revolutionize football in India. One such venture, FC Kochin, met with an inglorious end.               
	Placed precariously in this tragicomedy of Indian football are two other characters. First, the Indian football fan, who, unwilling to call the entrepreneurial bluff, faithfully reports to the grounds every time a match such as this is organized. Then there are the mice. The poor creatures have been made to give up their lives for a lost cause.

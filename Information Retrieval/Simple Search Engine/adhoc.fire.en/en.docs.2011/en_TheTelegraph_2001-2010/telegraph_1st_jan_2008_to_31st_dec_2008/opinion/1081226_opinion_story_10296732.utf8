	On shaky ground                  
	Sir  The destruction of the Maidan, in violation of a high court ruling, by the Democratic Youth Federation of India deserves severe condemnation (Party ravage, Dec 23). The DYFI ruined the greens and caused great environmental damage on December 20, when it decided to hold a meeting on the Brigade Parade grounds. By addressing the rally, the chief minister has become an accomplice in the illegal activities carried out by the youth wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He also happens to be the home minister, and it is his responsibility to maintain law and order and implement court orders. He should be censored for being a mute spectator to the traffic disruption caused by the DYFI cadre making their way to the Maidan. If the organizers are found guilty of violating the high court directive, the chief minister should face contempt of court charges as well.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Bhaskar Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is a matter of concern that despite the high courts directive to safeguard Calcuttas greens, DYFI rallyists dug makeshift holes in the Maidan to cook a meal for those who attended a meeting on December 20. At the end of the day, the only extensive patch of green in the city was left littered with tonnes of refuse. In view of such a serious breach of law, the organizers, including the chief minister himself, must be called upon to explain their actions.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	New hope          
	Sir  Ashok Chavan, the recently crowned chief minister of Maharashtra, was criticized for his inability to bring the Nano small car project to the state when he was the industries minister (Quick change, Dec 8). This had created a feeling of distrust in the industrial sector about the intentions of the state government. Chavan now has the opportunity to make up for his shortcomings. He must try and bring more projects to Maharashtra. Involving the Opposition in industrialization by removing misconceptions from their minds would be a decisive step towards realizing this goal.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Abdulkarim Mohd. Shaikh, Mumbai

                
	Sir  With the exit of Narayan Rane from the Maharashtra cabinet, the Konkan region has lost a powerful representative. Due to the lack of industrialization, young people from this region have no choice but to migrate in search of employment. Rane tried his best to bring industrial projects into the Konkan. However, the vested interests of politicians like N.D. Patil from the western parts of the state foiled his efforts, creating hurdles in the path of important plans like the special economic zone in Raigad.           
	Rane has been shunted out of power for political reasons. It is unfortunate that no other minister looks capable enough to fill the void created by Ranes ouster. In the interest of development, politicians from the Konkan region should demand industrial projects unanimously. India has already shown to the world that it can stand united in its fight against terror. It is time now to unite for the sake of development as well.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilip Pandhaarkar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The economic meltdown is a major threat today for all sectors. Although the government has declared a bail-out package, it can, at best, be a temporary measure. Our economy will have to stand on its own feet. This can happen only through long-term efforts like developing more industrial units. Maharashtra has been a hot destination for SEZ projects. Taking advantage of the situation, the state government should go all out to encourage them. Expectedly, certain reactionary forces will oppose industry. However, they must be dealt with ruthlessly, keeping in mind the interest of the state and its youth.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiba Walia, Mumbai 

      
	Sir  The people of Maharashtra feel frustrated by the various adversities that have befallen the state. Without unified efforts, the decline is not going to be arrested. Initiatives must be taken to revive industrialization. Such concerted efforts can inculcate a forward-looking attitude in the people. Petty politics and ideological differences should be forgotten and people must rise as one in the interest of future generations. They should pressurize the rulers for increasing employment generation. It is deplorable that SEZ projects, like the one in Raigad, have been allowed to become heavily politicized.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyotsna Sarkar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The rulers of Maharashtra are trying to save their skin by trotting the bogey of global economic slowdown. However, measures need to be taken in this regard without wasting any more time or by indulging in petty political games. It is still possible to overcome the recession by completing the delayed development projects forthwith, and getting started with the ones that have been approved already. The production from such projects and the employment opportunities they would generate would be a great help in the present circumstances. Be it the SEZs in Raigad or the power projects in Vidarbha, their completion on time is vital to quell the public dissatisfaction over the depressing functioning of the government.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ajay Khanna, Mumbai

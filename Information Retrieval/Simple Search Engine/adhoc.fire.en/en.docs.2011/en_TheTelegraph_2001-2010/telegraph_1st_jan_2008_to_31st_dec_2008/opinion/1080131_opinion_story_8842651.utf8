             - The familiar buzz is missing from Lyons Range, but maybe it has shifted elsewhere
				 
   TAKING STOCK
                        
	After the minibus disgorged me at the intimidating crossing near the Writers Buildings, I walked up to the traffic constable and asked him what the shortest walk to the Calcutta Stock Exchange would be. I was meeting someone whose office was next door to the CSE. But even at his polite best, the policeman did look as if I had asked to be led to Xanadu. Could I give him the street name, he asked. Surely the stock exchange isnt so pass as to have become invisible? 
    
	Thankfully, the building  on Lyons Range  didnt take much finding. It made its presence felt even in a locality known for its architectural grandeur. Going inside was ruled out, by an armed security guard with a frisking device. But peeping seemed okay. As the door parted to let people in and out, it revealed a huge hall, with green sofas scattered all around. Not quite the familiar picture of a busy trading hub, with TV screens spewing numbers, and people running helter-skelter, phones to their ears. But a peek is only a peek, and I had visions of frenzied buying and selling going on in some part of the building where my eyes could not wander.
    
	But the muriwallah said that his sales have halved from seven years ago. And no, it is not because office-goers have taken to eating momos. Lyons Range simply does not attract as many people as it did in the Nineties.
    
	Ajit Day, managing director of the broking firm, Dayco Securities  thats the office I was trying to find  maintains that regional stock exchanges, like Calcuttas, had to fold up once the National Stock Exchange came into being. Perhaps the Ketan Parekh scam of 2001 hastened the inevitable. Brokers at the CSE alone defaulted to the tune of Rs 92 crore. The exchanges Settlement Guarantee Fund was all but wiped out to make good the losses. But, as Day claims, Calcutta may have been the worst hit, but it was certainly not the only one. The exchanges 2002 balance sheet shows a 20-80 per cent drop in income from trading and enlistment fees, subscriptions and fixed deposits.
    
	One of the most familiar sights around Lyons Range used to be of vendors selling share forms and other papers. There are still a few of these men around, guarding sheaves of paper under crude paperweights. As one of them describes how, on a good day, the noise from inside the CSE could be heard from the arcade of the Great Eastern Hotel, two blind men come to buy forms to transfer shares held by them. The seller is visibly pleased about the sale worth Rs 4. But with the entire trading business taken over by computers, this is hardly unusual, says Day.
    
	Day was president of the CSE in the early Nineties. He was on familiar territory  his father and grandfather had been on its board before him. It pains him to find today that he is the only Bengali member of the NSE. But his daughter is following in his footsteps, he says, with a hint of relief. This may well have something to do with why Day refuses to be disheartened at the state of affairs in Calcutta. Tell him that many of the old Calcutta broking firms have gone out of operation, and he says that it is only because they failed to keep pace with the times, and indulged in over-speculation. At the other end of the spectrum are the large numbers of housewives and students who are entering the market. Yes, Calcutta would still figure quite low down if the percentage of household savings diverted to the capital market were a criterion. But its early days yet, and theres not much room for despair. 
    
	If the sun has gone down on Lyons Range, it must have come up somewhere else.

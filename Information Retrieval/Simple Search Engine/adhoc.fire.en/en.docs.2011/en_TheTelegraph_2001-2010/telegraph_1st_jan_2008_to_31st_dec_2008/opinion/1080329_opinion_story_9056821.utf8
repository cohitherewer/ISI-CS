	I had a small windfall. Last month, my son living in Mumbai re-directed a bound manuscript of articles I had commissioned for the now defunct Illustrated Weekly of India over 30 years ago. The man who had sent it was Philip Knightly, once editor of The Sunday Times of London. He was not sure whether or not I was still around, so he sent it to my son for disposal. I had invited English men and women who had lived in India after independence to write on What India meant to me. Amongst those who had responded were Lord Mountbatten, members of the Indian civil service, journalists, boxwallahs, housewives and others. I went over them and found them fascinating as well as relevant to our times.         
	For far too long, we have looked upon the English as unwanted rulers who exploited India, kept their distance from Indians, and as soon as their tenures were over, went back to their homes in England. This lopsided image of the English in India persists in the minds of most Indians. It is true that the majority of those who came here, came because they could not get good jobs in their own country. They hated everything about India: its climate, mosquitoes, flies and so on. Above all, they hated Indians. There were others who enjoyed the luxury of living in spacious bungalows with servants, and of shikar, riding, pig-sticking, drinking, dancing.... But they kept themselves aloof from Indians with their Whites Only clubs.         
	However, there was a third variety which liked everything about India, kept out of the racist clubs, went out of the way to befriend Indians and maintained contacts with their Indian friends after returning to England. I was fortunate in knowing quite a few of this breed  both those I befriended during my long years in England and those I got to know in India. Amongst the closest to me were the Sinclairs. Sinbad was head of Burmah Shell. When in Bombay, I did not stay in a hotel or with an Indian friend, but with Elinor Sinclair and her family. Later, whenever I was in England, the Sinclairs home in London was my home. After Sinbad and Elinor died, it was the Croom-Johnsons. Henry was the head of the British Council. His wife, Jane, a tall, handsome, grey-eyed blonde made it a point to reach out to Indians. She stayed with me in Kasauli. I and my daughter stayed with her in London. Now both Henry and Jane are gone, only their memories linger. I felt I owed it to my close English friends to record not only what India but also Indians meant to them. I handed the manuscript to Ravi Singh and Diya Hazra of Penguin-Viking. It was promptly accepted. Hopefully, it will appear in book form by the coming autumn under the title, Sahibs who loved India.                
	Givers and takers                
	The human species can be divided into two equals  givers and takers, suckers and spongers. Their relationship is symbiotic: one are compulsive givers, the others thrive on them. I have always been a sucker and resented being taken for granted. But I cant help my nature. If any friend dropped in at meal time and drink time, something compelled me to ask him or her to join me. He or she did so as if doing me a favour: I no longer do so. I bluntly tell them to buzz off as it is time for my lunch or dinner. I do the same at my sun-downer. I tell him, I enjoy my drink alone. Behind my back they say that with age I have become stingy: He thinks he can take his booze with him to the next world. I dont care; perhaps I will be allowed to take a crate or two.        
	You may have noticed that the habit of taking runs in some families from the father to sons, daughters and grand-children. I know of a few families of which every member is a born sponger; its in their blood. Most of them also pretend to be do-gooders or left wingers. They make you feel guilty if you dont offer them hospitality and open up your purses so that they could pursue their good deeds. If you shut your doors to them, they think you are mean and petty. They live in style, never return hospitality but are over-eager to accept yours.        
	There is another class of spongers who get so habituated to being entertained that they get convinced that it is their birthright. Such are members of the now defunct princely order and retired senior civil servants, who were once in positions to grant favours to lesser people. They accepted hospitality without anyone expecting them to return it. You can see them by the score at embassy parties, book launches and large receptions. They will be guzzling Scotch and swallowing canaps with an air that they are honouring their hosts.        
	Givers remain the exploited lot. They grumble, complain to their friends but can do nothing about it. It is in the order of nature not limited to human beings. Similar divisions exist amongst animals, birds and insects. There are drones and there are workers  one takes, the other gives.                
	A lot of drive                
	A newly elected member of legislature was included in the cabinet. He decided to celebrate the occasion by buying a new car in keeping with his elevated status. So he bought the latest model of Mercedes Benz. He was mighty pleased with himself and said to his driver: I will drive this car myself  main khud chalaonga. The driver reacted scornfully: Sahib aap sarkar chalaiye (Sir, you run the government). Car chalaana aap ke bus ka nahin (You are not fit to drive a car).

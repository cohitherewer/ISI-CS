	Festive concern                  
	Sir  Synthetic khoya, containing harmful chemical ingredients, is sold everywhere. The government had proactively banned unhygienic private dairies; it should also ensure the availability of dairy products at authorized outlets to check the sale of synthetic dairy items by retailers. Many stores of Mother Dairy and Amul sell packaged cottage-cheese. Now that the festive season is round the corner, they should also consider selling authentic packaged khoya for us to prepare our favourite sweets without fearing for our health.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Minority matters          
	Sir  Kanwal Sibals argument for promoting the infiltration of Hindus in Kashmir to combat secessionism is nothing less than absurd (The divide in Kashmir, Sept 2). The communal reaction in the valley has indeed been irrational, but that has more to do with the exclusion of Kashmiris from Central policies than with their religion. For years, Kashmiris have been isolated for belonging to a politically sensitive region. This, however, has nothing to do with the fact that the majority of Kashmiris are Muslims. Rather, the Hindus in the state have been victimized because they have been the minority there, in the same way as Christians have been attacked in Orissa, and the Muslims in Gujarat. In Orissa and Gujarat, the presence of a considerable section of other religions could not stop the violence of the Hindu majority. A multi-religious population, therefore, is not a solution to bigotry and religious fanaticism. Opportunistic politicians, who always go for the easy option of exploiting religious sentiments to hold high offices, are to be blamed. Unfortunately, the domineering instinct of the majority community is too natural to alter by encouraging a cosmetic fusion of communities. Sibal should have suggested ways to empower the minorities instead.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The word, secularism, seems to have had a shift in its meaning in Indian politics. In the name of secularism, vote-seeking ministers don minority attires for prayer and hold iftaar parties. Such secular acts are, however, not considered necessary if the politicians belong to minority communities. Kanwal Sibal has rightly hinted that the Muslims in Kashmir should have been more stringently dealt with. The Muslims are the majority there and have been accused of driving out the Pandits in the past. But they are exploiting the minority label of Indian Muslims to exact more benefits for themselves. And this becomes too easy for them as our politicians, to whom electoral gains matter more than preserving communal harmony in the country, are too busy playing to the minority gallery. The government must instruct its ministers to follow the true path of secularism by allowing the free practice of all religions.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  As an employee of Reuters, Bangalore, I have to travel across the country and have encountered odd incidents in every city. But my recent experience of deceitful taxi-drivers in Calcutta beats them all. I took a taxi (WMT 736) from Howrah to Dum Dum and the cabbie charged me an exorbitant fare of Rs 1,240. I was suspicious, but since that is what his fare chart showed against the meter reading, I paid him the amount. My suspicion, however, was confirmed soon when I narrated the incident to friends in Calcutta. At their insistence I also tried to lodge a complaint with the traffic police at Dum Dum airport, but they refused to help. If the authorities are so reluctant to help, the image of Calcutta will get more and more tarnished in the eyes of outsiders.          
	Yours faithfully,

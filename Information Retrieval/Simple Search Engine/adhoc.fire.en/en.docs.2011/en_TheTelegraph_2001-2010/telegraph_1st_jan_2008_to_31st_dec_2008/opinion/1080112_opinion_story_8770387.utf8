	At a gathering to celebrate Paritosh Sens 88th birthday, the artist recounted his first encounter with Abanindranath Tagore. In the course of the conversation, Abanindranath pretended that a mouse he had created with twigs had come to life, and was trying to escape from captivity. A battery of servants played along with the master and pounced on the critter, finally capturing it. 
    
	K.G. Subramanyans exhibition organized by Seagull (till January 12) gives the same impression of an outburst of creative energy and spontaneity in an artist who is well over 80. Subramanyan has drawn on the vast pool of images he has created by appropriating ideas and forms from every civilization and art movement known to us. He juxtaposes these images, in some cases fusing them, with his own observations of life around his house at Purvapalli, Santiniketan, from where he moved to Baroda a few years ago. 
    
	Even a casual glance at the vast exhibition  for which an entire building has been transformed into a work of art, its white walls and facade covered with murals in black created by Subramanyan himself  reveals some familiar images. Indian folk goddesses, bull demons, African masks, Cretan deities, dancing women from Mohenjodaro, snarling cats, loads of fresh fish, lush green flora, ladies in dshabill invade stylish drawing rooms and boudoirs on his large canvases and in the bigger paper works. Subramanyan has used a palette in this body of work that would be the envy of any cosmetic company. Gone are the muddy browns, dark greens and blues. He seems to steal his blushing pinks, warm peaches, cobalt blues, sea greens, russets and high-voltage yellows from the make-up kits of one of the fashionable women he depicts. These are the colours of noctilucent eyeshadows and blushers used in combinations beyond the wildest imagination of any cosmetologist.
    
	Even more fascinating are his smaller drawings and sketch pads, which throw some light on the mysterious creative process. First, he would draw a nude in a style that is fairly realistic. He uses this as a launching pad to create fractured forms with a flurry of strokes that seem to have a life of their own. His observations of nature remind us that Subramanyan belongs to the long line of artists of Santiniketan with his mentor, Benode Behari Mukherjee, preceding him. 
    
	The solemn rows of date palms, the riot of flowers and vegetation, randy goats, the hissing grimalkin, cocky roosters and the toad about to swallow an insect are part of the Great Tradition that Subramanyan energizes with his dynamic vision of life. Subramanyan has not avoided opposites and accepts change as part of life. Which is why he still fascinates.

	The faithful dead                  
	Sir  The death of more than a hundred devotees in the Naina Devi temple stampede reveals the utter callousness with which holy shrines are maintained in India (Rumour mows devotees, Aug 4). One of the main responsibilities of temple authorities is to put barricades and regulate traffic to facilitate the safe movement of pilgrims. Such efficient systems are already in place at the Venkateswara temple in Tirupati and the Manjunatheshwara temple in Dharmasthala. The state administration should have taken stock of the rise in the number of devotees at different times of the year and taken adequate precautions to minimize the risk of mishap. It is unfortunate that the Naina Devi tragedy was brought about by rumours. The temple authorities should be blamed for not trying to quell the panicky mob by giving assurances over loudspeakers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  First, the Panchmahal stampede in Gujarat, then at the Mata Karauli Temple in Madhya Pradesh, and now the Naina Devi mishap in Himachal Pradesh: since last year, Indian pilgrims seemed to have been plagued by a blighted trail. While the population in India has grown in leaps and bounds, public-safety facilities and infrastructure have not increased proportionally. The Centre should allocate funds to state governments to help them widen the narrow paths leading up to popular shrines. States should also be asked to submit details of such places, with an estimated footfall at various times of the year. Only with such vigilance can untoward incidents be avoided at over-crowded temples.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The redeeming moment of an event otherwise marked by tragedy was when little Neha, lost in the Naina Devi stampede, was reunited with her mother (Stampede girl finds her mum, Aug 6). One could breath a sigh of relief when the uncertainty lurking on the baby at the dawn of her life was resolved thanks to the excellent reporting by The Telegraph.           
	Yours faithfully,         Ashok Modi,Nagaon, Assam              
	Sir  In a country with few resources and too many people fighting for them, stampede deaths occur not just at shrines. The media seem to have forgotten the mad rush that killed 22 women in Lucknow in 2004, when the Bharatiya Janata Partys Lalji Tandon decided to distribute free saris on his birthday.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Strike no deal          
	Sir  The strike called by junior doctors of government hospitals demanding higher pay deserves to be condemned severely (Docs strike, govt studies, Aug 5). It was disturbing to read about patients, in urgent need of care, left lying unattended. Admittedly, it does not require an agitation to reveal the dismal state of government hospitals in West Bengal. Despite frequent claims by the health minister and the chief minister, little has been done to improve the conditions of these places, leaving middle- and upper-middle-class families with no choice but to resort to the more expensive private clinics. The victims of a doctors strike are the vulnerable patients from the lower strata of society.           
	A peaceful strike by any group of workers is an important means to fight injustice in a democratic system. But can workers responsible for providing essential public services go on a strike to settle scores, undermining the needs of those they are entrusted to cater to? Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees protection of right to life and personal liberty to all citizens. The right of a few people to go on strike can never supersede the rights of thousands. In a historic judgment, in 2003, involving striking government employees in Tamil Nadu (T.K. Rangarajan versus State of Tamil Nadu), the Supreme Court ruled against the right to strike and observed that government employees cannot take society at ransom by going on doing so. In 2006, when doctors in government hospitals in Delhi went on strike to protest against reservations, several patients died without treatment. The People for Better Treatment, an organization dedicated to fight medical negligence, filed a public interest litigation against the Medical Council of India and the striking Delhi doctors. The apex court has already issued notices to the respondents in this case, which may have significant implications on such strikes in India. The rules framed by the MCI, the central regulatory body for practice of medicine in India, also prohibit doctors from going on a strike. Section 2.1.1 of the MCI Code of Ethics and Regulations unequivocally states that in case of emergency, a physician must treat a patient. A doctor would be held guilty for professional misconduct and may lose his license if he does not provide treatment for any reason. The allegation of Bengals junior doctors in government hospitals that they are paid half or even less than their colleagues in other states needs to be addressed. It is a pity that over three decades of inept Left rule has resulted in the deterioration of Bengals healthcare sector.           
	Yours faithfully,																															 Kunal Saha,Ohio, US              
	False promises          
	Sir  We bought a water purifier called Pureit manufactured by Hindustan Unilever. This filter is equipped with a replaceable part  the battery  responsible for filtering the water electronically. Unfortunately, the company is unable to supply this battery as it is facing a shortage. Its call centre keeps on booking our complaint and informing us that we will have to wait for an indefinite period for the battery to be replaced. This situation has forced us to drink impure water, leading to health hazards. The government should ensure that products, which do not have any after-sales support do not reach the consumers.           
	Yours faithfully,

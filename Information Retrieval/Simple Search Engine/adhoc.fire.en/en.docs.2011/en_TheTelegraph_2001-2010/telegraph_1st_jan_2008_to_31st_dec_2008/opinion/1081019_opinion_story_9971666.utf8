	Principles please, not films                  
	Sir  Mahatma Gandhis greatness lies in the fact that his ideals still hold relevance in a developing India. Gandhis fight to empower the poor and the down-trodden is equally inspiring. Even as it aspires to a seat at the international high table, India today is still plagued by the problems of hunger (Rich and poor, Oct 17), unemployment, and violence, among other things. Instead of remembering the Mahatma through films, our policy-makers should follow his principles to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.           
	Yours faithfully,         Ashwani Sharma, Ghaziabad, UP
        
	The M factor          
	Sir  The whole of India should applaud the dynamic Narendra Modi for taking the Nano project to Gujarat (Tatas opt for good M, Oct 8). In a democracy, political leaders must be able to communicate effectively to win the peoples approval for business projects. The ease with which Modi won the bid for Nano shows that the people of Gujarat support him in this venture. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, despite his lofty intentions, can never be considered as good a communicator as his Gujarati counterpart. That is why only a handful of opponents managed to stall the Nano project in Singur. India needs more popular leaders like Modi who are capable of carrying the masses with them.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	Sir  After the riots in Gujarat, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had given shelter to Qutubuddin Ansari in Calcutta in a bid to flaunt its secular credentials. Now, the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, has paid back Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his comrades handsomely by snatching the Nano away from Bengal to Gujarat. Modis masterstroke will undoubtedly dent Bhattacharjees image and jeopardize Bengals industrial resurgence. Ratan Tata may have indirectly blamed Mamata Banerjee for the loss by dubbing her as the bad M. But the truth is that the arrogant, inexperienced and inefficient government of Bengal is to blame for the debacle that has taken place.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Tatas decision to shift their small-car factory from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat is a wise one. Hopefully, this will be a lesson for Bengals politicians who seem to believe in destructive politics only. In the future, they will do well to learn from the mistakes that were committed during the Singur episode. Narendra Modi succeeded in hijacking Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees prized small-car project on account of his professionalism and thorough preparedness.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  In the press conference announcing the Nanos departure, Ratan Tata alluded to a bad M and a good M. Although he did not say more, people surmised that the bad M stood for Mamata Banerjee while the good M signified Narendra Modi. There is no doubt about who the good M is. But the bad M, I think, stands for both Mamata and the Marxists.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sharma, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Something to break
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SOMETHING TO BREAK                                  Indians are known for their dislike of rules. But to become modern, every society needs to cultivate orderly practices, writes Surendra Munshi                          Whos afraid of queueing?                                  
	Indians as a rule hate rules. We are comfortable when no rules exist, or, when they do exist, in pretending that they do not exist. Perhaps nowhere else is such ingenuity shown in breaking rules than here in India . No sooner is a rule made, than ways of breaking it are devised. A common strategy is to show disdain for rules by breaking them while affirming the need for observing them. I admire in this respect the minibus drivers of Calcutta. Just as one struggles to recover ones composure after being nearly hit by a minibus, it is not uncommon to read the advice painted in bright colours on the back of the speeding minibus  Follow Traffic Rules.        
	For those who do not like the manner in which every possible rule is broken, a common argument advanced is that there is a singular lack of discipline in the country. Can a country call itself developed, it is often asked, if the people living in it have not even learnt to stand in a queue? Yet another argument that is given, generally by older persons, is that there is no nationalism in this country. Indians no longer feel moved by a goal higher than their narrow personal goals. In their pursuit of selfish interests, rules appear as restrictions. It is argued that what is needed is a strong leader who can impose discipline and create a sense of nationalism, combining thus the arguments of discipline and nationalism.              
	For the common man to whom bureaucracy means red tape, rules mean the worst that can be expected from an organization that is seen as apathetic and inefficient. For a businessman, rules often mean the interference of the bureaucracy in the operation of the market. For many politicians too rules are generally unwelcome. They impose restrictions on their irregular actions. The only beneficiary seems to be the bureaucracy for which rules provide the raison dtre. But even here, those bureaucrats who look upon their offices as means for acquiring benefits and dispensing favours, rules cause annoyance and call for skills of avoidance.        
	The case against rules is expressed in yet another way. Rules are seen to be against the idea of a family. Why do we need rules if we can sit and resolve problems amicably as if we belonged to one family? Why be formal and not sort out issues informally?         
	Those who do not favour the breaking of rules tend to look for a strong leader, who, like the patriarch of a family, can set things right. While leaders are needed for a positive role, history teaches us that the craving for a strong leader can also have harmful effects. In this country, even though there are still admirers of Indira Gandhi who laud her for imposing the Emergency in 1975, it is commonly recognized that this period was also one when the nascent institutions of modern democratic society were undermined. It is important to bear in mind that the emergence of an extra-constitutional centre of authority around her son, Sanjay, led to such a severe abuse of power that even acceptable goals such as family planning and planting of trees caused horror as compulsory sterilization and forced slum-clearance were carried out.        
	Modern democratic society, like any other society, must be prepared to meet the diverse needs of collective life. This gives rise to institutions. An institution does not refer to a building that houses an organization but to a relatively stable orderly practice meant to fulfil a particular social need. Thus, for meeting educational needs, schools and colleges are created that follow clearly spelt-out practices on the major aspects of education, such as admission, curriculum, pedagogy and examination. These practices taken together define what a school is in a society.         
	Different societies may create different institutions for meeting particular needs. For a tribal society still at the stage of hunting, for example, it is of utmost importance to devise ways of training hunters, a need presumably of no importance to modern society. If institutions refer to orderly practices, it stands to reason that they are governed by rules. It is with reference to these rules that an action can be considered right or wrong.         
	While a traditional society defines its rules more implicitly in the form of customs, a modern society defines them more explicitly in the form of written rules that are easily accessible. These written rules then serve to establish the principle that nobody is above them. The overall objective is to facilitate correct behaviour and to ensure that nobody can act in an arbitrary manner.         
	As a society tries to become modern, it needs to create institutions of modern society. Fortunately for India, B.R. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, and Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, were keenly aware of it. In giving the nation a long written Constitution, perhaps the longest in the world, Ambedkar was aware that the practice of democracy had to be cultivated in this country. If the practice is still subverted, questions needs to be asked about the source of the failure. Is it the Constitution or the people? Distinguished anthropologists and sociologists, such as Nirmal Kumar Bose and Andr Bteille, have pointed out the need for building modern institutions. This is a process that requires a persistent effort. This involves not only formulating rules but also ensuring that they are observed.              
	It may still be argued that what applies to the administration of the country does not apply to a school, a housing society, a voluntary organization, or any other small body. I want to point out that clear rules and conscious adherence to them are as much needed in these domains of public life, which should be differentiated from private life. It is at the grassroots level that the problem begins, and it is at this level that there is the greatest need for creating orderly practices.         
	An argument against bad rules or a wrong application of rules cannot be an argument against the need for rules. Rules are needed not for their own sake but for the sake of developing efficient practices and for checking autocratic and arbitrary actions which are found all too often in the public sphere. Such actions often breed corruption. The desire to behave as if belonging to one family may lend itself to abuse by those who have their own agenda to serve. Indeed, it is important to define practices for ensuring desired collective outcomes. Such practices and honest attempts to adhere to them can together contribute to a healthy atmosphere for all.        
	As customs prove inadequate for new forms of modern life, new ways of dealing with them need to be devised and everyone must adhere to them. Khaled Hosseini notes in his moving book, The Kite Runner, that Afghans cherish customs but abhor rules. Is it not the tragedy of that proud country that it has not been able to devise and live by rules for a new situation for which its tribal customs prove inadequate?

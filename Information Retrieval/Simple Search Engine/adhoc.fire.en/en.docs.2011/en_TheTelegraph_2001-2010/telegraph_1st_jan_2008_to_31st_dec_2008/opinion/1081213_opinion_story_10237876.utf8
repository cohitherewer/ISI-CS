The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Good cheer ahead of the festive season
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       GOOD CHEER AHEAD OF THE FESTIVE SEASON                              Jonathan Ramgopal      MUSIC                                                
	How do you usher in the festive season? With song and cheer? Both these elements were present in abundance at the opening night of the series of concerts performed by the students of Dr Grahams Homes. The Rising Stars in Concert at St Pauls Cathedral started with little Luke Alistair singing the opening verse of Once in Royal Davids City, joined by the choir which marched up the aisle, candles in hand, singing the four-part harmony. The pristine voices reverberated across the cathedral and settled on the listeners in layers of vocal beauty. They seemed to grow in confidence, tonally and emotionally. In their third song, O Come All Ye Faithful, they attained the highest purpose of a choir; with the harmony coming out in clear layers, each part distinguishable from, yet complementing the other. Then came Away in a Manger, which they sang as to a baby, with Luke singing the third verse in his angelic voice.         
	Surprisingly pleasant was ten-year-old Priyash Biswakarma on the violin, performing Spring from Vivaldis Seasons. He played with outstanding dexterity and remarkable intonation. His potential looked ready to explode as he swayed rhythmically to the movement of his well-balanced bow.         
	The second half was in a more contemporary vein. Ben Wesley and Lindsay Cantopher, two former students, sang Santa Claus is Coming to Town and The Greatest Gift of All. The concert ended with O Holy Night, in a key chosen just outside the comfort range of the soloist. Sadly, however, during the second half, the choir ceased to be a choir, and became a large group of mellifluous background voices.        
	The second concert at the Tollygunge Club was not as traditional as the first, with renderings from The Lion King to Evanescence. The choir seemed quite to have lost its purpose and direction with a line-up of songs that was more of a mixed bag than anything else. The juxtaposition of screeching rising rock stars with disciplined Vienna choir boys was too stark for comfort. A cricket bat, autographed by the Indian cricket team, was auctioned for the benefit of the children of the Homes. An emotional and burly Manfred, from Germany, won the bid at a quarter of a million rupees.        
	These concerts by the children from the hills have always been ardently looked forward to. However, a choir like this deserves better musical backing. It should at least have sounds that do justice to their voices, instead of the poorly arranged synthetic accompaniment and scratchy beats of the keyboard.

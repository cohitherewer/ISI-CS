	Sound of a new music                  
	Sir  Today, the majority of songs in Hindi films comprise words in Punjabi and English. Be it the tunes of successful commercial films such as Race or Singh is Kinng, Hindi words seem to have disappeared altogether from lyrics. It is a pity that our beautiful national language has lost its appeal among song-writers in the Bombay film industry. If this disturbing trend continues in the future, people like us will have no other option but to rummage through old cassettes and CDs to listen to a word of Hindi in popular tunes.           
	Yours faithfully,        Dipak Mantri, Kalimpong 
                  
	Olive terror          
	Sir  The alleged involvement of a serving officer in the Malegaon blast has sullied the reputation of the nations armed forces (Rattled army clams up, Nov 9). In case the charges are proved to be true, this will be the first instance of its kind in India and undoubtedly affect the morale of the nation. Things will take a turn for the worse if politicians exaggerate this isolated incident for petty gains. Lets just hope that Indian politicians will do nothing more to demoralize an institution that has been uniquely apolitical, secular and loyal for a long time. The army, they should remember, has been a shining example of Indias unity and diversity even in trying times such as these.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.C. Kapoor, Noida 

                
	Sir  The reported involvement of an armyman, lieutenant colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit, in the infamous Malegaon case will undoubtedly sensationalize the affair further. The arrest of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has already created ripples in political circles. But if the issue is politicized any further, it may jeopardize the possibility of a fair investigation that will help unearth the truth. If Purohits guilt is established, the army should take punitive action against him to deter other officers from committing similar crimes in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The Malegaon blast investigation is yielding astounding results. An army officer is among the ten who have been arrested from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The shadow of the Hindu Right seems to get longer by the day, and like Islamic militants, they only understand violence. A group called the Hindu Jan Jagruti Samiti had exploded bombs outside a Thane auditorium. Recently, at a seminar in Delhi University, an activist from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad spat on the face of S.A.R. Geelani who was an accused in the parliament attack case while at M.S. University in Baroda, Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists had assaulted an artist for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments. It is a pity that the agencies entrusted with the responsibility of stalling terror seem more interested in arresting innocents instead of punishing the guilty.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Hasan-ul-Huzaibi, Pune

                          
	Hunger for power          
	Sir  The president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, is one of the most corrupt leaders in the world today, and has no qualms in exploiting his countrymen to remain in power. Since the run-off elections of 2008, his legitimacy as president has been called into question. Given his track record, it is unlikely that the power-sharing arrangement between President Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai is likely to survive for long. After all, Mugabes men have killed several of the supporters of Tsvangirai. Mugabe must go if Tsvangirai is to secure the future of his country and its people.           
	Yours faithfully, 
  Ashwani Sharma, Ghaziabad

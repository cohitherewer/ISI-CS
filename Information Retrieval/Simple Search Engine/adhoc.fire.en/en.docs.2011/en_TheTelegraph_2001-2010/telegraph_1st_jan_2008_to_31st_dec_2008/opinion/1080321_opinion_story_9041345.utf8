	It is usually in Shakespearean comedy that vexed fathers appeal to figures of authority for intervention when their daughters get involved with dodgy young men. Think of how A Midsummer Nights Dream begins. But what does a high-court judge do when faced with a similar appeal? And this is, indeed, what happened recently in the city. Parents of a 12-year-old girl, both of them doctors, appealed to the Calcutta high court after the police allegedly failed to help them sort out their daughters friendship with a local youth. He was allegedly extorting money from the parents through the girl, who had been sent away to Bihar to wean her off this relationship. What the judge did is eminently sensible. He referred the parents to a lower court, and firmly reminded them that such matters had to be sorted out by the parents rather than by the court. The police can address the youths other misdemeanours, as they have done. But monitoring his relationship with the girl, especially how much money she was giving him, was outside the purview of their vigilance. The judge also specifically asked the father why he did not regulate more strictly the amount of money he was giving the child. This is a matter of education and discipline that clearly falls within the scope of parental responsibility.        
	It is reassuring to see the court (together with the police, at another level) distancing itself so unambiguously from what it sees as outside its jurisdiction. The recent history of parents resorting to such measures has not been a happy one in Calcutta, particularly when the relationship worrying the parents has been inflected by economic and cultural difference. It is crucial for the justice system to keep the public and the private realms separate insofar as it might be done in the sphere of everyday life. Social change, particularly upward mobility, will continue to pose major challenges to traditional parenting. But turning to the police or the courts for supplementary parenting is a sinister, and potentially dangerous, way of addressing these challenges.

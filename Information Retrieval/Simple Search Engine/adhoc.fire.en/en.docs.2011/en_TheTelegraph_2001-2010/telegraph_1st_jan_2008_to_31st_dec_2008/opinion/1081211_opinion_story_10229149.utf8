	Shame and silence                  
	Sir  It is a matter of shame that the former chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, was accompanied by his film-star son, Riteish Deshmukh, and the director, Ram Gopal Varma, while visiting the Taj Mahal hotel after the terror attacks (Terror tourism, Dec 1). Deshmukhs light-hearted comments and evasive responses in the press conferences aired on television gave ample evidence of his callous attitude to the disaster in Mumbai. It was, therefore, to be expected that his visit to the Taj would be little more than a pleasure trip. With his son working in the film industry, perhaps Deshmukh is more concerned about the wellbeing of Bollywood than about the rest of his state. He probably wanted to help Varma pick up some plots from the terror site, and his actor-son to watch the expressions of horror on the victims faces so that he could reproduce them in his films in future. Did he also let Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena run a reign of terror and violence against north Indian migrants a few months ago so that Bollywood directors could have more real plots? If anyone is missing the former chief minister of Maharashtra, it must be some of his friends in Bollywood.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
N.K. Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Reconstruction of an economy is a great challenge and only great people can face it. After World War II, Germany and Japan emerged stronger, literally out of the ashes. But an effective leadership is essential for this. The new chief minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan, will have to inspire the people of Mumbai and of Maharashtra into thinking that the financial capital of India can regain its position. In the nine years of Vilasrao Deshmukhs regime, with a brief interval under Sushil Kumar Shinde, Maharashtra kept sinking on every front. The terror attacks have definitely taken their toll on the image of Mumbai. The state government will have to initiate strong measures to create an atmosphere that would instil confidence in people from every section of society. The new chief minister should accord topmost priority to this task in order to attract investments  domestic and foreign.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amitabh Tiwari, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Mumbaikars heaved a sigh of relief as Vilasrao Deshmukh and R.R. Patil stepped down from their chairs. The administration had come to a standstill during their tenures. The two leaders had prostrated themselves in front of Raj Thackeray and his goons. The governments tacit support for the latters parochialism hindered the police of Maharashtra from taking strong action against those who were bashing up north Indian migrants all over Mumbai. A state already torn apart by internal squabbles was naturally the most vulnerable target for the terrorists. The unity among Maharashtrians had already been broken into pieces by Thackerays divisive politics. The state police, so far happy to be politicians puppets, showed a more commendable side to themselves during the initial stage of the siege of Mumbai. The new chief minister, Ashok Chavan, must try to blur the social divisions created by the regional parties as far as possible before he can hope to make the state stand united in the face of terrorist attacks.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Firoz Batliwala, Mumbai

                
	Damp flames          
	Sir  The fact that Godfrey Phillips India Limited, the famous cigarette manufacturing company, is returning to Calcutta after 15 years proves that the recent ban on smoking in public places has remained ineffective (Cigarette war in Calcutta, Dec 5). The business of cigarette manufacturers is flourishing as ever, just as that of other tobacco-related products like gutkha, tobacco-mixed mouth fresheners and beedi. If the government is really serious about curbing tobacco consumption, some additional measures are needed over and above the implementation of legal restrictions. The production of these items should be reduced, so that they are not easily available in the open market. The big companies should be made to accept more responsibility in spreading awareness about the hazards of smoking. It is not enough to print a one-line advisory on cigarette packets. The selling of tobacco-products should be banned within a few kilometres of schools and colleges. There is a risk that these restrictions may jeopardize the livelihood of thousands who depend on the tobacco industry. The government, keeping in mind the welfare principle, should also rehabilitate them in alternative professions.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Nirmal Samanta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Smokers are already badly hit by the ban on smoking in public places. The reports of the destruction of packets of Godfrey Phillips cigarettes soon after their relaunch in Calcutta are anything but music to the ears of the citys smoking fraternity. I agree with those who feel that Calcutta lags far behind the other Indian metros in terms of aristocratic and sophisticated lifestyle. Many good brands of clothes, electronic gadgets, and other luxury items do not even have exclusive outlets in the city. It is unfortunate that Godfrey Phillips, the manufacturer of some popular brands of cigarettes, had to leave Calcutta 15 years ago. The news that dishonest distributors are trying to prevent the brands comeback will do no good to Calcuttas already tainted image.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sukhomoy De, Calcutta

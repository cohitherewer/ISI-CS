	Legal legacy  
	When a man died while a case against him was pending, his sons (legal representatives) were allowed to continue the suit. The sons wanted to bring to the courts notice that their father was not the only owner of the disputed shop as they were co-owners of it. The court, however, rejected their appeal to file an additional written statement. They finally approached the Supreme Court, which held that they had the right to file a written statement. If they could not file a statement then allowing them to fight the case would serve no purpose, the apex court held (Sumitbai and others vs Paras Finance Co. and others).   
	Enabling the disabled  
	A driver was terminated because he was suffering from defective colour vision. Now, according to the Pensions with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act if an employee suffers a disability during service, he has to be accommodated in an alternative post. His employers contended that if suitable alternative employment could not be found, an employee is entitled to compensation alone. The Madras High Court rejected the employers contention, holding that in a similar case the Supreme Court had stated if a cadre post was not available, a supernumerary post should be created with continuity of service and pay protection till a suitable alternative post is found for the disabled workman (Management of TN State Transport Corporation vs R. Tamilan).  
	Extra time  
	The Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules says that compassionate appointment can be given to an employees family if he has to retire before the age of 50 for medical reasons. The son of an employee was not considered for compassionate appointment as his father had just crossed 50 years at the time of such retirement. The son appealed on the ground that the medical board had taken nearly a year to submit its report. Directing the employers to consider the case afresh, the Madras High court held that the employer had not considered the vital point that the medical board submitted its report after inordinate delay for which the petitioner could not be victimised (K. Saravanan vs Chief Engineer, Agricultural Engineering).

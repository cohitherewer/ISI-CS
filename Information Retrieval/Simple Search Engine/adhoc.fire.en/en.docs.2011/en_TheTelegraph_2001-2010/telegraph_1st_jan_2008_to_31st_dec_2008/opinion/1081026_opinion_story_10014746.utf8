	Where have all the ashtrays gone?                  
	Sir  Ever since the ban on smoking in public places has come into effect, I have been struck by a peculiar concern. What will happen to all the ashtrays in the possession of the restaurants and bars? On asking a waiter of a restaurant I frequent, I found that all the ashtrays have been unceremoniously sent to their godown. My heart goes out to the lovely ceramic, steel, and even cheap tin ones on which have been dumped the ashes and burnt-out ends of some memorable evenings. Can Calcutta not have a museum for its lost ashtrays?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Cross currents          
	Sir  It is most unfortunate that the issue of legalizing homosexuality is still being debated in our country (PM tells ministers to end gay battle, Oct 17). The States familiar excuse has been that homosexuality is against our culture, and so there is no need for amending the infamous Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The government needs to be reminded that in the 18th and 19th centuries sati and child marriage were also a part of our culture. Yet the government did not hesitate to ban them then. Some religions may have something against homosexual behaviour, but religion and law are two very different things.           
	Interfering with the personal life of two consenting adults is a gross violation of the personal freedom of an individual. Merely amending Section 377 will not put an end to discrimination against homosexuals, but it will certainly be a step in that direction. If we are progressive enough to consider alimony for live-in relationships, then surely we have the right mindset for erasing the criminal tag off the gay community in the country. We have been fighting for the lower castes for several decades now. Here is another minority group that needs our support.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  We are fast turning into a decadent society where we tend to give more importance to aberrations than than to normal, mainstream practices. The demand for giving rights to homosexuals (and maybe solemnizing gay marriages in future) and the recent proposal to accord the same status to women in live-in relationships as to wives are examples of this. It is one thing to sympathize with gay men and quite another to let them flaunt their sexual preferences. There is also a section among our actors that believes that nudity should be allowed in our films. Should we give in to this one too?          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa 

                
	Sir  One wonders whether a progressive government should waste time and energy on a non-issue like homosexuality, while more important national issues, such as primary healthcare, infrastructure-building, and education for all are crying out for attention.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri

                          
	Mad race          
	Sir  I witnessed a horrifying sight on EM Bypass on October 19 at around 2.45 pm. Two white buses of the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation were racing madly against each another in total disregard of the traffic around them. What if a major accident had occurred?           
	I have noted down their numbers  WB 41C 9415 and WB 11A 9273  in the hope that the authorities shall take cognizance of such an irresponsible act.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Erratum          
	In the editorial, Lunar legend (Oct 23), the cost of Indias moon mission has been mentioned as Rs 3.8 crore. It should have read Rs 3.8 billion. The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

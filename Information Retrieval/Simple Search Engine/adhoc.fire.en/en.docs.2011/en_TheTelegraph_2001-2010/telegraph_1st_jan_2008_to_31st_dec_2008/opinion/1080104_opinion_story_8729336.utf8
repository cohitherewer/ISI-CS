	The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot 

 By Naomi Wolf, 

 Chelsea Green, $13.95
    
	The title sounds rather intriguing. Can there be a book on the decline of a country which claims itself to be a superpower? But Naomi Wolf, in The End of America, does not say that the American empire will simply vanish after an attack by its enemies. Rather, she predicts the gradual self-destruction of this superpower. 
    
	Wolf shows, using the example of Hitler, who rose to power with the help of the electorate only to become a despot, that democrats, too, can be fascists. She writes, The United States has stood for the rule of law in the past: We set a standard for other leaders, and set a point of aspiration for other citizens. If we lose that, what force on earth will stem any barbarism that any despot wishes to impose on his people? Following from this, Wolf shows how, in Egypt, security forces threw opposition leaders in jail. When challenged, the Egyptian authorities invoked the USs Patriot Act to justify themselves.
    
	Throughout the book, Wolf draws parallels between 21st-century America and Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union of the Twenties and early Thirties, when fascism was becoming stronger. To substantiate her argument, she discusses how, in 2002, the Bush administration created and named the Department of Homeland Security. Similarly, in the Thirties, Nazi propagandists referred to Germany not just as the nation or the Republic  which it was  but rather, as the Heimatthe Homeland.
    
	Such examples are not hard to find. As she points out, When the United States invaded Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney promised that we would be greeted as liberators. When the German army occupied Rhineland, the Nazi propaganda asserted that the troops would be welcomed as liberators.
    
	Wolf goes on to explain how even a parliamentary government can facilitate the growth of fascist forces. Hitlers Germany was no anarchic state: He used law to legitimate virtually everything he did. Hitler often boasted that We will overthrow Parliament in a legal way... Democracy will be overthrown with the tools of democracy.
    
	Coming down heavily on the Bush administration for its mistreatment of prisoners, democratic political opponents, Congressmen (even of the ruling Republican Party) and free-thinking journalists, she says, if we keep going down this road, the end of America could come, for each of us, in a different way, at a different moment.
    
	The book is in the form of a letter written to a young patriot friend, as the subtitle suggests. It starts with Dear Chris and ends with Yours, Naomi, New York City, July 14, 2007.

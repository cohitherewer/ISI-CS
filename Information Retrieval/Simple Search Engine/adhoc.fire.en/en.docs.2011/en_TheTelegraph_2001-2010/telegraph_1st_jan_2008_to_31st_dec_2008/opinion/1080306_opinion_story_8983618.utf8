                                                                                                                 FLAWED APPROACH                                  Bengals sub-plan for the minorities may work if it prioritizes welfare over appeasement, writes Samim Ahmed                          Broken promises                                  
	The panchayat elections will be held in West Bengal soon, and all political parties are, naturally, concerned about the votes to be cast by Muslims who make up (depending on whose figures you take) between 26 and 28 per cent of West Bengals population. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government is busy announcing programmes for the welfare of the Muslim community. It has come up with a sub-plan  to borrow the term used by the department of minorities welfare and development in a pamphlet named Minority Development in West Bengal  to that effect. The government has been saying that the sub-plan will ensure housing, education and employment opportunities for the minorities. The subtext is that it is to serve as the blueprint for the development of subhuman beings. The sub-plan is supposed to supplement the prime ministers new 15- point programme for the benefit of the minorities.         
	The West Bengal governments sub-plan has 43 points. These do not enumerate any concrete measures for ensuring housing facilities for Muslims except for the construction of a second Haj House and a new building for the West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education. The problem of housing is a crucial issue, especially for urban Muslims, who are refused rented or ownership flats in Hindu areas, forcing them to live in Muslim pockets like Rajabazar, Topsia, Mechhuabazar, Metiabruz, Taltala and some parts of Park Circus. They live in these areas year after year. The population increases but the areas do not.               
	This leads to an unnatural increase in the density of population. Consequently, illegal multi-storied buildings are constructed. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is aware of this truth. But it neither tries to legitimize the goings-on with proper show cause notices and the payment of subsequent penalties necessary for regularization, nor does it declare the illegal constructions as dangerous and order their demolition.         
	If the government recognizes the buildings to be safe and imposes fines or penalties for construction, the corporation has to provide facilities like water supply, electricity, proper sanitation, and so on. This creates a dilemma for the civic administration. If the buildings are demolished, it is impossible to get dwellers votes, and if these buildings are recognized as safe and at least conditionally legal, they have to be supplied the minimum facilities. The lack of resolution on the issue results in a denial of hygienic living conditions, which is practically a denial of the right to life. The argumentative state government or the CPI(M), nevertheless, successfully manages to steer clear from these horns of dilemma.        
	The second issue is education. The 43-point action plan promises several steps for the betterment of education opportunities. Most of it is madrasah-oriented. Point number 33 is interesting. It asserts that school dress is to be provided for all girl students in classes I to V. But where are the schools? The government has not been able to establish primary schools in 1,161 Muslim-majority villages. The ratio of primary schools in Muslim-dominated areas is less than half of that in other areas. There is one primary school per 1,851 people in Muslim-majority Murshidabad whereas the so-called underdeveloped district of Bankura has one primary school per 852 persons. No concrete steps have been taken to increase the number of primary schools in Muslim-majority villages till now.        
	In fact, in matters of education, this author has noticed a rather peculiar phenomenon in West Bengal. I did my graduation and post-graduation in philosophy and am now teaching the subject in a college. The study of the subject  from the higher secondary level to the post-graduate level  encompasses rigorous study of the the many branches of Hindu and Western philosophy, Buddhism, Jainism and so on. Yet, despite the presence of a rich and varied philosophical tradition in Islam, we do not learn anything at all about the various branches of Islamic philosophy.               
	The minority sub-plan includes the assurance of increased employment opportunities for Muslims. It calls to mind the fact that members of the minority communities have been provided loans, which are supposed to have benefited 684 persons in 1997-98 and 12,926 persons in 2006-07. Let us not suppose that the beneficiaries were all Muslims. However, it needs to be mentioned that no project for increasing employment has been announced in the plan, which merely mentions loans being given out to a handful of minority community members among a population of 8 crore. If the population of Muslims is around 26 per cent (according to the 2001 Census), the numerical strength of Muslims is around 2 crore and 8 lakhs. Would a simple grant of loans suffice to provide employment opportunities for this teeming population?        
	Appeasement of Muslims has always proved to be counterproductive. While the community is denied of tangible benefits, the policy makes certain sections of the majority community feel threatened. If the state government or the CPI(M) begins from the understanding that appeasement has not resulted in the desired socio-economic development of Muslims community, it could go a long way in benefiting the community.         
	Backwardness and deprivation breed separatism. In 1869, James Long wrote, The Muslims of Bengal have degenerated, are degenerating and will sink to still lower depths unless steps are taken to remedy what must be an evil attended with serious consequences. William Hunter wrote in 1871, ...The whole Mohamedan community has been openly deliberating their obligation to rebel. History has an odd habit of repeating itself.

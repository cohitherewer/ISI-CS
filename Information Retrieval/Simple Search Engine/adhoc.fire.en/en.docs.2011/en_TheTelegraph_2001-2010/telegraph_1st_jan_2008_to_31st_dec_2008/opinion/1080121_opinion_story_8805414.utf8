	The chosen one
         
	Sir  Jyoti Basu may have turned down the governments offer to receive the Bharat Ratna. But the United Progressive Alliance governments proposal of rewarding Basu with Indias highest civilian award is preposterous (CPM on Ratna radar, Jan 12). This is because in Basus long career as a statesman, he has hardly made a contribution of national significance. It may be recalled that Basu and his party came to power at a time when Bengal was at the forefront of the national economy. People from all parts of the country flocked to Bengal then in search of employment. However, during its 30-year-rule, Basus party has managed to reverse the situation completely. Today, Bengal lags far behind developed states such as Gujarat. Little wonder then that Bengalis are now being forced to travel to other parts of India in search of employment. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Subhas Chakraborty, the state transport minister, is keen to confer the Bharat Ratna on Jyoti Basu, the man who has crippled Bengals economy with his dose of militant trade unionism. Basu has many other feats to his credit. His tenure saw the closure of numerous factories, rising unemployment, as well as the politicizing of education, bureaucracy and health care. He also helped a new class of people  the promoters  to gain prominence. Given Basus achievements, shouldnt the Bharat Ratna go to someone else?
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The fact that the Congress has suggested Jyoti Basus name for the Bharat Ratna is because the Union government depends on Left support for its survival. Basu, unlike Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has never been a national icon in Indian politics. In fact, he has played a pivotal role in bringing about Bengals demise  ruining its economy, education and law and order. He also introduced the culture of gherao which continues unabated, although the man himself is no longer in power. Indias highest civilian award should go to Basu for making such lasting contributions to Bengal. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Subhas Chakraborty of the CPI(M) and the BJPs L.K. Advani have demanded the Bharat Ratna be given to Jyoti Basu and A.B. Vajpayee respectively. While Basu was a master at double-speak, Vajpayee was the perfect manipulator who could never let go of power. Whether it is Basus economic policies or Vajpayees mantra of India Shining, the people have never really prospered when these two men have been in power. 
     
	I have a humble suggestion to make in this respect. Why not bestow the Bharat Ratna to the people of Nandigram? These brave men and women resisted the state governments efforts to take away their land for months. Finally, they were overpowered with the help of brute force, resulting in the loss of many lives. These people, and not Basu and Vajpayee, are Indias real heroes, and deserve to be recognized by the men in power. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Congress leader, Veerappa Moily, has supported Jyoti Basus candidacy for the Bharat Ratna. Moilys stance, however, is based on political calculations. With the general elections around the corner, his party is hoping to come back to power by riding piggyback on the Left. Hence, his insistence on the Bharat Ratna going to Basu. 
     
	Such politicking has defeated the very purpose of the Bharat Ratna, which, essentially, is an award given in recognition of an individuals contribution towards society. Politicians have always lobbied for their own candidates as recipients. When the National Democratic Alliance was in power, the then prime minister, A.B. Vajpayee, awarded a Padma Bhushan to the surgeon who had operated on his knee! 
     
	This time, the Congress-Left combine has proposed Basus name while the BJP wants the award to be given to Vajpayee. The regional parties have joined the fray too, with Mayavati of the Bahujan Samaj Party saying that the prize be given to Kanshi Ram. Such antics have made the honour irrelevant. The government should work on establishing clear guidelines and set parameters to ensure that the Bharat Ratna is given only to the deserving. It may also make sense to strike off the name of politicians from the list of prospective recipients.
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

        
	Sir  The Bharat Ratna was once the prerogative of politicians only. However, a few years back, in a welcome development, the award was given to eminent people from other walks of life. It was heartening to note that the government was willing to recognize the services rendered by these men and women in their respective fields. 
     
	Our country has no dearth of heroes. Take E. Sreedharan for instance, the architect of Konkan Railways. Under Sreedharans dynamic leadership, the project was completed on time and has been an unqualified success. 
     
	There is no doubt that Sreedharan deserves this award. In fact, India can do with many more Sreedharans to meet the new challenges that lie in its path. If the government confers the Bharat Ratna on Sreedharan, it will mark the beginning of a historic phase. For it will mean that the government has finally learnt to honour Indias unsung heroes. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

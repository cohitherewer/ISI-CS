	A state with total reservation of 68 per cent looks only one per cent less silly than a state with a total reservation of 69 per cent. The latter is Tamil Nadu, which has been pretending not to notice that the Supreme Court cap on reservations in any state is 50 per cent. Now Rajasthan has managed to come a close second. Reservations spiralling upwards indicate a politics bankrupt in theory and mismanaged in practice. Both have set the stage for the Gujjar victory of having acquired a five per cent quota under a special category. The National Democratic Alliance state government, headed by Vasundhara Raje, has evidently decided to push the Constitution as far as it will go. Ms Raje is fearful of angering the Meenas, who have Scheduled Tribe status and so resisted the Gujjars fight for the same. And she is anxious to appease the Jats, given other backward classes status. This set the Gujjars on the path of direct protest, since they felt that the more powerful Jats would seize the OBC Gujjars benefits. By giving the Gujjars the category of the most backward and deprived of the OBCs, the state government has managed to keep the present SCs, STs and OBCs happy.        
	By its inherent logic, politics that is played only by pitting ethnic, caste and economic groups against one another cannot stop multiplying categories. For that, principles must be multiplied too. To save its skin in the upcoming assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has also awarded 14 per cent reservations to the upper castes  for those most deprived and backward among them  based on an interim report of the Economically Backward Commission. Ms Raje has done the nation a service by exposing the purpose for which the commission with the most sensible rationale was set up, while making a grab for the traditional BJP electorate. She is desperate to recover political poise in a situation that she allowed to get violently out of hand, and which began with the BJPs pre-election promise of ST status to Gujjars in 2003. The BJP forgot that, but the Gujjars refused to be forgotten. The most recent movement was the outcome of another failed promise after the Gujjar protests of 2007, and the subsequent evasions of both the state government and the Centre. The Gujjars seem happy now, but their year-long struggle has shown up politicians in Jaipur and Delhi in the poorest light.

	Utshaho-udbhash brought together Sayan Bandopadhyay and Rahul Mitra in an evening of Rabindrasangeet titled Amar chola nabeen patay at Rabindra Sadan on October 18. Both Sayan and Rahul, the first quite fresh to the world of public performance while the second is more experienced, seem to have a great deal of respect for the traditional way of singing Tagores compositions. Sayan presented six songs  Jagate anandajagge, Ke go antarotoro shey, Tomay jatane rakhibo hey, Tomari naam bolbo, Tumi chhere chhile bhule chhile bole, and Chiroshakha hey  all of them with great care and understanding. His voice is clear and expressive, and his presentation smart and mature. If this evening was any indication, then there is much to be expected from this young artists interpretation of the poets creations.        
	Rahul Mitra has already made a name for himself as a singer of little-heard Tagore songs. True to his reputation, he began his recital with Chirodibash naba madhuri. Some of his later songs, such as Ogo nadi apon bege, Amar jeerno pata, Khelaghar bandhte legechhi and Prangane mor shireesh-shakhay, though heard quite often, were sensitively rendered. The singer tried to go off the beaten track with E moho-aboron, but the idea of doing a rhythm-less vistaar of the song before performing it in the prescribed format did not work very well. Besides, Mitras attention to technicalities came in the way of a free play of expressions in the more difficult songs. Finally, Joy Goswami read out his poem, Tumi jaano, Srijatokishore, but it seemed to reinforce the idea that poetry is better read than listened to.

	Utsav, an exhibition of black-and-white and colour photographs organized by Kolkata Today and Picasso (Gaganendra Shilpa Pradarshashala, Oct 29-31), comprised a mishmash of kitschy images. The participants  Utpal Dutta, Indrajit Chakraborty and Pratap K. Dasgupta among others  perhaps in keeping with the theme, focussed mostly on hackneyed vignettes of festivity. The exhibition was thus littered with photographs of collective gaiety: a gaggle of men and women during rathyatra , chirpy damsels with faces dabbed in vermilion before immersion, clay idols and so on. Inexplicably, a yawning tiger and brawny models also gleamed in the frames mounted with a carelessness that can only be called criminal. The basic requisites of an exhibition  a catalogue and details of the prints  were missing. This one certainly got the spirits down.

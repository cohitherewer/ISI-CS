                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ITS ONLY A GAME                          - Why Venus and Serena get so much flak from the tennis world        Mukul Kesavan                                                  
	When Elena Dementieva, having lost to Venus Williams in the semi-finals of this years Wimbledon, suggested that the finals between the two sisters would be fixed before the event in a family conclave, she was doing what the tennis world has been doing for a decade now: trashing the Williams sisters. When reporters ran Dementievas comment past Venus, she said she found the comment insulting to her commitment as a tennis player; when the moderator tried to find an alibi for the Russian girls insinuation, Venus cut the question short. She had been listening to rubbish like this for years now, and she had had enough.         
	As someone who thinks Serena and Venus have transformed womens tennis for the better in the past ten years, Ive often wondered why they get so much flak from their peers, ex-players, the press, and yes, even spectators. Given that theyre the most exciting players to watch since Martina Navratilova in her prime, why is the tennis world so reluctant to give them their due? Roy Johnson, a sports journalist for Yahoo Sports, summed it up neatly: ... the sport of tennis  from its governing bodies to the establishment elite, to sponsors and fans in the cheap seats  has been, lets face it, ambivalent about them.        
	Ambivalent is a nice way of putting it: snide, patronizing, resentful and jealous would better describe the hostility theyve encountered. The trash-talking began early. It took a curious form: their peers suggested that they were taking advantage of the fact that they were black, that their being black was in itself an unfair advantage.               
	This must have come as news to the sisters who grew up black and poor in Crompton, one of the roughest parts of Los Angeles, playing on public courts that boasted amenities such as drive-by shootings and used hypodermic syringes. Richard Williams once thanked Vijay Amritraj on television for arranging practice facilities for his girls when the public courts became too dangerous to play on. Martina Hingis couldnt have seen that programme because in a 2001 interview she declared:        
	Being black only helps them. Many times they get sponsors because they are black. And they have a lot of advantages because they can always say, Its racism. They can always come back and say Because we are this colour, things happen. When asked about this, Serena said that journalists could look at the transcripts of all the interviews she had done in her career to judge the truth of the allegation. She had never once brought colour into the equation. About the sponsors: she said, as she was entitled to, that she got endorsements because she worked hard and won matches.         
	Hingis can be dismissed as a serial offender: she once put Amelie Mauresmos success in the womens game down to the fact that she was half a man. But its harder to explain away Navratilovas willingness to go after the Williams family. In an interview with Time magazine in 2001, Navratilova criticized Venuss father, Richard, for doing a jig, courtside, after his daughter beat Lindsay Davenport. As a great player with nine Wimbledon singles titles, Navratilovas views on court decorum might have been taken seriously if she hadnt dragged race into the conversation: If Mr Williams had been white and done that victory dance in front of Lindsay Davenport, he would have been reprimanded much more. People have been afraid to criticize them because they dont want to be called racist.        
	You could be forgiven for thinking that it was Navratilova who had Richard Williamss skin colour on the brain. Notice how Navratilova moves from her specific criticism of the fathers behaviour to the general allegation that legitimate criticism of the Williams sisters had been inhibited by a fear of political correctness. The trouble with this generalization is that it isnt true. Serena and Venus have been at the receiving end of more critical comment than any other player of similar standing. In an essay in The New York Times in 2003, Sara Corbett spoke of the relentless criticism the sisters have faced. John McEnroe, declared that Venus and Serena were as cold as ice. Davenport and Monica Seles complained that Venus didnt say hi to anyone. Navratilova accused them of being ...afraid to show any kind of humility.         
	In 2006, both Navratilova and Chris Evert took it upon themselves to chide Serena for a lack of commitment to tennis. Venus and Serena both play an average of roughly ten tournaments a year, well below the tour norm of fifteen, even twenty tournaments. Evert went to the extent of writing Serena an open letter in Tennis Magazine. Referring to Serenas much-publicized interest in couture and cinema, Evert wrote: I dont see how acting and designing clothes can be compared with the pride of being the best tennis player in the world. Navratilova echoed Everts reproach. Apart from the daftness of legislating other peoples preferences, the odd thing about this gratuitous advice was that neither Evert nor Navratilova had been particularly supportive or appreciative of Serena and Venus earlier in their careers, which made their intervention seem like carping rather than well-meant concern.         
	Even if the advice was well-meant, it was misplaced. Venus and Serenas strategy of playing fewer tournaments has allowed them to outlast many of their more committed contemporaries. Anna Kournikova, Justin Henin, Martina Hingis, Kim Clijsters have all retired from the game, burnt out by injuries and their monomanical commitment to competitive tennis. Pam Shriver, Navratilovas doubles partner and once Venuss mentor on the tour, has come to believe that the Williams sisters might have pioneered a new and better way of handling a tennis career. Theres something to pacing. You have to be willing to face criticism from the tour and the establishment to play 12 to 16 tournaments a year.        
	Shrivers comment is a clue to the animosity that the Williamses face. Heres Richard Williams, a man who declares when his daughters are thirteen and twelve that theyll grow up to be the two best players in the world. But unlike the usual obsessive tennis parent, he doesnt allow them to play the junior circuit because it might interfere with their education. He teaches them the importance of a life outside tennis and tells the world that he expects his daughters to walk away from the game theyve dominated to pursue other interests.               
	And Venus and Serena go on to bear out his beliefs. They do everything he predicted. They win fifteen majors between them without obsessing about being No 1. And they win the big tournaments on their own terms. Serena, for example, after two years of injuries left her out of shape and adrift at a rank of 95 at the end of 2006, won the Australian Open by thrashing tenniss favourite golden girl, Maria Sharapova, 6-1 6-2 in the final. Along the way, Venus sets up an interior design company, V. Starr Interiors, while Serena creates a new apparel line, Aneres.         
	Over the past five years, weve heard that the Belgians were coming, then it was the Russians who were coming, and now its the Serbs who are coming. Someone forgot to tell the Williams sisters. Because the Belgians have come (and gone), the Russian girls seem to have lost the plot and the Serbs didnt last till the business end of Wimbledon, so Venus and Serena, after being exiled from the show courts in the earlier rounds, found themselves playing each other again, on Centre Court.         
	Thats why Hingis, Davenport, Navratilova, Seles, Evert, McEnroe amp; Co. dont like the Williams. That two girls and their dad could take the womens game by the scruff and shake it into new life and take it to another level without treating tennis as a sacred vocation, galls them. It diminishes their lives, it makes their immersion in tennis seem one-dimensional and obsessive. In March this year, Richard Williams criticized McEnroe for playing tennis for twenty years and then commentating on it for the next twenty. It was as if he had learnt nothing else in the course of his life, said Williams. Given that McEnroe has said plenty about Venus and Serena in the past, he can scarcely argue that Richard should mind his own business. That a black man who doesnt know his place should say this, a black man with two champion daughters who have brought his prescriptions to life, must be intolerable. But after this all-Williams Wimbledon final, its time for their critics to learn the two Commandments that the familys been trying to teach for a decade now.         
	Tennis is only a game. And the Williamses own it.

	The laziest child in the class is always the most proficient at producing excuses. The panchayat and rural development department of West Bengal has many. An average of 25 days is a truly disgraceful score out of 100 days of work guaranteed by the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. But the department is unperturbed. There are floods, and there is the harvest season, claim its officials, as if these phenomena are unique to West Bengal. In case these excuses sound thin, there is an additional one. Villagers are unwilling to do manual labour. If it is possible, even for a moment, to overlook the absurdity of this statement regarding the rural poor, it can be seen as a reflection of the psychology of the administration. Let alone manual labour, officials are unwilling to do any work at all, including the work for which they are paid. Besides, as in the case of every other beneficial scheme, only households loyal to the dominant party are considered first, even when they do not need the benefit.That was one of the reasons for the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s defeat in a few areas in the last panchayat elections.        
	If apathy and the corruption of local politics can be seen as the main reasons for the failure to provide guaranteed work, they are still immediate explanations. The scale of the inaction regarding the improvement of rural health services points to a truly magnificent indifference, towards duty and towards the people. The West Bengal government has not bothered to use more than 14-15 per cent of the Rs 489 crore given to the state under the National Rural Health Mission, leaving its primary health centres inaccessible, without electricity, water and telephones. There is nothing new in the states apparently congenital inability to use money given to it for a beneficial purpose; the same happened with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan funds. Nothing has made a difference. The fact that in the utilization of funds West Bengal is among the most inefficient few states, or that various governmental and non-governmental agencies have been periodically reporting its failure to implement the NREGS, or that people in the villages are desperate for basic healthcare  these have left the government unmoved. It would be fascinating to find out what kind of future leaders expect for a state where people are deprived of health, education and work.

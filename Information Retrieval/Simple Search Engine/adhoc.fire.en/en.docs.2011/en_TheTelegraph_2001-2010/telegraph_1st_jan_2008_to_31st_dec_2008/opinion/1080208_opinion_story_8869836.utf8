The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Global recipes from local kitchens
                                                                                                              GLOBAL RECIPES FROM LOCAL KITCHENS                                                                  
	Eating India: exploring a nations cuisine By Chitrita Banerji,
   Penguin, Rs 350        
	Years ago, when Chitrita Banerji told Khushwant Singh about her decision to write a book on food in Bengal, he made some friendly jibes about whether any book would be long enough to capture the cuisine or the Bengalis love for food. Apparently not. Four books later, Banerji starts from Bengal and undertakes a remarkable journey that takes her to all parts of India. The result is an extremely enjoyable and informative book that goes beyond merely talking cuisines to become a travel diary of sorts, criss-crossing geographical zones and eras in history to give us an interesting insight into why we eat what we eat.         
	A wedding invitation tempts Banerji to leave her Boston apartment and come to Calcutta to taste a traditional Bengali wedding feast. Banerji braces herself for a letdown, since, like many of her generation, she cannot imagine or expect the authentic preparations that marked such occasions in her youth. The misgivings prove to be unfounded, and the meal becomes a springboard for a book, which starts with the writer trying to prove the popular theory that Bengalis learnt to make chhana-based sweets from the Portuguese. No conclusive evidence is found, but during her travels along the western coast, Banerji discovers how Goan and Kannada cuisine have assimilated and reinvented themselves with each wave of traders and invaders.        
	A later chapter is also devoted to Kerala cuisine, which Banerji hails as one that can match Bengal for the way it uses rice in various ways. The Malayali kitchen has always been dismissed as coconut-based vegetarian territory, but that is not the case. The subtle differences as well as similarities in the food eaten in the three erstwhile kingdoms of Cochin, Malabar and Travancore make for a variety of delicacies.        
	From the west coast, Banerji moves northwards where she enjoys her meal in the langar of the Golden Temple before delving into Mughal and Awadhi history, culture and cuisine. Like the waves of foreigners who hit Indias western shores, successive attacks from the northwest also changed the food habits of the north. Muslims brought with them kebabs, koftas, pulaos, and above all, biriyani. In Delhi she gets acquainted with butter chicken before moving to Benaras to sample street food. Plenty of attention has also been given to Hyderabad, and how the cuisine is a unique union of southern spices and herbs with Persian or Mughal preparation  a union that took place during Aurangzebs ill-advised siege of Golconda Fort.        
	Vignettes like these pepper the book from start to finish, making Eating India an informative read even for Indians, though the book primarily caters to the West. For example, legend has it that Worcestershire sauce was accidentally invented when a container of spiced vinegar had been left forgotten in a cellar and began to ferment. Before throwing it out, the chemist happened to sample it and thus discovered its unique taste. Another interesting nugget is about Chicken 65, a south Indian dish that, according to myth, gets its name from either the initial marinade that comprised sixty-five spices, or because the chicken used for this dish always has to be sixty-five days old.        
	One popular question that the book answers is why the biriyani in Calcutta has potatoes, unlike the traditional Awadhi biriyani. Banerji explains that Wajed Ali Shahs entourage had to sustain itself on meagre finances. This prompted his chef to use the potato, a foreign tuber that was slowly gaining acceptance in Indian kitchens, as a filler to biriyani and other gravy-based meat dishes. The inevitable comparison between Awadhi and Hyderabadi biriyani is made, and Banerji picks the Awadhi version as the winner.         
	While Banerji focuses on some of the popular cuisines of the country, she also deals with the dwindling Jewish influence in Kerala, Bombay and Calcutta. She also raises a toast to the significant contribution of Anglo-Indian cuisine and to the food of the Northeast. An observant onlooker, Banerji has an eye for detail and also for the unconscious manner in which food effortlessly crosses borders, from one culture to another. While construction workers on a national highway eat greasy noodles with a spoon, Japanese IT professionals in the Infosys campus dig into idlis with chopsticks.        
	Seen through Banerjis eyes, globalization and cultural exchanges are as old as the spice trade, and food is often the first ambassador of a new culture. Taste buds have always sought and acquired new tastes, which is why the advent of international fast food chains is merely the latest form of foreign invasion, while the McAloo Tikki is only the newest example of Indias ability to modify and assimilate. The exchange works the other way too, and has done so long before British Airways put chicken tikka masala on its menu. The first spate of curry houses in England sprang up when the English leaving India discovered that exotic exasperating India had seeped into their bones. However, Banerji has not explained why Punjabi-Mughlai cuisine is seen the world over as the definitive Indian cuisine.         
	This is Banerjis first attempt at writing about food outside Bengal, and she has worked hard to understand the nuances of all the culinary practices she has touched upon. Fortunately, the hard work and extensive research does not weigh the book down. Instead, Banerjis insatiable curiosity, her hunger for new culinary experiences, engaging style and gentle humour makes Eating India a worthwhile read even for those who are not hardcore foodies.

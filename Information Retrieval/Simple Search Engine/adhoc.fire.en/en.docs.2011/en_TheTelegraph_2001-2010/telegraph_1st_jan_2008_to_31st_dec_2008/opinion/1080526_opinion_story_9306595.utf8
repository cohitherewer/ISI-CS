                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       OPEN TO TROUBLE                                   Gwynne Dyer                              
	It was looking ugly there for a few days, with mobs of South Africans in townships around Johannesburg randomly murdering several dozen foreigners (migrants from other African countries) and injuring several hundred. But now, President Thabo Mbeki has acted decisively: he has announced the establishment of a panel of inquiry into the violence. That should fix it.        
	Just in case he gets impatient while waiting for the panels report, however, I can tell him what it will say  or at least, what it should say. It should say that the root problem was his governments non-interventionist policy on immigration.        
	The fact that the commonly used estimate is three to five million illegal immigrants says it all: the authorities have no idea how many foreigners are in South Africa. But the higher estimate is probably closer to the truth, for some four million people have left Zimbabwe alone to seek work abroad, and almost all of them have come to South Africa.        
	This open borders non-policy had high motives. Many of South Africas current leaders are men and women who spent decades in exile during the fight against apartheid, and the migrants come mostly from the countries that gave them shelter at that time. How can they turn away people from those countries now that the shoe is on the other foot?        
	It is an honourable sentiment, but more easily experienced if, like South Africas current leaders, you lead a secure and comfortable life in one of the nicer northern suburbs of Johannesburg. If you happen to live in Alexandra township, amidst garbage and violence and poverty, and if you dont have a job, its a little harder to access such noble emotions because one-tenth of the people in the country are illegal immigrants, and lots of them have jobs.                
	Revised target        
	None of this justifies murder, but it does begin to explain it. Mbeki was incredibly foolish to assume that he could just let foreigners flood into the country and not expose them to a popular backlash. The South African media are filled with self-flagellating editorials that ask, What kind of people are we if we can behave like this? The answer is: not saintly inhabitants of some imagined rainbow nation that has risen above the normal human plane, just ordinary people under pressure and behaving badly.        
	The South African poor have been amazingly patient. It has been 14 years now since the end of apartheid and very little has changed for the better in their lives. The black poor still loyally vote for the African National Congress, but their anger was going to burst out sooner or later. By holding the door open to so many illegal immigrants, the government has guaranteed that they would be the primary target.        
	Is this some Machiavellian plan to divert popular anger from the government itself? Probably not. Its just that the leaders dont see what has been happening to the people. How else could Mbeki defend Robert Mugabe, especially since Mugabes misdeeds have resulted in the enormous wave of illegal immigrants into South Africa? Justice Malala, whose column appears in The Times (the online version of South Africas Sunday Times), nailed it when he wrote: (Our) people are behaving like barbarians because the ANC has failed... to act on burning issues that are well known for having sparked similar eruptions across the globe.... The Mbeki governments refusal to even acknowledge the crisis in Zimbabwe has resulted in as many as 3 million Zimbabweans walking the streets of South Africa.... Mbekis... block-headedness is directly responsible for the eruption of xenophobia.        
	Such plain talk is not about blaming the victim. It is about recognizing realities, which is the first step towards addressing them. And the despairing poor of South Africa should be addressing their anger not at helpless Zimbabweans but at the president who let this human catastrophe happen.

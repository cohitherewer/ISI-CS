                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RUNNING SHORT                                                    
	The Congress is a caring party. Not long ago it wanted to give the poorest of the poor liquefied petroleum gas cylinders. Now its pet distributor of goodies, Indian Oil Corporation, has stopped giving new connections. It has not yet run out of gas; that will come later. It has not run out of cylinders: the private sector makes them. No, it has run out of money. It would require exceptional incompetence to run out of money in an industry which all the world over is minting money because of the high oil prices. But incompetence would be the wrong word to use for IOC; misfortune is more appropriate. For IOC has the privilege of being owned by the Central government; it has mercilessly raided the corporation to make itself popular with sundry users of oil products, including those who hire out generators for weddings, who cook for festive occasions, and who adulterate kerosene with more expensive diesel oil. Not all users are equal, though; some are more equal than others. The governments favourite users are the so-called poor. They shall remain nameless, for if they did not, the government would not be able to favour its rich friends who divert subsidized oil products into black market at considerable benefit to themselves.         
	Cessation of new LPG connections is only one symptom of a more serious ailment that IOC suffers from; that ailment, as mentioned, is lack of money. And the lack of money is due to the fact that the government has not allowed IOC to raise sale prices of its products while the cost it has to pay for oil has mounted. As a result, IOC made a profit of Rs 415 crore after receiving oil bonds of Rs 13,527 crore in the second quarter of 2008. In other words, it lost Rs 13,112 crore. It sold products worth Rs 102,260 crore for Rs 89,148 crore, losing 13 paise on every rupee. Running out of money makes the patient behave in unpredictable ways. For instance, it will not be able to pay transporters to carry petrol to pumps. Some in the south have already started running dry; if powerful people continue in their foolish ways, all of us will have to queue for our tankful of petrol.         
	Vehicle owners do not matter in this populist country; they are the privileged ones who strut about on scooties and sweeties. The government will, however, be jerked out of its slumber when IOC can no longer pay the Arabs for the crude it imports. They are not bleeding-heart socialists; they are hard-headed businessmen. If India cannot buy oil, they have a hundred customers waiting to take it. It is just Indias bad luck that it cannot import a government. Indians are supposed to choose their government; but they do not seem to be very good at doing so.

	The fall guy                  
	Sir  Recently, some television channels showed men dressed as Ravan dancing obscenely, consuming alcohol and misbehaving with women during Ramlila celebrations. Their conduct was an insult to all religious-minded Indians. Ravan may have been Rams adversary but legend has it that he was a great scholar and a courteous king who never behaved lecherously. The Union government must introduce a law to prevent such disrespectful treatment of mythical figures and legends.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

      
	Holy order          
	Sir  The canonization of Sister Alphonsa has indeed made Indian Christians proud (Calling a saint, Oct 7). The miracle, which was necessary to confirm her sainthood, was not merely a spell of magic, but also a profound gesture of humanity: it helped a disabled child take to his feet again.           
	But, nonetheless, it is quite strange that even in the 21st century the Roman Catholic sect demands proof of a miracle before conferring sainthood on deserving missionaries. What Mother Teresa had done for the poor and homeless was no less miraculous. No ordinary individual could have done so much for mankind. But still the Vatican is dragging its feet on bestowing sainthood on her as it is yet to come across a miracle performed by this woman. The Vatican should know that there are people working tirelessly for the needy all over the world. They may not have performed miracles but they are the real saints.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kakali Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is true that the Christian community has contributed immensely to the cause of welfare in India. Yet, it is being victimized in our secular democracy by Hindu fundamentalists who are accusing Christian missionaries of forceful conversion. All hell seems to break loose in our country if a man were to convert to another faith in the hope of of a better life. India is a democracy and hence the people of this country have the right to adopt and practise any religion of their choice. The supporters of the sangh parivar seem to have forgotten the fact that this secular nation is not for the Hindus alone, and that people from other religions have also done wonderful work for the cause of humanity here. Sister Alphonsas canonization, giving India its first ever saint, is a perfect example of the good work being done by members of other religions.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                          
	Dial error          
	Sir  A couple of years ago, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited had boasted that its Internet Protocol Television or IPTV would provide better services than other digital transmitters of satellite channels. The company had also promised that it would be far less expensive than the prices offered by competitors.           
	But quite mysteriously, BSNL has not yet launched IPTV in Calcutta. BSNL authorities claimed that IPTV has been introduced in some rural pockets of West Bengal only. The customer care executive on the BSNL enquiry hotline, however, could not provide the reason for IPTVs absence in Calcutta nor could the person confirm whether it would be introduced in the city in the near future. Many families had been waiting to subscribe to this cheaper network. Tired of the delay, they have now been compelled to subscribe to other private satellite TV connections at exorbitant rates. If the BSNL is not technically competent to provide this service, it should not have announced its launch in the first place.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sanghamitra Ray, Calcutta

	Easy win                  
	Sir The Bharatiya Janata Party would be well advised not to lose itself in the euphoria following the partys sweeping victory in Karnataka (South battle won, not war, May 27). Although the people of Karnataka have rejected the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Congress, they have not handed the BJP an absolute majority. The National Democratic Alliance, particularly the BJP, should remember this as it prepares for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress is surely losing its power base across the country, and for good reason. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliances stint at the Centre has been marked by sycophancy, corruption and abuse of power. As for Manmohan Singh, he will certainly leave his mark, if not for anything but for being the most servile prime minister in the history of independent India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  In spite of the joint efforts of the Congress and the JD(S) to win over voters by showering them with incentives, the BJP won the Karnataka assembly elections decisively. The chief election commissioner should be congratulated for ensuring free and fair polls in the state. Both the Congress and the JD(S) flaunted their secular credentials and touted the BJP as communal. However, the secularism card was bound to boomerang on their faces. The voters have realized how these parties have been cheating them for so long. The JD(S), in particular, was known to have lured the people with money and liquor, ruining many a family. It was only after a concerted effort was made by the BJP minister, Ramachandra Gowda  who put restrictions on both these items  that the quality of life improved. Now that the BJP has won the peoples mandate, it must set up a model administration in the state by doing away with the corrupt governance set up by its predecessors.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  The credit for the BJPs victory in Karnataka goes to its opponents. The JD(S) received a drubbing for triggering political instability in the state, while the Congress lost the polls because of the tactical blunders it committed. The Congresss failure to project a suitable chief ministerial candidate must have harmed its prospects. The Congress and the JD(S) should accept the peoples verdict gracefully and refrain from doing anything that might plunge the state into yet another political crisis.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa             
	Sir  The biggest beneficiary of the Karnataka elections, undoubtedly, is the BJP. Not only has it captured power in a southern state for the first time, it has also gained the required momentum ahead of the crucial general elections next year. The Congress, on the other hand, has come up second best yet again. And this, despite intense campaigning by Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi. But the biggest losers of these elections have been the JD(S)s H.D. Deve Gowda and his son, H.D. Kumaraswamy. They have been shown their places by the people. While the BJP can justifiably feel elated by this victory, it would do well to remember that the issues in a general election are vastly different from an election to the state assembly. If the BJP wants to succeed in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls, it would have to think up an agenda that would reflect its national, and not parochial, priorities.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The BJPs victory in Karnataka heralds the entry of the saffron party into the South. The Karnataka results will force the regional parties to rethink their poll strategies for the future. The JD(S), for instance, seems to have learnt, albeit a little too late, that it never pays to betray the people. Although Mayavatis social re-engineering has been a success in Uttar Pradesh, political parties should ponder why the reservation card has ceased to pay dividends elsewhere in recent times.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune 

                
	Sir  The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Karnataka. The division among the secular parties and infighting in the Congress have given the BJP this unprecedented success. If the Congress and the JD(S) had fought the elections together, they would have won with a big majority. If these secular parties do not join hands in the future, they will face the same fate in the forthcoming parliamentary polls.           
	Yours faithfully,       
V.M. Khaleelur Rahman, Ambur 

                
	Sir  The centre of gravity in Indian politics has shifted towards the saffron party. The win in Karnataka is the result of the botched agenda of the Opposition. In fact, the BJP did not have to work hard for its success. The erosion of the the Congress votebank in the state and the absence of a competent leadership in the party made sure that success would elude the BJPs arch-rival.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sunil V. Khaitan, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The BJP has, for the first time, formed a government on its own in a southern state. This shows that in Karnataka, secular-minded people voted for the party, ignoring its alleged communal tag. Instead of trying to profit by creating such misconceptions, the Congress should focus on real crises  rising inflation, terrorism and farmer suicides.           
	Yours faithfully,         Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

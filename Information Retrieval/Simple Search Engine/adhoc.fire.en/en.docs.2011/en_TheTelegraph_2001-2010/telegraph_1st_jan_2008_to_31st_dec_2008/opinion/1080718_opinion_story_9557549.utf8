	Bond with the best            
	The Book Of Nature (Penguin, Rs 250) by Ruskin Bond is the ideal collection for the lovers of blue hills, green fields, creatures big and small and of course, Ruskin Bond. Written in that funny, quirky style that is typical of Bond, it has short entries on topics ranging from the beetle that blundered into the authors room, the scent of Snapdragons to the bubbly mountain stream in Mussoorie or the quaint little village called Manjari nestled among the Himalaya. Ambling off the beaten track, Bond comes across a leopard leaping over a parapet wall, her three cubs scurrying into the bushes. On a particularly wild and stormy night, the corrugated tin roof of Bonds house is blown away by the wind, leaving him to salvage his beloved books from the lashing rain. Only a person acutely sensitive to the silent workings of nature could be as alive to its beauties as Bond is. To read him is to be transported to another time, when Aunt Mabel fainted on discovering Grandfathers pet python in the tiffin box, and another place, where the mist performs its secret ministries.                         
	Encounters with Civilizations: From Alexander the Great to Mother teresa (Meteor, Rs 295) by Gzim Alpion brings together 13 articles on history, culture, social issues, politics and the media, written between 1993 and 2007. Each of them is the product of Alpions ongoing reflection on the problems people experience in their encounters with civilizations different from theirs. Although the authors intentions seem genuine enough, his prose is too burdened with academic jargon to facilitate a proper understanding of what he is trying to say. The reader can only end up hopelessly muddled if he has to start with an interview with the ghost of Mohammed Ali, former ruler of Egypt and end with subjectivist, structuralist and post-structuralist approaches to Mother Teresas celebrity status.                        
	Pandoras Box (Avon, Rs 225) by Giselle Green is a well-written debut novel about a mother-daughter relationship. The narrative combines the voices of Rachel Wetherby and her daughter, Shelley, in alternative chapters and has the myth of Pandora at its centre. When Pandora opened the box, she brought in pain, sorrow and desolation to the world, in addition to hope. Memories that are best kept buried are raked up as Rachel rummages through the carton containing the paraphernalia of a lost childhood. But something magical also emerges out of the dreaded box. Life changes for Rachel and for Shelley, who had planned her own death to end the torment caused by a fatal illness.                                 
	The Last Dragon Dance: Chinatown Stories (Penguin, Rs 199) by Kwai-Yan Li gives voice to a community that is slowly fading away from Calcutta. Li was born in Calcutta to parents who had migrated from Moi-Yen in China in the 1920s. At the end of the book, there is a short write-up on the first Chinese who landed in Calcutta in the 1770s. According to legend, Yand Da Zha, referred to as Acchi, tricked the Governor General, Warren Hastings, into giving him a large tract of land on the banks of the Hooghly. After nearly 150 years, the Calcutta Chinatown came into being on Sun Yat Sen Street, a narrow cobbled street with decaying buildings and no street lighting. Lis stories are charming and poignant, filled with the sound of clicking chopsticks, the smell of chilli chicken and the daily misery of the houses in Chattawalla Gully. However, Lis writing needed a little more polish. A sentence like Uncle Worry always tears [that is, cries] when he laughs mars the pleasure of reading.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Inside Incredible India                                                                                    Stephen P. Huyler has always been guided by strong, self-reliant and self-aware women. DAUGHTERS OF INDIA: ART AND IDENTITY (Mapin, $176.40) is mostly a picture-book which documents the lives of some women with phenomenal strengths and capabilities that Huyler came across during his travels in India. From the six-year-old Padma who is about to draw her first kolam design with rice-flour (picture, bottom right), to the 72-year-old Bidulata (extreme left), who still paints floral motifs ahead of Lakshmi Puja, most of the twenty women chosen by Huyler have been carrying forward some traditional art-form or the other. The picture on bottom left shows the hands of Chhatisgarhs Sonabai sculpting forms with plastered clay and hemp rope; top right is Savitris mother standing next to a door painted by her daughter in Orissa. Naturally, the inclusion of a software-developer-cum-entrepreneur, or an NRI doctor in this milieu strikes one as odd. But there is something even more baffling in the compilation of inspirational tales and arresting photographs  the pictures of Sunithi Narayan, Indias pre-eminent female tourist guide. In some, she (if it is her at all) has grey hair, in others jet black.

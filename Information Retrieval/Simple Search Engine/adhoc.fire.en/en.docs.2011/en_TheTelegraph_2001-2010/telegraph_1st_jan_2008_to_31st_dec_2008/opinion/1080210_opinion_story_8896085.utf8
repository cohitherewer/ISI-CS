The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Prisoners better talk
                                                                                                                 PRISONERS BETTER TALK                              Recognised as a basic right and guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, the right to remain silent is now under debate and may soon be snatched away. Dola Mitra reports                                                  Mums not the word: Making it legal to compel an individual to speak may result in human rights violations        
	You have the right to remain silent. This statement, made familiar by Hollywood courtroom dramas, and read out to a person under arrest as among his rights as a prisoner, essentially informs a person accused of a crime that he can keep his mouth shut if he wants to. He doesnt have to answer questions pertaining to the commission of the crime. Not under police interrogation. Nor even in a court of law when his case is being tried. Recognised as a fundamental right and guaranteed by the constitutions of most democratic countries around the world, including the Constitution of India, this right, however, is now under debate and may soon be snatched away. That is, if a recommendation by a national legal committee is approved. Called the Committee on Reforms on Criminal Justice System in India, the committee is attempting to reform the criminal justice system in the country.        
	Our criminal justice system places too much emphasis on the rights of a person accused of a crime, explains Justice V.S. Malimath, former Chief Justice of the Karnataka and Kerala High Courts, who is the chairman of the committee. Sometimes this is at the cost of delivering justice to the victim of a crime. He argues that by exempting a person accused of a crime from being cross-examined by a prosecuting lawyer or from answering questions pertaining to the crime at the time of police investigation, you severely limit the scope of getting to the bottom of the truth. The accused could be the most vital source of information and may be able to provide the most incriminating evidence under interrogation. In order to strengthen the criminal justice system to ensure that justice is delivered, it is imperative to review laws that allow an accused person the option of refraining from giving evidence.        
	The recommendation has many takers in the legal community. In support of the committees recommendation, a Calcutta High Court criminal lawyer, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed his frustration at the courts having to allow a man, accused of rape, to walk free, because of insufficient evidence. As things stand, the onus of having to prove an accused person guilty lies on the prosecution. That means, the defendant, accused of a crime, can just sit back and say, Ok, prove, it. So its basically the victim who has to get out there and try to offer proof of a persons guilt. In the case that I am referring to, I was convinced that the man was guilty as charged and I am certain that under repeated cross-examination he would have cracked and come out with the truth. Unfortunately he had the legal option of keeping silent.        
	In fact, according to Justice Malimath, one of the main reasons for coming up with this recommendation, which comes under the category justice to victims, is his own experience as a judge for many years of seeing what he perceived were the guilty getting away scot-free. He said that there were many instances of people literally getting away with murder because of insufficient evidence. We could do nothing to prevent them, he says, We were hindered by the law from making them speak about their crimes.        
	While legal experts provide many more real life examples of what they call the need to make it mandatory for the accused person to speak, the power of cross examining an accused has been brought out in reel life too. In the Hollywood courtroom drama A Few Good Men, which is based on a true story, the character of the prosecuting lawyer in a murder case, played by Tom Cruise, pins all his hopes on cross examining the character of Jack Nicholson, who, Cruises character believes, has committed the crime. When the case is about to be rested for lack of evidence, Nicholsons characters sudden outburst under aggressive and provocative cross examination brings out the truth.        
	But there is also strong opposition to the recommendation made by Malimaths committee. Among those who argue against compelling under-trial prisoners from having to testify in court or be forced to answer to questions they dont want to during police investigations is Calcutta High Court criminal lawyer Joymalya Bagchi. He says, It is anybodys guess what kind of torture an accused person may be subjected to, to make him or her confess to a crime he or she may or may not have committed. As things stand, such a confession has no legal bearing in a court of law because of the possibility that it could have been obtained through intimidation. An Indian citizen, whether he has been accused of a crime or not, is protected by Article 20 of the Constitution of India which gives him the right of silence if he feels that what he speaks may go against him. But if it becomes legally permissible to force an accused person to answer to questions put forward by investigating police officers and prosecuting lawyers in law courts, extracting confessions would be rampant.        
	Human rights lawyer and the head of Calcutta-based human rights group Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), Kiriti Roy too, upholds an individuals right to remain silent. Making it legal to compel an individual to speak whether under police interrogation or in a law court is tantamount to an individual testifying against himself. The evidence may be used against him and it is unconstitutional to compel a person to give evidence against himself.        
	Roy points out furthermore that even given the prohibitive nature of the laws there is ample evidence of custodial torture to extract confessions or leads for purposes of investigation.        
	According to a senior police official, however, investigating officers have to abide by specific regulations. He explains, Right now, the law permits a prisoner to be interrogated for reasons of police investigation while in police custody as well as be asked to testify in court, but it is the individuals right to decline. For purposes of investigation, it is permissible for the police to repeatedly ask, coax or cajole to try and persuade a prisoner to provide leads. But the use of physical force, whether electric shock treatment or other forms of third degree torture or mental threat of any kind, is prohibited by law.        
	Still, he admits that the line that separates persuasion from pressure is very thin and it leaves scope for physical and mental abuse.        
	Critics of Malimaths recommendation fear that making it legal for the police to make prisoners speak and use it as legal evidence in a court of law, thereby investing more power with the police, will result in further human rights violations. They uphold the legal premise that it is better to let a 100 guilty men go free than to wrongfully convict one innocent man.        
	But the gist of Malimaths recommendation is, as he himself puts it, Why should a single criminal be allowed to walk free? A strong criminal justice system means delivering justice to every single citizen whose rights have been violated by a crime.

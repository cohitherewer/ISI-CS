The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Farewell to the Shivaliks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FAREWELL TO THE SHIVALIKS                              This above all      Khushwant Singh                        Happy highways				                                       
	Last year, when I came to the Shivaliks for the summer months, I swore it would be the last time. The journey by road turned out to be a day-long nightmare. Eight long hours of crawling behind snail-paced trucks, tractors, buses, cars, oil-tankers and scooters with frequent stand-stills every few miles proved too much for me. However, I have happy memories of over 90 summers spent in these hills  at Shimla, Mashobra, Narkanda, Tatapani, Kasauli  and felt I owed them a proper farewell. I decided to run the gauntlet once again for the last time.        
	I did the journey in a style I am not accustomed to. In a brand-new Mercedes Benz (courtesy Nanak Kohli) led by two police cars with blaring red lights and sirens (courtesy the governor of Haryana, A.R. Kidwai), we set out at 8 am in spitting rain and went past amaltas trees dripping molten gold on either side of the road. There was the same sort of heavy, barely moving traffic of vehicles I had encountered last year, but the police sirens blasted their way through it screaming, Get out of the way, you blithering idiots, and make way for the Dirty Old Man of Delhi whose godless sermons have ruined the morals of the entire generation. He is on a farewell visit to the Shivaliks. And so I found myself at the MacDonalds eatery in Karnal in two-and-a-half hours. I was recognized, given free pizza and coffee and was soon on my way up again. No toll taxes, no hold-ups. We sped past a 30-km stretch of stationary vehicles into Himachal Pradesh. I was expecting to reach Kasauli by 4 pm. I was there at 2.30 pm. The journey, including the halt at Karnal, had taken five-and-a-half hours in all. A record of sorts.        
	I occurred to me that our roads can never keep pace with the increase of traffic. When Nanos appear on them, matters will go from the bad to an impossible worse. A better alternative would be to travel by train to Chandigarh or Kalka, then by a taxi to your hill destination. If Lalu Prasad does succeed in putting superfast trains on the tracks, Chandigarh will be an hours reach from Delhi (at present it takes three). But the future of tourist travel from the capital to hill resorts like Shimla, Manali, Kulu, Dalhousie, Kasauli, Nainital, Almora, Mussoorie and Ranikhet lies in helicopter taxi services. All these sylvan places will then be accessible by air in an hour. Entrepreneurs should be willing to stake their money on safe bets.        
	The Shivaliks have been my summer abode since I was a boy in school. I have been to Shimla, Mashobra, Naldera, Narkanda, but have stayed in Kasauli for the maximum number of times. I have special affection for Kasauli because my father built the Pasteur Institute there for making anti-rabies vaccines and for treating people bitten by mad dogs. In my younger days, as soon as you expressed an intention to visit Kasauli, someone was sure to ask you: Kyon? Pagal kuttey ne kaata hai?  why, have you been bitten by a mad dog? The Pasteur Institute has now grown into a mammoth building  an ugly pink edifice called the Central Research Institute. It overlooks Kasauli bazaar and is a veritable eyesore. However, when the institute had been in operation, it had produced various kinds of vaccines  against snakebite, smallpox or typhoid. It provided employment to some 700 locals at apprentice levels. The other permanent feature of Kasauli is the cantonment created by the British to prepare for war against Punjab after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839. Ever since, the bundobast of the town has been in the hands of the brigade commander.        
	What I saw in Kasauli on this last visit both gladdened my heart and filled it with sorrow. It was packed with visitors. The Upper Bazaar, which had a row of gunny sack kiosks held by bamboo sticks in which Tibetan refugees sold woolens and artefacts, had been made pukka, complete with neon lights. A barricade guarded by a sepoy had been put up to prevent people from driving up and down the hill roads, endangering the lives of people who like strolling along the flower-decked hillsides.         
	The story of the CRI is a sad one. A team from the World Health Organization inspected it and reported that its methods of preparing vaccines were outdated. As is his habit, the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, ordered it to cease operations. The future of hundreds of employees has been put into jeopardy as a result. Large stocks of vaccines worth crores of rupees lie rotting in the godowns. Many promises to use the CRI for different purposes or to modernize it have been floated around but so far nothing has come of them.                
	Fears in solitude                
	My pen-friend, J.M. Rishi, industrialist of Jalandhar, often fires salvos of thoughts. One of his pals remarked, with reference to nothing, Man came alone in the world, lives alone and dies alone. Rishi was touched by the words and in his turn, fired them off at me, accompanying them with a few appropriate couplets in Urdu about the loneliness of birth, life and death. At first, I too was impressed by the seeming profundity of the words. But when I examined them more closely, they did not amount to much beyond a feeling of desolation. Does a man come alone in the world? Yes, most do. But they are occasionally born in pairs (twins), threes (triplets), fours (quadruplets) and even fives (quintuplets). Does he live his life alone? No. He lives with his family, friends and colleagues. Does he die alone? Most do. But some die en masse, as in earthquakes, cyclones, plane crashes, rail and road accidents. So what remains of this poetic statement? It seems like the stock sob-stuff to me  No one loves me. It touches the heart, but not the brain.

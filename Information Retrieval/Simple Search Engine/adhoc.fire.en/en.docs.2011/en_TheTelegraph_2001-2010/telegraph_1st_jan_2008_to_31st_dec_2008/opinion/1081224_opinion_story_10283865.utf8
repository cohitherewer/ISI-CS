	It might have been expected that Satyams swift reversal of its decision to buy Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure, two companies employing the founders sons, would reassure investors; but there seems to be no end to public misgivings. That a rich mans sons should run ambitious enterprises is not surprising. That those got into trouble in these difficult times is understandable. That buying up enterprises in trouble can be good business would also be familiar to investors. What was not clear was that this purchase was a good bargain. So all that stuck in the publics mind was that the companies were the mainstay of B. Ramalinga Rajus sons; the smell of nepotism overpowered all other considerations. Maytas Infra, in which B. Teja Raju is vice-chairman, does public construction projects; recently, it has been taking on projects such as metro railways and airports in partnership with foreign firms. Maytas Properties, started by B. Rama Raju Junior, has 300 acres of land in a good location; it had plans to build an information technology special economic zone and, adjacent to it, a township. Neither business has been known to be poorly managed or in financial distress; both are likely to dip in the near future. But in the long run, they may not necessarily be bad bets. It all depends on the price at which they are available. On the details of the proposal to buy them, there has been virtually no information. The public was bound to assume that the sons were bad eggs running bad businesses. It is surprising that Mr Ramalinga Raju did nothing to bridge the information deficit.        
	This reticence may have something to do with Satyams contingent liabilities. It is facing litigation abroad. American courts are known to be extremely generous with awards for damages; Satyam may be in danger of a liquidity shortage should it lose suits. Maybe there is more to it than meets the eye. There have been reports of insiders selling Satyam shares. There may be an innocent explanation for this, for example, whoever foresaw the meltdown of the stock market would have sold, and some sellers may have simply needed the cash. But all these innocent explanations have been overwhelmed by the buttoned-up approach of the Satyam management to investors. It may be that Satyam is just another old-style, promoter-run company. But even promoters have to explain themselves to their investors. The sooner Mr Ramalinga Raju begins to do so, the better.

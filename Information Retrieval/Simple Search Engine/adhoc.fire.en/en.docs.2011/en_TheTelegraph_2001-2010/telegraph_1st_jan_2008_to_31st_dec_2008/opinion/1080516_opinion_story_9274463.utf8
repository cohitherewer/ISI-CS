	Modern urban India is a fake. It is unrooted. It is insecure. It lacks cultural confidence. All these are sweeping statements and therefore merit some explanation in order to recognize the reasons for much that is going wrong  why we are losing our social anchor, our inherent strengths, our confidence, as well as our ability to absorb what adds value to a changing reality by discarding all that is irrelevant to our socio-economic and cultural beliefs. Imitating a juvenile culture struggling to find itself makes no sense at all and is disturbing the foundation that protected India from the human turmoil of a bloody revolution.        
	The townships that are rising high on the periphery of Delhi, polluting the skyline, are all inferior, sub-standard copies of Middle Americas idea of a planned and gated community  settlements of town houses for the better off and condominiums for the rest! The utterly disconnected architectural faades, alien floor-tiles, sheets of glass that attract 40 degrees of heat into the home, are all wrong. When you enter one of these Beverly-Hill-type apartments, the smell of lasun and hing overwhelm you. Strange, fake Louis IV furniture is what you have to uncomfortably perch yourself upon, and then sit at a fake wood formica dining table and eat chapatis with a fork and knife on melaware plates!        
	Why not design and create townships with the tried-and-tested elements taken from the great havelis of India? Build around a courtyard, go up as many floors as permitted, grow a sacred grove of plants and sweet-smelling flowers in that common central space, enclosed, safe and private. Let there be a nursing home, a dispensary, a petrol station, a cyber caf, a provisions store, a laundry, a local tailor, plumber, carpenter, electrician, an open market selling fresh vegetables and fruit, cereals, daal, rice and all the essentials for our kitchens, as an intrinsic part of the settlement. That is how India once lived, and we need to replicate those tested cultural traditions in a contemporary context.                
	Distant lands        
	The best and the brightest in the West have begun to shed the styles and edifices that have failed them and their towns and cities, attributes that we, in a fast-transforming new world of the future, are shamelessly copying without foresight. We have become so deeply insecure about our legacy that we look away from our truths and function in completely sterile, alien environments. The anarchy that has invaded India stems from this unease within a detached habitat.         
	We are a warm-blooded people. Our cultures are akin to those of the Mediterranean countries, South American nations, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The architecture of these areas, the forms and structures, building materials, the use of indoor and outdoor spaces, gardens and groves, the cuisine, the spices, the fabric, their textures and colours, the music and dance, are all connected with Indian traditions. They are proud of their legacy, they enhance it, share it, and capitalize on it. Why do we mock our own?        
	As our rather stupid municipalities and State administrations seal commercial community activities in residential colonies, ban vendors and open markets, kill our traditions and our culture, my mind races to the open Rialto market in Venice, and to other, similar markets all over the great cities of Europe, in Rome, Bologna, Grasse and Nice, even in Bali and Bangkok, where the locals share their cultural pride with the visitors.         
	The acute lack of intelligence is palpable and frightening. To conserve and grow sensibly in an effort to participate effectively in a changing technological world, we need a different breed of leadership at all levels, ranging from local municipalities to the exalted cabinet that rules India from Delhi.

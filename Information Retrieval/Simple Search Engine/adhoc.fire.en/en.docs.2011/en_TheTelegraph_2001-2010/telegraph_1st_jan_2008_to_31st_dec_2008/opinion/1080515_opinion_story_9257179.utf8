	Stormy signals                  
	Sir  George W. Bush had announced a few months ago that the United States of America would tighten economic sanctions against the junta-ruled Myanmar. Now the same man is making a great show of sending relief to the cyclone-devastated country (US aid reaches Yangon, May 12). Bushs gesture is perhaps more a result of his attempt to improve his public image, which has been severely dented in recent times, than of his genuine desire to help the distressed people of Myanmar. Even the Western media  the BBC and CNN in particular  have gone overboard in trying to emphasize what a blunder the military regime has committed by refusing US aid. There is no harm in letting the junta handle the crisis on its own. If the regime aims for self-reliance, it should always be encouraged. At the same time, the world must assure Myanmar that it would be ready to help in case the need arises. The US is patting itself on its back for sending relief supplies halfway around the world. Unfortunately, when it comes to managing natural disasters in its own backyard, the US has come a cropper. Even today, years after Hurricane Katrina lashed New Orleans, many people have not been rehabilitated properly. The US should discard its holier-than-thou attitude and also refrain from poking its nose in the affairs of every other country.

	Sir  The unprecedented destruction unleashed in Myanmar by Cyclone Nargis would go down in history as one of the worst instances of natures fury. The cyclone has killed thousands and people are still dying of starvation and disease (Countless bodies float in Myanmar waters, May 12). The situation has been aggravated by the stubborn refusal of the ruling junta to accept foreign aid. Such obstinacy is foolhardy, especially when the junta has little or no capability to tackle the circumstances on its own. The attitude of the military leaders to cyclone-relief shows that they are indifferent towards the plight of the people. The hapless Myanmarese cannot be left at the mercy of an arrogant and insensitive regime. The United Nations must move in and help in the distribution of relief materials to the victims. The junta may disapprove of external aid, but it has no moral right to hinder the flow of relief to the victims.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar on May 3, and the country continues to suffer the aftermath even today. It is necessary to help the Myanmarese in every possible way at this juncture.India, being a neighbouring country, should try and expedite relief measures to Myanmar. Unfortunately, Indias response has often been tardy when it comes to helping neighbours in distress. Last year, when a cyclone ravaged Bangladesh, India did not have much to speak for its efforts in providing aid to the affected people. Such callousness would only rebound on India if it is struck by another tsunami or shaken by a powerful earthquake.

	Dirty job          
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a group of villagers stoned to death a dolphin in Lucknow when it was trying to flee the muddy waters of the Ganga (Dolphin fleeing Ganga filth killed, May 9). The death is doubly regrettable because Gangetic dolphins are an endangered species. Only 2,000 of them now survive in these waters. When the villagers saw the dolphin in the Sharda canal, they could have informed the forest department instead of killing the creature. It is useless to blame the villagers since they probably did not know that the dolphin is a harmless animal. It is good that the World Wide Fund for Nature is shooting a film on Gangetic dolphins at Katarnighat in Uttar Pradesh to spread awareness among villagers. Since the Indian government will never take the initiative to educate the common people on issues of conservation, private organizations might as well take up the responsibility.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Zeeshan Roohullah, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The killing of the Gangetic dolphin in Lucknow is not a stray incident. Dolphins are regularly killed in Uttar Pradesh and in Bihar, despite the fact that dolphins cause human beings no harm. One wonders whether it is pure bestiality or rustic ignorance that leads villagers to kill dolphins. Given the common attitude towards animals among the villagers of India, the lives of not only dolphins but of most wild creatures are under threat here.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Chakraborty, Naihati

                
	Sir  The death of the Gangetic dolphin brings two issues to the fore, both of which are equally alarming. First, it highlights how ignorant Indians still are about animals. They would stone an endangered animal to death rather than rescue it. Second, the death of the dolphin in the filthy waters shows just how far the Ganga has become polluted. We venerate the Ganga as a holy river and then dump wastes in it. All the projects to save the Ganga have come to a naught. They have only helped corrupt leaders fatten their pockets while the Ganga continues to flow as dirty as ever. Foreigners come and label the Ganga a soup of pollution and we sit doing nothing. Perhaps that day is not far off when not only all animals will disappear from India but the mighty Ganga will be silted up as well.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The street lights on Khanpur Road near Naktala have been kept switched on for a few days now. And this when there is supposedly an acute shortage of electricity in the state. I have informed the concerned authorities in the CESC of this negligence but no action has yet been taken. Perhaps the authorities are not taking notice because leaders do not usually travel by this route.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For better or for worse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE                                                                  
	Inconveniences in transport and accommodation had always been one of the occupational hazards of jatra actors. But now air-conditioned hotel rooms and cars are part of the establishments logistics  a result of the influx of actors from popular cinema. The overhauled system may have lent an urbanized gloss to jatra, but these facilities are meant only for the migrant celebrities, and for jatra icons such as Kakali Chowdhury, Tridib Ghosh and Jhuma Mukherjee.         
	The imported names have made the modest resources of the jatra companies lighter by lakhs of rupees in fees and exorbitant luxuries. Many of the companies are running at heavy losses. It was Swapan Kumar, the jatra legend, who first demanded habitable rooms and buses instead of the cowsheds and carts given to them earlier. But this was by way of asserting the respectability of jatra artists. The manifold enhancement of the same benefits, albeit for a selected class, has endangered the trade. The producers are now caught in a double bind. Prabir Sinha of Trinayani Opera, which boasts of being the second home of Indrani Halder and Victor Banerjee, recollects how a pala starring the jatra icon, Shekhar Ganguly, failed miserably two years ago because its cast had no filmstars.        
	The big names are well aware of their indispensability. In a bid to retain or poach them, some companies are willing to risk bankruptcy. The celebrities, who charge anything between Rs 20,000 to Rs 90,000 per show, get cars all to themselves. They occupy two or three air-conditioned rooms, a suburban equivalent of five-star suites. For Chiranjeet, Trinayani Opera once had to provide two AC cars, one of which went empty to the venue. Some celebrities demand cars to take them back to Calcutta after shows ending late in the night. Babul Chowdhury of Muktamanjuri makes a distinction between those who deserve to be pampered and those who do not, on something he calls jogyata (worthiness), which is no more than the actors ability to pull crowds.        
	A liberal budget for the exalted figures must be balanced by a proportionately paltry allowance for the junior artists. They are paid between Rs 200 and Rs 2,000 per show, and are made to stay in groups in dilapidated village school buildings or houses without electricity or lavatories, eat very basic meals, and travel by buses. These arrangements are made by the clubs that hire them, not by the troupe managers who are kept busy by the celebrities. Their make-up man, if the juniors are entitled to one, applies grimy cosmetics with frayed cloth and bristly brushes and stays with them in the same dormitory, as do the musicians and crew members  making it a family of artists and artisans that jatra had always cherished. Prashanta Goswami of Debanjali Opera gets emotional reminiscing about shows that turned into family-picnics. Such bonds are a thing of the past; now there are hierarchies and disparities. At the same time that the stars enjoy all possible luxury, hundreds of talented juniors have wages pending for months. Some of them fume and fret, but dare not protest, since the companies can easily replace them if they do not behave. If the companies fold up under financial pressure, it is the junior artists, and not the stars, who would be the worst hit, feels Goswami. Just as better amenities mark the superiority of the filmstars, jatra artists like Shankar Ganguly and Chandan Adhikary use the tales of deprivation to flaunt their genuine love for the art. Thus, it becomes a moral obligation for them to adjust to the inconveniences. After all, the stars who ask for the sky arent even aware of the true dignity of jatra.                     RIANKA ROY

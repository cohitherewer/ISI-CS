	Double speak                  
	Sir  The editorial, Wrong foot (June 12), rightly points out the contradiction between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cultured persona and his callous defence of police high-handedness. What is most striking about Bhattacharjee is the way he makes repeated declarations of repentance after every instance of wrong perpetrated by the police force and then does nothing to make the police change their ways. Be it Rizwanur Rahmans death or Nandigram, the chief ministers behaviour after the police atrocities seems to follow a definite model. His actions, however, are in keeping with the ideology of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  first kick the opponent and then say that it was unfortunate. I think it is time we called the chief ministers bluff and asked him why the police are repeatedly allowed to commit improprieties and what he has done to punish those responsible for the Jadavpur incident.           
	It needs to be noted that the police never misbehave with criminals or the CPI(M) cadre or the rich. The machismo of the police is reserved for the political opponents of the ruling party or the marginalized sections of society. This being the case, it is no use asking the chief minister what it is that makes the police force act in a highhanded manner time and again. Rather, we should ask what it is in the police force that makes it act as lackeys to the rich and the powerful time and again.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  How many times will the media forgive the chief minister of West Bengal? Probably they have surpassed the limit set by the gospel as to the number of times a trespasser may be forgiven  seventy times seven. The editorial, Wrong foot, seems to have been written to exonerate Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of his inaction yet again. Every time the police force, which comes under the home ministry headed by Bhattacharjee himself, does anything wrong, the chief minister first supports it and then regrets his decision. And the media tend to highlight his regret, which supposedly shows how humane and cultured he is. But isnt this next to impossible? These two words have rather novel meanings in the communist dictionary. Even though Bhattacharjee is saying now that the police did not do the right thing by raiding the house of students of Jadavpur University without a warrant, it is difficult to believe that the police act independently, without the prior knowledge of the ministry that controls them. The fact is that Bhattacharjee has given the police and the cadre of his party the power to do as they wish. He knows that all he has to do is put on the mask of a cultured man once the misdeed is done.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The harassment of a group of students from Jadavpur University is alarming. If the police start heckling people without a warrant, then it is evident that democracy is in peril in West Bengal. This is what happens when the police enjoy the patronage of the ruling party. Now we have to live in fear of being picked up by the police under any pretext because law and order have collapsed in the state.           
	The students apparently earned the ire of the police because of their suspected connections with the Maoists. The sudden anxiety of the police, and hence of the ruling party, over the Maoists is a direct fallout of the disastrous showing of the CPI(M) in the panchayat elections. Now the party is desperate to protect the red bastion from any other party or outfit that might pose a threat to it. But the witch-hunt for Maoists in West Bengal is only going to send the wrong signals by showing, once again, the dichotomy within the communist party. While the ruling Maoists of Nepal are welcome in West Bengal, the home-grown Maoists are not. Such double standards will distance the party even more from the already-aggrieved masses.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  For the past few days, we have been facing a lot of problems in travelling from Calcutta to Ranchi. The Howrah-Hatia Express is the only overnight train between these two cities. The only other alternative is the Shatabdi Express, which travels by day, costs more and hence is not always convenient for everyone. The Howrah-Hatia Express has always been quite dependable. But of late, the coaches of this train are being used for the East Coast Express, running between Howrah and Hyderabad. As the latter usually runs late, the Howrah-Hatia has been leaving Howrah at least 2-3 hours after the scheduled departure time. This is causing much inconvenience to the passengers. Since the train starts late, it also reaches Ranchi late. Instead of the scheduled arrival time of 6:50 am, the train enters Ranchi only at around 1 pm. As a result, office-goers miss a working day and students have to skip classes. Will the railway authorities look into the problem and make the train run on schedule again?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I am a Bengali living in Bangalore for many years and I always look forward to my sojourns back to Calcutta. However, my recent trip to the city of joy proved to be rather joyless. My family and I braved the blistering heat to go to Bhojohari Manna on Hindusthan Road for a typical Bengali lunch. I was delighted when the food arrived  along with phulko luchi, and chholar dal there was mochar ghonto, a dish which I long for in Bangalore. But my pleasure was short-lived, as the mochar ghonto was sour. It was replaced eventually but the waiter confessed that the ghonto had gone stale as it was kept in the open from the morning. I was stunned. It is unthinkable that such a reputed restaurant can be so indifferent as to serve its customers food that they know has gone bad. When the customers are paying through their nose for the meals, they certainly deserve better than this.           
	Yours faithfully,

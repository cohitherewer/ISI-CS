	It was through a haze of nostalgia that the Maitree Express ran between Dhaka and Calcutta on the first day of the Bengali calendar. Restoring broken ties after 43 years was bound to be a nostalgic affair. This is the first time since 1965 that a passenger train service between India and Bangladesh has been resumed. Meanwhile, pilgrims have been ferried across the border by cargo trains, but a full-fledged passenger service had been kept on hold for the last seven years. For this reason, the Maitree Express has been greeted with great public enthusiasm. This is not a simple diplomatic victory for India either. The Maitree Express, its name evoking friendship and trust, will vitally connect the two halves into which Bengal had been split during the partition in 1947. So the train will not only strengthen bilateral ties between two nations, but it will also reinforce the bond between two peoples of a common cultural origin, separated by an accident of history.        
	This sense of a return to the past, a revival of lost memories, lends a powerful emotional charge to the event. The Maitree Express has not just covered the 406 kilometres of railroad that separates Dhaka from Calcutta; it has also turned the dreams of many into reality. Yet, it is important not to be blinded by the euphoria, but to be unsentimental in confronting this reality. So far, India has been on politically even terms with Bangladesh. New Delhi would ideally like to see democracy established there, although it has reasons to be satisfied with the stability brought to Bangladesh by its army-backed interim government. Of more serious concern is a regional matter, and all the more dangerous for that reason. Illegal migration along the Bengal-Bangladesh border has for long been a problem without a solution. With the coming of the railroad, that problem is bound to become more pronounced, with a greater flow of people across the border. Such infiltration would have a serious effect on the demography of this area, and it would also increase the risk of Islamic terrorism along the border districts, which already have a high Muslim population. However, a new beginning should be cause for hope rather than just scepticism. With stringent security checks and tighter immigration laws, the Maitree Express could become the model on which a pan-South-Asian rail network  connecting India with its neighbours  could develop.

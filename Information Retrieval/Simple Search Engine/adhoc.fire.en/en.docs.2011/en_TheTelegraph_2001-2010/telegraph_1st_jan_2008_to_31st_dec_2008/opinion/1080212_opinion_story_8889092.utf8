The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | 
                                                                                                            THIS IS NOT A PRODIGY                                Aveek Sen                                          
	Sometimes, being put in ones place can be a wonderful relief. I had spent the first twenty-odd years of my life in Calcutta being told, with hyper-ventilating ardour, that I was a child prodigy. I had started playing the violin when I was six, gone through the eight mandatory Royal School exams with honours, taken a few awards at the School of Music annual concerts, played in local ensembles and orchestras. I somehow knew all along that I played quite badly. There used to be excellent concerts in those days, and we listened to enough Western classical music at home to realize that although I never played out of tune, I would never be able to get beyond dully correct performances of the easier Mozart and Beethoven sonatas. And attempting the Bach unaccompanied partitas in public, though I loved playing them in camera, would be the most ludicrous form of overreaching. Yet my parents, larger family, friends, teachers and other adorers wouldnt listen to me. The child prodigy label somehow stuck on, often making me feel frightfully bleak  and fake.        
	Then I went to study in England, and at my college freshers concert, where I played a bit of Mozart, my apprehensions were proved most splendidly, painfully right. The average English first-year undergraduate, scraping through violin lessons in school, played far more skilfully than I did, and better still, did not have to trail utterly false clouds of glory as I saw myself having to in Calcutta. Nobody made a big deal of their musical lives, and those who were really good went off to the best music schools and became stars. This also marked the happy ending of my violin-playing. Henceforth, I spent all my spare money and time listening to the best live music, and was relieved of the terrible burden of having to make worse-than-mediocre music for the undiscerningly affectionate delectation of my loved ones.         
	Paradoxically, it was when I gave up my violin-playing that my musical life truly began. I admit that listening to music has been enriched by my musical education. But I also wish I had spent more time in my childhood and adolescence learning to listen in a sensitive and informed way than learning to play with the fundamentals of technique absolutely, and soon irreparably, wrong. It would have been a different story, of course, if I had wanted to go off to Bombay, play for the films and make pots of money; or if I were happy churning out sub-classical schmaltz, pseudo-jazz or this-is-not-fusion.        
	So when talented young things, or their parents, come to me for advice, I tell them to steer clear of the violin, and take up the piano instead. There are a few piano teachers in India who can take them up to a reasonable level, after which, if they are still serious, they must flee abroad. Otherwise, they could learn for a bit of fun, although the first few years of the violin is not fun at all, for anybody concerned. And, most important: beware of people who love you more than they love music. To them you will always be a child prodigy.

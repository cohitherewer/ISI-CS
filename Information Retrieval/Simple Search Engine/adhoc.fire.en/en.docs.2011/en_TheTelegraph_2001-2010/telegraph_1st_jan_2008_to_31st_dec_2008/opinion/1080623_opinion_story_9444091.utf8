	Pakistans new government seems to be taking its first tentative steps towards establishing democracy not just in letter but also in spirit. The supreme court judges (including the chief justice, Iftikar Chaudhry), ousted by Pervez Musharraf last November, finally got their pay-cheques, with arrears for the last seven months, on June 10. The lawyers, fighting for the restoration of the deposed judges, claim that the payments were made under the Salaries Sanction Order, 2008, while the law ministry said that they were given from the prime ministers discretionary funds  which are to be disbursed only to the needy. If the lawyers are right, then this could be the first in a series of reparations promised by the Pakistan Peoples Party in the run-up to the February elections. As of now, Pakistan labours under the shadow of a token democracy, where the judiciary is still enmeshed in the executive. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, the PPPs main ally, has already distanced itself from the government because of the latters delay in reinstating the judges and declaring Mr Musharrafs presidency unconstitutional. The PML-N supports the government only on an issue-by-issue basis.         
	Politically, there are too many issues impeding a full-fledged democracy in Pakistan. The PML-N is keen on retaining power in Punjab, so it will not seriously challenge the PPPs dubious methods of restoring the judiciary. By paying the judges, the government has accepted them as rightful members of the apex court, but there is still uncertainty over the fate of the present supreme court bench established unconstitutionally by Mr Musharraf. Instead of making a fresh start by getting rid of Mr Musharraf and traces of his dictatorial regime, the PPP is planning to raise the number of supreme court judges  now fixed at 17  to 29 by passing an amendment as part of the finance bill this month. However tenable this looks on paper, such a mixed body, split by political rivalry and conflicting allegiances, is bound to come to loggerheads. If the government seriously wishes to honour the peoples mandate, it will have to stop trying to appease all and sundry.

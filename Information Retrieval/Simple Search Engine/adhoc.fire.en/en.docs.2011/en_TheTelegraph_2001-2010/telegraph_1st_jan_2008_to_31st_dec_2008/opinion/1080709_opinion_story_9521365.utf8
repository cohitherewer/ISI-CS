	The saying about the brevity of public memory may or may not be true, but it is certainly true of ministerial memory. It was just last month that the prime minister had advised his ministers not to go on trips overseas unless absolutely necessary. At the time, when the realities of the rising prices of fuel and growing inflation had just struck home, Manmohan Singhs request had appeared indubitably right, given that he was also advising cuts elsewhere, as for example, in government establishments. The nation may have been gratified to see how seriously ministers took this advice. Quite a few of them cancelled trips abroad, although most of the occasions were official. The ministers were using their discretion. Within a month, all that is history. The Union sports minister can now tell his near and dear ones that he was actually present at Roger Federer and Rafael Nadals classic encounter in the Wimbledon finals. It was apparently just coincidence that the match happened while M.S. Gill was in Britain, doing his duty by his people by meeting British officials and NRI organizations in the cause of Indian sport. That does not take away from the fact that the minister travelled abroad on public money, and was seen to be watching the Wimbledon mens finals. Coincidence or no, the visit to the game has taken on a symbolic load in the light of the prime ministers recent urging and the nations feeling of hard times.        
	Mr Gill is not alone. Arjun Singh and Kapil Sibal have found reasons necessary enough to fly out, Mr Sibal to inaugurate Indias first Arctic research station. Maybe it would have withered away and died had the science and technology minister not flown there to do the honours. Should the prime minister stop talking about austerity since his council of ministers forgets so quickly? Perhaps Mr Singhs directive can be delivered in a more memorable way. Instead of being couched as advice in a letter and a list of reported resolutions  fuel for government cars will be rationed, pre-election propaganda will be scaled down  measures for austerity should be formulated as strict policy. It is clear that the sense of morality and rightness is not enough to contain ministers and officials desire for pomp and foreign trips. If that is as far as expense-cutting measures can go, the prime minister need not have bothered to write his letter of advice at all.

	How to be a Brit                  
	Sir  Swapan Dasguptas critique of Great Britains decline into a nanny state is timely and accurate (Our Britain, their India, Jan 25). However, one feels that he need not have pulled his punches as much as he does while criticizing Britains post-war leadership. As an Anglophile myself, may I remind Dasgupta of the views of one of the greatest of our tribe, the late Nirad C. Chaudhuri, on the matter? Niradbabu lamented the British guilt at its imperial legacy and concluded that England does not deserve itself. As the British penchant for political correctness touches new highs (or lows), the Unknown Indian must be chuckling to himself wherever he is now.

	Books come last          
	Sir  Victor Banerjee has brilliantly outlined, in nine paragraphs spreading over four columns, the malaise of the Calcutta Book Fair (A fair quarrel, Feb 4). Our intellectuals have openly expressed their displeasure with the Calcutta high court and the army, and the government of the day has sided with them. But it is primarily the governments fault that it could not ready the Milan Mela grounds in time for the book fair. Why shove the blame on the keepers of the law and the Maidan? From the look of things, one feels that the ruling party might even make the book fair an election issue next year. One hopes that the sane voice of Banerjee will prevail over those spewing imported dogma.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Thanks to the judiciary and Victor Banerjee, we can hope that Bengal can be rescued from the hands of frenzied, self-propagating and visionless ideologues. The court has made sure that the law of the land is applied dispassionately and impartially to everyone. And Banerjee has shown the difference between right and wrong without being moralistic.          
	Our special thanks should go the spirited people in and around the Park Circus Maidan who dared to speak up against such heavyweights. This has not only saved them and the rest of the city from inconvenience and pollution, but has also given hope to those who have been facing such onslaughts on their freedom for a long time.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
S.S. Dasgupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  A fair quarrel was what we needed, and Victor Banerjee gave it to us  at a time when the book fair on the Maidan was being projected as the be-all and end-all of the life of Calcutta. There is a need to change this mindset. Other than the speed of light, there are very few things which are absolute in this universe, and the book fair on the Maidan is certainly not among them. Instead of wasting time on useless debates, the government should create a permanent fair ground right away, so that the next book fair can be held without a hitch.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Long ago when I was a student of a reputed boys school in Calcutta, I read Mark Twains story about the Prince and the Pauper. I can see the shadow of the story in the unfolding career of M.S. Dhoni. Those of us who follow Indian cricket closely from London, laugh at the Indian one-day skippers interviews. As a player, he has not achieved much, but talks big nevertheless. He should give fewer interviews and concentrate on getting runs on the board. And to those multinationals who pay him, I can only say this: let Dhoni perform on the field and then pay him. There is already too much money in Indian cricket, and it does not help players perform.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Chanchal Banerjee, Croydon, UK

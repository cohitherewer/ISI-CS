                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IDENTITY BLUES                                                    
	Belonging is always dodgy, and therefore impossible to define. It concerns a series of overlapping identities. One such identity is belonging to a particular country or a State. The proof of that identity is the possession of a passport. This document identifies an individual with a country and this is backed by the imprimatur of a State. This sign of belonging can easily be overlaid by other identities: for example, a passport-holder of Pakistan or India or any other country could owe allegiance to a transnational organization like al Qaida. This loyalty could even make such an individual work against the interests of the country to which he belongs by virtue of holding a passport. In fact, a passport for such an individual is nothing more than a convenient document to be used for travel when necessary to carry out acts of violence. Such situations produce a clear conflict between nationality and identity. This raises the thorny question about the identity of terrorists and about the assigning of responsibility for the actions of terrorists. The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, has described the only terrorist arrested after the attack on Mumbai as a stateless actor.        
	This description of an agent of terror is somewhat ambiguous, to say the least. The person concerned may not be identified as a Pakistani national as yet since a Pakistani passport has not been discovered on him. But the subject has confessed that he was born in Pakistan; what is even more important is that all evidence shows that the entire operation was conceived in Pakistan and masterminded from there. In fact, the boat carrying the terrorists sailed out of Karachi. This does not mean or imply that the Pakistan State was directly involved in either the planning or the execution of the terror unleashed on Mumbai. But it does mean that there exist in Pakistan centres for the training of militants who are brainwashed into dying for the cause. The Pakistan State, either through incompetence or intent, has failed to eradicate these camps and the terrorists. Thus the Pakistan State cannot absolve itself of responsibility even if the argument that the concerned actors are stateless is taken to be technically and theoretically valid. The Pakistan State, if it sees itself as being responsible, must forget the contentious questions of belonging and identity, and make itself an unqualified participant in the global war against terror.

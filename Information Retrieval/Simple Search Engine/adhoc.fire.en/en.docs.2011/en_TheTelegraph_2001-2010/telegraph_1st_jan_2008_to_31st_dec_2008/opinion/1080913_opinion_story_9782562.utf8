	Among the best treatments of raga Ahir Bhairav that I have heard live so far, was one in the late-Seventies by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. His elder son, Amaan Ali Khan, came reasonably close to him in his alap and gatkari in the same raga at a sarod recital at Kala Mandir on Sunday, August 31, organized by the Institute of Child Health to raise funds for its proposed thalassaemia foundation and blood bank.        
	In fact, the impressive array of lyrical phrases that sprung out endlessly from Amaans sarod, the permeation of melody of the same level in rhythmic patterns, taankari and rapid stroke-work seemed to suggest that Amaan is about to blossom into a maestro of the first order.         
	The sons Ahir Bhairav utilized the madhyam-dhaivat (or the fourth-sixth) axis just as the fathers had done in his memorable treatment. This endows the raga with a colour and scope not permitted by the usual sadaj-pancham (or the tonic-fifth) axis.         
	The two-and-a-half octave raga development in the alap connected most notes with small meends and brought in longer meends at appropriate points. This gave the rendition a song-like quality. The pancham, though not used as a halting point till just before the movement to the high tonic, was always used as a connecting note in most phrase clusters around it.        
	As in his recital at the Malhar Festival, Amaan dropped slower movements of the conventional jod and went off straight to medium tempo ekhara taans after the alap, and then to rapid strokes on single notes ending with long meends. This, in turn, developed into fast-medium taankari with ladant interludes. Finally, there were powerful high stroke density figures that led to the rupak tala gatkari centred on a composition by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.        
	The gatkari was very much a continuation of the spirit of the alap and featured mukhra elaboration, lad-lapet and taan-toda, which were rounded off with explosive tihais. The rupak tala gatkari ended with ladant in which there was a foray into 5/4th (or kuad) rhythms in a pancham-centred patch.         
	The drut teental gatkari was an occasion for complex ekhara taans and fast jhala. It was centred on two gats of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and the second one was of the anaghat variety, ending half a matra before the first beat. Amaan played around with this, transferring the landing a little after the first beat as well.        
	The final aochar and drut ektal and teental gatkari in Gurjari Todi was very much in the same class, with inspired raga evocation and virtuosity on an even keel. Anindo Chatterjees spirited tabla accompaniment contributed to the impact of the gatkari throughout the recital.

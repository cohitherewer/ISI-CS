The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A world without barriers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A WORLD WITHOUT BARRIERS                                  Fifth Column - Deep K.

	Yet together, these two men have deconstructed one of the great myths of our times: that the West has the capacity to develop the high technology, which defines modern living. In doing so, President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have erased the barriers that stymied the free flow of knowledge, and opened the flood-gates of high-technology commerce.        
	The Indo-US treaty is the second of the three great freedoms that the modernity project is attempting to realize. The first was the end of the Western dogma of mercantilism in general and bullionism in particular, which ended with Chinas re-entry into the global economy. This was a watershed not because China industrialized to become the worlds workshop, but because the West was able to break free of an old mentality and accept, to a degree, that trade is more productive than hoarding wealth and industry.         
	Even before the full effects of Chinas industrialization are felt, the approval for the nuclear deal will repeat those momentous changes in the arena of knowledge by permitting communication between technocrats, technologists and business people. The obstacles to the transmission of ideas and knowledge about high technologies and to the ability to re-process and apply them in innovative ways have been demolished. The consequences of easily accessible expertise will be felt far more rapidly than Chinas industrialization because while manufacturing demands building up a base, technology development requires labs and scientists that are abundant in India.                
	Huge difference         
	Critics of the agreement scarcely took note of its knowledge dimension. Instead, the debate coalesced around the twin issues of non-proliferation and the safety of nuclear power. Non-proliferation is a non-issue. India retains the right to test a nuclear weapon not because it wants to transfer technology but because India demands not Mutually Assured Destruction, but a minimal deterrent. Lacking the technology and data required for computer generated nuclear simulations which the five nuclear powers continue to use to develop their warheads, India insisted on retaining the right to develop new warheads.        
	Sceptics ask that if the goal is to create energy security for some of the worlds poorest nations, then why does the US not help India develop clean technologies? Because, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the total life-cycle greenhouse-gas emission per unit of electricity for nuclear power is similar to those for renewable energy sources, and because the energy requirements for providing the basic amenities of dignified life to the worlds poor cannot be met by renewable sources. Nuclear power, inevitably, becomes part of the equation.        
	The third great freedom underpinning modernity is the ability to move without hindrance. If an Indian can import knowledge and transfer his money without barriers, then why should his body be subject to oppressive immigration controls in the West? Bush and Singh have brought the world to the cusp of a profound economic and social change, but future generations have their work cut out for them.

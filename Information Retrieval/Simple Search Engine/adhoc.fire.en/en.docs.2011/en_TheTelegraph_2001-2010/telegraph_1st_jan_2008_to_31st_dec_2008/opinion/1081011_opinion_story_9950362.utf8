	In a year in which most exhibitions seemed to be weighed down by a dull, leaden quality, and curators, if any, did not seem to be much aware of their responsibilities, Aakriti Art Gallery had put up a rare exhibition of non-figurative works, titled Empty And Full (September 9-20), where the works were chosen with a lot of thought and care. The works of six artists, including some from Madhya Pradesh, were on display, and the absence of figures was never felt as the various registers and shades of colouring adequately made up for the lack of corporeal presence.         
	Earlier, a cold grey used to be the predominant colour in most of the canvases of Akhilesh from Bhopal. This is the Akhilesh that viewers in Calcutta are familiar with. He made no reference to the world we see around us but the canvases were tightly structured like light refracted by a prism. This time, Akhileshs frigid hues have given way to the brightest of colours like red, orange, maroon, green and yellow and also mellower browns and ochres. He turns his canvases into a multitude of kaleidoscopes, breaking their surfaces into innumerable squares with single arches in a contrasting shade within. The sameness of the squares is relieved by wide strokes of colour barely perceptible in the background. In another work, a wide swathe of dark brown turns the canvas into a dusky Milky Way patterned with tiny, veined squares. However, he is not so much concerned with evoking a certain mood or atmosphere. In all of Akhileshs works, one is struck by his strong design sense (picture).         
	The paintings of Manish Pushkale, also from Madhya Pradesh, on the other hand, quite clearly conjure up a crepuscular world where darkness easily merges with shadows. His paintings resemble palimpsests, insomuch as they are like several pieces of gauze layered over each other to create a complex patchwork of splintered light and shadow. He uses oil on canvas but his works look like he is experimenting with applique using pieces of gauze instead of cloth. Extending the textile metaphor, the painting turns into the canopy of a starless night sky.        
	The background of most of his paintings is blue, the blue of moonlit nights. Over that, he paints strips of light lemon yellow, ochre and indigo, permeated with the mysterious blue. In another work, a spectral bark seems to float through Stygian gloom. The forms are suggested and the viewer is free to use his imagination. Pushkales works have a haunting quality that makes them memorable. They could remind viewers of the works of Ganesh Pyne and Klee, but it must be admitted that this artist can stand out on his own.        
	Lemon yellow and pink burst softly on a field of ochre. A background of white is speckled with rust. Yogendra Tripathy makes limited use of colour in his low-key canvases. It requires technical skill of a high order to dab these shades with such finesse. They are sombre and contemplative works that need to be viewed with concentration. All these are works that are not recommended for people with short attention spans.         
	Sunil Des paintings seem to be inspired by archaeological finds, by stele and fragments of stone tablets closely inscribed with hieroglyphs or cryptograms and other scrawlings. De uses muted shades of grey and buff, colours associated with calm and pensiveness. But do Des canvases really rouse such feelings in the viewer? Some of his paintings seem a little too pat for their own good. At times, the perfection of the painted surfaces of Des canvases is tedium-inducing. They bring posters to mind, instead of paintings.        
	Archaeological finds and ancient civilizations resurface in Samindranath Majumdars paintings, once again in acres of grey. He often uses geometrical figures that sprout in a waste of sand. One is immediately reminded of a contemporary Indian master whose paintings had made waves in sale rooms a few years ago. This is a trick that this artist has been resorting to, ever since his works were exhibited first a couple of years ago and it has become a tired ploy.         
	Unlike the rather anaemic canvases of De and Majumdar, Amitava Dhars works look quite charged. He slashes his canvas with strokes of brown and creates fine grids of the same colour like mesh. It bristles with visual energy, and this makes it stand out from the rest of the works. He is the only one to use a bright tomato red that forms the background of one canvas, walled in on both sides. An excrescence, resembling a giant tentacle, sprouts from a wall and is laid to rest on a table-like surface. It may look suspiciously similar to the work of a British artist but at least he is quite different from the other two Calcutta artists.

	Ragging  like going to college or university  is an adult affair. It will, therefore, have to be treated as one. The National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad has expelled two of its students for committing this offence, while three others have been told to leave the hostel for indirect involvement. This is entirely in line with what the Supreme Court had directed the Central and state governments to ensure. In the countrys most prestigious institutions of higher education, the problem of ragging crops up more frequently than is expected of a modern democracy. The IITs, especially, have had to think up their own regime against this particular version of the abuse of power. Calcutta, too, will have to sit up to the seriousness of this offence, following recent incidents at Jadavpur University.        
	The problem with most authorities entrusted with the prevention of ragging is that it is difficult not to treat freshers, as well as their abusive seniors, as children. Most often, what is adopted is a kind of stern paternalism, as if ragging is a failure of what in schools is called discipline. Hence, one often gets to hear of offenders being scolded. Similarly, anti-ragging committees decide to segregate freshers from their seniors in hostels, first-years are not given off-periods in the morning during which they might roam the campus and be ragged, or are asked to leave the campus immediately after classes are over instead of loitering. But such measures undermine the very idea of a university and, ultimately, of responsible adulthood. It is not the duty of the authorities to shield students from the wages of freedom by restricting their movements and interaction. There should be a clear code of practice and punishment in place, defining what constitutes the offence of ragging and how, and by whom, it will be investigated and punished. A campus (hostels as well as public spaces, like canteens) becomes a safe haven for students  men and women  when laws and codes are clearly understood and communicated, and an effective infrastructure of basic security is kept in place. Students, teachers and other staff, as individuals and as members of committees and unions, will, of course, have to be aware and alert. But the solution could never lie in treating freshers like children. Young people come to university to become responsible adults, not protected victims.

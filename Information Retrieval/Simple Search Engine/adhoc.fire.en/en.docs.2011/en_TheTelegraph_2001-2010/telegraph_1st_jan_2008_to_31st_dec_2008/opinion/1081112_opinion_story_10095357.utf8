	To be named by the State as national river or classical language seems to have become the most important way of looking after or valuing natural or cultural resources in India. Recently, the Prime Ministers Office declared the naming of the Ganga as national river. From this elevation of status seemed to follow all other practical schemes for the actual conservation and purification of the river. The prospect of general elections made this look like a biased and rather mindless political move. The Kerala government is now pressing the Centre for another ritual of naming: Malayalam must be made a classical language. The reasons behind this demand are unabashedly political rather than philological. Tamil, Kannada and Telugu already have been made classical by the Centre, so why should Malayalam be left to feel discriminated against? The minister of education and cultural affairs in Kerala, M.A. Baby, is concerned about the inferiority complex this might create in the minds of people who speak a non-classical language.        
	This says more about what is going on in Mr Babys mind than in the minds of ordinary Malayalis, and it is unfortunate that he has taken it upon himself to speak for the latter. The elevation of a dialect to the status of a constitutionally recognized language makes some sense in actual terms, as with Bodo, Maithili, Dogri and Santhali, which are now part of the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. But the category of the classical language, especially when defined and fought over by the state and Central governments, gets absurdly divorced from the vital life of a language and of its users, and becomes yet another instance of regionalist tokenism or chauvinism. In 2004, the same government that has been appealed to now had declared Tamil a classical language, and this seems to have made little difference to its actual practice. Most would agree that Sanskrit being revered as Indias most classical language has hardly given it a new lease of life. No other government in the world has taken upon itself the declaration, after due political wrangling, of ancient Greek, Latin, Chinese, Persian or Arabic as classical languages, thus ensuring a sudden improvement in the quality of their study. Mr Baby and his peers must speak for themselves, even if in a classical tongue, when they invoke an inferiority complex that other Malayalis may not wish to identify themselves with politically.

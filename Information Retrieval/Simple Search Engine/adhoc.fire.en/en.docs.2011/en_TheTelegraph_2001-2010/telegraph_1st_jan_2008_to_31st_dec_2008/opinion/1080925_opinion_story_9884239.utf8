	As the Indian subcontinent reels under a series of terror attacks, perhaps what is more frightening than the images of mangled corpses and ripped automobiles are the cold, clinical minds that are behind them. The day, time and place of the attacks are so chosen as to cause the maximum panic. Typically, the venue is an urban hub  a railway station, a bazaar or a chowk  and the victims cut across castes and communities; they are the aam admi of metropolitan, middle-class India. The violence and its televised visuals evoke empathy: there is this visceral feeling of I-could-have-been-there. Even though more people die in our cities due to poor traffic management or lack of sanitation, the sense of frustration and panic is acute every time a blast takes place. The opposition parties never miss the chance to whip up waves of hysteria and then ride on them, especially when an election is round the corner.         
	The Delhi blasts have seen the replay of the same old pantomime. Although the Bharatiya Janata Party has been crying hoarse for some time for a tougher law to deal with terror, a recent comment by the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, has a wider connotation. On the face of it, though, it is deceptively inoffensive and casual: These (secular) parties can accept innocent citizens killed in thousands, he said at a rally in the capital on September 19 . But they cannot accept a few innocent persons arrested. Thats why they oppose tough laws.         
	His line of argument has found many takers as it reflects a popular middle class sentiment. The trick, however, lies at the level of perception. A member of the dominant urban community can instantly identify with the victims of terror, but can never see himself as among the few innocent persons falsely implicated in a terrorist attack. While one set of images (the bloodied footpaths, the screaming ambulances) is widely-publicized, the other set  the midnight knocks on the door, the non-bailable arrest warrants, the harrowing interrogations, the disappearances  remain invisible.         
	One crucial reason behind their invisibility is that these theatres of horror are played out within specific communities. The caste and communal identities of the innocent persons might vary according to the nature of crime, but the fact remains that a disturbingly large number of those detained unlawfully or killed in custody in our country are from the minority and backward communities.Thus Modis pert remark starts having grim resonances when one tries to see it in perspective.         
	The story of Indias growth has failed to include certain communities on the one hand and has been accompanied on the other by the persecution and stereotyping of those same communities by the state apparatus. Modis logic of protecting thousands at the expense of a few innocent persons is borrowed from the book of the so-called development lobby, which calls for the sacrifice of a few for the greater common good. But the logic loses its innocence when it turns out that, in our country, those unfortunate few are always from certain sections of the society.         
	Thus, disproportionately large sections of dam oustees, illegal detainees and exploited workers are tribals, Dalits and women respectively. Very often, these different categories collate and the discriminations are aggregated. A rural Dalit woman, for example, is more likely to be illiterate, malnourished and a victim of police harassment than her urban, upper caste counterpart. The overarching marker across all these categories is, of course, poverty.         
	The slums in our cities are often the centres of hidden apartheid. Be it Jamianagar or Tiljala, these ghettos are islands of discrimination and discontent in the urban landscape. They always appear in the news for the wrong reasons, whether as terrorist haunts or as centres of communal flare-ups. In November 2007, Calcutta saw such an outburst in the Park Circus area when hundreds of youth from the minority community took to the streets. The city administration had to call in the army. Perhaps it is a coincidence that just a few weeks back at that time, a youth from the same community had grabbed the headlines for being well, innocent. His name was Rizwanur Rahman. He was poor, a Muslim and a slum-dweller. To the city police, he was a criminal too, because he had carried  not guns  but love in his heart.         
	Perhaps Modi should spare a thought for men like Rizwanur the next time he speaks of a few innocent people. And rather than clamouring for tougher anti-terror laws, he would do well to pull down the walls, both real and metaphorical, that have come up along the mohullas of Ahmedabad and other cities in Gujarat.

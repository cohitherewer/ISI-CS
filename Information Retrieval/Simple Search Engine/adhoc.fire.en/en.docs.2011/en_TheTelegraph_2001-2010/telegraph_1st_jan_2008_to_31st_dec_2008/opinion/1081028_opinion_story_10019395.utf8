                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BRAVING ROUGH WEATHER                                  Westminster Gleanings - Anabel Loyd                          Whats the plan?                                        
	The floods in this country do not equate with the horrors in Bihar. Deaths here are relatively rare and a three-year-old child was saved last month when she was washed down a drain, through a hundred or so feet of pipe and into the local river where her father managed to rescue and resuscitate her. Still, to lose your house and your possessions is bad, whether you have a little or a lot, and the security of insurance policies here has long gone, as premiums rise to prohibitive levels in flood areas or are simply refused. People, often those least able to afford it  and few people, after all, can afford to lose everything  are being forced to abandon their homes altogether as no more than worthless bricks and mortar.         
	I regularly commend the providence that gave us a house on a hill, particularly as many of the most desirable houses in our part of the world are built to be picturesque, with gardens sloping gently down to the local chalk stream, now liable to turn into a raging torrent for some part of every year. The village just down the road has sandbags in the street and having dry floors and feet myself is some consolation for this year without a summer. The papers are searching for a silver lining; bad weather is good for great and gloomy literary endeavours and inspired Gothic masterpieces such as Frankenstein. Looking out of the window on another dismal day  that comes neither as a surprise nor an encouragement.              
	Truth be told, I have not helped myself. I escaped to India earlier in the summer, to the North-east where, of course, it was raining, and am now off again to Ethiopia where currently, it is raining. I am also craving a bit of sun and light after grey weeks in Scotland. The soft Scottish climate is well-known for producing a dour race and the prime minister is at his most dour as he hits his lowest point yet. The economy has not yet reached rock bottom but constant fuel-price rises throughout the summer have us looking forward to a cold and miserable winter when we can no longer afford our central heating, and a depressing diet of staples as food bills rise commensurately. Of course, we are blaming the government and most of all Gordon Brown who looks more unhappy by the day and seems unable to lead in any one clear direction. There is talk of Blairite plots at cabal barbecues; the former home secretary, Charles Clark, has again been demanding Browns departure. There is trade union agitation and demands for a return to old Labour values  always the last cry of the desperate, and unlikely to appeal to those who can barely remember what old Labour was meant to stand for. They should not pretend that it was only Tony Blair who changed things forever.        
	It must be a nice warm feeling to be in the shadow cabinet at the moment and maybe just to be a Conservative, basking in the sort of anticipation of power and glory that New Labour once did, but the great British public is a little less certain of David Cameron, in the wisdom of hindsight, than they were of Tony Blair. The truth is that the great body of voters, whether Labour or Conservative, really want the same things and, bar exceptions, want them achieved in a similar way. They want a thriving economy, reasonable taxes, a successful education policy and a good National Health Service. A few green policies in there make everyone feel he or she is doing his or her bit for the environment, but that is way down the list and unpopular when it involves the individual in greater cost or labour. It is going to take more than the evidence of global warming in a few wet summers for us all to be ready really to change our habits and be prepared to focus on alternative forms of energy to the oil we so expensively continue to crave.         
	The Labour conference may not have spelt the end for Brown, but it hasnt left left him in great ease either. Things started to go awry for him from the crest of his new prime ministerial wave this time last year when he threatened or promised a general election and failed to follow through. He has never really recovered from not making up his mind and his leadership looks up for grabs. Who, though, really wants or has the support to step into the breach? As what about the war? gets banished to the back of delegates minds, there is a growing nostalgia for the spark of Blair the man and the sparkle of his leadership but not again, methinks.         
	The Blair mantle is more likely to fall on new shoulders, the foreign secretary, David Milliband, the most plausible contender, although he is far from popular with the grassroots or with opposing parliamentary labour cliques. Indeed, anyone who sets his face publicly against Brown at the moment may meet with disfavour, whatever the desire for change at the top. Labour activists understand the dangers of a divided front and are plastering up the very public chasms in the party as fast as they can. Another change of leadership does not look good, and, as Andrew Rawnsley pointed out in The Observer, while Brown has no plan for his own revival, those who want to be rid of him have none for theirs either.               
	Gordon Brown has tried playing on public sympathy with a speech designed to point out his shared understanding of adversity: the death of his first baby at a few days old and the loss of his sight in one eye from a football injury. We were unimpressed by the gimmickry of the occasion, the first cabinet meeting outside London for donkeys years when the cabinet decided to get cosy with another area of the country, Birmingham, central city of the Midlands. We did not, to be honest, care that much about Browns adversity, we were all sorry for him at the time his baby died a few years ago and we arent sure that his eye is relevant to anything. We want to know what he is going to do for us, not that he is as miserable as he looks. The pointless short-term package of policies that are his current stock-in-trade is not what we expect of a man who we believe was at least a remarkable chancellor of the exchequer.         
	The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, has lately been undermining even that assumption with dark mutterings about the state of the books he hopes to inherit soon. But first things first, and this Labour conference can be said to have at least clarified the leadership of the party into the next election.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | dreams fall apart
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DREAMS FALL APART                                  malvika singh                              
	It hits you smack on the face when you drive through the many, once-sleepy, oversized villages, now bustling, bursting-at-the-seams towns, that this energetic, entrepreneurial and booming India is operating within a failed and useless administrative infrastructure. Himachal Pradesh is a stark example of a place where radical change is evident. Hoardings and banners announce the availability of flat-screen televisions. Shops selling sound-systems, home-theatres, music and DVDs confront you along every bazaar street. Refrigerators and airconditioners vie for attention where, not long ago, watercooler was the fast-selling product.        
	Then there are the household stores selling fancy bathroom tiles and fittings. Large slabs of marble and granite are stacked at road corners. Endless furniture shops, small malls, shoe shops selling branded footwear, cosmetic stores, pharmacies and more jostle for space with traditional goods and services.        
	However, the administration has lagged behind. There are open sewers along the main road, choked with refuse, never cleaned. Electric wires, entangled with satellite television cables create a jumbled mess overhead. Uncleared garbage grows in mountainous heaps with a foul stench polluting human habitats. Uniformed policemen hang about at crossings and rotaries, picking their nose, unconcerned about doing their assigned jobs.        
	Governance has let us down. Corruption has diseased us. Ineffective administration has strangled and suffocated us. Free, democratic India and its institutions have insulted us, exploited our patience, maimed and destroyed our culture and civilization, demeaned our strengths, spat on our local, municipal demands, and endorsed an insular civil service that cannot define service and is unable to extend it.                 
	Deliver, or else...        
	This large  national and regional  committee of government servants needs to be trained and compelled to deliver or face the humiliation of suspension. They have to be made accountable. Without a radical restructuring of the rules, systems and laws that govern life and living, and preserve dignity and integrity, Indias booming energy will fall prey to unchecked anarchy as individuals and collectives reach out to the sky to fulfil various aspirations.        
	If you put a private entrepreneur alongside a government babu, the difference in calibre becomes crystal clear. The babu oozes arrogance and a condescension that comes from guilt and ineptitude, knowing well that he is out of sync and belonging to a fast-dying breed of failed enforcers of the law. The babus represent all that is wrong, all that a new generation has to be warned against.         
	It is no longer the best and brightest who join government service but rather those who do not know what to do with their lives  average individuals looking to make quick, undeclared bucks, and lured by the perks and privileges of government service  who become civil servants. This is a sad but unspoken truth, because such a statement is deemed politically incorrect!        
	A corrective must begin and one way of starting the process is by ensuring that in every small town and village, private, non-government residents create self-help units that do kar seva for the immediate habitats and force the municipal officers to do their jobs. For this to happen, we need strong and severe pressure groups that eventually hold the elected representative responsible and, in a manner of speaking, to ransom  deliver, or else face the consequences of defeat and alienation.         
	Rotary clubs could lead the way. City elders could force the issue. Teachers could carry the brief. The young could be the foot-soldiers. India and Bharat could go through a renewal and rejuvenation to celebrate the great excitement and change that is overwhelming us all.

	Elections are a necessary condition for the functioning of a democracy. But the holding of elections cannot be taken as a sufficient condition for defining a polity as democratic. Many other conditions need to be fulfilled, and even the way the elections are conducted is an important signifier. Take the examples of two countries  Russia and Pakistan  where elections are new arrivals. Both have seen totalitarian regimes, and the transition to democratic processes is fraught with difficulties. In Russia, the presidential elections that have just concluded are best described as State-controlled, at worst Putin-controlled. Vladimir Putin, the outgoing president, ensured that his creature, Dmitri Medvedev, won the presidential race. This guaranteed that Mr Putin, who by the constitution is not entitled to hold power for a third term, will remain in power, albeit through remote control. To achieve this end, Mr Putin used the powers of the State to remove Garry Kasparov, his critic and potential rival, from the competition. Technically, an election has taken place in Russia, but it would be foolhardy to say that Russia has made the transition to being a democracy. In Pakistan too, elections have been held and the popular will has asserted itself. This, however, has not meant that the shadow of military dictatorship has disappeared from the politics of Pakistan. A former general remains the president and thereby retains the power to dismiss an elected government under some pretext. The triumph of democracy in Pakistan remains incomplete.        
	Democratic processes in Russia and Pakistan stand in sharp contrast to what is happening in the United States of America. The deep roots of democratic practice in the US are evident from the fact that the battle for the presidency is wide open. And if a Democrat candidate does occupy the Oval Office in the White House, it will be either a woman or a coloured man. There are no constraints on anyone rising to the top job of the worlds most powerful country. It is this openness to merit which is the hallmark of a democratic polity. Democracy in India also has many and obvious lacunae, but it cannot be denied that entry into it is open and has become increasingly so over the years. The rise of a leader like Mayavati illustrates the point. Polls have eradicated many years of accumulated prejudice. That is the power of democracy.

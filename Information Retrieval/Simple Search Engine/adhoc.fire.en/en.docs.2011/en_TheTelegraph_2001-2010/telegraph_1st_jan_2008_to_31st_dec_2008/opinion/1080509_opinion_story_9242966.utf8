	When Shri Bush and Kumari Condoleezza Rice talk about rising prices of food and pass the buck of their failure to grow enough food for the American people onto the growing middle classes of what were once-upon-a-time third world countries, they merely endorse the fact that India and China are no longer dependent but instead, economically powerful and making a strong, determined impact on the rich Western world led by the United States of America. The Iraq war has debilitated America and exposed its many warts  socio-economic and political. The last few years have shown up the leadership in the United States as being limited in historical assessments of the world and its diverse cultures, traditions and faiths, social and political movements.        
	The US has never bothered to comprehend the remarkable, inbuilt intellectual agility of ancient cultures and their ability to be patient, to adjust and shift gears, in an effort to deal with the onslaught of careless, strong-arm tactics. The arrogance of unipolar power has been the hallmark of Americas foreign policy and high-handed military initiatives have influenced and made an impact on the world through the better half of the last century till date. Its dogmatic leadership, unwilling to look at alternatives or hear other voices from different cultures, would require much historical and intellectual application to empower it to partner those rapidly changing, growing, hitherto poor countries, that are asserting themselves and competing for their rightful space in international relations. The exploitation of poor countries has to stop. The writing on the wall is crystal clear.                
	Image makeover         
	The US must begin to grow its own food, to take care of its internal requirements and stop exploiting other countries, depriving them. India must make agriculture a priority area, learn from the gross errors of the US, and thereby ensure that the basic needs are taken care of for the citizenry. The international bully must give way to future partnerships based on mutual understanding, give and take. For our politicians, anything they see as a put-down by America gives them a chance to hit out at the prime minister and the nuclear engagement. It is predictable, unintelligent and mere rabble-rousing. Leaders, if one can refer to them as such, should be proud and happy with the endorsement that our economic mobility is killing that of the United States!        
	The misuse of Parliament has reached unacceptable proportions with mindless men and women holding democracy to ransom. They do not seem to understand the destruction they are indulging in by this irresponsible behaviour. The horror on the streets, the rape and loot, the extortion and criminality all hold up the mirror to our representatives who conduct themselves in the most inappropriate manner that sets the worst possible example for the next generation. There was a time when Parliament was peopled by thinking, committed individuals, upright and kosher. The ugly face of India lay elsewhere. We could look up to our heroes and attempt to emulate them. Those National Democratic Alliance members should be asked to sit outside the class, with their fingers on their lips like school kids, till they participate sensibly and in a responsible way because they are being watched by a disturbed India.        
	Small wonder then that Amitabh Bachchan has a larger following compared to any political entity. He is intelligent and sensible when compared to Anbumani Ramadoss! Why are we allowing parochial thinking and regressive minds, to pull us down and bury us in static dos and donts? To bring to life the rotting root is truly tough  which is why our leaders speak out in this rather undemocratic, dictatorial fashion. We must, as a nation, protest this kind of diktat through passive non-cooperation.

                 MALA FIDE - Malvika SIngh
               
	Anything that doctors cannot diagnose or put their finger on, is passed off as a virus and first-time viruses are growing like wild, sometimes even poisonous, mushrooms. People are dying for no reason at all, except the lack of research into such strains of infection. Such infections are further aggravated by callous policy-makers who refuse to see the effects of pollution and climate change, and the dire consequences that will soon be upon us. 
    
	Our leaders are not concerned about the impending devastation of the planet. Nor are they able to think through the problem and codify a set of stringent rules that will allow their children and grandchildren to stay alive and enjoy a wholesome legacy  a legacy that these men and women should build. Their intellectual lethargy, their superficial knowledge about the environment, their inability to strategize and communicate the realities we are confronting, define the irresponsible governance that India is experiencing today.
    
	This lack of thought and control at the top manifests itself in terrible mistakes, such as the tribal rights bill being passed in its present form (by a voice-vote when other volatile matters were being debated), and in crime, such as doctors molesting patients, frequent rapes, thefts and murders, and the polices apathy towards victims and their collusion with criminals. 
    
	All this is evidence of a social breakdown. Our traditional systems of governance worked till the Hinglish-speaking babu, uneasy in his skin and tongue, made a mess of the code of conduct. We are suffering as a result of this 60 years of mismanagement. 
        
	Disaster ahead
    
	It is sad to think that, over six decades as an independent nation, we have been unable to set the basics in place  health, education and dignity of life and living. Today, with the issue of health inextricably linked with the degradation of the environment, earth, water and air  essential for the survival of all species  need to be conserved. That is the first priority for all governments, and those that neglect these resources will pay a heavy price, sooner than later. 
    
	Education is the second most important area of concern  a sphere that was usurped by the State and consistently destroyed. As a result, two pillars of civil society  health and environment, and education  desperately need attention and reconstruction if India is to rise out of poverty. No trickle-down effect will work in this case. The magnitude of the impending disaster is huge and mind-boggling, which is probably why no leader looks at it and addresses it with a sense of urgency. 
    
	This government could reactivate interest in itself and garner support, leading to possible votes in the next general elections, if it were to devote the next eighteen months to rectifying all that has gone wrong over the decades. If it were to take the risk of discarding, dramatically, all the failed procedures, of radically altering the wrong decisions of previous political dispensations, of weeding out the superficiality that has overwhelmed policy initiatives, of restoring strategy and commitment to the public domain, it might just manage to retain power in 2009. 
    
	If, on the other hand, it carries on with the status quo, putting forward the old and predictable people and policies, and if its leaders continue to operate like inferior potentates on the verge of falling off their shaky pedestals, the grand old party may be reduced to double digits in the Lok Sabha. 
    
	When you are at the bottom, you can take strong decisions to turn the tide, you can step out of the box that has contained and petrified you into a fossil, only to be studied in future centuries for academic reasons. The only means of survival is to reinvent yourself and take decisions and action that change history.

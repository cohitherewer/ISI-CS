                                                                                                                 BLOOD RITES                                                    
	Pakistan continues to follow the trail of blood that leads it to February 18, the reset date for the democratic elections. Since the suicide attack in Rawalpindi that took the life of the Pakistan Peoples Party leader, Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan has not seen mass rallies, except ones to mourn and remember the dead. Electioneering, in fact, never quite got off the ground, what with the PPP, the largest party in the fray, interned during the crucial time by its 40-day mourning period. Whatever little is on show has been marred by repeated bombings and suicide attacks that seem to claim lives on a routine basis. Incidentally, most of the violence, perpetrated allegedly by extremists, has been targeted at the opposition parties, killing political workers and driving down the attendance at rallies. Strangely, the campaign of vote-seekers belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League (Q), which lords the interim and district governments, and the Muttahida Quami Movement, the chief ally of the government, has not been struck by a similar malaise. With healthy support, and, expectedly, protection, from the administration, they continue to make brave attempts at luring popular affection during their tours in armoured cars and helicopters. Acutely aware of President Pervez Musharrafs unpopularity, they make as little mention of him as possible. The president, however, given that the elections are entirely about him, remains a looming shadow over the goings-on. A parliament not within the grip of the PML(Q) would make him susceptible to impeachment. And that possibility is difficult to write off despite the show of invincibility at international fora or the apparent willingness of the PPP, the frontrunner in the electoral race, to break bread with the enemy.        
	The muted run-up to the elections, however, is not an indication of its lack of appeal to the popular imagination. Unlike any other election in Pakistans recent history, the February 18 democratic exercise in the country holds tremendous importance for its civil society. It is a culmination of a long fight that has changed the rules of the political game, re-emphasized the sanctity of the constitution, compelled the authorities to lend an ear to popular aspirations and forced the army to change tack. The electoral campaign may follow feudal lines of command, the government that emerges after the elections may not be too different, but for the people of Pakistan something has changed inexorably.

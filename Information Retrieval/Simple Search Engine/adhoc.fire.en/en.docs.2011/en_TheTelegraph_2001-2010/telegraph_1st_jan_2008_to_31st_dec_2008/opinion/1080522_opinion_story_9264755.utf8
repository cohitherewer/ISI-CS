                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A FOUL WIND BLOWS                                  Fifth Column - Gwynne Dyer                              
	The Myanmarese regime is not to blame for the powerful cyclone that struck the Irrawaddy delta and Yangon early this month, killing over an estimated 200,000 people. But it certainly will be to blame for the next wave of deaths if aid does not reach the survivors soon.        
	Which sane government would block the entry of foreigners bringing the kind of help that is needed  from people whose professional lives are devoted to disaster relief  when at least a tenth of the countrys people are living in the open, with little access to food or clean water? The short answer is that the generals who rule Myanmar are ill-educated, superstitious, fearful men whose first priority is protecting their power and their privileges.        
	They almost lost both during the popular demonstrations that were led by Buddhist monks last year, and they are terrified that letting large numbers of foreigners in now might destabilize the situation again. They are sitting atop a volcano, and they know it.        
	This begs the question: why has Myanmar fallen into the hands of people like that for four and a half decades? Thailand has the occasional short-lived military coup, Indonesia had its problems with Sukarno and Suharto, and Cambodia had the horrors of Year Zero, but no other country in the region has been misgoverned so badly for so long.        
	It seems incredible now, when neighbouring Thailand has four times Myanmars per capita income, that at independence in 1948 , Myanmar was the richest country in south-east Asia. With huge resources, a high literacy rate, and good infrastructure (due to the British empires obsession with railways and irrigation projects), it seemed fated to succeed. Instead it has drifted steadily downwards, and is now the poorest country in the region.        
	The problem is the army, obviously, but why is the army such a problem? Perhaps it is the legacy of the Thirty Comrades. Rarely has such a small group of people dominated a whole countrys history for so long.                
	Corrupt comrades        
	The Thirty Comrades were a group of young Burmese students (average age 24) who went abroad in early 1941 to seek military training so they could come home and launch a rebellion against British rule. Their original intention was to get training from the Chinese Communists. However, by chance, they fell in with the Japanese instead.        
	They returned under the wing of the Japanese invaders at the end of the year as the Myanmar Independence Army, but switched sides in 1944 when it became clear that the Japanese would lose the war.         
	It was this army, that seized power in 1962 and has ruled Myanmar ever since. The last of the Thirty Comrades, Ne Win, only retired in 1988, and continued to exercise great influence from behind the scenes until only ten years ago.        
	Whatever ideology the army once had is long gone, and it has become so corrupt that Myanmar now ties with Somalia for last place on Transparency Internationals corruption index. The country exists merely to serve its armed forces, which have never shown any hesitation in shooting citizens who question their right to rule.        
	Its commanders are fully aware that most Myanmarese hate their rulers. Even if another million-and-a-half lives depend on the rapid delivery of emergency aid to the desperate survivors in the delta, the army will restrict the entry of foreign-aid personnel as long as it can resist the international pressure to let them in.        
	Hundreds are probably dying each hour who could be saved if the food, shelter, water- purification equipment and medical teams could pour in as they usually do after a disaster, but the army is half-a-million strong, so nobody is going to fight their way in. The Myanmarese, as usual, are on their own.

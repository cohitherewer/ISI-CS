                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NEIGHBOURHOOD WORRIES AND HOPES                                  NEXT STEP      The second phase of Indias Look East policy gives importance to security concerns                                                  
	At long last on August 28, India and the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations concluded negotiations on a free trade pact in merchandise goods that will pave the way for a free trade area of over 1.5 billion people by 2016.The formal free trade agreement will be signed at the Asean-India summit in Bangkok in December.         
	It has taken nearly six years for the two sides to conclude the negotiations. The talks tripped several times over issues such as rules of origin and market opening by India for sensitive agricultural products. Under the pact India and Asean will eliminate import duties on 71 per cent of the products by December 31, 2012 and another nine per cent by 2015. The import tariff on sensitive items, now in the range of eight to 10 per cent, would be lowered to five per cent by 2015. India and Asean will also negotiate trade in services and investment as a single undertaking as soon as possible. The objective is to introduce a comprehensive Asean-India economic cooperation agreement, including goods, services and investment, by the end of 2009.        
	Asean forms the core of Indias Look East Policy initiated during the prime ministership of P.V. Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s. The policy has been pursued vigorously by successive governments, giving importance as much to economic interests as to national security and strategic imperatives. South-east Asian leaders too have acknowledged Indias strategic footprint in the Asia-Pacific region and want India to play a larger, meaningful and stabilizing role here. India is certainly among the countries Asean would like to reach out to.         
	For Indias own peace, security, stability and development in its neighbourhood, the Asean and the Indian Ocean region are strategically important. The potential benefits of a closer Asean-India relationship go beyond economics. Indias accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with south-east Asia and the agreement on combating terrorism mark a shift from trade and investment to wider economic and security issues, including joint efforts to protect the sea-lanes to ensure energy supply lines and coordination on counter-terrorism activities.         
	The Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation and the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation have already marked the success of the Look East policy. India has also been made a member of the East Asia Summit, a meeting since 2005 of the heads of state (or government) of China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the 10 member-states of Asean.         
	The second phase of the Look East policy is characterized by an expanded definition of East extending from Australia to China, but with Asean still as its core. The other feature is the shift from exclusive focus on economic issues to a broader agenda involving security cooperation. Indias defence contacts have widened to include Japan, South Korea and China.         
	The Northeast naturally figures prominently in the policy. The key concern here is the development of the region and its promotion as the gateway to east and south-east Asia.         
	It has been said that Look East is not yet a policy, but a mere approach. Questions have also been raised about its prospects. Be that as it may, it is undeniable that India stands to gain, not lose, by strengthening economic links with the Asean countries. Bilateral trade, albeit still below potential, is growing rapidly. The target of $30 billion, set for 2007, has been achieved. India has now set up an ambitious bilateral trade target of $50 billion for 2010. Free trade agreement with Asean would be a big step forward in Indias engagement with the region.

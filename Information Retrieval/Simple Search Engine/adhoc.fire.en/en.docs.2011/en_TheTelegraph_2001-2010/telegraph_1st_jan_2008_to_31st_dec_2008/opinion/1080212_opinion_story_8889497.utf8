                                                                                                              TEEING OFF                                                    
	From caddie to champion is as rare an occurrence in sports as the journey from the log cabin to the White House is in politics. In India such a phenomenon is even rarer since there have been so few champions in the world of sports. The triumph of Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia is thus as special as it is poignant. Mr Chowrasias father used to look after the course in the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Young Mr Chowrasia thus took to golf as a fish takes to water. But golf is the proverbial rich mans game. He had to struggle against material and social odds to excel in the game that had captured both his imagination and his entire being. In his early days, he could have access to the greens only after the members of the RCGC had finished playing; he often had to practise his putting at twilight by candlelight. His spirit, however, was indomitable, and he realized that there was no primrose path to success. Fortunately for Mr Chowrasia, there were people around in the club that was his second home who recognized his prodigious talent and decided to nurture it. That nurturing, and of course, Mr Chowrasias talent and hard work have made him the champion that he is today.        
	This young golfers life and career teach some obvious lessons. Some of these are so evident that they are often forgotten. Mr Chowrasias career reiterates the point that success has only one mother: hard work. There can be no calculation of the number of hours Mr Chowrasia has spent driving, chipping and putting on the RCGC course. This dedication is at the root of Mr Chowrasias innate humility. He knows he was not born with a silver club in his hands. Success also has many snares. Trophies bring with them various allurements. Mr Chowrasia has to keep his head on and off the field. This in the glamorous world of sports is easier said than done. The many congratulations that Mr Chowrasia is receiving all come with a warning tag. India expects Mr Chowrasia to always play below par.

	Flagging care
         
	Sir  It is usually observed that after Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations are over, miniature plastic flags are strewn in the streets and thrown in garbage cans, while pedestrians trample over them. The authorities should ban these mini-flags immediately. Or, school students, NCC cadets, boy scouts and girl guides should be assigned the task of collecting used flags and disposing of them with respect. If children are not taught to maintain the dignity of the national flag, they too will grow up and step all over discarded flags without even noticing.

	Ace of yore
 
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas Recalling a touch artist ((Jan 19) took me back to mid-1959, when I was a 12-year-old. The touch artist, Ramanathan Krishnan, had just won the London Grass Court Championship, beating Alex Olmedo and Neale Fraser en route to the finals. Wimbledon began within a week; though Krishnan was unseeded, an encore was expected. But he lost in the third round to Olmedo, who went on to win the title. Those days, there were no ATP rankings, but Jack Kramers world ranking of non-professionals had high credibility, and Krishnan was ranked third in it. In 1960 and 1961, he reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, losing to Neale Fraser and Rod Laver respectively, the ultimate winners in the two championships. He was seeded seventh in one of those two years, I remember. 
     
	Like Guha, I too feel that Krishnan was a great sporting hero who brought Indias name to the forefront of world sports. But unlike Guha, Sports amp; Pastime was not enough for me. The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture had come up at the time near Gol Park, and its reading library allowed free entry even to schoolboys like me. There, I would scour The Times, London to see what the British scribes had written about the Indian. We are yet to see the like of him. 
     
	True, the thrilling Davis Cup tie with Brazil that Guha talks about was not televised. But I remember seeing glimpses of it in the Indian News Reel that used to precede films in Calcutta theatres those days. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While reading about Ramanathan Krishnans victory over Thomas Koch in the Davis Cup, I wondered where Ramachandra Guha got the bit that when the next morning the match resumed...the galleries were empty more or less. Shockingly, he attributes the sparse attendance to the day being a working day. When did this ever stop Calcuttans from watching a sporting event of consequence ? If he knows any tennis enthusiast in this city who is at least a decade older than him, he or she would tell him that South Club was packed like sardines and the crowd behaviour resembled that of football fans. Apart from the heavenly tennis Krishnan played that day, the memory of people in formal officewear shouting themselves hoarse in urging Krishnan on will remain with me. And I didnt return to my office after the victory. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Chimp talk
     
	Sir  I was deeply moved by the photograph of Babu, the chimpanzee at the Alipore zoo in The Telegraph on Jan 24. I saw his antics on television too. From his gestures, I felt that he was trying to convey that if the gazing public threw large boulders (instead of the small stones that they were throwing), he could make his way across them to freedom. The chimpanzee, after all, is closest to humans in terms of development of intelligence. They deserve better treatment in captivity.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Kartic Krishnan, Salkia

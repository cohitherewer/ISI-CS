	Demolition woman                  
	Sir  The unwarranted demonstration by the Trinamul Congress against the small-car factory in Singur forced Ratan Tata to abandon the project. The Trinamul Congresss opposition will prove to be costly for Mamata Banerjee and her party (Historic Blunder Two Oct 6). It appears that Banerjee got carried away by the recent panchayat polls in which her party made some significant gains in East Midnapore. The situation in East Midnapore, however, was totally different from that in Singur but Banerjee seems to have failed to grasp this. The loss of the Nano factory will have an adverse effect on Bengals industrial future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is said that when the going gets a tough, the tough get going. Unfortunately, Mamata Banerjee isnt a tough cookie and is now showing signs of a breakdown. But then Banerjees conduct and her politics have seldom been normal. By forcing the Tatas to leave Singur, she has acted in an irresponsible manner, jeopardizing the lives and happiness of countless people. After the festivities are over, Bengalis will suddenly wake up and find that the damage wrought by politicians like Banerjee is irreparable.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Aloke Ranjan Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  History will not be kind to Mamata Banerjee for compelling the Tatas to move out of Bengal. The Trinamul Congress leader has described Ratan Tatas departure as a victory for Ma (mother), Mati (land), and Manush (people). Once the forthcoming elections are over, she will realize that this was no victory at all. Banerjee has considerably damaged the future of farmers whose champion she claims to be. Thanks to her mindless agitation, Banerjee will now be hard pressed to keep her own seat in Parliament in the next elections.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The governments, both at state and at the Centre, are either myopic or only sympathetic to big business. If all the agricultural land is used for industrial or urban development, what will the burgeoning masses survive on? An ethical business house like the Tatas would have surely turned around Bengals business environment. Instead, we are now left with a ranting Mamata Banerjee who isnt capable of creating jobs in the state.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilip Mahanty, Sydney, Australia 

                
	Sir  With the death of Singurs Nano project, the industrial clock of Bengal has been set back by several hours. Mamata Banerjee seems to be made of harder stuff than steel. Her ceaseless dharna, which proved to be the undoing of the prized Nano project, has cost the people of Bengal dearly. Banerjees support base, even in urban pockets, is likely to be eroded because voters will punish her in the coming elections.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Bengal has been shamed by the antics of Mamata Banerjee. Her erratic politics has dented the states image all over the world. Bengalis in other states are being taunted for belonging to a land known for regressive politics. In one clean sweep, Banerjee has killed off the hopes of a resurgent Bengal. Never again will any industrialist think of setting foot in this beleaguered state. Even the Communist Party of India (Marxist) which never shies away from talking and acting tough chose to be a mute spectator in the Singur episode, enabling Banerjee to call the shots. The people of Bengal must now give a fitting reply to Banerjee and her party through the vote to deter them from acting irresponsibly in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajeeb Ghosh, Pune

                
	Sir  It is indeed sad that Bengal has the Trinamul Congress as the main opposition party in the state legislature. Mamata Banerjee, who leads this political outfit, can only be described as a rabble-rouser and a self-serving politician. She has brought Bengal on the brink of disaster on account of her petty politics. We have seen Singurs farmers demanding the Tata factory on television. Does Banerjee really know whom she is fighting for? She is an opportunist who is quick to spot an opportunity to hog the limelight. It would have been better had she joined a reality show and spared Bengal of a ruinous future.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kshama Agarwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial, Exit, pursued by politics (Oct 4), has correctly observed that Mamata Banerjee has hoist Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with a petard the CPI(M) made. The CPI(M) has no reason to blame Banerjee for the Nano debacle. Instead, it should be proud of her. After all, she seems to be a perfect specimen from the School of Business Disruption that has been created and nursed by the Leftists.           
	Jyoti Basu was the honorary principal of this hallowed institution and the muscle-flexing cadre its students. It is the CPI(M) that has introduced terms such as bandh, dharna and gherao in Bengals political lexicon. The communists have practised these forms of street activism to perfection over the last thirty years and it is evident that very little has changed. Through her Singur agitation, Banerjee has simply presented a mirror in face of the communists for them to view the horror that they assiduously created in this state. If the CPI(M)-led government is serious about industrializing Bengal, there is plenty to do. It can begin by eliminating bandhs and militant trade unions, and creating an enabling environment where the rule of law is supreme. The state government should also revive closed industrial units and take steps to feed Bengals starving masses. The results will benefit the state immensely.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

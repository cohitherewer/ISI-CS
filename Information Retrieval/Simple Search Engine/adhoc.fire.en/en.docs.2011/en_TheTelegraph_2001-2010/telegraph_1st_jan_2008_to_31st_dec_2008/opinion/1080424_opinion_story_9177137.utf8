	According to Military Balance 2008, the Indian armed forces employ 12,88,000 men. The army has 11,00,000 soldiers, while the numbers in the navy, air force and coastguard are 55,000, 1,25,000 and 8,000 respectively. Add to these the 12,00,586 personnel in the paramilitary and the final number in the workforce comes to 24,88,586 . The strength of those employed with the Indian federal government is reported to be 56,00,000. Thus, the men in uniform constitutes 45 per cent of the total number of employees.         
	The army, despite a shortage in the officer rank, has 40,000 men to lead the ground forces. Today, however, the entire lot as well as the soldiers are reportedly unhappy with the proposed hike in their pay and their perks. If this is true, it is indeed a cause of concern, and the issue needs to be examined seriously.         
	To understand the reasons for the discontent, one has to take into account the harsh conditions that Indian soldiers are forced to put up with. Here, one is referring to the jawans, and not to the senior or commissioned officers simply because the latter possess the wherewithals to address their grievances. Those serving in the lowest rungs have to just grin and bear adversities.                 
	Hard life        
	Life in the armed forces demands extreme endurance on the part of soldiers. The stint can often be fatal  because of the rigours of camp life and deployment in harsh, hot and humid terrain. If a soldier serves with the Desert Division in Jodhpur, and is expected to be battle-ready for 11 months, he would surely be subjected to sub-zero temperatures, blistering heat and venomous creatures in the desert.         
	After this, he could be moved to the mountains and jungles  in the Northeast, for instance, for counter-insurgency operations. This could be followed by a spell under the Northern Command in Kargil and Doda to combat militants supported by Pakistan. In Siachen, Indian soldiers face biting cold and have to operate in a barren terrain. If an armyman were to retire prematurely on account of injury, how would he be able to support himself and his family for the rest of his life with such meagre payment?         
	In this context, it is perhaps instructive to look at what the chief of the general staff of the British army, Richard Dannatt, said when he was asked whether a take-home pay of 1,150 was sufficient for a months fighting in the Helmand province of Afghanistan. In a poignant reference to the soldiers plight, he answered  If we had a hand in damaging them, then we are responsible for them.                 
	Serve them well        
	Dannatt had more to say on the matter. Iraq may be an unpopular war now and Afghanistan may be misunderstood war, but the soldiers, sailors and airmen who are conducting those operations, are doing their duty to their best ability. Dannatt concluded by stating that the Army wont let the nation down, but I dont want the nation to let the Army down.         
	Today, the people of India need to extend the same kind of support to the armed forces in the country. The issue of better payment is not merely about penury. It is also about a soldiers self-respect, honour and dignity. The juniormost soldiers could be looked after better by the people for whom they lay down their lives.         
	Their superiors, who are prone to condescension and have also been known to misappropriate funds meant for the men, should also look after these men who operate in difficult and dangerous areas. The jawans of the Indian army deserve to be treated well, considering the fact that things have change for the better in the nations economy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reasons for the debacle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       REASONS FOR THE DEBACLE                                  Fifth Column -Sumanta Sen                              
	It will perhaps be a little too simplistic to attribute the reversals faced by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the panchayat polls solely to the firing in Nandigram, the resultant deaths and the sweeping anti-Left feelings the incident generated. If that had indeed been the case, the Marxists and their allies would not have still emerged as the winner in 13 of the 17 zilla parishads. If police firing in Nandigram had antagonized voters, then the same should have happened in Cooch Behar where five Forward Bloc supporters had fallen to bullets in February. Nor can the dismal results be interpreted as a response to the governments policy of industrialization. The Left won resounding victories in Burdwan, Bankura, West Midnapore and Purulia  districts where the governments industrialization drive is causing huge factories to come up.         
	So what happened in Nandigram? The answer perhaps is that the Marxists unwittingly fell into a trap that had been laid for them by the Opposition, which created a fear of land acquisition among the villagers, built up armed resistance to thwart attacks, and then prayed for the attack to come. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party ought to have realized the game plan but did not. The police attacked, deaths followed and Nandigram was projected as an example of Marxist atrocity on poor peasants. No real move had been made to take over land there, but the word went around that the Marxists had killed villagers who had tried to protect their small holdings from land sharks.        
	The Marxists might have been able to pull things back even after this had they not set foot in the trap yet again. The local partymen decided to liberate Nandigram and was given the nod by the state leaders. Clashes followed and the cry against Marxist atrocities was heard yet again. And the outcry did not die down, was not allowed to die down, till the polling date. The entire East Midnapore district threw out the hammer and sickle.                
	Pyrrhic victory        
	Why did the Marxists make such glaring mistakes? Because the Left, both in Calcutta and at the panchayat level, had lost sight of the fact that East Midnapore was not Burdwan, it was by no means a red stronghold. In undivided Midnapore, the eastern part was the area where anti-Left forces had always been strong. This fact, in itself, could not have been unknown to the leadership but it thought that the anger that had built up over a rumour of land acquisition would not last long and even if it did, a show of strength, accompanied by the chief ministers assurance of no industry in Nandigram, would be enough. It overlooked the fact that the anger was not spontaneous; it had been organized with a definite goal in mind. These failures on the part of the Marxists actually helped their opponents.         
	The loss of the zilla parishad in the South 24-Parganas, a narrow win in the North 24-Parganas, and major reverses in the lower tiers can also be explained by factionalism within the Front. In the two 24-Parganas, sections of the local leadership were not comfortable with the idea of giving over farm land for industries. At party conclaves, they dutifully supported the industrial policy but the slogan they had grown up with  down with the Tatas and Birlas continued to echo in their hearts.         
	So what lies ahead? It is too early to predict but it does seem that the plans for a chemical hub at Nayachar or a ship-building yard at Geonkhali will be met with uncertainty as the Trinamul Congress cannot afford to be seen as pro-industry. With no new problems to bother it, East Midnapore may soon find itself falling by the wayside. If that happens, and the possibilities are real, then the TMC and its allies will realize that they have had only a pyrrhic victory.

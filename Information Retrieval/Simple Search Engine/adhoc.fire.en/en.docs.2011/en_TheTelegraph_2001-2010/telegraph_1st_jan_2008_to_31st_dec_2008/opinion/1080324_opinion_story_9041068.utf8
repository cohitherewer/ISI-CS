                                                                                                                 SHARE TROUBLE                                                    
	There are shareholders, and there are income-taxpayers. The two are not the same. A pensioner may hold a few shares to supplement his income; his total income may be below the tax limit. A jeweller may have his entire income in cash, and may invest his savings in property. He may pay millions in tax without owning a single share. If somebodys income exceeds the tax limit, it is for the income tax department to catch him.         
	On April 1, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Board of India made it compulsory for holders of dematerialized shareholding accounts to get a permanent account number issued by the income tax department, and to disclose it to their share depository. Shareholding has nothing to do with being liable to income tax. But Sebi is a loyal daughter of the finance ministry; it jumped to do what was bidden. Many shareholders did not furnish their PANs. Some had applied to the Central Board of Direct Taxes and received no answer. Some had got a reply allotting a PAN but did not receive a PAN card. Some had lost their PAN card. Some had their PAN at their head office in Pudukottai, whereas the depositories were in Mumbai. Since its own performance was not stellar, the CBDT granted extension after extension. But finally its patience ran out. Sebi declared that from January 1, 2007, demat account holders would not be able to sell shares they had in their accounts. Even such a dire threat did not deter some diehard shareholders. A quarter of them still did not disclose their PAN numbers. Now the CBDT has issued a final warning: if they do not show their PAN numbers, it will confiscate their shares.        
	That would be expropriation of property; it cannot be done in a democracy. If the IT department could prove that a shareholder had income above the tax limit and had deliberately not paid it, it could claim a lien on his assets, of which his shares may be a part. But confiscating his shares because he did not go to the IT department and get a PAN? It would be a travesty of property rights, and a shame on democracy. Only in India, the worlds greatest democracy, can the tax authorities even think of such a brazen act. If they do carry out their threat, however, they will doubtless have some section in their acts and rules to support it. If it is not there, they will have it enacted; and the Indian parliament being what it is, its members will be too busy shouting slogans to notice. If some taxpayer is enterprising enough to go to court and get an injunction, P. Chidambaram is sure to get legislation through parliament taking away the courts right to protect the citizens. He has done it so often before; it will be just once more.

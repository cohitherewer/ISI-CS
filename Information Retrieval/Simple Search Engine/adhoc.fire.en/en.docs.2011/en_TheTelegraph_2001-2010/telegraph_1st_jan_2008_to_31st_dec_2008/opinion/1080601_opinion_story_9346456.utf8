The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a sensitive matter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A SENSITIVE MATTER                                                          
	An idea is a beautiful thing. And no one is more enamoured of this beauty than the complacent gentlemen who head the West Bengal government. But while they nod and smile at one another in self-congratulation after they have announced one, they probably know that it will remain an idea for a very long time, safe from the vicissitudes of implementation. The idea that government schools would introduce teaching in the English medium alongside the Bengali is one of their best. It is not just that students are passing into a globalized world, but also that all-India tests for higher degrees and professional studies require a certain competence in English. So do many new jobs. Not to have a workable grasp of English gravely limits young peoples opportunities. The option of the English medium of learning in government schools could correct that.        
	But now the Revolutionary Socialist Party leader, Kshiti Goswami, has neatly thrown a spanner. He wants the government to have a fresh look at the idea, since it is a sensitive matter. According to Mr Goswami, an English medium wing in a government school would create feelings of inferiority among students who study in Bengali. The RSP is a constituent of the Left Front, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) seems eager to humour its ally on this subject at least. It was always suspicious of English. Mr Goswamis reasoning is fascinating. One, while he is so worried about the divisive effect of English in government schools, he seems unaware of the much more painful divide that has already been created in society by the Left Fronts oscillating policies regarding the teaching of English. Perhaps Mr Goswami does not know that there is a world outside government schools? Had he done so, he would have also known that the introduction of the English medium in government schools would help bridge this larger divide. Two, if students studying in the Bengali medium feel inferior, then why did the Left Front force this inferiority on all of them for years, by preventing the teaching of English before Class VI? A whole generation of students have suffered, although English is now taught from Class I.        
	Given this history, it has to be asked how the government planned to introduce English medium wings. Does it have the means to attract teachers, hundreds of them, who can teach all subjects in English? The standard of English teaching in government schools, especially in the villages, is pitiful, the methods and texts thoughtless and unimaginative. It takes a lot of thought and care to bring alive and make accessible a language that students have never heard or do not use. To introduce the English medium, expert educationists sensitive to the needs of children in villages  many of whom come from backward classes or underprivileged families  are needed for the detailed planning of courses and texts. It certainly is a sensitive matter, although not in the sense Mr Goswami thinks it is.

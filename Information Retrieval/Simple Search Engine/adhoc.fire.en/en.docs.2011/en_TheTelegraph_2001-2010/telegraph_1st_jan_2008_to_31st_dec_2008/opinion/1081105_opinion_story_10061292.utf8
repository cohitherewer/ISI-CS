                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MARKETS IN A MESS                                  Fifth Column - Sunanda Sen                              
	The current crisis in the global economy can be explained with the help of two major aspects related to the markets. The first involves the prevailing state of uncertainty in these markets, and the second pertains to innovations that aim to hedge and insure the financial assets subject to risks.         
	Aspects as above can explain the subprime loan crisis in America, which recently triggered a meltdown of financial assets in the global economy. While uncertainty provides the base for risk-taking, such risks can be disproportionately high as compared to the returns. Situations as above generate a climate characterized as ponzi finance by the post-Keynesian economist, Hyman Minsky. With ponzi finance, the high returns, as are offered to entice new investors to lend and invest, are not realized in the market by the borrower. To avoid an impending default and an interruption of business, it is not only necessary for these investments to continue but also the flow needs to be adequate to cover and compensate the losses on previous investments. However, as confidence on these assets tends to wane in the market, these transactions come to a grinding halt, creating big holes in the balance sheets of the concerned parties.         
	Another factor that has triggered the crisis is financial engineering or innovations in de-regulated markets. Asset values subject to uncertainty prompt use of derivatives like futures, options, swaps and so on. Thus, futures contracts that warrant the price of an asset on some future date dispense use of cash other than a small margin. These instruments open up vast potentials as they are less constrained by uncertainty and/or liquidity. However, business can continue only if hedging dampens risks and helps realize the risk-adjusted contractual returns on assets, an outcome that may fail in a typical ponzi situation.                 
	Way out of trouble        
	As for the events that led to the present crisis, financial innovations in America came up in response to the tight monetary control of the 1970s, generating credit beyond the usual banking orbits. A large number of US firms started having access to short-term credit by using, as collaterals, securitized assets. New forms of financial intermediation by repackaging securities were provided and easily sold in the market by investment banks, which, incidentally, were outside the orbit of the Fed regulations. Churning of asset-backed securities propped up multiple counterparties with leveraging made easy with these debt-financed assets. Hence, trust and confidence in the uncertain markets for these assets continued.         
	Mortgages of housing opened up new profit opportunities in the US by the mid 1990s, targeting citizens so far excluded. Securitized mortgaged assets opened up new channels for the broker-mortgage firms, the issuers, insurers and the investment banks readily buying and repackaging the ABS with sources of credit by leveraging. A set of low-income households were suddenly endowed with mortgaged houses with a liability to pay monthly instalments. Soon the loans advanced were discovered to be subprime, with collaterals subject to valuation in a sliding property market and the borrowers not even bankable in terms of conventional practices. The euphoria died out.         
	The contagion has now crossed borders, with financial markets in both Europe and Asia in duress. Strategies to halt the downswing in asset markets are yet to bring in a reversal. It is unlikely that markets will get immunity from such shocks in the current regime of de-regulated finance that encourages speculation in uncertain markets. The revival and strengthening of the regulatory devices in financial markets, scrapped altogether in the de-regulatory regime, may help. The ressurection of the real sector, which in the past led the way to recovery from the Great Depression, might also be looked at as a solution.

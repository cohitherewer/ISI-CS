	Alls fair in love and war, Mayavati would be likely to agree, referring, of course, to the love for her own position and the war against the Congress president. If there is anyone who is going to speak to the people of Uttar Pradesh, whether in Rae Bareli or elsewhere, it will have to be the chief minister and her party, no one else. Ms Mayavatis not particularly subtle game began a few months earlier, when she calmly had the area in Rae Bareli earmarked for a Central railway-coach manufacturing factory turned into gram sabha land from its title under the Union agriculture ministry. The change of title helped her government pass an order reclaiming the land from the Northern Railway to which the ministry had given it for building the factory. Ms Mayavati will not countenance the possibility that Sonia Gandhi, and therefore the Congress, would be perceived as creating jobs within the state she considers her territory. Her magic word is control, not development. It may be a passing irritation for her that the high court has frozen the order, and that too partly because farmers protested against it. But that has not stopped her from trying to make the visiting Congress president invisible. Mysterious law and order problems have caused the district administration to implement Section 144 of the criminal procedure court in the area till Diwali, so that Ms Gandhi is unable to hold a rally in her own constituency. No one in the administration can say what the acute law and order problems are, but then, in Mayavati country, anything goes. The laying of the foundation stone for the factory had been cancelled earlier, since the whole matter of the land is now in the courts.        
	It is one thing to unsheathe swords for a full-blooded political battle, but quite another to hijack the battlefield by a sly abuse of power. Political shrewdness is rather different from the exhibition of smallness manifested in preventing a leader from meeting her people. All this did not affect Ms Gandhi, however; she has made her stand clear with firmness and dignity. Ms Mayavati, true to her style, is trying to kill a flock of birds with one stone. With Brahmins and Dalits on her side, she is now focussed on the minority vote. Ms Gandhi cannot be allowed to come in the way, especially since the UP chief minister is looking towards Delhi. The land in Rae Bareli must therefore be used to inaugurate not a factory but Ms Mayavatis favourite game of get-to-the-top.

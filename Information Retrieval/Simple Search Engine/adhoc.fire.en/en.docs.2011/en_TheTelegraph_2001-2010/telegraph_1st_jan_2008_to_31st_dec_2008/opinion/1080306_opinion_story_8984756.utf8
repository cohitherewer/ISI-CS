                                                                                                                 BETTER THAN A FEW, BUT WORSE THAN MOST                              Extracts from the Sachar Committee report (2006) on the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim community of India      DOCUMENT                                                
	Educational Conditions of Muslims: Relative deprivation in education of Muslims vis--vis other socio-religious categories calls for a significant shift in the policy of the State, along with the creation of effective partnership with private and voluntary sectors. Given the vastness of the population to be served and the limited resources available with policy-makers, the emphasis on provisioning of a minimum level of school education by the State seems justified. That does not mean, however, that the State can withdraw from participation in higher levels of education. The policy focus should be on those areas of education where private investment is not adequate to cover the weaker section of the population        
	The data clearly indicates that while the overall levels of education in India are still below universally acceptable standards, the educational status of the Muslim community in particular is a matter of great concern. Though the all-India literacy levels of Muslims are somewhat satisfactory, disaggregative analysis of State data, by place of residence and by gender, presents a less flattering picture. When alternative indicators of educational achievement, more representative of the progress made in education, are considered, a significant disparity between the status of Muslims and that of other SRCs (except SCs/STs) can be noted In fact, in several contexts, SCs/STs are found to have overtaken Muslims. While there is a significant rural-urban differential, it was observed that the gap between Muslims and the other SRCs is generally higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Similarly, though Muslim women have lower educational attainments than men, the gap with other SRCs is lower for women.        
	Analysis of time trends indicate that, despite overall improvement in educational status, the rate of progress has been the slowest for Muslims         
	That the share of Muslims is poorest in streams having brightest employment prospects is of special concern. This has serious long-term implications for the economic empowerment of the community and consequently for economic development of the country... One of the key reasons for the low participation of Muslims in higher education is their significantly low achievement level in higher secondary attainment rates. Muslims seem to have significant disadvantages vis--vis most SRCs in school completion rates         
	The recent trends in enrolments and other educational attainments and committees interactions with the Muslim community are adequate to dispel certain misconceptions and stereotypes with respect to education of Muslims. Muslim parents are not averse to modern or mainstream education and to sending their children to the affordable government schools. They do not necessarily prefer to send children to madarsas. Regular school education that is available to any other child in India is preferred by Muslims also...         
	There is also a common belief that Muslim parents feel that education is not important for girls and that it may instil a wrong set of values. Even if girls are enrolled, they are withdrawn at an early age to marry them off. This leads to a higher drop-out rate among Muslim girls. Our interactions indicate that the problem may lie in non-availability of schools within easy reach for girls at lower levels of education, absence of girls hostels, absence of female teachers and availability of scholarships as they move up the education ladder        
	Government employment and programmes: A very small proportion of government/public sector employees are Muslims, and on average they are concentrated in lower-level positions. This is consistent with the finding that the average earnings of Muslim regular employees are lower than those of employees belonging to other SRCs. While no discrimination is being alleged, it may be desirable to have minority persons on relevant interview panels. Although efforts were made to ensure the presence of Muslims on the selection committees for Group C and Group D, the results were not made available to the committee. A brief review of programmes suggests that Muslims have not benefited much from them.         
	While it is difficult to identify all the causes, one of the reasons for the low efficacy of these programmes is lack of Muslim participation in political processes and governance, especially at the local level. Muslims participation in nearly all public spaces is low. In India this participation is possible at a number of levels  at the national level, at the level of the states/ Union Territories and at the grassroots level  the panchayat and urban bodies. Besides these institutions of parliamentary democracy, there are a number of paragovernmental institutions which run on the principles of electoral democracy and public representation. For example, a cooperative society formed for the purpose of providing developmental finance in a locality can elect its own representatives from among its residents.         
	Access to Social and Physical infrastructure: Villages with large Muslim populations are located in states/ areas with poor physical and social infrastructure. This has resulted in Muslim households being poorly served by amenities compared to other SRCs. Improvement of rural social infrastructure in these states will provide Muslims better physical access to key amenities such as education, health, transport and communication. The housing conditions of Muslims are on a par with the overall average. They are worse off than the Hindu general category but at about the level of Hindu OBCs. Muslim households are better provided with toilet and water supply but are not as well served in modern fuel and lighting. The overall standard of living of Muslims is close to the H-OBCs, better than SCs/STs but poorer than others.

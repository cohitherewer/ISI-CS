	American authors and publishers have reached an agreement with Google, the worlds largest search engine, to scan millions of books and make them available on the internet. This means that Google can sell electronic versions of copyrighted books that have gone out of print. Hitherto, only snippets of books were available but now people will be able to buy digital books outright or pay to access them by the page like CDs and DVDs or pay for TV channels. As The Bookseller, the British trade journal put it, almost overnight the largest publishing deal has been struck, and the largest bookshop in the world built.         
	Although these are early days, and the deal is confined to the American market, the main hurdle of how to pay authors and publishers for the digital use and sale of works has been worked out and the model is sure to be extended soon to other markets as well.         
	Beyond the obvious advantage of hitherto-inaccessible books now being available at the touch of a button, there are some questions that arise. First, why are books put out of print even when they are still within copyright, either by the author or his/her successors? Will their availability now help the reader/researcher? What will be the cost  or rather, will the digital version be cheaper than the printed book?         
	Books are put out of print by publishers when they feel that the market for the book has been exhausted or when a limited reprint would not make a viable commercial proposition. No publisher would reprint an edition of, say, 200 copies because the unit cost of production would be too high to price it affordably. Many books are also declared out-of-print when publishers and their editorial advisers feel that they are dated and would no longer serve the purpose for which they were originally made. This is especially true for books on science, technology, medicine or for other professional subjects like accountancy, architecture and law.         
	The value of reprinting out-of-print books would really depend on the choice of titles finally scanned and this would depend on the perceived frequency of its usage by the potential buyer. The key, therefore, lies in thinking more clearly about what readers actually want  entertainment, information, or accuracy? Is it possible to measure the relationship between the reprint and its future sales? It is almost impossible to do so with any degree of accuracy.        
	Also, what does scanning mean  a simple photographic reproduction of the original copy? With advances in design and layout now, old designs would no longer do. And if old books have to be reset in new formats, the cost would be prohibitive for limited editions. So, if the new revised books are reset, not merely photographically reproduced, they would not be worth it except for the scholar. Just supply-side economics would not do because the problem today is that there are too many unwanted books; besides, there is very little shelf space for slow-moving stock.        
	Any technological advance has its hidden costs. So a personal computer with a broadband connection is a must if you want to keep in touch with books and the print world.

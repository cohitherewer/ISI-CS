	Walking on a razors edge                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras astute analysis puts the upheaval in the Indian stock markets in a global perspective (The guilty people, Nov 7). In retrospect, it appears that the mantra of nationalizing the economy, followed by Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, was a far more reliable option than the liberalization of the 1990s. Although inefficiency and corruption prevail across the nationalized sector, the fact remains that peoples assets are in relatively safer hands in a non-globalized economy. After experiencing the growth boom for over a couple of decades, the government ought to have been careful with its policies so that people were not left high and dry. Hopefully, the next general elections will bring a more down-to-earth finance minister who would safeguard the common man from nasty shocks in case there is a similar economic meltdown in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Even after seeing the debacle of the Marxist economy and the poor rate of growth in communist countries vis--vis the free-economy countries, Ashok Mitra seems to have learnt no lesson. Although he concedes that liberalization has doubled the gross domestic product rate over the last decade, Mitra also points out that a large number of people remain untouched by this growth. Does he then prefer lower rate of growth under a command economy? Mitra suggests that globalization is not necessarily a good thing for a nation, as in the case of the Soviet Union, which, when detached from the United States of America and other Western nations, registered a high rate of growth. In truth, whatever its claims, the Soviet Union could at no point compare with the scale of the US economy. And if the Soviet Union is such an ideal case, why did it topple so easily? Perhaps it produced more bullets and guns than bread and butter?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Should we shed tears for the gullible and greedy investors who were provoked to commit suicide by the stock market crash? When you live on the edge, you cannot expect to be lucky everyday. It is the hunger for more and more wealth that spelt the doom of these investors. This was a fate of their own making  they are hardly the victims of the frenzy of neo-liberal passion. Conservative investors, who took the trouble of enquiring what was happening on both sides of the Atlantic, managed to remain unscathed.           
	And why blame it all on the prime minister? The ruined investors never consulted Manmohan Singh before putting their money in the bourses. Since Indian communists remain ardent admirers of the socialist policies of the Nehru-Gandhi clan, one is hardly surprised by Ashok Mitras warm praise of Indira Gandhi. However, it is rather sad that P.V. Narasimha Rao was considered not good enough to be mentioned, depriving him of the recognition he deserved for steering the nation with exemplary courage and vision in one of the worst phases of its history.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra laments the fate of those who lost money in the stock market. The reality is that in India very few people invest in stocks. Those who do better not entertain any illusion that the market will remain steady at all times. There are well known methods of systematic investment where loss can be greatly reduced. After all, how a person should invest his savings is entirely his prerogative. The government or the stock market cannot be blamed for any eventual losses.           
	Mitra should realize that every investor is an adult and is free to make a choice to invest or not. Thanks to the initiatives of the present and former prime ministers, Manmohan Singh and P.V. Narasimha Rao respectively, since 1991 the Indian economy has experienced a steady rise. The GDP growth rate went over 9 per cent for last three years, in contrast to the pre-1991 traditional growth rate of 3-3.5 per cent. Since demand is primarily domestic, the high growth is expected to continue, despite a temporary reduction this year. So, while one cannot predict the behaviour of the Sensex tomorrow or in the next month, it is bound to grow in the long run.           
	Yours faithfully,        Shyamal Pain, Missouri, US            
	Sir  Indeed, history could never be rewritten, as Ashok Mitra has pointed out. But had Jawaharlal Nehru been around in the 1990s, he would probably have converted to Thacherism, especially as the Soviet Union had completely failed by then. Why, if Nehru had studied in Chicago and not in Britain, he would have probably turned India into an economic superpower in four decades, with a decent annual GDP growth rate. The economy would not have crumbled in 1990-91 as well. The cause of the latter can be traced back to Indias socialist command-economy regime, a model that Nehru imported from Britain.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, about how the Soviet Union enjoyed plenty of food and full employment, while hunger and unemployment stalked America and Europe during the Great Depression of the 1930s, recycles a familiar fairy tale. Recession and unemployment disappeared in Germany altogether when Hitler came to power. Can one then justify Hitlers actions on that count? The matter of employment in the Soviet Union  Soviet economists later wrote about the long hours of hard work that workers had to do in that era  is laced with irony in a regime of forced labour, arrests, prison camps and mass annihilation.           
	Yours faithfully,

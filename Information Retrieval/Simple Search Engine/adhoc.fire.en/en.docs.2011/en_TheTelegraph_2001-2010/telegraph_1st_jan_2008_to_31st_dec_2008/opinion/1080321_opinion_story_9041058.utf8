The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | still whining
                                                                                                                 STILL WHINING                                                    
	Asim Dasguptas budget speeches fall into a deadly pattern. He is an interminable speaker. He begins by blaming the Central government for every ill imaginable, and then goes on to boast about his governments bleeding heart and glowing achievements. The budget documents of the West Bengal government are convoluted; and they are never available in toto. But this time the finance minister has given a statement of financial trends which shows how disastrous his policies have been.         
	He is too coy to call borrowings by their name; he calls them surplus outside revenue account, fudging the fact that he has been borrowing money because he has been spending far beyond the revenue he gets. A government may borrow to create durable assets. But in 2007-08, the West Bengal government spent less than a third of its borrowings on capital assets. The last time borrowings were spent mostly on capital assets was in 1995-96; since then, Mr Dasgupta has been borrowing to pay his bureaucrats salaries. As a result, he has incurred a debt of Rs 18,000 on behalf of every citizen of West Bengal. Although he would never mention it, the Centre bailed him out by refinancing the debt at lower rates of interest. Nor would he ever mention that of his revenue of Rs 36,000 crore, Rs 17,000 crore  almost a half  comes from the Centre. But however much it gives, Mr Dasgupta will keep whining. He is so depressive that he has not even noticed the fact that his revenue receipts have more than doubled in the last five years. As fast as he might spend, he could not keep up with the surge in revenue; as a result, his revenue deficit came down in absolute terms. And since he was borrowing largely to find money for current expenditure, his borrowings came down too. But this happy state cannot last. Once he realizes his good luck, he will work overtime to spend. He will call it expenditure to create employment and produce equitable growth; but the prosperity he brings will be unequally distributed between supporters and opponents. And at the end of it, the average Bengali will bear even higher debt. Finance ministers come and go, but the people on whose behalf they borrow have to live on.         
	The ideological paranoia that has pervaded Mr Dasguptas budgets is outdated; today, it is the Central government that is at the communists mercy, not the other way round. And that paranoia can only lead to budgetary bankruptcy. Mr Dasgupta should consider whether he might not serve West Bengal better by taking the Centre for granted, counting West Bengals luck at being part of a large country and making his policies as attractive to investors as they are in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu or Karnataka.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       OPEN UP THE MIND                                                          
	A harbinger of modernity cannot be bound by prejudice. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, sees himself as the prophet of a new era. This new era will be marked by West Bengals emergence into industrial prosperity, which will be driven by new investments made by foreign and Indian companies. Mr Bhattacharjee is not especially choosy about the colour of the money that is being invested so long as industrialization flourishes. Thus even multinational corporations are welcome to bring their business to communist-ruled West Bengal. This promise of a new age is also premised on certain reforms that Mr Bhattacharjee is committed to implement. These relate to reforming the bureaucracy in order to make it more efficient. Tied to such changes is a transformation in the attitude of the people. Mr Bhattacharjee wants the people of West Bengal to be work-oriented and investor-friendly. This would assume that Mr Bhattacharjee himself has taken the first steps to radically alter his own attitudes and beliefs.        
	In some matters, especially with regard to his attitude towards capital and capitalists, Mr Bhattacharjee has changed, and changed quite dramatically. Yesterdays firebrand revolutionary is todays investor-friendly chief minister. But there are some critical areas in which he still remains within the confines of a straitjacketed communist. He said recently that he and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), are against all strategic partnerships with the United States of America. This cannot be described by any other word save prejudice. For Mr Bhattacharjee, investment that originates in the US is welcome in West Bengal and India, but when it comes to any other relationship with the US, he, perhaps at the diktat of his party, erects a wall in his mind. He does not even pause to consider if such alliances and relationships will be beneficial to India or not. This is an odd contradiction in someone who wants to embrace all that is modern in this world.        
	The arguments that are offered by Mr Bhattacharjee only highlight this contradiction. He is not against nuclear power per se, but he believes that the deal will only benefit the US power lobby at the cost of Indian research and technology. For one thing, without a regular supply of uranium, nuclear research in India will remain starved and the reactors will lie idle. The deal will facilitate supplies and thus help research and technology. This has little or nothing to do with the US power lobby. Mr Bhattacharjee is either betraying his ignorance or his prejudice.         
	As the chief minister of West Bengal, who is eager that the world should come to his state and enrich it, Mr Bhattacharjee needs to shed his blinkers, even if those blinkers have been ordered by the party that commands his loyalty. No prophet of modernization can thrive on the motto, The party is always right.

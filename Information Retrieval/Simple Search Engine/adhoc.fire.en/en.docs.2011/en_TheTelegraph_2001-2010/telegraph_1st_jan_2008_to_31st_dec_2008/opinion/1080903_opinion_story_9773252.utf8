	Unnatural disaster                  
	Sir  Though many parts of India are hit by devastating floods every year, nothing worthwhile is done to prevent such periodic occurrences. Given the fact that neighbouring states like West Bengal and Orissa suffer floods regularly, the Bihar government should have taken steps to quell the deluge beforehand (Sorrow swallows villages, Aug 28). Despite the heavy loss of property and human lives, ministers, both at the Centre and the state, have not done enough to minimize the damage. Our technology, these days, is strong enough to combat natural calamities. But we seem to lack the will to put it in place effectively.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The furious Kosi has rendered lakhs homeless in Bihar. The breach in the Kosi embankment, near the India-Nepal border, had been just a few hundred metres wide initially. But the gap was not plugged on time, resulting in the breach extending to more than a kilometre. It is shameful that after six decades of independence, the people of India have to bear the costs of critical bureaucratic errors that lead to a crisis. The Central government has declared the Bihar flood as a national disaster, but it has done precious little to alleviate the sufferings of its victims. In the future, the government should act quickly after detecting a calamity. This will save it from spending huge amounts by way of relief work and also lower the death count.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  Bihar is one of the richest states of India in terms of natural resources. Unfortunately, human error has brought about a natural disaster in the state. Even as politicians pass the buck, people continue to suffer unimaginable hardship. It is wrong to expect the government to salvage the loss. Therefore, people from other states need to come forward and help as much as they can.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyoti Shokhanda, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  Apparently, the earlier government in Bihar, led by Lalu Prasad, was so corrupt that it paid scant attention to its subjects. Nitish Kumar, too, has failed in his duty to safeguard the peoples lives. The officials responsible for the delay in mending the dam over Kosi that caused the flooding must be punished severely.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Ears wide open          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavan should realize that it is the Kashmiris, and not the Arundhati Roys or L. K. Advanis or citizens across the border, whose views must be taken into account to solve the Kashmir riddle (The trouble with Eden, Aug 28). While Pakistans intrusion in Kashmir and the subsequent occupation of a major part of it are barbarous, India itself does not stand on a high moral ground either. Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession and agreed to merge his state with India. Unfortunately, the Indian government did not bother to take the Kashmiris into confidence before negotiating with the ruler.           
	It is high time Kashmiris are given the right to decide their own fate. If India is confident that the Kashmiris wish to be a part of the Union, it should organize a plebiscite under the aegis of the United Nations. On the other hand, if the people of Kashmir want independence or a merger with Pakistan, their demand should be met. India needs to learn a thing or two from the United States of America about the meaning of a true democracy. It will help India realize that respecting the sentiments of citizens is of critical importance in a democratic set-up.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur 

                
	New cure          
	Sir  Many self-proclaimed Ayurvedic practitioners reportedly mix harmful steroid in their medicines. Although these mixtures give instant relief, they cause considerable harm to the patients afterwards. While it is alright to encourage the consumption of Ayurvedic medicines, care should be taken to ensure that the patients are not being given doctored curatives. The government should also undertake steps to propagate the virtues of this line of treatment. This will not only be beneficial for the people in general, but will also lure foreigners to undergo Ayurvedic treatment in India.           
	It may be recalled that the Kairali massage has become popular in India and abroad, generating employment opportunities to trained Indian therapists. Similarly, other non-allopathic forms of treatment like the unani medicines should also be supported by the government.           
	Yours faithfully,

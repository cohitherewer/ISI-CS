	Racism is ugly  always and everywhere. But in a country so giddy with the bliss of new-found freedoms, it takes on a particularly nasty quality. The shock, followed by a longer and more diffuse feeling of public humiliation and helplessness, which the two black cheerleaders had to go through in Mohali, and continue to feel now, is an experience every civilized Indian would do well to try to imagine. As young women in a foreign country, whose work involves continual exposure to the public gaze, being singled out for abuse for the way they look must feel like the most shattering loss of dignity. Add to this something they must all know about by now  that many Indians consider cheerleaders to be unacceptably obscene unless they are properly covered up. And even to those they cheer and entertain, they are, at best, decorative presences kept in the margins of the IPL glamour and glory.        
	In this, somewhat trivializing, context, the muck of racial prejudice becomes compounded with other kinds of indignities. What begins to come together is something larger than the horribleness of individuals  the sense of a top-down, systemic nastiness, with racial, sexual and class prejudices at its core. These are usually garbed in professional or bureaucratic correctness and cunning, hence often difficult to pin down or prove. With Ellesha Newton and Sherinne Anderson, the line between racist discrimination and shabby, unprofessional behaviour (not being paid in time, arbitrary changes in schedule and itinerary) has now become blurred. Nobody at the Indian end, from Preity Zinta downwards, seems to have known anything. And the two women are really too unimportant for the star herself to bother to find out what really happened, let alone apologize. The best that could be offered them, as an amicable sorting out of the matter, are Bollywood bit-parts. Besides, to say that Wizcraft International does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of gender or nationality, leaves plenty of room for racism, for skin-colour  ethnicity  need not have anything to do with either gender or nationality.        
	With IPL, cricket may have transcended its national barriers. But this hideous incident brings the game dangerously close to that old-fashioned thing  a national disgrace. So it demands from IPL crickets most important men and women those old-fashioned rituals of civilization  a sincere inquiry, followed by a public and unconditional apology. Heads would also have to roll. A nation proud to have thrown off the yoke of white imperialism cannot afford to be smug about its own habits of discrimination, the abusive energies of the chauvinisms that persist, however insidious their expression. There are certain kinds of dazzle, which are undoubtedly the signs of a new vitality, that could make civilized humanity look like a spoil-sport.

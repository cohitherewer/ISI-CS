The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blame it on the players
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BLAME IT ON THE PLAYERS                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	If it is Bihar, then it must be about failed promises. This is being seen, once again, with rival politicians coming together briefly to take up the cause of their fellow men brutally assaulted in Mumbai, only to turn the issue around for the sake of their selfish interests.         
	It was expected that state leaders would rise in protest against Raj Thackerays heinous acts. What was seen instead was the wrangling between Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan over the proposed resignations of MPs and MLAs from the state. Lalu Prasads men submitted their resignations to him, and not to the concerned authorities. Paswan said that his boys would follow suit once the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, handed in his papers and got his five Lok Sabha members to send their resignations to the proper place. But with Parliament now not in session, it is doubtful whether any decision would be taken before this Lok Sabha is dissolved.        
	If these leaders really wanted to focus attention on the plight of job-seeking Biharis in Maharashtra, then the Central ministers from Bihar should have resigned. Nitish Kumar should have given an ultimatum to the Bharatiya Janata Party that he would end the alliance if the BJP did not dissociate itself from the Shiv Sainiks and their recently estranged brethren. No such development took place and the three leaders simply indulged in a game of one-upmanship.        
	The developments have been on expected lines. Only a few months ago, people from Bihar were gunned down in Congress-ruled Assam. Yet neither Lalu Prasad nor Ram Vilas Paswan demanded that Sonia Gandhi pull up the chief minister at Dispur. This time, they stirred themselves and organized rail rokos and bandhs but these were not enough to jolt the powers in New Delhi or Mumbai.                 
	State of apathy        
	Leaders in Bihar, much like those in other Bimaru states, are unconcerned about the plight of the people and view them as subjects to be exploited during elections. The political establishment has not been able to put an end to the massacres along caste lines. Neither has it done anything to create jobs so that poor people from Hajipur, Araria, Bhagalpur and elsewhere do not have to seek lowly-paid jobs outside Bihar. Vast swathes in central and northern Bihar have no means to feed their populations. Patna has done little, save pay lip service to the cause of industrialization.         
	Over the years, the people of Bihar have been reduced to objects of scorn and hatred in alien surroundings. Having been discarded by their own leaders, what solace can they expect away from home? Biharis in Mumbai, Assam, Manipur and other places certainly have a right to seek protection, but do the likes of Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have the moral authority to voice their demand when they themselves are nothing but feudal lords at home?        
	With such leaders at the helm, the anger at the violence perpetrated against Biharis in Mumbai will surely die down after a few ritual expressions of protest. The leaders themselves must be a happy lot. Had the protests continued, they would have had to face the uncomfortable question as to why they did nothing to stem the flow of migrants from Bihar into another state. The issue will come up when the state goes to the polls and the world will witness another spate of blame game, but nothing will change. And as the game progresses, it will perhaps be Lalu Prasad who will find himself the most hard-pressed as he had the state under his thumb for the most number of years. His ally, the Congress, must also share a good portion of the blame, but right now nobody seems to be paying much attention to it in Bihar. Meanwhile, migrant Biharis continue to be targets of parochialism wherever it raises its ugly head.

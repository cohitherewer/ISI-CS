	To call Tassos Papadopoulos a dinosaur is a slur on the entire Cretaceous era, but at least the age of the dinosaurs has ended in Cyprus. Running for re-election as president last Sunday, Papadopoulos, the man who almost single-handedly scuttled a peace settlement in Cyprus four years ago, came third and was eliminated from the race. The other candidates want to re-open negotiations for peace.        
	The Greek-Cypriot newspaper, Simerini, was a little more generous about the 74-year-old Papadopoulos, calling him the last of the Mohicans, but the sense that his defeat marks a turning point for Cyprus is widespread. For more than half a century, Cyprus has been a divided and heavily militarized island kept quiet by a UN peacekeeping force, but there is hope on the horizon.        
	Papadopoulos, who founded his presidency on resistance to a UN-backed plan to end the division of Cyprus, trailed only a few thousand votes behind his two adversaries  former foreign minister, Ioannis Kasoulides, and the Communist Party leader, Demetris Christofias, each of whom took almost one-third of the vote. But that means that two-thirds of Greek-Cypriots are now ready to reconsider the settlement they rejected in 2004.        
	What we have here is the dawning of strategic realism in Cyprus. According to census figures, almost four-fifths of the Cypriot population spoke Greek and only one-fifth Turkish. So if the island had been located somewhere off the west coast of Greece, it could just have joined Greece when it got its independence from Britain in 1960. If the Turks didnt like it, they could leave.        
	But Cyprus is a large island off the south coast of Turkey, and the Turkish mainland is ten times closer to Cyprus than the Greek mainland. Moreover, Turkey is a militarily competent country with about seven times Greeces population. The Greeks may love the Greek-Cypriots, but they were never going to wreck their country by going to war with Turkey.                
	Strategic realities        
	That was why Cypruss independence constitution was a document of Byzantine complexity, dividing every aspect of the government between the Greek and Turkish communities. By 1963, frustrated Greek-Cypriots were trying to change it, mutual suspicions flared, and within a year almost all Turkish-Cypriots were living under siege. That was when the UN peacekeeping force arrived. Then, in 1974, the military junta in Greece backed a military coup against the Greek-Cypriot government and installed a new regime that promised to unite the entire island with Greece. It was a miscalculation.        
	Turkey invaded the north of the island to create a safe haven for Turkish-Cypriots, and the Greek armed forces did nothing. Almost half the Turkish-Cypriot population lived outside that Turkish-controlled enclave, but they fled their homes. About 200,000 Greek-Cypriots fled south to escape the Turks. And for the next 30 years, nothing happened.        
	By 2003, however, with Cyprus about to join the European Union and Turkey negotiating its entry terms, a new effort was launched to clear up the mess. The UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, came up with the terms after consulting both sides, and the deal was put to a referendum in 2004. Two-thirds of Turkish-Cypriots voted yes; over three-quarters of Greek-Cypriots, at the urging of Papadopoulos, voted no. It was one last outing for Greek-Cypriot strategic fantasy.        
	Admittedly, the UN-brokered deal was not perfect. It allowed Greek-Cypriot refugees to return to some parts of the north, but not to most. But it sent the Turkish troops home, and it conformed to strategic realities. In 2004, Papadopoulos persuaded Greek-Cypriots to reject this deal. In 2008, they have rejected him. Be it Kasoulides or Christofias, the new president will soon open talk with the Turkish-Cypriot government. With enough realism, there could be a deal within a year.

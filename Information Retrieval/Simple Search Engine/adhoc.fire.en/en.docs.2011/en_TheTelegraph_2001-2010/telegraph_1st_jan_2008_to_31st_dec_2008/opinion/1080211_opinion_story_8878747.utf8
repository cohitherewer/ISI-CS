	Prodigal daughter                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that Sania Mirza has decided not to play in India this year because of certain controversies off the court. The decision she has taken, whether under pressure or as a result of sheer exasperation, will only gladden the hearts of those male chauvinists who rejoice at the subjugation of an internationally-successful young woman. Had there been a man involved instead of a woman, the controversies over his attire, unconventional views or shooting for a commercial would not have arisen. Indian society is still coming to terms with the modern woman. Custom still prefers a woman to stay at home, give birth to babies (preferably male), and be an obedient housewife.           
	Of all the contentious gestures Sania is supposed to have made, the one involving the national flag was the silliest. It is unlikely that she went out of her way to insult the flag. Photographers often play around with perspectives, manipulating distances in such a way that objects which are placed away from each other in reality come together in a sinister manner on the picture. Then there are the ingenious captions that sensationalize pictures. Sania is not merely a youth icon, but a symbol of what women can achieve in a fiercely patriarchal society. She ought to ignore the criticisms and carry on playing in India as well as abroad just the way she wants to as a professional, and not take hasty decisions which would suit regressive, opinionated voices. Otherwise, she would be doing a great disservice to scores of young girls who look up to her as a role model.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Telegraph has perhaps given Sania Mirza more attention than she deserves by putting her on the front page (Hounded out of home courts, Feb 5). Why should a personal decision taken by a player  to not play a tournament in India for a while  capture the headlines instead of the more urgent human-interest stories? The media have been rather indulgent in the way they have given prominence to Sania Mirza. After all, she is not the first or the last sportsperson in India to become involved in unwarranted controversies. In any event, there is little reason for us to despair: even if Sania sticks to her self-imposed embargo. Indian tennis would not be terribly impoverished without her.           
	Of the four controversies which have annoyed Mirza, three  the fatwa for wearing short skirts, her comments on pre-marital sex and shooting for a commercial on the Mecca Masjid premises  began because she had offended members of the minority community. Ideally, Sania should have just ignored the injunctions of fundamentalists. Choosing not to play in her country is a negative response. Continuing to play in the face of opposition would have been the braver option.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Suhas Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  If Sania Mirza thinks she can enjoy celebrity status and escape scrutiny and criticism of her acts, then she is living in a fools paradise. She should be reminded that the show will go on, even if she has decided not to play in India. Somebody else will eventually take her space. After this defeatist gesture, Sania is bound to lose public sympathy. Perhaps it would have been better if she had stopped throwing tantrums, accepted the reality, and carried on playing as before, thereby proving that she is not daunted by criticism.           
	There is no denying that Sania likes getting involved in controversies. Her latest reaction itself is an example. Has she ever wondered how so many other tennis players manage to stay out of the public eye? The answer is not all that difficult to find. Controversies are useful career-boosters. It is not enough to argue that Sania is still very young, and is thus affected by the stress of a celebrity life. She has been a professional for some time now and should know how best to conduct herself in public.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The picture showing Sania Mirza relaxing in a chair with her feet pointed at the tricolour provoked people to accuse her of disrespecting the flag intentionally. It is too much to expect someone to be conscious about where one puts ones feet after a a tiring game. Given her career profile, her defiance of religious zealots and her contribution to Indian sports, few would bring a charge of unpatriotic behaviour against Sania. It is not unusual for someone of her stature to feel wronged when court notices are served questioning her loyalty to her motherland. If pointing ones feet unintentionally towards the flag is construed as disrespect, then all of us are guilty of insulting Mother Earth because we trample on it. Is the national flag not insulted when people take bribes and indulge in unjust practices inside offices decorated with the tricolour and pictures of eminent freedom fighters?           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TIME FOR A MEAL                                                    
	In West Bengal, people have to die, preferably in noticeably large numbers, of having nothing to eat before the government starts talking about starvation. Then, too, most of the talk is about how the deaths are caused by disease rather than starvation, never mind if the diseases themselves  tuberculosis or dysentery  are because of acute scarcity of food forcing people to live on ants eggs or even just soil. This time, it is a survey by the government itself that has decided to come clean with West Bengals shocking starvation statistics  with the familiar hedging, of course, around what exactly to call the phenomenon. Around five lakh people, most of them above 60 years old, live in starvation-like conditions. (What, one wonders, is the difference between living as if one were starving and actually starving? Is the former better, or less uncomfortable for the government, than the latter?) The concentration of the starved, according to the survey, is in the districts that have been intermittently in the news, for years, precisely for this reason. And something else that is not new is the junior panchayat and rural development ministers knee-jerk, and entirely ad hoc, offer of a solution in the form of serving one or two cooked meals to those who prove themselves to be in such a condition.        
	Brazen denial of the facts, short-term and politically advantageous solutions, and refusing to look at the larger systemic factors have always constituted the Left Front governments familiar and expected reaction to starvation. Be they the displaced tribals of Amlashol or the out-of-work labourers and their families in north Bengals tea-gardens, the government has chronically refused to deal with the situation by addressing the fundamental causes of why people are failing to provide themselves with food. This time, the irony is in the fact that the very panchayats that have failed to make the public distribution system and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme work among the rural poor are now planning to provide meals to the starving, or the quasi-starving. From the distribution of below-poverty-line or job cards, to the deflecting of the PDS rice to the open market, both systems are mired in the corruption and greed of politically empowered middle-men. This had even led to an extended outbreak of food riots in the recent past. Nothing about this survey, and about the governments reaction to it, is new or cause for any fresh hope.

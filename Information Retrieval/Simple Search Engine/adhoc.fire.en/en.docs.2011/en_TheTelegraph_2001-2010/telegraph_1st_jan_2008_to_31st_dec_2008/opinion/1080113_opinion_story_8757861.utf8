	The real culprits
         
	Sir  The patriots in the BCCI have got their man. The ICC, under pressure from the Indian board, has shown Steve Bucknor the door for the rest of the Australian series (Bucknor decision in best interests of game: Speed, Jan 9). But it wasnt just poor umpiring that did India in in Sydney. The three batsmen who could not play one over among them did their bit too. Alright, so the trio, being tailenders, should not be judged too harshly. But then, one ought to remember that Michael Clarke, who bowled the last over, is no Brett Lee either.
     
	Yours faithfully,
    T.K. Saha, Calcutta

    
	Heres to health
     
	Sir  The Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, normally gets what he wants. After ousting former AIIMS director, P. Venugopal, Ramadoss has now set his sights on purging the nation of fatty food (Lifestyle lessons on govt plate, Jan 5). A countrywide campaign against public consumption of fat-laden delicacies has been launched under the aegis of the National Programme for the Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke. 
     
	It appears that Ramadoss is worried about those who cant do without McDonalds burgers or KFCs fried chicken as they run the risk of dying prematurely because of their food habits. Ramadosss intentions may be noble but is he aware that only a minuscule percentage of Indias total population  mainly the urban rich and middle classes  are capable of affording such luxuries? The real problem in India is not one of overeating, but of malnutrition and the absence of quality healthcare. The poor in India are still dying of diarrhoea and malnutrition, causes that can be prevented entirely. 
     
	Ramadoss lamented that such a drive has started 30 years late. But I think that the programme could have been put off by a few more years so that funds could have been used to feed the countrys starving population. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta
       
	Sir  The number of deaths related to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes is on the rise in India. These afflictions are going to take a heavy toll of those who lead a sedentary life and should be a major concern for the government. Thus, Anbumani Ramadosss announcement of a campaign to rid India of such maladies is welcome news. India cannot afford to add to its already burgeoning population of obese individuals. To prevent this, health needs to be treated as a high-priority sector. A national programme on public health is perhaps the best way to ensure that Indians lead a healthy life.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot
     
	Sir  The report, Foulmouths take toll on call centre youths (Jan 7), revealed the abuse faced by call centre employees from irate customers. Call centres in India have reportedly started employing counsellors to help workers deal with such abusive behaviour, but this cannot be a solution to the problem. Call centre workers are human beings too, and sustained abuse such as this would impair their health and personal lives. 
     
	Indians have always been subjected to racial abuse in the West. Now they are being victimized even at home. Call centre employees should be allowed to work with dignity. This is the least that can be expected after 60 years of Independence. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

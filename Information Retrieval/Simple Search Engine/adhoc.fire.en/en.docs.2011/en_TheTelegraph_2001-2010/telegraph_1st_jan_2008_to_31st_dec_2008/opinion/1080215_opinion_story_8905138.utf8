	With a few exceptions, all successful books these days are solicited by publishers. Authors are commissioned to write on specific subjects that fall in line with the publishers' interests; or, their works-in-progress are 'booked' through advance payments, which are then adjusted against the royalties they would earn through the sales of their books. Hitherto, American and British publishers made advances confined mainly to mass market fiction - crime, sex, glitz that would spin off into TV serials, or political memoirs that could be serialized in tabloids for huge fees. Advances are now being extended in a modest way by Indian publishers on projects that could be co-published in simultaneous editions in Britain and America.        
	Four questions. How are advances negotiated and by whom? Authors are notoriously innocent of the nitty-gritty of the publishing business and the scope of the market. Second, are all advances recoverable by publishers, especially when the advances are quite large? Also, would the advances to Indian authors have been as large if co-publishing arrangements had not been negotiated prior to publication? Lastly, since only big publishers can pay advances does it squeeze out the small publishers who do not have the resources to play the 'bidding game' between competing publishers for the same book?        
	Advances are negotiated by literary agents - most have been former publishers - who know the market far better than authors. The market doesn't comprise only of the book; there is a whole field of 'rights' for different territories of the world, for translations and serializations, but above all for the entertainment industry. Because of this gigantic informational advantage, agents know how to 'maximize the book's value' and get the highest advance for it. All books today are sold in bits and pieces, never as a single product. As the publishing world has grown more specialized, literary agents have made themselves indispensable to authors.         
	Whether advances turn in a profit at the end of day for publishers, depends very much on how the costing is done for the book, and the marketing strategy - price and discounts offered to the retail trade, plus other incentives. Indian publishers tend not to add the cost of money to the cost of production - paper, printing, binding and the like - which lowers the unit cost of a book and hence of its price. But this is a sleight-of-hand that doesn't tell you whether advances are justified or not. Quite often they are not, if you go by the experience of American/British publishers; but those are in a different league from ours.        
	No advances would have been possible if co-publishing arrangements had not been made in advance. And co-publishing arrangements don't mean just buying back X thousand copies of the book; it means the sale of a lot of other rights which add up to justify advances. The Indian market for books is not as large as it is sometimes made out to be. Most book sales taper off at 1000-plus copies, which just about recovers cost and makes a little profit, but not much more. It is co-publishing and the attendant rights that really account for the heavy initial investment in advances.        
	There is no doubt that small publishers can't stand up to big guns but that doesn't mean they are out of the loop. For one thing, many of the small publishing houses that have come up in recent years are run by former senior editors or CEOs of the big houses; they know the market and what it is looking for and have the critical faculties to discriminate between the good, the bad and the ugly. You don't find this in the big houses where the bottom line is all that matters.

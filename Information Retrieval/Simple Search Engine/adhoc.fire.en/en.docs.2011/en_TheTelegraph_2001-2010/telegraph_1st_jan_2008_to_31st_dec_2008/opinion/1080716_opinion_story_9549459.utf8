	Still in the dark                  
	Sir  The Central Bureau of Investigation may have acquitted Rajesh Talwar in the murder of his daughter but it has not been able to provide concrete evidence in support of its claims (Rap off Aarushi dad, blame on drunk trio, July 12). Neither the sharp object that Aarushi was claimed to have been hit with, nor the missing mobile phones of the victims have been recovered yet. Yet, the CBI has concluded hastily that Rajkumar and Mandal, and not Rajesh Talwar, are the killers. As a premier investigating agency, doesnt the CBI have the responsibility to tie up loose ends and clear all doubts before deciding to close a case? Also spare a thought for Rajesh Talwar. Who will compensate him for the trauma that he underwent after being sent to jail on the charge of killing his own daughter? The Meerut IG, Gurdarshan Singh, should be severely penalized for suggesting that Aarushi and Hemraj were romantically involved. One only hopes that the real culprits will be brought to book soon so that it brings some solace to Aarushis parents.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

      
	Sir  It has been reported in the media that Aarushi Talwar had a sore throat, which prevented her from raising an alarm when she was attacked by her assailants. This claim by investigators is difficult to believe. Even a person with a bad throat will scream loudly in order to save his or her life. The condition of Aarushis throat on the night of her murder can be easily ascertained by interrogating her friends with whom she talked just hours before being killed.           
	There are other intriguing elements to this case. For instance, why did Mayavati reportedly ask the Union home ministry to repatriate Arun Kumar, the CBI joint-director, to his parent cadre just as he about to crack the case? The answer to this query has not been found yet. It seems that a powerful person or network is trying to shield the real culprit, thereby preventing the truth from emerging in the Aarushi murder case.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Leave us alone, was what the Talwar couple said to the media which stood waiting outside the jail on the occasion of Rajesh Talwars release. However, it is unlikely that the media will let go of Rajesh Talwar in a hurry. This is because the media have always had a morbid fascination for sensationalizing crimes such as murder. Aarushi Talwars murder is a case in the point. Instead of digging out the truth behind the killing, the electronic media were busy breaking stories with dubious credentials. The television channels should learn to handle sensitive public issues more judiciously. Unfortunately, even after Rajesh Talwars release, the maniacal obsession of television channels continue. They are now repeatedly telecasting programmes showing the pain and trouble that the dentist went through.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Blind faith          
	Sir  Indians seldom donate body organs under the pretext of some superstition or another. Most Indians believe in the concept of rebirth and think that donating an organ would impair their bodies in life after death. The government as well as some NGOs have taken steps to free them from such absurd ideas. Against this backdrop, the report, Red tape ties life saving act (July 1), came as a shock. Although the relatives of Thingujam Bidhyashor Singh were keen to donate his vital organs to the Safdarjung hospital, there was a criminal delay in receiving the same on some silly pretext. The people responsible for such negligence must be penalized and the government must ensure that the transplantation of organs is not jeopardized in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The report, Caught in a jam? Heli-hop to your destination (July 5), would gladden the hearts of only the super rich. After all, very few people would be able to shell out Rs 5,800 for a 43-km helicopter ride from Electronics City to the new airport. But given Indias economic progress, a day might come when people will hail a helicopter in the same way that they hail a cab these days. In my childhood, a trip to the airport was like a journey to dreamland. Some people would not even pull off the tag of Indian Airlines from their luggages just to prove that they had flown. It is a pity that cheap airfares have resulted in airports resembling railway stations. The romance of an aeroplane ride is now lost forever.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyoti Kr. Patwari, North Lakhimpur, Assam

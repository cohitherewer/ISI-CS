                        How unfair!      
	 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi cannot be faulted. Ask any man on the street to choose between information and broadcasting, and parliamentary affairs, and he will pick the first. After all, bickering belles (read saas-bahus) in chiffon and gold are so much better than furniture-hurling, gutkha-chewing MPs. But no sooner did Priyada make the choice than he turned into a man on the street. Which is another way of saying, he lost his room in Parliament, the room where he used to hold forth on matters big and small, before his favourite journos. The new room allotted to him is in the annexe, at least a couple of miles from the main building. But Priyada has always considered Parliament to be his second home (or is it his first?), so he happily continued meeting MPs in his old room, now occupied by Vyalar Ravi. After a week or so, some gentlemen from Kerala (Ravis home state) were found sitting there at the precise hours that Das Munshi had given appointments to people. The hint was far from subtle, and Priyadas supporters lost no time in blaming it all on the scheming ways of Ambika Soni. The story goes that our man had refused Soni a room in the prestigious ground floor of Parliament, pushing her to the third floor instead, and now, Soni has taken sweet revenge through her protg, Ravi. As if this is not enough of a setback for Das Munshi, Sonia Gandhi is rumoured to have promised the ticket for the Malda parliamentary seat to Ruby Noor (late ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhurys sister) instead of Das Munshis wife, Deepa. Time for some quick strategizing, Priyada!                        
	 Rahul Gandhi hasnt been sleeping on charpoys and swatting mosquitoes at night for nothing. He was probably doing what a good brother is supposed to do  prepare the ground for his sister. The buzz in the Congress circles is that the next elections will see the party pull out its last trump card, namely, Priyanka Gandhi. The Vadra bahu might contest from either Jhansi or Banda in the Bundelkhand, areas where Rahul has been particularly active in the last few months. The Congresss favourite game is about to begin again. Its called will-she-wont-she.                            
	 IPL stands for improvisation and innovation. And guess who has understood this best after the cricketers? Your neighbourhood cable operator. Millions of Indian homes are watching IPL matches on their local cable channels even if they do not pay for the official telecaster, thanks to the signal-tapping skills of our cablewallahs. Now thats how David gives Goliath a tough time.                            
	 Our MPs are in the thrall of IPL too, though it is not known if any of them are watching the illegal local cable telecasts. A senior Union minister is rumoured to have reshuffled his parliamentary duties in order to make his presence felt at the Ferozeshah Kotla. One of his colleagues, given the responsibility of looking after the Karnataka poll preparations, was heard ruing that he couldnt even afford to catch the match on telly. Some people have all the luck. And the political clout.                            
	 Behenji, the unimaginatively titled forthcoming biography of the UP chief minister, Mayavati, reveals her fathers strong dislike for her political activism. Journalist-author Ajoy Bose mentions that Prabhu Das, an MTNL lineman, had warned his daughter against hanging around losers like Kanshi Ram. The authorized biography also dwells on the sensationalization of the Kanshi Ram-Mayavati relationship. Apparently, Mayavati herself admits that there were widespread rumours among her Dalit colleagues after she left her fathers house and moved into a room rented by Kanshi Ram. But neither behenji nor her biographer mentions that she campaigned for the Jana Sangh in 1977 or that she failed to win a ticket to the Delhi municipal polls. Like most authorized biographies, Behenji too seems intent on building up the CMs image as pristine, blameless and morally upright. Alas, politicians in India seldom come fitted with these qualities.                             
	 Things are evidently going Mayavatis day these days. And that has convinced her that the PMs seat is next up for her. She even congratulated the Agra unit of her party for coming up with a model that showed an elephant (the BSP symbol) waiting to enter the hallowed portals of Parliament. At India Gate, a huge billboard shows the Dalit queen herself, marching resolutely in the direction of the gates. Congressmen are still banking on their prince (oops, this young man does not like royal tags) to stop Mayaji in her stride.         Footnote            
	 Jairam Ramesh is a lucky man, for he has got a chance to bask in the sun and sand. Pleased with his performance in the commerce ministry, the PM has not only given Ramesh additional responsibility in the power ministry but has also personally okayed his trip to Cairo to represent India at a meet. The times are good for Ramesh. First came the post of a minister of state in the power ministry. Now, thanks to the PM, comes the foreign junket. That too at a time when Manmohan Singh has denied other ministers the pleasure of visiting exotic locales and escape the Indian summer. While the rest tend to the political crisis at home, Ramesh can have a change of scene. And who can say that he didnt deserve it? Wasnt he the one doing the rounds of Indias remote corners  the tea gardens in Jalpaiguri for instance  as a junior minister? In Cairo, at least, he wont have to go around offering relief packages.

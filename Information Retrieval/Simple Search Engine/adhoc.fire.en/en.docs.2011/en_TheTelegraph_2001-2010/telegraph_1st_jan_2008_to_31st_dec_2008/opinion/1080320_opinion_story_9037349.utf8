                                                                                                                 TAKE HEART                                                    
	It has taken nine years for a fast-track court to nail the culprit in the murder of Shivani Bhatnagar, a senior journalist working with a national daily. For the fourth estate, which prides itself on its ability to change the system, it must have been a humbling experience. But this usual story of judicial delay should not blot out another rare facet of justice that is now becoming increasingly common. The convict in this particular case is a senior police officer who had been in a position to work the system in his favour by virtue of being a part of the bureaucratic establishment. The fact that neither R.K. Sharmas official status nor his influence could insulate him from the course of justice is itself a powerful message. In the past year-and-a-half, this message has been repeatedly sent out by the judiciary through a slew of verdicts that have brought the high and the mighty to the docks and altered accepted ideas about the susceptibility of the rich and powerful to law. An incumbent minister like Shibu Soren has been found to be as vulnerable to judicial rulings as iconic political strongmen like Mohammad Shahabuddin and Amarmani Tripathi. The judgments in the Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo cases have also shown that proximity to the bureaucracy or the political establishment cannot be a sufficient guarantee of immunity from the law.        
	However, there is another side to judicial proceedings that allows for smugness to play on the faces of convicts like Sharma. The judgment arrived at by a lower court can, as part of the inbuilt system of checks and balances, be challenged in the higher courts. The procedure often guarantees sufficient time to the criminal to dodge punishment and, sometimes, even to waylay the course of justice. The backlog, delay and distractions that ensue from this undermine the judicial system as also public confidence in its efficacy. If it can take up to six months to initiate a simple hearing, would it not appear more logical to the public to take a less circumlocutory route and settle the score on the streets through lynching? For every successful case in the court there are thousands of others waiting to be heard. And the hearings on these may continue to be postponed by the smart thinking of those who know how to make full use of the loopholes in the system. It is not without reason that even high-profile cases like those of Nitish Katara and Rizwanur Rahman are nowhere close to being resolved.

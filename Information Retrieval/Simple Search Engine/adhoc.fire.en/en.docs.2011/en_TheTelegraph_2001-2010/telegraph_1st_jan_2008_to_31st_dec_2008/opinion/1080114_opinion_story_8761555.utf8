	Unsafe haven
         
	Sir  In recent times, there has been a series of campus killings in various schools and colleges across India. But the murder of Saswati Pal by Amaresh Kundu has been, by far, the most shocking, not just because of its gruesomeness but also because it took place in Santiniketan. Rabindranath Tagore had founded Santiniketan to create an environment of peace, harmony and scholarly excellence. That idyllic vision has been blighted over the years by the inefficiencies of the governing body of the Visva-Bharati University. Now, yet another tragedy has revealed the complete absence of security at the girls hostel. Apparently, there was not even a guard present at the entrance of the building, which let the killer walk-in unchallenged. One wonders if men usually have this kind of unhindered access to the universitys womens hostels? The authorities need to take stock of the situation and come up with a workable and long-term solution. A few words of assurance are simply not good enough. After all, it is the safety of the students, and not Visva-Bharatis so-called heritage, that is at stake here.

	Sir  No doubt Saswati Pals death was profoundly disturbing, but even more shocking were the circumstances of her murder. First a young man steals a lethal weapon belonging to a police constable of the Tollygunge police station, who had, quite conveniently, forgotten to lock it up safely. Then he walks casually into the womens hostel of Visva-Bharati University, seeks out his victim, chases her around the bed, then shoots her dead before committing suicide himself. Is it possible that nobody heard Saswati screaming for help? Why was there not a single armed security personnel in or around the campus? This incident certainly puts the so-called abode of peace and learning in a new perspective. In the past few months, we have seen students killing one another to settle personal scores  as in a posh Gurgaon school, and in a village school in Madhya Pradesh. The case in Santiniketan is different from the ones in the schools, in that two adults were involved here. However, that does not take away from the fundamental problem of security in schools, colleges and universities. The legislature should make it exigent upon educational institutions to impose the strictest safety measures in and around campuses by passing a law.

	War of words
     
	Sir  A debating genius was found missing in the list of star-debaters of the Fifties and Sixties in an otherwise nostalgic piece by Rohini Chaki (In the spell of words, Jan 3). The late Sudhansu Dasgupta could surely claim a place in the august list of debaters that Chaki mentions. Perhaps not a brilliant academic himself, Dasgupta could enthral the audience, with his superb wit, sense of humour and inimitable style, whenever he spoke either in favour or against a motion. Dasgupta and N. Viswanathan used to form a formidable team and the Physics Lecture Theatre of Presidency College witnessed the best of their debating skills during the Fifties. The sight of budding debaters gathered around Dasgupta to take lessons over cups of coffee in the College Street Coffee House still haunts old-timers. Having a chequered career, Dasgupta left the world prematurely, unsung and unmourned.

	Sir  Rohini Chaki has rightly pointed out in her delightful piece that Calcutta has for long been the debating capital of India. I would like to add two more motions to the probable list of topics suggested in her article. Since politics and sports are of the greatest interest to Calcuttans, may I suggest This house believes that Marxism is not viable in India and Cricket is not a gentlemens game as possible ideas?
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Think different
     
	Sir  It was a pleasure to read the spirited arguments made in the editorial, Goa way (Jan 7). One cannot but agree with the contention that the communist government in West Bengal should have pushed for more development of the countryside, and tourism would have been an obvious way of attracting funds into the state. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee needs to understand that special economic zones are not the only means of wooing foreign investment, the tourism industry could very well give Bengal the economic uplift that it so desperately seeks. The scene in Goa, in contrast, is refreshingly different. A conscious traveller will notice that the majority of the labourers who help preserve Goas own brand of carefree culture are jobless people from villages across the country, as also from Nepal. It would be entirely misleading to assume that tourism is only fun and frolic while industrial development involves toil and misery. In fact, serving feni to the sahibs could be as stressful as working in a car factory. Tourism might offer relaxation to tourists but for those working in this industry, it is hard work. So building SEZs and serving feni are not exactly opposed to each other. It only requires a little more imagination and vision than what Buddhababu is capable of to realize this, and more importantly, to translate this idea into reality.

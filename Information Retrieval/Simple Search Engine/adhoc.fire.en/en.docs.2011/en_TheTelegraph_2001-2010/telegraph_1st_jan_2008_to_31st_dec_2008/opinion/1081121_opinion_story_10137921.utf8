	The gods who loved            
	Barack Obama: The New Face of American Politics (Praeger, Rs 295) by Martin Dupuis and Keith Boeckelman is part of the series, Women and Minorities in Politics, edited by Melody Rose, focusing on the roles played, and not yet played, by women and minorities in American politics. The new president-elect is, of course, an obvious choice for this project. The authors chart the rise of Barack Obama, the senator with aspirations to the toughest job in the world, but stop short of his historic victory. As a curtain-raiser to the prospective president, this is a valuable book, written in an engagingly lucid style and filled with fascinating insights into voting patters, fundraising, race relations, the role of the media in US politics and the arrival of a completely inexperienced face in the White House.                
	What They Teach You at Harvard Business School (Penguin, Rs 395) by Philip Delves Broughton is revealingly subtitled, My two years inside the cauldron of capitalism. After a successful career in the media, Broughton decided to enroll at the Harvard Business School to find the answer to the question that forms the title of this witty memoir. He did not go there as a snooping journalist, if anything, he was running away from the job that he had done for ten long years, looking for a way to change his view of life. What he got in return was immeasurably richer than just a good degree. He got an ideal synthesis of the two types of education that John Adams spoke of  One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live.                         
	Tandoor Cinders (Penguin, Rs 199) by Vilas Sarang takes its inspiration from the gruesome murder of Naina Sahni by her husband, Sushil Sharma, in 1995. After killing his wife, Sharma had burnt her body in the tandoor of a restaurant in Delhi. In Sarangs novel, Chandra Sekhar Nayak, a college teacher, reads about the notorious Jaidev Jakhad, who tried to get rid of the body of his victim in a similar way. Morbidly fascinated by this macabre incident, Nayak sets out, with his daughter, Leena, on his own investigative trail, only to be confronted with unforeseen dangers. Although a gallant effort by the author, the book has neither the punch of a classic whodunit nor the depth of a psychological thriller.                                  
	The Book of Ram (Penguin, Rs 250) by Devdutt Pattanaik tries to retrieve the mythical king from the discourses of power, and understand him within the discourse of love, into which he rightfully fits. The author is mindful of the religious associations that Ram has in the Hindu imagination, but beyond this, he is drawn to the literary potentials of the sacred texts in which Ram is mentioned. A close reading of the Ramayan by Valmiki, and its successive re-tellings by others, brings out a story interlaced with metaphors and bristling with rich possibilities of meaning and interpretation. Pattanaik looks at long passages from the texts, raises intriguing questions and then weaves in his own observations to create a composite impression of Ram and the times he is supposed to have lived in. He shows how the dissemination of the Ramayan in India and abroad has been inflected by distinctive sociological and cultural traditions.                 
	Language, Discourse and Culture: Contemporary Philosophical Perspectives (Anthem, Rs 295) by Franson Manjali is a collection of 14 essays, originally delivered as lectures, talks and conference papers over the last seven years. Most of these pieces are concerned with linguistics and semiotics, but also explore related issues of ethics, translation and literature. A rewarding volume for students and teachers of language and literature.

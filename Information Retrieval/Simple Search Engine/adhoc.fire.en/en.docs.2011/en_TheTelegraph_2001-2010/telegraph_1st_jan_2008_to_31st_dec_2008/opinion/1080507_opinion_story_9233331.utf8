	How new is New Delhi? For the many Dalits who come from all over the country to study, work and live in the capital, the city can suddenly turn hostile in the most barbaric way. Untouchable children beaten to death for picking fruit or flowers from upper-caste gardens, and scheduled-caste young men burnt to death as part of a superior drunken spree are incidents that are usually associated with the most backward villages and small towns of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh or Rajasthan. Come away from these areas of darkness to Delhi, and the assumption is that the golden apples of equal, or reserved, opportunity start falling generously and democratically on the untouchable laps. But Kanaklata Rani from Uttar Pradesh, and her siblings, were allegedly beaten up and their water and electricity supply cut off by their landlord, Om Prakash Grover, and his wife when the latter got to know that they were Dalits. The Ranis had not initially disclosed their surname to the Grovers since letting prospective landlords know about their caste had left them with one refusal after another when they first started looking for accommodation in Delhi. One out of every five of the 25 lakh Dalits staying in Delhi are students, many from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and many of them have similar stories to tell, forcing them to rent lodgings only in specific areas in the city.        
	It is significant that violent caste prejudice in Delhi is inextricable from the story of migrating to the city for higher education in both government and private institutions. Moreover, the person who let on Ms Ranis caste to the Grovers, and then fled, was studying for the Indian Administrative Service. Higher education and the civil services are precisely the areas that have been restructured by reservations. Ms Ranis experience, which is just the tip of the iceberg of metropolitan untouchability, shows the sort of worlds in which reservation is trying to initiate its improving effects, and the kind of hostility that it could end up reinforcing and intensifying in these spheres of everyday life. It is all the more frightening, in this context, that the police have refused to help the Ranis by filing a first information report, and tried to pass the whole thing off as a quarrel over water distribution. The neighbours also stood and watched as the Ranis were being abused. What was happening was obviously not an anomaly.

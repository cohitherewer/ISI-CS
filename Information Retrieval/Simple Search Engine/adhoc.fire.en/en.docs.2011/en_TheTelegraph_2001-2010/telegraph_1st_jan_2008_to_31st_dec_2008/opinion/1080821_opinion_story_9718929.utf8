The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | into the gloom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       INTO THE GLOOM                                                    
	Greater curse hath no race than the one committed to destroy its homeland. Witness Bengalis and the benighted state of West Bengal. The two leading political parties of the state are on paths that can lead only to its ruin. The party that has been ruling West Bengal for over three decades promises industrialization, while its trade union wing stymies the promise by calling a meaningless bandh. Between the dream of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the policies of Citu falls the shadow of an antiquated ideology to which the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is wedded. The principal opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, led by the mercurial Mamata Banerjee, is heading towards a confrontation with the state administration with regard to her agitation against the Tata Motors plant in Singur. The future of the state is poised to slip through these two irrelevant political movements. The result will be many more years of economic backwardness and deprivation. Yet there is no denying that both the political parties enjoy substantial support from the people of West Bengal, who seem to be reconciled to their present plight and to their dark, almost apocalyptic, future.        
	The quest for popularity, which both the parties consider to be their great strength, actually leads them to completely ignore the future of the state that nurtures them. Popularity, or the increase of votes, cannot be the goal of any responsible political leadership, especially one that rules the state and the other that sees itself as the government-in-waiting. If Mr Bhattacharjee believes that the future of West Bengal lies in industrialization, he must be bold enough to carry forward his policies without waiting for a nebulous thing called consent. If the people of West Bengal do not like his policies and their execution, they will vote him out of power. But as a leader, he must take that risk and do what he thinks to be correct. Otherwise he will be known as the chief ditherer instead of the chief minister. Ms Banerjee, on her part, has failed to tell the people of West Bengal where she stands on industrialization and what her plans are for the development of West Bengal. She is the voice of an irresponsible Opposition. The people of the state have no one save themselves to blame for leaving their destiny to these two political formations.

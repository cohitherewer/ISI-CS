The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Old wine in a new bottle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       OLD WINE IN A NEW BOTTLE                                  Hurriedly passed in Parliament in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks, the Unlawful Activites (Prevention) Amendment Bill leaves enough room for human rights abuses. Hemchhaya De reports                          Dark Hours: The Taj Mahal hotel was the centre of the Mumbai terror attacks in November                                  
	The debate simply refuses to die down. Should our lawmakers deserve a pat on the back for promulgating a repackaged anti-terror law after 26/11? Or should they face censure for coming up with yet another exercise in futility in so far as tackling terror is concerned?        
	Though it may appear less draconian than, say, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill 2008, passed by both Houses of Parliament recently, leaves enough room for human rights abuses, argue lawyers. To some, it is nothing but an eyewash or a matter of political expediency. Others feel some safeguards have been taken into consideration.        
	Amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, which deals with terrorist activities and forfeiture of the proceeds of terrorism, had been on the governments agenda ever since a bill to repeal POTA was introduced in Parliament in 2004. Apparently, 26/11 was the wake-up call. The Mumbai attacks seem to have jolted the government out of its stupor.        
	The latest additions to the old law are in line with the Security Council resolutions on combating terrorism that are passed from time to time. In fact, the preamble mentions Security Council resolutions on the basis of which our government has adopted and inserted the new clauses, says Justice Shyamal Sen, chairperson, West Bengal Human Rights Commission, commenting on the new anti-terror law.        
	However, many feel that the whole exercise is fast becoming a vicious circle. A terrorist act is committed, the government takes rapid cosmetic measures like announcing special laws in the name of national security, the public is assured that something has been done and then, after some time, the acts get repealed owing to allegations of human rights abuse.        
	Laws like Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), Terrorist and Disruptive Activites (Prevention) Act (TADA) and POTA have been thrust upon the country from time to time. There have been ample cases to show that such laws can be misused by the state machinery to torture the innocent or harass political opponents. The new law is just an eyewash. Such laws can hardly prevent terrorism. They only tend to give unfettered powers to the police machinery and violate the human rights of ordinary people, says Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, senior lawyer and mayor of Calcutta, adding that such laws also undermine the independence of investigating teams and state authorities.        
	But political parties like the BJP have long been agitating for a tough anti-terror law similar to the POTA. Senior West Bengal BJP leader Tathagata Roy says, A tough anti-terror law should not have in-built safeguards for people accused of terrorist activities.         
	But Joy Sengupta, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court, disagrees. Rather than reposing faith in such special laws, its better to rely on general laws. The real focus should be on a more effective implementation of existing laws. For example, the police has a duty to properly investigate the cases. A lackadaisical approach simply wont do.        
	Nevertheless, Sengupta feels that the latest anti-terror law is less draconian than either POTA or TADA. At least, a purported confession before a police officer, no matter what rank he belongs to, remains inadmissible as evidence. POTA allowed it, says Sengupta. There have been numerous cases where it has been found that confessions were fabricated. Therefore, we have Section 164 of the CrPC which says that if a confessional statement has to be admissible, it has to be made before a magistrate. Some special laws make an exception to this, which is improper. The latest anti-terror law makes no such exception.        
	Also, lawyers say that theres a provision in the new law regarding detention without bail for up to 180 days, which makes the legislation more flexible than POTA. POTA didnt allow a judge to exercise discretion in this regard. If an application was made, the judge would have to extend the detention period under POTA provisions, says Sengupta. But Section 43 D (2) (b) of the new law states, if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the said period of 90 days, the court may, if it is satisfied with the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said period of ninety days, extend the said period to one hundred and eighty days.        
	The operative word here is may  the court may extend the detention period. In other words, it all depends on a judges discretion, says Sengupta.        
	The amendments to the original act (1967) have given a wider scope to combat terrorism and they are quite reasonable, in my opinion. These are in consonance with our democratic norms, adds Justice Sen.        
	But lawyers say that there are several provisions in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2008, that raise concern. Take Section 43 F (I). It states: the officer investigating any offence under this Act, with the prior approval in writing of an officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police, may require any individual to furnish information in his possession in relation to such offence, where the investigating officer has reason to believe that such information will be useful forthis Act. The failure to furnish information or giving false information will draw a heavy penalty.        
	Also, according to the new law, the court shall presume, unless contrary evidence is furnished, that the accused has committed an offence for which he has been arrested, including the possession of arms or explosives, and presume that these were used in committing a terror act.        
	Many innocent people will be thrown behind bars on the basis of presumptions and mere suspicion. I dont see how this new law is going to check police atrocities. Their versions will still be taken as the gospel truth, says Tamal Mukherjee, senior criminal lawyer at the Alipore court, Calcutta.        
	As per the new law, the onus is primarily on the accused to prove himself innocent. In some cases it can be accepted. But how can this hold in a case where the maximum penalty can be death, asks Sengupta.        
	Legal experts also say that although the bill has provisions for special courts, the lack of infrastructure and funds will be the main hindrance to expediting legal processes. We dont have an adequate number of judges. The number of undertrials is always rising. We have to deal with these issues first, says Advocate Kaushik Gupta.        
	Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya feels that terrorism needs to be checked more on the security front than on the legal front. The recent attacks have exposed several weaknesses in our security machinery. Without tightening our security measures, changes in the law cannot be considered to be a positive step in combating terror, he says.        
	All in all, only time will tell whether the new anti-terror law will turn out to be yet another controversial piece of legislation, just like its predecessors.

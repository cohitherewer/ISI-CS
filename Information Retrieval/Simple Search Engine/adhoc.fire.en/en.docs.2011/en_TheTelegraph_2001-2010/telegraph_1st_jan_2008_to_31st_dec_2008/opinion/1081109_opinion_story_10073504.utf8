	A father at the movies                  
	Sir  Celebrity fathers do bizarre things to help their children. Kofi Annan herded 70 Nobel laureates to support his son after the latter was caught in the Food-for-Oil scam in 2005. Thankfully, Amartya Sen, our own Nobel laureate, only turned up to watch his daughter play Ravi Varmas muse in Ketan Mehtas film, Rang Rasiya (Papa Amartya proud of muse Nandana, Nov 1). But the Bollywood movie-goer is a strange animal, who might just take Sens appreciation of the film as a mark of its high intellectuality and low entertainment quotient. Nobel laureates have never got along too well with the Indian box office.           
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Motleb Ali, Calcutta 
        
	Biting army          
	Sir  Mosquitoes have unleashed a reign of terror in Calcutta. The city has been attacked by malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, meningoencephalitis and chikungunya. Nothing can be done about the deadly diseases, thanks to the extraordinary leadership of the mayor and his army in the municipalitys health department. We need a different army right now to free the city of the clutches of mosquitoes on the one hand and the incompetent corporation on the other.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De (Dutta), Agartala 

                
	Sir  Whatever be the sting toll (deaths caused by malaria, Japanese encephalitis and other such vector-borne diseases) in the state, it can hardly match up to the casualty figures related to arsenic contamination. According to a Jadavpur University research team, in nine districts of West Bengal, 42.7 million people suffer from arsenic contamination in the water they use. In 23.8 per cent of the 140,150 samples taken, the percentage of arsenic was as high as 48.1. Why have the media and social activists been indifferent to this danger? Is it because the arsenic victims are usually poor villagers?           
	Yours faithfully,         Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta  
	Sir  The news report, A life lost for Rs 40 (Nov 1) made me wonder whether we live in a 21st-century city or in the dark middle ages. But why blame just hospitals? All government establishments that offer public service  police stations, licensing authorities, local bodies, employment exchanges, ration shops  are linked by a chain of corruption. When a part or whole of this chain is brought into focus, the top administration first feigns ignorance and then promises to hold an enquiry whose report never sees the light of day. At times, I feel that this bulky non-performing administrative pyramid that we have may be done away with to save money, if for nothing else. I am sure its absence will not be noticed.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta

                          
	Unsung hero          
	Sir  Gajanan Shivsankar Hemmady, the champion badminton player of the Fifties, died recently, unnoticed by the sporting fraternity and the media alike. He was my batchmate at Jadavpur University. When we were students, Gaja was already a famous shuttler who would regale us with stories of playing top-seeded players in foreign lands. In those days prior to the television revolution, we scoured the sports pages to learn about Gajas matches. He hankered neither for money nor fame, even at the peak of his career, when he was ranked No. 4 in the world in singles, and No. 3 in doubles, partnering Manoj Guha. Even in death, he remained unsung. Hardly anyone from the press attended his memorial service. But the nonagenarian former chief minister of Bengal, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, came to pay his tribute and proved that the true sportsman lives in the hearts of true sports-lovers.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

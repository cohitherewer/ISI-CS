The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | As the going gets tough
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             AS THE GOING GETS TOUGH                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	India is a price-sensitive country and feels vulnerable with every small hike in the costs of goods and services since it has got used to a command economy that was subsidized, insular and inefficient, functioning on the whims of powers that were disconnected from real market forces. Adjusting to a free market and its fluctuations, living with its ups and downs are all an intrinsic part of an open economy. This recent rise in the prices of petrol and other oils and gas is far less than the real escalation. Beyond a point, rising subsidies too are inappropriate and consumers have to learn to pay for what they use.         
	The salaried class will genuinely feel the pinch and entrepreneurs will selfishly grumble because the price rise will cut into their large profits. This class has been wallowing in favours for a trifle too long and getting fat on subsidies. The opposition parties will loudly rattle their rhetoric in an effort to pull more votes towards themselves for all the wrong reasons. This is yet another way of exploiting our lack of knowledge about these critical issues that affect our lives.        
	Simplistic, foolish and angry retorts have been thrown at the Central government on the issue of price rise. The Left is doing what it is best at  trying to bring the government to its knees and pretending otherwise; the BJP spokesman has called the hike economic terrorism; and the Congress is, as usual, being unable to communicate its feelings to the people across all economic strata. The political space is polluted with the superficial rhetoric of untrustworthy leaders whose intellectual acumen leaves much to be desired. It is acutely disturbing to recognize the frightening reality that seems to be overwhelming us.                
	Deaf ears        
	There were two intelligent interventions on this particular issue that made clear the necessity of adjusting the price of oil. These two voices of reason were of the prime minister of India and of the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. On hearing them, one was expected to understand the rationale behind the governments decision. But their explanation seems to have fallen on deaf ears, as few among the warring political factions are willing to listen. One only hopes that the political class and its leaders would sit together, open their minds, step out of their rigid political ideologies and commit themselves to a growing, changing India while not sacrificing their intellectual integrity.         
	Continuous exploitation of our planet is compelling attitudinal change. Conservation is an essential tenet of modern living. It is necessary for ensuring our future security. Indian leaders have not even begun to comprehend the impending disaster as they run about serving themselves. They have been irresponsible in that they have failed to communicate this imminent assault of nature on man to their constituents. Parliamentarians need to be put through a course on conservation of the environment, both natural and man-made; conservation of human resource, the indigenous skills and expertise that characterize Bharat; conservation of values, ethics, integrity, honesty and much more. I am amazed that opponents of the ruling coalition never ask for bandhs  virtual holidays from work  on the topic of the corruption that plagues all levels of society.        
	Why are they silent on the subjects that have diseased India and exploited Bharat? If simple human dignities were in place, citizens would have taken the price hike in their stride. Maybe all the parliamentarians should set new austere standards by rationing their oil consumption, remaining in their respective constituencies when the sessions are in recess and doing some restoration work for the nation.

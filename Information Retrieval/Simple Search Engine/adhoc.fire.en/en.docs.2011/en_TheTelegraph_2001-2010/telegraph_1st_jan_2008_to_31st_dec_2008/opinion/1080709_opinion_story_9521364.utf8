	The suicide bombing into the gates of the Indian embassy in Kabul on Monday was perhaps the deadliest of its kind since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. Among the dead, numbering more than 40, were the Indian Foreign Service counsellor, V. Venkateswara Rao, and the defence attach, Brigadier R.D. Mehta, together with two guards from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, which has been on duty at the embassy in Kabul and other Afghan consulates since the end of 2002. Before India came up with any public voicing of suspicions, Afghanistans interior ministry stated that it believed the attack was carried out in coordination and consultation with an active intelligence service in the region. Hence, it becomes difficult for India to avoid rethinking its role in Afghanistan in relation to at least two regional equations: Indias relationship with Pakistan, and Pakistans relationship with Afghanistan. In both cases, the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and their elusive links with the shadowy al Qaida will also have to be kept central to the picture. Just last month, the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, had threatened to send troops across the Pakistan border to attack militants there if Pakistan did not take action. Most of the violence has been in the south and east, and in the lawless tribal area on Afghanistans border with Pakistan. The Indian embassy attack in Kabul shows a more alarming infiltration into an area hitherto seen as kept relatively safe by the presence of the central government and the various international troops still posted there. But the real measure of the Taliban resurgence is in the fact that in June, militants in Afghanistan killed more American and Nato troops than those in Iraq. Also, United Nations figures show that the number of civilians killed in Afghanistan has risen by almost two-thirds in the first half of this year compared with 2007.        
	Given this escalating grimness, and given that the question of withdrawal does not arise yet, India needs to think harder about how it will go ahead with its commitment to rebuild and develop Afghanistan as peacefully as practically possible. This is both the larger question of foreign policy and diplomatic strategy, and the more specific and urgent one of how to make the many Indians engaged in carrying out this commitment, at every level, feel physically more secure in Afghanistan.

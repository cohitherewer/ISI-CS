The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a prime minister
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A PRIME MINISTER                                                          
	There is a widespread illusion in India that governance is about winning elections and staying in office. All political parties are afflicted by this illusion. The fallout is that whenever a party in power is faced with the choice of taking a tough decision whose results threaten to be unpopular, the softest way out is taken as the option. The iron of the easy way out has so eaten into the soul of Indian politicians that most of them are aghast at Manmohan Singhs steadfast refusal to back out of the Indo-US nuclear deal. Their shock and amazement come from the fact that they know, as does Mr Singh, the price of going through the deal is in probability the fall of the United Progressive Alliance government. Mr Singh is thus willing to forfeit his prime ministership for a nuclear deal with the United States of America. Most Indian politicians cannot fathom this, just as they could not fathom Sonia Gandhis rejection of the countrys top job in 2004.        
	One principal reason for this plight of Indian politicians is that, over the years, governance has become bereft of principles. Another name for governance has become populism: the soft option, which, it is assumed, will please the maximum number of people. Nothing could be further from the idea of good governance than this kind of sacrifice of principles at the altar of the ballot box. Good governance is about taking the decision that is best for the country irrespective of the consequences. Mr Singh has chosen to do precisely this. He believes as the leader of the country that the Indo-US nuclear deal best serves the national interest, and therefore he has accorded to this deal the highest priority. What is equally important is that he is not willing to compromise on the matter. He knows that the Left allies will withdraw support from his government if he remains steadfast in his resolve to go ahead with the deal. Despite this, he has opted to put his perception of the national interest before all other considerations, including that of remaining in office. If reports are to be believed, then the prime minister has gone to the extent of saying that if the deal is abandoned he will quit office. This shows his commitment and his rectitude.        
	Mr Singh has demonstrated that governance is not about clinging to office. Governance is about carrying through certain policies. When he was finance minister under the prime ministership of P.V. Narasimha Rao, he initiated policies, in a crisis, that completely transformed the face and figure of the Indian economy. In the present conjuncture  also a crisis  Mr Singh has decided to stake his fame on a policy. The alternative before him was to go down in history as a prime minister who succumbed to political blackmail. Mr Singh knows it is better to live one day as a man rather than a thousand days as a coward. The Telegraph raises two cheers to Mr Singh for remaining firm. The third cheer will be raised when he signs the deal.

	There are few doctrines that stand out as boldly in economics textbooks as the one advocating competitive markets (or laissez faire systems) as the best possible means for allocating economic resources. Tightly stated by academics, the doctrine holds only under strict conditions, many of which are ignored both by laissez faire enthusiasts as well as their detractors. The clearest statement of the result is to be found in the works of Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu, both Nobel laureates in economics. They gave due recognition to uncertainty, one of the trickiest aspects of the real world. Economic calculations involve forecasting the future (such as the values of interest rates on fixed deposits, the Sensex or the exchange rate a week from today). Actions based on inadequate knowledge of market variables are likely to lead to sub-optimal results, especially when expectations are not fulfilled.         
	The upheaval surrounding the world financial markets right now is an obvious example of the enormity of the problem. At the time Lehman Brothers was raising (that is, leveraging) its debt-asset ratio to mind-boggling levels (30:1), it was little aware of the fact that house prices were poised for a sharp decline. When the decline occurred, it led house purchasers to foreclose their mortgages, since their houses turned into weak assets in comparison to their loan repayment obligations. The vastly lower-priced houses passed into the possession of Lehman Brothers and similar organizations. And since the market prices they commanded shrunk to minuscule levels relative to Lehman Brothers debt liabilities, the investment bank too went bankrupt. As is well-known now, the assets (or IOUs) held by Lehman Brothers creditors all across the world turned toxic in consequence and a chain reaction ensued engulfing the world in what has been described as a financial meltdown.               
	How did the Arrow-Debreu proposition avoid uncertainty-related problems? It assumed the existence of competitive insurance markets to deal with all possible contingencies. However, it admitted only finitely many contingencies at best, even if large. Economic agents were assumed to be aware of the details of each such contingency should it arise, but they did not know which of them would actually show up. They were insured against each one of the contingencies, however, and this was what prevented markets from going haywire.         
	A 1933 law enacted by the American Congress insuring bank deposits under President Roosevelts New Deal was an example of the insurance contracts Arrow and Debreu proposed much later. John Kenneth Galbraith observed that deposit insurance remedied a grievous defect in free market economics, and that rarely had so much been accomplished by a single law. A bank failure though is only one possible contingency that an economy might prepare to face. The real world, unfortunately, is far too complex for all contingencies to be known in advance or insured against. Even if the nature of contingencies could be fully outlined, too many such eventualities are likely to exist vis--vis the number of insurance contracts coming forth. In the language of economic theory, the insurance market structure is necessarily incomplete. Consequently, no serious academic believes markets to be a panacea for every economic woe.        
	The best possible example of academic concern for market failure in the face of uncertainties may be found in the work of John Maynard Keynes, who is best remembered for his analysis of the Great Depression. When uncertainties are too severe, Keynes observed that economic agents turn wary of carrying out large-scale expenditure and hold on to whatever money they possess in the form of idle cash. When such situations prevail, pure monetary policies, such as reductions in the repo rate, the reverse repo rate or the cash-reserve ratio, cannot resuscitate the economies. The economy may be flooded with money supply, but Neither lender nor borrower be could continue to be the only piece of wisdom guiding the financial sector as well as industrial houses and households.         
	In the absence of excessive doubts about the future, competitive markets function reasonably well without government participation, even when a massive part of the world of contingencies remains uninsured. Trouble begins though when economies drift, by acts of omission or commission, into uninsurable regions. Put dramatically, there could be uncertainties that are so unclearly understood that an insurance covering them would itself need to be insured. And then the insurer for the insurer would require yet another insurance for himself and so on in an infinite sequence. This is an absurd requirement to say the least.         
	Insurance markets being necessarily incomplete, proactive economic policy needs to fill out the gaps. In particular, when financial markets are trapped in a confidence crisis, real demand management and growth turn into serious economic problems and the government has little choice other than initiating fiscal measures to insure failing markets. This requires it to undertake demand generation directly, alongside private agents, either through taxation or money creation. Keynes, too, advocated direct government expenditure on private produce for generating demand, and hence business confidence, in economies caught in an idle cash trap.         
	The route through which such expenditure might revive the economy was analysed quite brilliantly by Michael Kalecki too. Kalecki outlined how expenditure on commodities produced by the private sector generates profits as well as wages. The wages create employment on the one hand, but, more importantly, further expenditure on mass consumption goods, since workers are more prone to spend on consumption than profit earners. An initial government expenditure therefore leads to a multiplier chain of profit and wage creation. The wages create employment immediately and the profits can regenerate confidence for the business sector and lead it to spend on new investment schemes, as Keynes would have argued. It is only when such circumstances develop that both consumers and entrepreneurs could be lured back to lending institutions to meet the objectives of the governments money-creation policy.               
	Till such time though, there is little sense in identifying the cause of economic slowdown in a liquidity crunch. Immediately following the recent economic package though, the Planning Commissions deputy chairman announced, in unequivocal terms, that the major problem with the Indian economy at the moment lies in reduced liquidity. The reduction in the reverse repo rate announced by the package then should induce banks not to park their excess liquidity with the Reserve Bank of India, and use it instead to support business investment as well as consumer borrowing. The fact that the commercial banks were unimpressed by this diagnosis of the problem was proved the very next day, when the banks deposited an additional Rs 27,000 crore with the RBI despite the reduction in the reverse repo rate.         
	Quite apart from the error in the repo rate policy, the price cuts expected to result from tax reductions need not have as large an impact on the economy either. In particular, it does not stand to reason that the export sector would gain through price reductions. Foreigners need to import more for our exporters to be happy, but the world economy is itself passing through a depression and our price cuts are unlikely to boost foreign demand. Similarly, housing loans may remain unutilized due to a borrowing aversion. The only two policies amongst the ones announced, that are likely to have immediate impact on demand are the ones linked to infrastructure building through tax-free bonds and the decision to allow government departments to replace vehicles. However, for the economic slowdown to be arrested, more demand generating policies are called for.        
	There is little doubt that the government has now realized the need for direct expenditure, even if it leads to budget deficits. Creating money through expenditure-backed budget deficits is a better proxy for the insurance markets than liquidity boosts through RBI action.

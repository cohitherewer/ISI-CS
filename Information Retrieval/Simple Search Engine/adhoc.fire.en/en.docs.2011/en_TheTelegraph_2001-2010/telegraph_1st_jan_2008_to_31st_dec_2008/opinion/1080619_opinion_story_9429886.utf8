Mukul Kesavan                                                      
	Over the last ten years, Ive noticed that more and more people point at undistinguished plants and call them by their names as if they were friends. So, Look at that croton! isnt uncommon, and its said with an excitement that is hard to understand. Similarly, Is that a crocus? is freighted with more feeling than anything that small and weed-like should inspire. This would be understandable if these were young people, fresh from studying a contemporary subject like Environmental Science, or botanists professionally keen on plants, but most of the people who go on like this are middle-aged types, roughly my age, with no disciplinary connection to the natural world.         
	And it isnt just plants. The number of contemporaries I know who will interrupt lunch to point at a blue-throated bird going about its business, or generally name-drop birds in the course of a conversation thats otherwise bird-free, is staggering. I dont object to people knowing more about birds and plants and trees than I do, any more than I begrudge stamp-collectors their knowledge of philately. What I am beginning to resent is the unspoken implication that people like me, who arent on first-name terms with crocuses or lesser bustards, are diminished creatures, unplugged from Gaia and the Web of Life. Please.              
	For most middle-class urban Indians, trees and plants are outside furniture made out of living wood. Likewise, gardening is an outdoor form of interior dcor: the marshalling of good-looking objects in different colours and textures into pleasing arrangements. When I was a child, the lady of the house knew the names of the plants she needed to buy from nurseries, but these were generally desi terms or the pidgin forms of foreign names like kakascoma, which is mali-speak for coxcomb. Outside of gardening, city-bred Indians generally knew the names of half-a-dozen trees, the same number of birds (give or take one or two) and still managed to lead fulfilled lives.         
	As a child, my friends and I could recognize six kinds of tree: banyan, peepul, mango, neem, imli and gulmohar. As I grew older I added the ashok tree, the guava, the custard apple (or shareefa) and the amaltas to that list, so now I can name ten different trees in decent light which, youll admit, is as large a portfolio of trees as you need for normal life. I said as much, in an unguarded way, to someone I barely knew, and this person took it upon herself to smile encouragingly and ask me if I knew that two of these trees, the peepul and the banyan, both belonged to the same genus, Ficus, and were, therefore, actually fig trees?        
	Of course I didnt, but mark the presumption behind the teacherly question. In polite society, it isnt civil to go about educating your contemporaries about the world; an exception seems to have been made in the case of nature. The irony is that the information dispensed about the genus and so forth is actually bad for the layperson. Given that I can tell the peepul and the banyan apart, and given the fact that I have a real fig tree in the garden that I can recognize when its putting out fruit, what purpose is served by muddling the matter and pretending that theyre all basically the same sort of tree? Unless I was a mad botanist planning to mate peepuls to banyans, why would I want to know how theyre related?         
	I can see the point of being interested in a plant for a specific purpose. If you were planning to write a novel about the Sundarbans, like Amitav Ghoshs The Hungry Tide, youd want to bone up on the mangrove. Or if you were a forest officer battling Dutch elm disease. I was in Australia once, and a forest warden told me that there were four hundred different sorts of eucalyptus tree. Now I can see why hed have to know how to tell one from another because his special charge, the koala bear, only ate the leaves of three or four kinds. But otherwise? Quiz nerds apart, what sort of person would be able to tell eucalyptuses apart? (Eucalypti?) Its exactly the same with crotons. Unless youre a competitive gardener, the ability to tell crotons apart ought to be considered a treatable condition. That, or a sign that the person concerned has more leisure time than is good for her.               
	In the old days, nature study and bird-watching were sensibly classed as hobbies, particularly good for people with obsessive tendencies. They were forms of therapy for solitary people, and much good has come of them: think of Darwin. But for the rest of us, familiarity with commonplace creatures is enough. Here again, the rule of six is a good one. My childhood was stocked with pigeons, crows, sparrows, kites (which we called eagles), vultures and peacocks. And because I grew up with them, I miss house sparrows which had to be chased out of rooms in summer, for fear of the ceiling fans killing them. I miss vultures too. In Delhi, they used to sit right on top of tall trees near Kashmiri Gate, looking tired. Pesticides seem to have done for them. But the point of the story is that I miss them because they were a part of my everyday life: whats the sense in training yourself to spot birds that youll barely see?        
	The things that are useful or interesting about nature are generally obvious. For example, I learnt that English trees are different from Indian trees in a crucial way. Indian trees have trunks that grow for a decent interval before they branch out. So you have the trunk on its own for a few metres before the bushy top part begins. Lots of English trees arent like that. They branch out low to the ground and taper upwards like long skirts, so often you cant use them like Indian trees. You can neither stand under the foliage nor belly up to the trunk.         
	Naipaul has a nice line somewhere about how pointless it is for the writer to know specialist descriptive terms, words that describe parts of furniture or bits of buildings that the English always seem to know, words like transom or wainscoting. It adds nothing useful to the writers vocabulary, being merely a kind of knowingness. For people like us, lay people, diversifying beyond everyday nature is a waste of time. We dont need to cram up the names of exotic flowers: roses, pansies, dogflowers, shoe flowers, and marigolds will do nicely. Assaulted by the knowledge of our nerdy friends, we can take comfort in Kingsley Amiss important truth: nature is green.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

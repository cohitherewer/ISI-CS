	The third edition of Little Thespians Katha Collage, currently on at Padatiks Buildwell Theatre (somewhat leaky in the rains), synchronized with Rabindra Jayanti festivities last month, and appropriately featured two Tagore short stories. The series so far has made it a norm to include at least three tales on every bill, and to have just two does seem a little thin. To its credit, however, the group has turned bilingual, enacting one in Bengali and the other in its preferred language, Urdu.        
	Uma Jhunjhunwala, the director, follows their earlier technique of presenting fiction verbatim, instead of representing it through the usual transformative process of dramatization. Such a reliance on narration tends to drag because what works in one medium cannot possibly work in another, but in Tagores case the difficulty sometimes does not arise since several of his stories contain substantial direct speech, making their transference to the stage much easier. Indeed, if we compare Shesher Ratri with Durasha, we see that the former takes to theatre naturally, as it has much more dialogue; the latter is more laborious. No wonder Tagore himself dramatized Shesher Ratri into the full-length Grihaprabesh.        
	Both stories deal with devoted, selfless love and end sadly. Shesher Ratri (picture) shows the dying Jatin blindly enamoured of his wife, who cares nothing for him and leaves his bedside for her parental home, while his aunt covers up her absence to prevent him from realizing the truth. Little Thespian just about sidesteps the maudlin quality that often undermines this story, the Bengali cast performing naturally rather than melodramatically.        
	Durasha finds the experienced pair of Azhar Aalam and Heena Parvez a bit at sea in theatricalizing the male storytellers account of his chance meeting with a former Muslim princess, who converted to Hinduism for the love of a Brahmin. He repudiated her for her religion, only to discover decades later that he had eventually married a Bhutia woman. Curiously, both held back as actors, even dropping the climax in which she wipes the Brahmins feet with her hair and kisses them in abject surrender. Tagores Bengali narrator had trouble conversing with her in chaste Urdu, which Azhar obviously does not, so the original humour is lost, too.        
	Another dramatization, this time in Hindi, is Renaissances Gardish, adapted from Karel Capek. This is a cross between Gogol, Kafka and Dario Fo, sending up the idiocy of a police administration servilely fawning on its superiors, while brutally suppressing its powerless wards. Playwright and director Avinash Gupta Indianizes it quite effectively into local conditions, creating some biting satire, but his emphasis on farce ultimately goes over the top.

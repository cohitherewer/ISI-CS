The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE
                                                                                                                 FALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	And, once again, we have the Congress making the same old announcements about political responsibilities. Suresh Pachauri has been asked to head the party unit in Madhya Pradesh, and, to appease the ageing and infirm war-horse Arjun Singh, his son, Ajay, has been anointed the 'person in charge' for the forthcoming elections in the state. It is a compromise that will certainly result in ruining the party's strategies and cohesive plans that are essential to win the state polls decisively.         
	Very little seems to have changed. The same rhetoric, the same sparse intellectual inputs, the same superficial strategies, the same disgust for anything 'new' that would bring in its wake change and a movement forward. The outcome too will be predictable and sad because it will embarrass the party further and precipitate its slide into the realm of the inconsequential in the context of present political realities in an emerging India.        
	Then, to boot, some of these men are well past their prime and are now looking for a second stint in the Rajya Sabha for themselves because they are incapable of winning a Lok Sabha election. Why then are they put at the helm of the decision-making process during elections? These men and women are completely removed from the ground realities, and this was proven during the electoral debacles in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Neither Ahmed Patel nor R.K. Dhawan or Vidya Stokes is capable of facing the challenges that are there for all to see, or create innovative mechanisms and structures to ensure that party workers remain accountable, because they themselves have never been able to win a constituency.                
	Bitter truth        
	Sahibs sitting in government guest houses, instructing a few minions, cannot engage with the people. Nor can they win the people over to their side. Their arrogance reflects a supreme betrayal on their part of the party. To be able to enter the sanctorum with ease and manage to influence the rulers with half-truths is not to win elections.        
	The rapid decline of the Congress is unfortunate. It stems from the inability of its leadership to purge the party of those who have become redundant, who have selfishly lived off our land for decades, who have actively lobbied and prevented the party from reinventing itself by reaching out to a new and energetic generation. The rotting skin is waiting to be shed, to allow the clean and new layer beneath to breathe. Someone needs to wield the whip, take the risk, rid the party of the failed baggage and start from scratch.        
	Look at the Opposition.Whether you like it or not, the reality is that Mayavati works like a Trojan horse night and day, leaving no stone unturned in her race to Delhi. Mulayam Singh Yadav continues to work relentlessly to regain lost ground. Vasundhara Raje is also determined to win another term. Narendra Modi has already shown a lot of promise, and before we know it, he will be hailed, ironically, as the saviour of the tribals and also of the Muslims! Naveen Patnaik, an austere and upright politician, remains the undisputed leader of his people.        
	Who are the counterparts in the Congress to these active members in national politics, who can challenge and defeat the present incumbents for the right reasons? Why has the Congress not empowered its leaders? Why are Congressmen perceived as dwarfs by the people when positioned against leaders from other parties? Does their insecurity generate negative behaviour patterns in the Congress rank and file, to the detriment of the party? If the people can see the truth about the state of affairs in India's Grand Old Party, surely its high command can see it too. What stops it from correcting things when there is absolutely nothing to lose? Bewildering.

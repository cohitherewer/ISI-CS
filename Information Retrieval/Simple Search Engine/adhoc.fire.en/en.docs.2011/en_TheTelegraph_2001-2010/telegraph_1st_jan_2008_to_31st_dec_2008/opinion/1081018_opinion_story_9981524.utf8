	A three-day-long classical dance festival was organized by Dover Lane Music Conference and Dover Lane Music Academy at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar between September 15-17. Featuring upcoming and established dancers from Calcutta and other cities, the inaugural day presented Kirti Ramgopal, a talented Bharatnatyam dancer from Bangalore. A disciple of Padmini Ramachandran, the artist began her recital with ganesh kauthuvam. After creating a suitable ambience through this invocation, she moved on to varnam, the most crucial element of the Bharatnatyam repertoire, where both the sense of rhythm and the power of expression of a performer can be assessed. To praise the glory of Vishnu in this item, the dancer narrated episodes from dashavatar and Draupadis vastraharan. The strength and beauty of the supreme cause behind the universe was beautifully depicted in graceful movements and subtle expressions. She concluded her recital with krishnani beganee baro, an abhinaya item that is almost synonymous with Bala Saraswati, the doyen of Bharatnatyam.        
	Nivedita Mukherjee choreographed Bhanu Singher Padabali. Based on the Odissi style, it was not a proper selection for a festival where other dancers had to be accommodated on the same evening. Due to the time constraint, an incomplete presentation spoiled the choreographers entire effort. The most enjoyable performance came from Manisha Nayak, a passionate Kathak dancer from Delhi (picture). The nature of Kathak demands live accompaniment, with instant improvization. Nayak, trained by Rajendra Gangani, kept the intrinsic charm of Kathak intact, even with the pre-recorded music, with her well-rehearsed, flawless performance. Based on teental, the artist explored nuances of the various stances or thaat, followed by the abhinaya, pashyati dishi dishi, from Geetgovindam. An abstract musical pattern was painted in the sargam, where the dancers understanding of the form was remarkably complemented by strong footwork, high-speed chakkars and fluid motions. Sagarika Debnath, another Kathak dancer, presented traditional numbers based on dhamar under the guidance of Ramaprasad Chattopadhyay.         
	The only Kuchipudi dancer was Anjana. S. Mohanan. This young dancer has an inherent grace, an essential quality any classical dancer ought to have. Adrija Banerjee, a student of Anita Mullick, gave an impressive Bharatnatyam recital. Rajiv Bhattacharya and Rohini Banerjee were the other participatants. The festival ended with a group presentation by Preeti Patel, a senior Manipuri dancer.

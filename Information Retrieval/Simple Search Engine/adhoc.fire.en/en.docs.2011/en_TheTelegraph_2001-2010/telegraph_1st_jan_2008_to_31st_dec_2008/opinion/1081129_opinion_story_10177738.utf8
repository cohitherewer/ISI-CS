The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rather be clever than dumb
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RATHER BE CLEVER THAN DUMB                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh      
	Many who were in the Indian foreign or administrative services have joined politics and became more famous, or infamous. Syed Shahabuddin, who quit the IFS, became a member of parliament. Now he edits the Milli Gazette that talks about problems faced by Indian Muslims. Mani Shankar Aiyar, too, quit the foreign service. He was twice elected to the Lok Sabha and is now a cabinet minister. Yashwant Sinha quit the IAS, was elected to the Lok Sabha and became a high-profile minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayees government. Natwar Singh, a former member of the IFS, was the foreign minister in the present United Progressive Alliance government, led by his party, the Congress, till he was embroiled in a scandal. He ditched his old friends and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. Then he left the BJP to join Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, from which he was recently thrown out.        
	But there are others who renounced prestigious administrative ranks to pursue vocations of their choice. One of them is Ajay Singh Yadav, who gave up the IAS in 1998. His autobiography, Why I Am Not a Civil Servant, says why he did so. His latest work is Forty Four Poems. The poems are pleasant to read. Here are a few stanzas from the one which talks about the transition of a babu to a neta:        
	Socialism is my partys official creed,        
	An old omnibus in which all sorts can ride.        
	Former commissars and RSS men        
	All sitting amicably, side by side.                
	Actually it does not matter what you believe,        
	The important thing is what you profess.        
	Socialism is rather chic        
	And goes down well with the English-language press.        
	Ideological purity, in any case        
	Has now gone rather out of date        
	Who can afford the luxury of principles        
	When he has to win the peoples mandate.        
	In politics what counts is management.        
	Thats a game in which I am rather skilled.        
	Who remembers how much power you generate,        
	Or how many roads you build.                
	What counts is promise notperformance        
	In my book thats a rule of thumb        
	You may think I am being clever,        
	But I would rather be clever than         
	dumb.                          Stars on shelves       
	Readers choice                
	It has been the best year for books written in English by Indians and Pakistani authors. This applies to both fiction and non-fiction. I read around forty books every year. I note down their titles and the authors names in the last two pages of my diary and put stars against those that have impressed me. This year, I found I that the number of books to which I have awarded the star-status far exceeded last years count.        
	Some fictions were remarkable. There was Amitav Ghoshs Sea of Poppies, his best work so far. I think it should have won the Booker. Instead, the award went to Aravind Adigas The White Tiger. It is highly readable, thanks to its clear prose, satire and humour. But it leaves a bad taste in the mouth because it has only nasty things to say about India . I preferred Adigas collection of short stories, Between the Assassinations. With a bit of luck and hard work, he should be able to dominate the Indian literary scene for some time. Another Indian who has earned a name and fame for herself by winning the Pulitzer Prize for Interpreter of Maladies is Jhumpa Lahiri, who lives in New York. Her latest collection, Unaccustomed Earth, though on the same theme of migr Bengalis in America seeking out each other as her earlier work, has some outstanding short stories. Lets hope she widens the range of subjects.        
	Pakistani fiction writers have turned to Indian publishers as they have none worth their while in their own country. A remarkably good one was Moni Mohsins first novel, The End of Innocence, based on a country estate owned by her parents near Lahore. Another good novel, made of fiction and facts, was Mohammed Hanifs A Case of Exploding Mangoes, based on the assassination of General Zia-ul Haq. Equally interesting was Twilight by Azhar Abidi, on the disillusionment of well-to-do Indian-Muslim families that migrated to Karachi hoping to create a modern Muslim society and then losing out to mullah bigotry.        
	My list of non-fiction, however, is entirely Indian. First came Goodbye Shahzadi, on the life and assassination of Benazir Bhutto, by Shyam Bhatia. Next appeared Behenji, on Mayavati, by Ajoy Bose, to be followed by Navtej Sarnas The Exile that gives thorough insights into the life of the last Sikh maharajah, Dalip Singh, and Ajit Bhattacharjeas Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah: Tragic Hero of Kashmir. I found all of them informative and absorbing.        
	There were also a couple of books which I enjoyed but which didnt figure in the above-mentioned categories. For nature lovers, there was Wild City: Nature Wonders Next Door by Ranjit Lal and Good Night and God Bless by Anita Nair.        
	At the end, I must add some words of caution. I am no longer able to visit bookstores, browse their shelves and buy what I fancy or heard praised. My reading is restricted to what publishers or authors send me, hoping I will say something about them in my columns. I do the best I can.

	The untitled black-and-white photographs in Shahid Datawalas exhibition (Shadow Boxing, December 5-13, The Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre) compel the viewer to reimagine Bombay as an urban space. The collective Indian imaginary often perceives Bombay as a metropolis teeming with people, crowded trains and cramped houses, the invisible boundaries of the city being stretched and contracted by the momentum of a constant shuttling. Datawalas images, however, reinvent Bombay as an empty, still city. This metamorphosis has nothing to do with whim or fantasy. The elements that make up Datawalas photographs  crumbling, abandoned houses, dangling wires from yanked-off switchboards, stained walls, leaking pipes, landings laden with filth, each of them juxtaposed with what seems to be its mirror image  speak of a spectral presence of people, architecture, and ways of life that can be returned to, and perhaps even reclaimed.        
	What is remarkable about Datawalas engagement with this wilful erasure, this loss, is its unsentimental quality. Datawala, here, is recounting what could be a series of urban tragedies by recording once-inhabited ruins that are being forced to the peripheries of the city and its memory by a burgeoning and socially divided urban sprawl. The giant concrete blocks that continue to replace quaint old structures, Datawala seems to suggest, are the manifestations of a devious, all-consuming greed that is the hallmark of our cities.         
	The 80-odd photographs in the collection have been paired as 40 diptychs. So the tension between each seemingly contrasting pair is made fairly evident. The settings may not necessarily be in opposition, but the juxtaposition operates at various levels, each exposing the duality that is intrinsic to cities: rich and poor, exclusion and inclusion. Hence we have the long shot of the low-roofed congestion of a chawl beside the image of a spotless highrise. Next, a portion of a wall stands on grounds choking with brambles (picture, left). There is a tree behind it, its roots and branches snaking their way across the structure, holding it in a death-like embrace. The edifice stands for neglect and exclusion. Paired with it is the picture of a tall, vertical building, seen through a clump of leaves and branches, a space full of life, and meant for those included in the arc of prosperity (picture, right).         
	Occasionally, Datawala also plays with the idea of constricted space, and a release from it through its absence. In one photograph, we glimpse a portion of the sky and, below it, a suffocating enclosure hemmed in on three sides by a massive building. Right next to it is the picture of an open window with curtains, a few flower-pots on the ledge below: a telling pairing of the regulated with the unfettered.        
	There is also a premonitory quality in Datawalas works. Consider the diptych of an impeccably laid out landing and another that shows the plaster peeling off from the walls. It suggests the passage of time, the inevitability of decay and death. Datawala also makes skilful use of visual metaphors, like the circling birds seen in many of the images. They leave us with an ominous feeling, as if these winged creatures are agents of doom in search of carrion, which, in this context, happens to be the deserted spaces and structures of the city.        
	In style and tone, Datawalas images borrow many elements from the Cubist tradition. There is a sense of geometry, a symmetry in the lines, the shape of the walls and structures, the elevation of the stairs and pipes that he photographs. Some of the images use a crisp light, employ unconventional angles and convey a sense of abstraction. What Datawala also succeeds in exposing are the continuities that bind a citys schizophrenic components. Be it Bombay or Delhi, structures and spaces that have been disowned and discarded continue to exist along with those that symbolize the urban dream. Datawalas photographs force these abandoned entities back into our consciousness, raising uncomfortable questions about the dream that we are chasing.        
	Admittedly, Datawala isnt exactly breaking original ground here. The horror and beauty of Indian urbanity, forgotten, in between architectural spaces and landscapes, the conniving State and so on are themes that have been explored and recorded by other photographers such as Bharat Sikka. Yet, Datawala should be credited for burrowing through the debris to reveal the unsavoury truths that need to be confronted and reflected upon.

	 Things will never be the same for the former CM of UP, Kalyan Singh. He is mightily upset over the fact that the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, is trying to tie up with Ajit Singh in western UP. Kalyanji is thinking of throwing in his lot with the Samajwadi Party, and while his former BJP colleagues were debating their poll strategy in Bangalore, he was busy talking to Mulayam Yadav. The latter would love to have Kalyan Singh on his side to rock the boat of Mayavati, who is trying to lure the Lodh voters of Mulayams stronghold. Mulayam is certain that a backward caste leader of Kalyans stature could work his magic in western and central UP the same way he had done for his own Rashtriya Krantikari Party in the 2002 assembly elections after quitting the BJP. The BJPs defeat in 25 seats had ensured the chief ministerial chair for Mulayam. Kalyanji, however, wants his pound of flesh this time. He has demanded that Mulayam should have no truck with Ajit Singh. Is that a deal then?                        
	 The devil must be given his due. The Union home minister may be completely out of sync with home affairs, but he is fully aware of the home truths. Take the young Congress leaderships dislike of the Samajwadi mover and shaker, Amar Singh. Which is why Shivraj Patil needed no prompting to snub the Samajwadi leader when he recently called up Patil to complain about blackmail. The home minister is said to have asked Singh to go to the nearest police station. The Samajwadi gen-sec apparently repeatedly tried to impress on Patil the seriousness of the issue by mentioning several times Main Amar Singh bol rahaan hoon, but the minister was unfazed. And dont we know how infuriating that can be?                            
	 More home truths. Last wish is definitely not the final wish. At least that is what the Andhra Pradesh governor, Narain Dutt Tiwari, has made plain. The last last wish of the former CM of Uttarakhand was to be made governor. Since that has been fulfilled, Tiwari has dared another last wish. He wants the Congress to allow him to contest from Lucknow. Tiwari is confident he can deliver because this time the sitting MP, AB Vajpayee will not be contesting. But there are others wishing the same  Salman Khurshid, Shabana Azmi                            
	 An unwritten rule bars members of the governing board of directors of the State Bank of India to go for two successive six-year terms. Suman Bery resigned from the board a few months short of the end of his term, but was soon back with a re-election. Upon learning that Bery was about to start a second successive term, the finance minister, P Chidambaram, saw to it that he stepped down. He has been replaced by Rajiv Kumar, director of the Indian Council for Research and International Economic Relations. Talking of the ICRIER, that too is not new to irregularities. Some of its honorary heads supposedly occupy its offices full time while having plum advisory assignments elsewhere.                            
	 Now that the nuclear deal is in place, Pranab Mukherjee can breathe a sigh of relief and occupy himself with pursuits of his own. To his great joy, Pranabda got an opportunity to return to his former profession  teaching. The ex-teacher of political science recently lectured students in Sagardighi College in Murshidabad. It was almost evening when mastermoshai arrived, but he still got a bunch of eager students in the class. Once a politician, always a politician. In class, Pranabda is known to have told his students that for now they were his students and he their teacher. But in a few days, he will be their student and will expect marks to be given via ballot.                             
	 Shes the non-resident Amma, and arbiter of the fate of many like the Congress state unit chief, KV Thangabalu. Sonia Gandhi was recently asked to consider the prospect of sharing power in Tamil Nadu with the DMK in the same way that the DMK shares power with the Congress at the Centre. Getting a whiff of Thangabalus plans, M Karunanidhi has already dared the Congress to approach him with such a request and face the consequences. But that is not what is discouraging Madam from giving Thangabalus suggestion a thought. Sonia, apparently, is weighing the options of dumping the DMK and going with the AIADMK before or after the polls. Perhaps its time for another tea party!                        
	 With brother Rahul Mahajan safely  or not so safely at times  locked up in the Big Boss house, Poonam Mahajan must be feeling quite relaxed. One indication of this is that she has turned to politics more seriously, and it is almost certain that she will be the BJPs candidate against Milind Deora from south Mumbai in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Poonams uncle, Gopinath Munde, claims to have got both the BJP and Shiv Sena to agree to her candidature. But one sticky area remains in the form of the former BJP MP, Jaywantiben Mehta. She has been wondering aloud how Munde could make such pronouncements when she has not ruled herself out. Poonam, on her part, wants no controversies to nip her political ambition in the bud. Currently camping in Rajasthan for the assembly elections, Poonam has, like a good Bharatiya beti, stated that she will abide by the party high commands (read parivars) decision.

	Two brothers quarrel over property and approach a court. It asks them to go to their mother. It is a strange suggestion. But then, courts are a law unto themselves; and Indian courts are known to set precedents for the entire world. The unusual remark reflects the extreme frustration of the Bombay High Court with the squabbles of Ambani brothers; and the frustration is not the judges alone. As he remarked, the dispute before the court is so serious that it may affect the state of the economy. It relates to the division of gas offshore Krishna-Godavari basin that was discovered by and hence belongs to the Reliance Industries that existed before the two brothers split. The split has been documented and defined by a memorandum of understanding between them. Anil Ambani claims that the memorandum gives him a share in the gas that may come out of the wells; this has not been denied by his opponent. But Mr Anil Ambani cannot use the gas, for he has no industry that can use gas. He therefore would like to sell his share to whomever he wishes. His opponent, Mukesh Ambani, denies his right to do so.         
	It would seem that the matter was quite straightforward; they must follow whatever they have agreed in the memorandum. But Mr Mukesh Ambanis counsel failed to show the memorandum to the court; Mr Anil Ambanis counsel leaked selected tidbits from it to the court. Those well-chosen words presumably tell the truth, for if they did not, Mr Mukesh Ambanis expensive counsel would gleefully jump on them. But they obviously do not tell the whole truth, known only to the two brothers. The onus for baring it lies entirely upon Mr Anil Ambanis shoulders, so argues his opponents counsel. His own counsel, on the other hand, sees no reason why they should disclose any more than supports their case. That is where the case rested last week; and that is when the exasperated judge made his obitur dictum.         
	If the two brothers followed his advice, they might perhaps get over the present hurdle. Mothers are a godsend. But they are not there forever; at some point, not far in the future, the brothers would need to work out a modus vivendi that did not require the intermittent presence of their mother. It is a pity that the scions of Indias most famous industrialist cannot settle matters between themselves. Because Dhirubhai Ambani built an empire whose revenue today exceeds a thirtieth of Indias national income, their petty quarrels have a major impact on the nations fortunes. In another age, their refusal to grow up would have justified nationalization of their respective empires. In modern times, if they squander away their patrimony, the market value of their companies would shrivel, and more sensible industrialists might buy them up. But that could take decades; till then, their shareholders must suffer for the bad brotherly blood.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Home for Christmas
                                                                                                              HOME FOR CHRISTMAS                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Yuletide spirit                                        
	Christmas festivity is no longer confined to Christians and has lost much of its religious content. Every year, fewer practising Christians attend midnight mass or even bother to go to church. However, it has become the main celebration of the year, the time to sing carols, spend extravagantly on presents, indulge in meat-eating orgies  gobbling up turkeys and washing them down with vintage wines. All stores are festooned with suitable emblemsChristmas trees, Santa Clauses, coloured lights and much else. You can find this from Japan in the Far East to California in the Far West, from Iceland in the North to South Africa, Australia and New Zealand in the South. It is evidently the Disneyfication of Christianity as Don Cupitt described it.        
	My shrunken family and circle of friends of whom none is Christian but many are Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or of no faith, celebrate Christmas in our own fashion as we do joyous festivals like Diwali, Holi and Id-ul Fitr. On Diwali we light oil lamps and indulge in wild infusions of inebriants forbidden by the law  the sort of thing which landed my esteemed friend Jaswant Singh, Bharatiya Janata Partys foreign minister, in a spot of trouble. On Holi, we are less inhibited and try out bhang. On Id-ul-Fitr I receive plates of siveyyan (vermicelli), and I send something back as the customary Eidee (gift). The occasion provides me with the excuse to embrace lady visitors three times while repeating Eid Mubarak. On Christmas eve I wake up in a festive mood crowing Irving Berlins song: I am dreaming of a white Christmas / Just like the ones I used to know. I put on a cassette of Christmas carols and get soulful when it comes to Stilly night, holy night, and joyful when it comes to Holly and the ivy. I ring up my Christian friends living in distant parts of the country and wish them Merry Christmas.        
	Celebrations really begin after sunset. My friend and neighbour, Reeta Devi Verma of Coochbehar, a neo-Buddhist of the Osho school, instals a miniature Christmas tree in my sitting-room. She also plants a Santa Claus made in China alongside the tree and presses a button. The Chinese Santa waves his head and plays Jingle bells on his clarinet. We light a log fire in the grate. By this time a Christmas feast prepared by Claire Dutt (easily the worlds best maker of Christmas fare) is delivered. It is usually capon stuffed with chestnuts and a pudding laced with rum. We begin with Scotch, have vintage wines with our downer, Cointreau or Drambuie after the pudding; some men light cigars, others take second or third rounds of liqueurs. This goes on well after my usual time for bed. I dont mind, I remind myself that after all Christmas comes only once in the year. So I wish everyone a very merry Xmas and a happier 2008.                
	Where is Taslima?                
	Very few people know of her whereabouts in Delhi. She does not want to be in hiding but the police take good care that she remains underground. A few people who have been able to break through the police cordon and talk to her say she is very unhappy with the way she is being kept in seclusion. Her telephone is tapped; every visitor screened and most turned back. She is not allowed to go and meet friends. She is constantly advised to return to Sweden. Is this fair? Must we buckle down to threats from bigots who keep pronouncing fatwas against people who they imagine to have demeaned their faith?         
	Taslima has not written a word against Islam; only criticized Muslim intolerance towards the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. She has every right to do so, as we have the right to criticize our government when it allows discrimination against the Muslim minority in India. Indias best known painter, M.F. Husain, is living in exile because some Hindu bigots feel that his paintings offend their religious susceptibilities and keep filing cases against him. This is shameful.        
	It is time our government granted Indian citizenship to Taslima Nasreen with the liberty to live in Calcutta or wherever she feels comfortable. The West Bengal chief minister, a self-proclaimed patron of letters, has egg on his face for his treatment of her. She has to be given full police protection against mischief-makers. I appeal to the prime minister and Sonia Gandhi to come to her aid.                
	Drama down South                
	I love H.D. Deve Gowda        
	Because he is the greatest democrat        
	in the country        
	Who just cannot see        
	Anybody other than himself or his        
	family        
	Ruling at least Karnataka, if not the         
	whole of India        
	And his partnership with BJP        
	Is a classic example of mutual        
	morality.        
	For, they are both parties with a         
	difference        
	And neither of them is power-        
	hungry;        
	In fact, all our politicians are in         
	politics only        
	To serve the country selflessly        
	But Janata Dal (Secular) and BJP        
	Have added a new shine and glory        
	To our secular democracy;        
	And why not?        
	Deve Gowda is a former prime         
	minister of the country.

	Seen written behind a truck plying around Amritsar are new meanings of two words: thanda (cold) = Pepsi Cola and danda (stick) = Punjab police.

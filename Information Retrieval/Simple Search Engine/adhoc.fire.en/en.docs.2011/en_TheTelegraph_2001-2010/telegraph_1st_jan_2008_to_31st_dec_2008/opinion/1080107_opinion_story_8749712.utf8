	Films are supposed to do what education, means, and the law of the land have failed to do. The government, specifically the ministry of women and child development, is beginning to clutch at straws, it would seem, after having failed to check female foeticide. The most prosperous states and localities, the richest people, appear to be the most desirous of having girls wiped off the face of the earth. Hence the government will produce films against female foeticide and show them at multiplexes in the most prosperous urban areas to raise awareness among these very comfortably off people. 
    
	The idea would have been purely comic had it not been pitiful, apart from the waste of public money involved. Are parents to be made aware that their sons will not get girls to marry? Is that then the ultimate tragedy? With female foeticide, especially among the urban rich and middle-classes, it was never a case of unawareness, but of criminality. Even the most uneducated villager knows that to destroy unborn or just-born life because it is female  the last is commoner in many rural areas  is a crime of particularly inhuman dimensions. The government has failed; its Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act has not brought in the expected haul of doctors and parents. The problem lies not just in corruption among the law-enforcing institutions, but also  and more so  in the unshakeable gender-bias that Indian culture nurtures across economic strata. Those who kill female foetuses are criminals; when the technology becomes cheaper, there are likely to be more criminals  from less prosperous classes and areas. No film can stop crime, and no government can stop people from being inhuman by preaching prettily from the silver screen. Unless the law is used in every case, and unless the justice system is seen to be rigorous in its punishment of the killers, nothing will change.

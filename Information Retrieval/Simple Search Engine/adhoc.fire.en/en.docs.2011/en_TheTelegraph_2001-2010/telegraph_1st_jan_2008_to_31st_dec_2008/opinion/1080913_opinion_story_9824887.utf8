The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | will bengalis learn?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WILL BENGALIS LEARN?                                                          
	There is trouble in paradise. If the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and his cup-bearer, the minister for industries, Nirupam Sen, believed that the principal obstacle to industrialization in the state was the agitation of Mamata Banerjee, they were obviously living in a delusion. Events in the heartland of the government, the Writers Buildings, over the last few days have shown that government babus refuse to work, they are unruly and are not amenable to any kind of discipline. The plan of the chief minister to reform the work culture of the state lies in tatters in his very citadel. Work culture obviously does not begin at home, if it begins anywhere at all in West Bengal. Babus in the Writers Buildings have been pampered to think that the workplace is the right place to hold rallies, and during working hours too. They also have been taught to think that they have the right to harass and humiliate their superiors, whenever the latter do not acquiesce to their demands. If this is the situation within the Writers Buildings, where the governments orders are supposed to hold sway, the situation elsewhere can only be imagined and dreaded.        
	This situation is not new and therefore not surprising to those who know West Bengal and were not taken in by the slogan of reforming work culture. At the very heart of this condition is irresponsible trade unionism, and this irresponsibility was created, fostered and promoted by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Various trade-union bodies owing allegiance to the CPI(M) have, over the last 30 or 40 years, thrown work and discipline to the four winds. Other political parties and their trade-union bodies have followed suit. Trade unions of all political hues have taught their supporters that they have salaries and bonuses to collect; they do not have duties to perform. Babus in the Writers Buildings have been among the worst offenders. There, under the aegis of the coordination committee, whenever there has been a political rally, babus have downed their pens and have either joined the demonstration or gone home. This has been done at the behest of the CPI(M). Today this makes a mockery of Mr Bhattacharjees scheme to bring back industry to West Bengal.        
	It will be simplistic, of course, to locate the malady only within the practice of rampant trade unionism. The latter is situated within an overall societal context. Bengalis living in West Bengal dislike working. They would rather march in rallies, enjoy bandhs, engage in meaningless adda and grumble. The same people away from their homeland and habitat turn out to be among the best workers. Obviously, there is something in the culture of Bengalis that produces this loathing for work. Politicians have only pushed this strange propensity. People of the state have to decide if they are mentally prepared to enter the modern age or are satisfied chasing the elusive idyll where people are happy fishing.

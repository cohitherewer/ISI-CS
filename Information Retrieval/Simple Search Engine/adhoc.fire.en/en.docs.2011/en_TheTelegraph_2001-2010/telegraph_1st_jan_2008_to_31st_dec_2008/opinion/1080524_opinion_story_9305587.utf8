	Last Saturday, students of Fauzia Marikar, one of Calcuttas foremost piano teachers, were presented in their annual concert at the Sandr Hall of the Calcutta School of Music. This year too the concert featured young musicians who provided 90 minutes of nostalgic and innovative musical excerpts from a diverse repertoire, which included works for ensembles such as violin and piano, trumpet and piano, and piano for four hands (piano duets). The venue was a full house: parents, friends and music-lovers were present in the audience whose numbers grew as the evening progressed.         
	Oishik Ganguly, aged 11, was undoubtedly the best performer of the evening. Ganguly, who had been rightly allotted the senior section, stole the show with a commendable performance. He started the concert alongside eight-year-old Anjini Ganguly with three short duets. They were followed by 20 young musicians from the junior section who had eagerly awaited their turn to display their skills on the piano. Marikars pupils were a confident lot. They were disciplined in their performance and demonstrated an admirable degree of skill and stagecraft. Promit Sarkar, who played both the violin and the piano, and Deepanjali Lobo (piano) ended the junior section with impressive renditions of classical and jazz pieces.        
	The senior section explored more advanced repertoire. Some of the participants in this section were performing for the first time in the city. Again, Gangulys vibrant rendition along with Gaurab Dutta, of Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 5 arranged for four-hands, was rich in musical detail and featured well-co-ordinated tempo changes. M.S. Dawngzuala, arguably Calcuttas sole trumpeter in concert halls of late, produced a balanced and poetic tone in Morris Alberts Interlude. He was accompanied by Dutta on the piano.         
	Ganguly, who took his turn next, played with a precise understanding of the music along with the maturity and involvement of an adult player. His competence in technical facility and elegant communication were visible in one of Czernys ravishing tudes. One of Mendelssohns Songs Without Words, the famous Venetian Boat Song, was an engaging performance in which the composers haunting trills were exceptional in clarity and approach.        
	Dutta ended the recital with five major works, including the Valse Brillante by Frdric Chopin. There was no stopping this proficient pianist, especially after his jubilant performance of a Brazilian tango by Ernesto Nazareth for which the audience requested an encore.        
	With pianists such as Ganguly and Dutta, who have access to training and guidance from senior teachers like Marikar, Calcutta does have hope of resurrecting its age-old, but now dormant, tradition of entertaining as well as performing on the piano. To say the least, we have reason to be excited now about all this good music.

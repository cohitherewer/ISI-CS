	Fresh lease of life                  
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must be thanked for bypassing the Forward Bloc and issuing a licence to Metro Cash and Carry (CM unblocs Metro, Sep 27). Ashok Ghosh, the Forward Bloc state secretary, had earlier expressed his inability to renew the license in his lifetime. If Ghosh (may he live long) managed to keep his word, Bengals youth would have little option but to end their lives because of the economic uncertainty they would have to face. Now thanks to the chief minister, these young men and women can breathe easy again.           
	Yours faithfully,

	A star is born           
	Sir  Aamir Khan has every reason to be smiling these days. Imran Khan, his nephew, was the toast of the nation only a few months back after a successful film debut (Like uncle like nephew, July 6). Now, Taare Zameen Par, Aamirs first directorial venture, has been selected as Indias official entry to the Oscars in the best foreign film category. This is one of those rare films that manage to touch the audiences hearts. After watching the film, as I was walking out of the theatre, I felt something weighing me down. It wasnt the heavy bag I carried, but just the weight of emotions that had welled up inside me while watching the film.          
	Aamir is known to be fussy as an actor, but it is good to see that he is equally hard to please as a director. His maiden film is well and truly a cinematic masterpiece and it helped turn the sliding fortunes of the film industry in a disastrous year. The best thing about this film is that it renders an extremely sensitive portrayal of dyslexia, without being didactic. Darsheel Safary, the protagonist, is immensely gifted and is a better actor than our top heroes. It would be wrong to say that Taare Zameen Par is a film just about dyslexia. It also asks us to reflect on the ills of the present education system, the flaws in parenting and cruel practice of child labour. Hopefully, Taare Zameen Par will be able to do what Lagaan couldnt: help Aamir bag an Oscar.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Taare Zameen Par, one learns, is Indias entry to the Oscars this year. This may certainly be good news for Aamir Khan but he should remember that the chances of his film winning this prestigious award are rather slim. Bollywood films have never won an Oscar simply because they fail to create an impression on a foreign jury. Last year, the German film, The Lives of Others, won the prize for the best foreign language film. Calcuttans should watch it to understand why films such as this one, and not the likes of Taare Zameen Par, walk away with the big prize on most occasions.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Manjira Majumdar, 

      
	Calcutta                    
	Sir  The Oscar nomination for Taare Zameen Par is well deserved. In this film, director-actor Aamir Khan revealed the chequered truth about parenting. Khans film was loved by the young and the old alike, and the country is undoubtedly proud to count this talented and versatile man as one of its brightest sons.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A Wednesday is one of the best films to have come out of Bollywood this year. It is a chillingly realistic depiction of the nexus between crime, politics and society. It must be made tax-free for viewing throughout India. Quite a few interesting films have come out in recent times, Aamir Khans Taare Zameen Par being one of them. We should not fret if Taare Zameen Par fails to bag the Oscars this year. A Wednesday, if it is sent as Indias entry next year, might just be able to break the Oscar jinx.                     
	Yours faithfully,

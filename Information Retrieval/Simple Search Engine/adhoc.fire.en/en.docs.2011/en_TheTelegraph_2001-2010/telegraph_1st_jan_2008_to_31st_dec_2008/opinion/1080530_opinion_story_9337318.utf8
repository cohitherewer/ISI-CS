	There will always be people in various walks of life who want to put their little world into reverse gear. The present president of Fifa, Sepp Blatter, seems to be one such person. He is very keen to push forward his proposal to restrict the number of foreign players playing in any club match to five. He believes that this is necessary for the growth of soccer and to end the domination of a few rich clubs. Nothing could be more absurd and backward-looking. In a globalized world, football grounds and clubs have also crossed national boundaries. In fact, it will not be an exaggeration to suggest that the levels of popularity and skill that football has attained are related to the greater mobility of footballers. The success of the English premier league is due to the presence of foreign players who put on the jerseys of major English clubs. It is reasonable to ask how many Manchester players have donned the colours of Manchester United in the last ten years. Logically, if a Manchester-born player can play for Liverpool or Arsenal, nothing should stop an Italian footballer to play for an English, Spanish or a French club. Mr Blatter is obviously caught in a time warp if he thinks that the standard of soccer will improve if foreign players are restricted. Exactly the opposite will happen.        
	The argument that smaller clubs are being adversely affected by the presence of foreign players in affluent clubs goes against the idea of competition. As the levels of skills among footballers rise, smaller clubs will have to garner resources and improve their own standards to remain within the playing arena. Those who cannot stay in the competitive environment will fall by the wayside. Players and clubs are both responding to an economic situation in which the market forces hold sway. It will be quixotic to try and insulate soccer from these global trends. Mr Blatter is trying to take football back to an antiquated era. This is clear from the fact that the first obstacles his proposals will hit are the European Unions regulations regarding the free movement of workers. Mr Blatter does not have the support of the governing body of European soccer, Uefa, nor will his proposals have the sanction of the EU parliament. At various levels  from that of practicalities to that of ideas  Mr Blatters proposals are unacceptable. They belong to the dustbin of history.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A sense of proportion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A SENSE OF PROPORTION                          - While the Chinese work, the Indians jabber        Ashok Mitra                                                'The entire electricity requirement at the Beijing Olympics site was met from locally generated solar energy'    No reason to get het up; what follows is what old-time Marxists used to call self-criticism.        
	In the Olympics games, which concluded last month, China won 53 gold medals; India won just one. China claimed, all told, 100 medals; Indias tally was a paltry three. In the ordinal ranking of countries, China emerged as number one, India was number 50.         
	From whatever news have filtered through, the Chinese nation and its government have taken the Olympics triumph in their stride. The mood is one of quiet satisfaction. Some explicit expression of happiness has been discernible over piping success in this or that individual event, but no vulgar display of ecstasy, it has all been tucked inside. The aura is one of maturity, as behoves people who have come to the wisdom that self-assurance is what self-assurance does.        
	Maturity is precisely the commodity scarcest within our precincts. Indias performance at the Beijing Olympics is by any criterion miserable, especially for a country with more than one billion people. The media as well as the government apparently think otherwise. They went berserk over one particular happening: for the first time ever in the Olympics, an Indian won a gold medal in an individual event. Should not the occasion have been one not of raucous celebration, but of shame, mortification and merciless self-appraisal? No such thought assailed Indian minds. Instead, the suvarna vijay became the major national news story, the coverage given to the winner of this rarest of gold exceeded, for several days running, even the space normally reserved for the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance or her male offspring.               
	Much more embarrassing was the extravaganza unleashed immediately after with an Indian participant winning a bronze in wrestling and another compatriot obtaining, once again, the third spot in a boxing event. As they did in the case of the solitary goldwalla, the president and the prime minister of the country set time apart to meet, congratulate and bless the two bronzemen. The cue was taken up by lesser specimens; the threesome of medal-winners in Beijing have since been flooded with a flow of gifts of land, house, property and cash from different parts of the country. After such gorgeous Olympian victory, what is the need for modesty? Are we not world-beaters? Is three not greater than one hundred?        
	Sixty-one years have elapsed since Independence, and yet, our collective behaviour is that of crass country yokels; lack of maturity and of a sense of proportion walk hand in hand. Forget China, even that puny island-country, Jamaica, with a population of hardly two million, has won almost four times as many medals as we have, but the men and women over there, while full of the exuberance of life, have the equilibration of the mind not to go gaga over what their sports squad achieved at Beijing.        
	It is a malaise, and one so pervasive that spilling beyond the arena of sports, it has come to shape the countrys destiny in more substantial matters. Consider, for instance, the persistent heart-burning over the fact that China has made giant economic strides in the course of the past half-a-century, while we lag way behind. The situation was not that daunting in the late 1950s, when Indias per-capita output of both steel and electricity was significantly higher than Chinas. In terms of per-capita availability of foodgrains too, we held an advantage over the Middle Kingdom. Young academics from American universities would then visit Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and New Delhi and confidently offer the point of view that the presence of democratic institutions helped India to stay economically ahead of China; the latter was hamstrung by its authoritarian system, which shunted economic decision-making on to the wrong rails. Those earnest young things  or rather, their progeny  are now crowding university campuses in China, busy writing admiring tracts on that countrys development wizardry and on the super-efficiency of its economic institutions.        
	Indians feel betrayed. Righteous indignation boils over: please be objective, we were held back in the development race till the last decade of the last century because of the hangover of silly socialist dogmas. Now that that nonsense has been got rid of, India is not doing at all badly in economic terms. The GDP growth rate has more than doubled, and the countrys foreign exchange holdings are approaching three hundred billion US dollars. If only we had a Deng Xiaoping-like figure at the helm of affairs right from the beginning, we could have beaten China in no time. Beside, why do outsiders forget we had to fight a number of debilitating wars during this period, including the invasion of our country by China?        
	It is futile to try to convince the argumentative Indians that if that border episode of 1962 harmed Indias economy, it should have adversely affected China too. Nor would they entertain with kindness the suggestion that, right or wrong, Deng could do what he did in China because of the sweeping social changes earlier accomplished by Mao Zedong that ushered in both efficiency and discipline, factors that have had an electrifying effect on the countrys growth.         
	Why not proceed a bit further? The recent explosion of the rate of growth in India is largely the outcome of outsourcing, principally from the United States of America. Foreign balances too have gone up mainly because of the decision to introduce free convertibility on the current account that induced international finance capital to park their speculative funds in our bourses. Should outsourcing receive a jolt in the event of a Democratic victory in the forthcoming US elections, we could still return to the proverbial Hindu rate of growth situation. And the current convulsions in the share markets in the wake of the Lehman-Merrill Lynch holocaust could yet prove fatal to our foreign balances. Chinas growth, in contrast, is much more strongly based on the scaffolding of self-reliance, and its fabulous foreign exchange holdings  five times ours  represent savings from out of their export earnings. The propensity to consume remains so high in the US that whatever the circumstances, its citizens are unlikely to deny themselves the use of low-cost goods from China.               
	Groping for a basic reason for the disparate performance of the two countries in different spheres, one is tempted to reach an eerie, not altogether light-hearted, explanation: while the Chinese work, the Indians jabber. Like all generalizations, this one too is not one hundred per cent right; it still contains a large measure of truth. Take, for example, the weeklong border clash with China 46 years ago. It was, in the Chinese lexicon, a skirmish; once the week passed, little was talked of it any more. In India, the incident continues to be described in luridly magnified terms; we keep fuming over what was, in our firm belief, Chinas perfidy.         
	There has been no surcease of that feeling of injured innocence. In the process, we are in danger of losing our capacity for objective judgement. Here is one recent example. The Indian media, perhaps briefed by our ministry of external affairs, are cross with neighbouring Nepals Maoist prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, aka Comrade Prachanda. What officiousness, once installed as prime minister, he chose Beijing as the first foreign capital to visit, not New Delhi! But if somebody is Maoist by conviction, why blame him if he prefers to offer homage to Mao Zedongs country before he lays flowers at Rajghat? And should Prachanda be blamed too much if he too stole a glance at the Olympic performance table?         
	Or have we ever thought about it? Ruling politicians, caught in acts of corruption, are summarily shot in China; in India, they receive promotions. And while the fairytale is being dinned into our ears about how the Indo-US deal would flood us with nuclear power, few of us are aware that the entire electricity requirement at the Beijing Olympics site met from locally generated solar energy.

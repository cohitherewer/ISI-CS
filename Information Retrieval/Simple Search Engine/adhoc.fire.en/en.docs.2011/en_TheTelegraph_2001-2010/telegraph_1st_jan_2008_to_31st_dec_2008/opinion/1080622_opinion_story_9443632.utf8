                              Look whos pointing fingers        
	 Sonia Gandhi hadnt seen Congressmen so active in a long time. Unfortunately, all the action at the partys Mumbai meet was of the violent kind, and hence not constructive in the least. It has been learnt that the brawl was triggered off by the supporters of Shiv-Sainik-turned-Congressman Narayan Rane who were waving black flags and chanting CM hatao, Maharashtra bachao. Rane, in spite of all his efforts to play the victim in front of Madam, has been left wishing that the references to his bte noire, CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, werent so obvious. Whatever chances Rane may have had of replacing Deshmukh in the coveted kursi, have well and truly evaporated. And elections in the state are not due till November next year. While all this ought to be dropping as gentle music on Deshmukhs ears, a rude interruption has come in the form of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress chief Prabha Rau accusing him of intelligence failure. Truly baffling, isnt it? Since when, Deshmukh has been learnt to be wondering, has the state intelligence departments duty included keeping a tab on the supporters of wannabe CMs?                            
	 Deal or no N-deal, the country seems poised at the doorstep of yet another general election well ahead of its appointed time. A few weeks ago, most Congress leaders were oozing confidence about surviving a no-confidence motion even if the Left were to snap ties. But that confidence has been lost to the rising prices of fuel and other essential commodities. So, come November, it might be time to queue up again. What does all this spell for the Congress  apart from doom, that is? Simply this, that the polls would be conducted under the supervision of chief election commissioner N Gopalaswamy, and not Naveen Chawla, the man the party likes more. Chawla would have been at the helm if the polls had taken place at the expected time, that is, May next year.                            
	 Shivraj Patils home ministry is probably all for the equality of the sexes. Only, one is not too sure whether it is aware of the existence of the second sex. Senior women officials in North Block have to share toilets with their male counterparts because there arent restrooms assigned for women. The Raj-day sahibs were confident that their mems would never leave their piano lessons and tea tables to step into the male domain of politics and governance. And post-Independence, the babus were too busy washing their dirty linen in public to bother about toilets for women. Now every ministry official, irrespective of gender, has been given a key to the only toilet, to avoid untoward incidents. Last heard, the gentlemen and ladies had sent separate petitions to the ministry, seeking exclusive toilets. They have even cited seniority as reason, though one would have thought this unnecessary. Lets hope this plea does not get flushed down in the way the womens reservation bill does.                             
	 The freer the economy, the more are its regulatory bodies. The urban welfare ministry is exercised over where these bodies and their members can be accommodated. Not wanting to be irregular in its responsibilities, and fed up of the growing pressure from important persons heading the various commissions, the ministry has now proposed to build a separate office-cum-residential complex for all the regulatory bodies on the outskirts of the capital. But theres going to be regulation here as well, because the urban welfare ministry has made it clear that if more such bodies come up, they shall have to fend for themselves, or ask their respective ministries for bed and board. Do we have more regulators than causes to regulate?                            
	 Poor Rajeshpati Tripathi! The grandson of the late Congress leader, Kamlapati Tripathi, had been hoping to get the party ticket to contest (and win) the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat. But BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi has just decided to abandon his old seat of Allahabad and zeroed in on Varanasi. And that has practically ended Rajeshpatis dreams of causing a Congress wave in the temple town.                            
	 The Calcutta Stock Exchange Association Limited is holding its centenary celebration on June 24. The invitation card says that at 11.25 a vote of thanks will be delivered. After that, the card says, End of ceremony and High Tea. What are the guests supposed to do between 11.30 and the early evening when high tea is normally served? Count their stocks, of course. There was a time in Calcutta when people knew the difference between their Elevenses and High Tea.        Footnote            
	 Where have all the flowers gone? UP chief minister Mayavati seems to be asking. The state is bereft of a flower to call its own. The brahmakamal, which had been the state flower once, grows only in the Himalayan areas, which, alas, are no longer part of Mayavatis state. The exotic flower became the state flower of Uttarakhand after that state was carved out of UP in 2000. To appease a restless memsahib, the officials suggested that palash (Butea frondosa, or flame of the forest) be made the new state flower, and Mayavati appeared to have been taken in by such a quick resolution to the petal problem. It was only when an executive order was being typed that it was discovered that palash is the state flower of neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Perhaps the lack of a floral species that has not already been adopted by one state or another will prompt Mayavati to do some aggressive environmental awareness campaigns.

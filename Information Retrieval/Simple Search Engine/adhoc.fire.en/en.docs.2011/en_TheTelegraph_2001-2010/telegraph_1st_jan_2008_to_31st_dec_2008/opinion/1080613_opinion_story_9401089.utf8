	Why do governments and leaders talk about issues that need to be addressed but invariably act in a completely opposite manner? Why are they so blatant in their hypocrisy? A hugely damaging hydro-electric project between Gangotri and Uttarkashi that threatens the Ganga in a formidable and ruthless way, and assaults the water source of hundreds of thousands of Indians, is being constructed despite intelligent, professional objections supported by established data. On every count, whether scientific, environmental or cultural, this project is a disaster, a death knell for the river, for India and for the people.         
	Himalayan geology is under a severe attack that will culminate in overwhelming landslides and earthquakes, the magnitude of which cannot be imagined. Hundreds of humans living in the region will perish. Those in the plains will face drought and death. Poisonous, contaminated water will be bottled out to unsuspecting people. When unlettered, unthinking and virtual illiterates promote, endorse and implement destructive projects that bring comparatively minor gains for the aam aadmi but ample remuneration for themselves, and when greed and inadequate knowledge compel them to fight the forces of nature, they can only lose, but alas, only in the long term.        
	Short term gains today will bring upon us unimaginable losses tomorrow. All the elected incumbents of the two houses of parliament and of the many Bidhan Sabhas across India need to be informed about the changing realities of our planet and put through regular and rigorous intellectual training. A minimum of two hours in every forty eight hours should be spent schooling these men and women who have failed future generations of Indians in all the critical issues that afflict mankind in present times.                 
	Harping on        
	Our Central and state policies that concern the environment, both natural and manmade, shame us. The implementation of decisions taken on the basis of those archaic and warped policies, and the lack of enforcement, even where strong laws exist, particularly in the area of material heritage, shame us even more. The suffocating corruption that drives bad governance in the broadest definition of the term has killed India.        
	The natural environment has been mutilated over the last two decades by vested interests by businessmen wanting to make big bucks by raping the earth and infecting its womb with poison that is not biodegradable. And the authorities, mandated by laws to protect the landmass, have allowed the greed of money to undermine the oath of office they took with their hands on the book of god. Some of us, who have been harping on for years about these national horrors, have been damned and deemed hysterical. However, in the circumstances, it is better to err on the side of hysteria than be guilty of corrupt thought and action.        
	Arresting the waters of the Ganga between Gangotri and Uttarkashi will result in millions losing their source of water, their heritage, their beliefs and spirit, and the Ganga will never forgive the marauders. Will the government of India and that of Uttarakhand free the river, unshackle it from the concrete chains that threaten to bind it? Or, will they interrupt its flow, bind it down and allow the culprits to run free? Where are the selfless leaders in politics? Where are the Nehrus and the Indiras of yore who understood well the sacred need to conserve nature? Have our elected representatives abdicated their power to the mafias who seem to be the real leaders of today and the architects of Indias future? Will the Ganga die, or struggle to live a polluted life, reduced to near nothing, much like its sister, the Yamuna? We should be ashamed of ourselves.

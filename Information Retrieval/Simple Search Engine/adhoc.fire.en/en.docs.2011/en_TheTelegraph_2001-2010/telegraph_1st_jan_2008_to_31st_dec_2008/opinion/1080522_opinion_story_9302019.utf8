	Eight pm, Wednesday and Thursday nights, are sacred times in my house. These are the times reserved for watching American Idol. American Idol (for those of you who arent initiates) is a cult masquerading as an American reality show. Its a televised singing competition that starts with lots of contestants, whittles them down to twelve finalists and then proceeds by elimination till theres one person left standing, namely, that years American Idol.        
	Eliminations are based on public voting by phone and just to give democracy a helping hand, three judges, Randy Jackson (musician and record producer), Paula Abdul (singer and choreographer) and Simon Cowell (music executive), comment on each performance. Their comments influence the viewing public but arent necessarily decisive: one of the most entertaining subplots in last years season was Simon Cowells despair that an Indian American contestant, Sanjaya Malakar, who couldnt sing at all, managed to reach the top seven despite being trashed by the judges, on the strength of his androgynous, Peter Pan-like charm.         
	The show is telecast a day after it airs in the US, but its a rule of the house that none of us reads reports about it online so that we can pretend were watching it live. Watching another countrys reality show involves some make-believe. As I write this on Wednesday, the final round between David Cook and David Archuleta is over in America, but when we settle down on the sofa at eight tonight, itll be as good as new. My brother and I once watched a movie about the Mexico Olympics two years after the Games were over, so to be a day behind America needs no great suspension of disbelief. On Thursday, the day this column is published, well watch the final episode of this prolonged audition, to know who won.              
	Theres a desi version of American Idol (which itself is an American version of a British show, Pop Idol) called Indian Idol which racked up some extraordinary viewership numbers in its third season last year. By one estimate, seventy million votes were received for the final round. But the vital difference between the two shows is the panel of judges. Indian Idols judges change every year, whereas Jackson, Abdul and Cowell have remained fixtures, giving the show a constant cast of main characters who you can love or hate.         
	Simon Cowells willingness to skewer contestants, Paula Abduls daft good nature, Randy Jacksons near-parodic African-American idiom and presenter Ryan Seacrests running feud with Simon, give fans a narrative to plug in to. It might be a reality show featuring real singers, real home towns and real rewards, but the real stars of American Idol are the judges who have on-stage personas as fixed and confected as the dysfunctional family in The Simpsons.        
	In Indian Idol, Anu Malik is the only judge to have survived from Season One. To make matters worse, besides the three regular judges, the producers have decided to adapt the formula to desi circumstances by inviting an assortment of Hindi cinema celebrities, regardless of whether they had anything to do with the business of singing or making music. So we had Priyanka Chopra, Amisha Patel, Kareena Kapoor, Salman Khan, Karan Johar, Zayed Khan, Diya Mirza, Dino Morea, Mallika Sherawat, Shilpa Shetty and Tabu. I can see what Mallika Sherawat brings to the table, but Salman Khan? And whos Dino Morea? A baby raptor from Jurassic Park?         
	(Sometimes the mandatory Bollywood-ization of all popular entertainment in India disables the original formula instead of enhancing it. I remember those dreadful episodes in Kaun Banega Crorepati, where Amitabh Bachchan and then Shah Rukh Khan quizzed filmstars. The questions were so obviously rigged  all the stars won substantial sums of money for charity before bowing out  that the filmi glamour they brought to the show didnt make up for the damage they did to its credibility as a quiz where large sums of money rode on honestly knowing the right answers. And I cant help feeling that theres something fundamentally wrong with Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta owning cricket franchises and rah-rahing in the dugouts. Cricket is Indias biggest sport with a star system of its own: to sprinkle it with stardust from the movies makes the game seem tinselly.)              
	But the remarkable thing about American Idol is the corporate, machine-like way in which popular musical stardom is now manufactured in the US. American Idol is specifically about stardom and explicitly not only about singing ability. The judges rate contestants on their dancing abilities, their clothes, their look in general. One of todays finalists, David Archuleta, was counselled by Andrew Weber to open his eyes wider while singing! All the contestants are contracted to the production company, 19 Entertainment, that owns the Idol television shows. Winners and finalists go on to make platinum records, number one singles and win musical accolades. Kelly Clarkson, the winner of the first season and Carrie Underwood, the winner of the fourth, won every major prize (the Billboard Music Awards, the American Music Awards and the Grammy Awards) multiple times. Its almost as if the popular music industry is going through a process of vertical integration where the journey from being a novice singer to a star has been telescoped into a single season and under one management.         
	Still, knowing all this, Ill take my place on the family sofa tonight (minus my son: teenaged boys seem immune to the show) willing David Archuleta to out-perform David Cook. My daughter, who is fourteen, is rooting for him because at seventeen, Archuleta is the youngest finalist this season. Likewise, my wife wants him to win because hes just a year older than her son. I want him to win because the other David wears too many necklaces. And it doesnt hurt that he sings quite nicely too.

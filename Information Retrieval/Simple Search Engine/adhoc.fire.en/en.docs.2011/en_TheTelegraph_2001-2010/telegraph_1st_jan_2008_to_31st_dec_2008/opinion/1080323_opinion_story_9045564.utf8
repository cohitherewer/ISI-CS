	There are some events that hurt all sides. The departure of the writer, Taslima Nasreen, from Indias shores is one such. Everyone concerned with the form and content of secularism, freedom of speech, the duties of host and guest, would deplore this bitter departure. Ms Nasreen had wanted to live on in India, specifically in Calcutta, for there she would be closest to her own culture and language, an environment barred to her by her inability to enter Bangladesh. In her choice of place, she also identified the perfectly free country  and city  of her dreams. In leaving it with a feeling of injury, she too has lost that ideal land she had nurtured in her mind. The painfully long-drawn-out episode assails the roots of an old belief among the ancient cultures of the East, of India  a guest is no less than a deity. It is easy to put it down as a failure of the host country, to formulate the guests unwilling departure in terms of its surrender to the same fundamentalist tyranny that the writer has become famous for opposing.        
	The relationship of host and guest rides a delicate balance. The Dalai Lama, for example, is the guest of the State; he takes care to abide by the conditions, written and unwritten, on the basis of which this country extends to him its hospitality. Considerateness for the hosts concerns is the mark of a welcome guest. Intolerance of the hosts problems, a refusal to accept the many strategies by which a host- nation maintains its relationships within and without, shows up the limits of a guests tolerance. Of course, the Buddhist monk is not placed within the same volatile equations of Ms Nasreens context. But when a society offers a guest its protection, it binds the guest to the understanding that the visitor will not endanger that protection within reasonable bounds.        
	Even in the most ideal of worlds, no freedom comes without responsibility. Freedom of speech, too, has its own conditions, those which relate to other people. While art is transgressive, and hence disturbing, an artist is as accountable for his expression as a surgeon is for his surgery. No artist who has challenged the power or beliefs of a political order or a community in a major way gets away without paying for it in some way or other. Ms Nasreens courage was rewarded by exile from her own country. But she is not the first artist to whom this has happened. She was the right person to have brought the ideal world of freedom closer by attacking the rudiments of fundamentalism. Yet her own impatience with other points of view has merely incited the very intolerance she fights. It bodes no good for the host society that this intolerance threatened to go out of hand. Ms Nasreens departure is a loss for both sides.

	For an elderly person in Delhi, to have a place to live in, owned or rented, is no reason to feel secure. According to a recent survey, every second such person is likely to be harassed or abused precisely for that reason. And the torment is most likely to come from their children and their childrens spouses  although their own spouses, relatives and neighbours, apart from landlords, tenants, builders and civic officials, also contribute to their woes. What the same study brings out about the other end of the stick is that the victims themselves often choose not to go to the police with their troubles mostly because they do not trust the police. They also fear filial retaliation and dishonour for the family.        
	The problem with the States responsibility in all this, and with the legal solutions it proposes, is that security for the elderly is always imagined in urban, middle-class terms. The plight of miserably poor families, both rural and urban, where filial obligations are often over-ridden by the grimness of poverty, migration, unemployment or homelessness, hardly ever falls within the purview of the new bills and acts devised to deal with the problem. Yet the Delhi survey also forces one to think of the specifically urban aspects of this issue. The burgeoning of modern cities, especially the real-estate aspect of such development, is an important context for understanding the lives of the elderly, and their threatened control over their own property. The Indian welfare state is also not geared to making them less dependent on their children in, say, matters pertaining to healthcare. Yet, how exactly could the police be better equipped to deal with such situations? Is sensitization adequate in this case? Or is the problem not, in its very nature (as a form of domestic violence) impossible to deal with entirely in terms of non-domestic instruments of the State? But that does not absolve the State from ensuring that the public sphere, and the existing law (together with those who implement the law), provides the right sort of environment in which private arrangements and behaviour may be humane and just.

	In those hoary old days when the prime minister was finance minister, he had to steer the economy through a payments crisis. His predecessor had borrowed all he could from the Washington sisters; they were tired of Indian finance ministers attention, especially since the latter did not have a pie. They kept telling him to look for new suitors  for example, foreign investors. The very word foreign was a red rag to the Indian bull then; it smacked of colonialism, control and Cold War.         
	But the prime minister had a brainwave. He opened up foreign portfolio investment through the stock market. Portfolio investment was defined so that it would not exercise management control; the share of equity a foreign investor could take was limited to 5 per cent. If such investors tried to exert pressure by selling off their shares, their sales would cause the price to collapse, and they would be suitably punished. And if they ganged up together and tried to sell shares on a wide range, their attempts to get out of the country would lead to a collapse of the exchange rate, and they would be suitably punished. In this way, Manmohan Singh took most of the risks (in the eyes of paranoid patriots) out of foreign investment. And now his logic is being proved. Foreign investors needed money to cover their losses abroad, so they began to unload their investments in India. Their sales led to the January meltdown of the market. Their investment was valued at $292 billion at the end of December; three months later it was $265 billion. Of the fall of $27 billion, they got only two-thirds; the rest was lost in price decline. And their loss was the promoters gain, for they picked up the share of equity that foreign institutional investors lost. They should be grateful to the prime minister; maybe they will help his party in the next election. Nor is that all; the foreign investors lost on exchange, for the rupee depreciated 6 per cent in January-March against the dollar and 8 per cent against the euro. The prime minister can congratulate himself on the clever, Machiavellian calculation that went into his portfolio investment policy.         
	This resounding confirmation of his reasoning will probably not make him any less cautious. But if he reflects on it, he will find that the logic he applied to foreign portfolio investment applies with even greater force to direct investment. Direct investors also will have to sell their investments if they want to get out of India. If they are in a hurry, the buyer will beat down the price; that is even more likely where there is no open market in the equities. So the next thing Mr Singh should do is relax, simplify and liberalize the unduly complex foreign direct investment regime of his government.

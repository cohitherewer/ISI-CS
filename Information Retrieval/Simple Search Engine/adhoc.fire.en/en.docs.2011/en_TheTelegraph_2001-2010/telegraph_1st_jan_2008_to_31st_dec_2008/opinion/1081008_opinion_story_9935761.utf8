	Ever since his sudden entry into Pakistan politics, Asif Ali Zardari has raised many an eyebrow  mostly within his own country  with his style of functioning and his vision. As a popular leader, Mr Zardaris suggestions of a rethink on Balochistan and Kashmir, among other issues, had been unconventional. As president, Mr Zardari continues his breakaway from accepted logic. In a recent admission before the Western media, the Pakistan president is believed to have said that he sees militants in Kashmir as terrorists. Coming from the president of a country that has aided and abetted the unrest in the valley as the noble struggle for Kashmiriyat and has bestowed on extremists the exalted status of freedom fighters and martyrs, the comment is undoubtedly remarkable. It shows the willingness of the civilian leadership in Pakistan to continue the peace dialogue on Kashmir that had been in a limbo ever since political troubles beset the Pervez Musharraf presidency, and had come to a stop following the blasts in Afghanistan.        
	The governments favourable disposition towards India has been marked by its welcoming of Indian investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, reiterated the position in various international fora. Mr Zardari, too, has emphasized good neighbourly relations by vouching that he does not consider India to be a threat. Unfortunately, neither Mr Gilani nor Mr Zardari, separately or together, represents the entire power structure in Pakistan. At the recent meeting of the United Nations general assembly both the president of the United States of America and the Indian prime minister had expressed their doubts over Mr Zardaris control over the Pakistani establishment, particularly the arm of the Pakistan military that is now proved to have significantly contributed to the escalation of terrorism in the region.        
	Mr Zardaris condemnation of Kashmir militancy is part of his larger policy of supporting the allied efforts at combating terrorism. He has been pushed to adopt this position by the impossibility of handling Pakistans debt crisis without major international aid. The Pakistan army, however, is free from his encumbrances. It is neither willing to share the responsibility of freeing Pakistan from militants with foreign help nor is it in any hurry to discard Kashmir as unclaimed baggage. The escalation of border conflict with India and renewal of violence in Kashmir show that the Pakistan army has its own ideas. It may share some, but not all, of them with Pakistans political leaders in closed-door briefs. And these may not match Mr Zardaris.

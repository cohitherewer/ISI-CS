	Slippery terrain                  
	Sir  Mahendra P. Lamas discussion of the ongoing agitation for Gorkhaland is detailed and instructive (Storm brewing in the mountains, July 3). But it fails to provide an answer to the nagging question as to why the new state should be named after a community. The Gorkhas are neither the only group of people inhabiting north Bengal nor are they the oldest occupants of the hills. A state including tribes other than the Gorkhas cannot be named after just one group. Besides, why should a separate state be formed on the basis of a community when the other states of India have been created on linguistic basis? Lamas assertion that the movement spearheaded by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has spread over to communities such as the Marwaris, Biharis and Bengalis is also suspect. The video clippings of the agitation being aired by various news channels do not give this impression.           
	The central question in the Gorkhaland issue is one of identity  Gorkha identity. The Gorkhas, like every human being, want to belong, and so they want a state of their own. If one has to treat the Gorkhas needs with sympathy then why should an outfit such as Amra Bangali be called dangerously communal? After all, this group has a cause similar to that of the Morcha  it too wants to foster and preserve an identity  in its case, that of the Bengalis.           
	While the grounds on which the Gorkhas are asking for statehood cannot be contested, one cannot help but suspect that there are some ulterior motives behind the agitations  motives that are perhaps less selfless than those declared. Would the Morcha settle for a state carved out of India the way it prefers but not carrying the word Gorkha in its name? It is the answer to this question that will tell us whether a 29th state will hamper or foster the grand, ever-expanding federal structure of India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Bengal government has no right to deny the hill people their right to a state, especially since it has always been negligent of the community. A separate state has to be formed when a group of people is distinctly different from others inhabiting a state. Since the language, dress and food habits of the hill people have no resemblance to those of the people from the plains, it would be in the fitness of things to let the Gorkhas have a Gorkhaland.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattarcharyya has rightly understood the character of the Gorkhas (The guest is akin to god, June 30). We are grateful to him for acknowledging our worth and contribution to the nation. Politicians with ignoble intentions have mostly been responsible for giving the Gorkhas a bad name. Misled by their scheming leaders, certain sections of Indians have behaved insensitively towards us. Articles such as the one by Bhattacharyya would surely help people clear their misunderstandings about the true nature of the Gorkhas.           
	Bhattarcharyyas explanation of the meaning of Nepali words like kancha, bahadur or Gorkhali is absolutely correct. But it is a fact that these words are often used derogatively against the Gorkhas. Such misuse of the words might only reveal the ignorance of the user, but this does not take away the sting from the barb.           
	The article should make it clear that the Gorkhas are not outsiders in India, as has often been alleged. Like any other Indian, they want to go about their life with their head held high and without their identity being questioned at every step of their life           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amar Singh Rai, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  The article, The guest is akin to god, is confusing in so far it fails to make clear whether by Nepalis it means those people who came to India from Nepal or the population of over one crore Indians who speak the Nepali language. The latter group is very much an integral part of India and, as such, cannot be regarded as guests in this country. These people became a part of India after the treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1815. By this treaty, the king of Nepal ceded an area of 18,000 sq km to British India  this now constitutes parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Darjeeling.           
	Abhijit Bhattacharyya has trod on dangerous terrains by insinuating that all Nepalis are foreigners in India. Such a view may create chaos, especially at this point of time when thousands of Gorkhas are agitating for their homeland. The author may clarify the inoffensive meaning of words such as kancha or Gorkhali but it so happens that, in our country, rather than denoting a young person, the word kancha is used to refer to all those Nepali speaking people who work as domestic help or as securitymen in the homes of the rich. And the word bahadur might mean a brave person but is always applied to nightguards. Bhattacharyya says that Gorkhali means a Gorkha soldier. But the word actually stands for the language spoken by the Gorkhas. It can be accepted as a synonym for the word Nepali, but has never been known to signify a Gorkha soldier. Perhaps Bhattacharyya did not want to hurt the Gorkhas in his article. But by saying that Nepalis are guests in India, he has labelled us outsiders in our own home.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Blooming India          
	Sir  The signboard installed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation beside the Derozio memorial on the southern pavement of Park Street reads: In memoriam of Henry Louis Vivian Derozio  An unputdownable/ Spirit of blooming India. This is pretentious, semi-literate nonsense. Every line, except for the one in which the name occurs, contains a howler or two. Is this how Calcuttans write English now?           
	Hundreds of students pass by this way everyday. I despair about the lesson in English they will be getting from the CMC, which ought to be ashamed of itself. As the Derozio memorial already had a well-written epitaph, the need for the board is not clear. The leader of Young Bengal certainly deserved better.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Suranjan Roy, Calcuttta

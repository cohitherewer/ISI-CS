	Dilip Ranade, born in 1950, is the senior curator of European paintings at what used to be called the Prince of Wales Museum in what used to be called Bombay. He studied drawing and painting at the J.J. School of Art, and then went on to study museology. These biographical details help us reflect on the erudite, finical, anachronistic and highly idiosyncratic wit and skilfulness of his drawings  in the same way as it is helpful to know, when reading Borges, that he was director of the Argentine National Library for almost two decades. Shifting the Logic (Galerie 88, until April 28) shows a selection of Ranades works on paper from 1977 to 2007  mainly in ink, but occasionally touched up with lead and colour pencils, watercolour, pastel, oil and wax.        
	In the visual arts, as in writing, authentic strangeness is always the fruit of precision. Ranades perfected control of the thin, sharp, steady, black line produced by Rotring 0.2 and finer nibs, along with his use of the infinitely suggestive blankness of paper-white, holds together a prolific world of images. This image-world combines surreal, often Surrealist, phantasmagoria with a quizzical, clearheaded, detached and serenely perverse sanity. This is a man who knows his Kafka, and is not too afraid to know himself either. Creator, archivist and bureaucrat, and entrusted with the care of fragile Europeana in the always-afternoon world of a colonial museum, but in the midst of modern urban life too, the artist-curator explores  with unshockable curiosity and deadpan humour  the dovetailing of his arbitrary inner world with the eclectic and sophisticated universe of his educated eye.        
	Any art that self-consciously engages with the unruly playfulness of its own fabrication of images will have to confront the mysteries of doubling and splitting. If one thinks for long enough about these two processes, it becomes increasingly difficult to hold on to the difference between them, until one is teased out of thought by the conundrum. Many of Ranades drawings are about this confusion, and lead us, without any obscure mysticism, to the inexplicable core of creation itself, biological as well as aesthetic. Men, women, children, animals, birds and objects often co-exist in Ranades drawings with their other halves (but in what way, if at all, is ones other half Other?). These could be their shadows, twins, bisections, ghostly doubles, or simply their discarded shirts.        
	In the visual lexicon of Ranades drawings, the unbroken line enters into a range of relationships with other kinds of line: dotted lines, run-stitch lines, lines formed by little dashes. Similarly, paper-white contrasts with a whole range of shaded textures and contours, created by stippling and stubbling with fine dots and dashes. But there are also sudden, startling intrusions of sheer, dense blackness: shapes and forms filled in with black ink, eruptions of absolute darkness and opacity in an otherwise-starkly-daylit world of open, unsheltered spaces in which there is no event that cannot take place. Ranade can also create effects of distance, regress and elevation by simply varying the scale and clarity of depicted figures or objects, just as with the same continuous line and fine stipple, he can conjure up unwieldy masses of grotesque animal flesh.        
	There is a tendency to read the drawings and sketches of artists in terms of a private language welling up from the unconscious, inviting as well as frustrating analysis. In Ranades case, such a psychological approach could miss the culturally inflected, variously furnished and richly allusive texture of his drawings. They are windows through which one peers into a mysteriously animated museum or gallery where the artefacts and their keepers maintain an endless, random theatre of changing, merging, dividing and connecting forms.        
	These forms and processes, together with the atmosphere in which they exist and happen, are imbued with the memories of art: the comic-pathetic sketches that come with Edward Lears limericks; the early etchings and late pen-on-paper drawings of Paul Klee; the melancholy public spaces of Chirico, empty save a sleeping (or dead?) bust on a pedestal; the Fiat modes lithographs of Max Ernst, or his illustrations of Eluard; and Magrittes enigmatic gentlemen in bowler hats.         
	One such gentleman looks down on a sleeping Brahmin in Ranades acrylic-on-canvas, Magritte and Brahmin (2006). In another, Frog and Mondrian (2004), a yellow frog is cut down its middle, and as the two halves pull away from each other, what opens out between them is a slightly crumpled, accordion-fold Mondrian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Devalue WOrds and Perish
                                                                                                                 DEVALUE WORDS AND PERISH                                  WORDCAGE - Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	There are grown men  that is, superannuated school kids  who swoon over fast cars and whose idea of nirvana is a Formula One pit lane. Theres what laughably calls itself the Olympic movement, as if it were some kind of organized pseudo-religion. And then there are journalists who gush about some or all sport like a girl whose generous heart has for the first time discovered True Love.         
	All these are a danger to language, because of their overblown verbiage. Puff not only cloys reality but the words we use for it.        
	The speed groupies spoken words can easily be ignored: they are apt to be drowned in the roar of revving engines and the stench of petrol. But read these boy-men on, say, the British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, who last year, in his first season, all but won the drivers championship (though, being British, he naturally fluffed things when victory was in his grasp). You might think this was Arjuna reincarnate.         
	The Olympiocrats have a vocabulary of their own. It includes a mythical philosophy called Olympism (consult their website, not me, if you want to learn more), and the once-honourable slogan, coined by their founder, Not the winning but the taking part. By once I mean around 1900, when these games were games, not a quadrennial hyperathletics trade-fair. In my Economist days, I once wrote a survey of sport and money entitled Not the winning but the getting paid. Though I say it myself, that was nearer the truth, and this was more than 15 years ago.                
	Going overboard        
	As for the sports gushers, theyre beyond parody. Hark at one on this very topic, the Olympics: When champion takes on champion...we have something that makes profound sense and possesses profound beauty. Of various athletes performance at the 2004 Olympics: Thats where beauty lies and with it truth. And the Olympics themselves: The purest event in sport.        
	Forgive me while I vomit. Im happy to believe that there are pure sports events: a match between two teams of eleven-year-olds, maybe. But the money-fuelled, drug-infested world of top-level athletics? And when theres that much money at stake for gold-medallists, dont imagine that any amount of good intentions and snap tests will banish drugs from the Olympic scene. Let alone that no champion would even dream of using them if only he could be sure of not getting caught.        
	Profound sense? Profound beauty? Truth, presumably no less profound? Profound claptrap is the profoundest comment on that.                
	Terms of praise        
	And I do mean profound  as no doubt that writer did: I dont question his sincerity, I wish I could. Language actually matters more than the 100 metres, and all language is devalued if some is overblown. If you declare Shilpa Shetty the most beautiful, nay the most brilliant, actress ever to have cast her radiance on Bollywood, as some Western media were close to conning themselves a year ago, what do you say when another actress turns up who truly does come near those terms of praise?         
	I wonder if even Ms Shetty would thank you. She struck me as a sensible woman who would realize that when overpraise becomes commonplace its little praise at all. OK, we journalists are paid to sex up stories, and any fool can write or talk in superlatives. Some do it very eloquently. Yet fools they remain: theyre devaluing their own currency.         
	Dont imitate them. And that lesson applies beyond journalism and to countless topics beyond sport.                    THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

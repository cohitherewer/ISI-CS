The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | danger ahead
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DANGER AHEAD                                                    
	Everybody in this city, from political leaders to pavement-dwellers, knows about the deadly air pollution that has been killing and maiming Calcuttans for decades. It is common knowledge, too, that this entirely avoidable condition has remained unchanged for so long because it is kept in place by a web of criminal negligence, greed, political interests and inertia involving the entire gamut of Calcuttans, from the most eminent to the least noticed. There is plenty of evidence now that autorickshaws play a significant role in this killer web. They are lawless and lethal in at least four ways. First, they use an adulterated fuel that so pollutes the air that Calcutta has become one of the most dangerous cities in the world for the health of human lungs, heart, eyes and possibly more, if one were to start finding out about these things. Second, making and selling this fuel involve every kind of illegality, enabled by a whole set of people who know they are seriously breaking the law and will not be punished because those who can punish them have a great deal to gain from the situation. Third, more than half of the autos running in greater Calcutta are not properly registered. This too happens, and is allowed to happen, because there is something in it for everybody concerned. Finally, autos constantly break traffic rules on the road, giving rise to another set of offences and dangers.        
	None of this, apart from the details perhaps, is an earth-shattering revelation. People have been living and dying, driving and killing in this manner for a very long time in Calcutta, either knowing about the way things are (fully, partially or vaguely) or in a state of indifference that is quite as dangerous. It does not require a special investigation to figure out that Calcuttans have got used to breathing air that is of a shocking degree of harmfulness. More crucially, does anybody seriously believe that the citys keepers  the chief minister, mayor and transport minister, to start with  know nothing at all about any of this? Then, to put it simply, why does nothing ever happen? Why are high-court rulings, warnings from the pollution-monitoring bodies, special surveys done by medical and environmental teams, newspaper investigations and exposs, and citizens appeals all systematically  and criminally  ignored by the authorities? Is the answer as dangerous as what Calcuttans breathe  and for whom?

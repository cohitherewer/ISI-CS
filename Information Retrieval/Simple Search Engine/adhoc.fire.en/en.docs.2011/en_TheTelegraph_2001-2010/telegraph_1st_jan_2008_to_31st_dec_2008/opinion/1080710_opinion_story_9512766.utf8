	Train of trouble                  
	Sir  I find that Indian Railways have introduced side-middle berths in the sleeper class and in AC three-tier coaches on a few trains. The passenger allotted the side-middle berth is accommodated as the fourth passenger in one of the three-tiered seats in the same coup. This arrangement is causing severe discomfort to passengers. Perhaps the idea behind this change is to increase the number of passengers and thereby the revenue of the railways. But Indian Railways should know that they cannot put the passengers comfort at stake simply to make more money. Travelling sleeper class has become quite a nightmare. The compartments are often occupied by travellers without tickets, waitlisted passengers and day boarders. This practice is quite common in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and in certain parts of the South. The railways need to adopt strict measures against ticket checkers who allow illegal passengers to travel like this.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  We are regular passengers of the Howrah-Azimganj-Malda Intercity Express. We have seen that two constables of the Government Railway Police regularly travel in a section of the general compartment reserved for the disabled. They restrict general as well as disabled passengers from entering this section, declaring that it is reserved for the GRP and railway staff, but are unable to show any document in support of their claim. These men also lock the door to this portion of the compartment, so that passengers from the other side of the compartment are unable to access the toilet. The locked door also causes a problem to passengers when they board the train or alight from it. In the case of an emergency, there remains only one exit for ordinary passengers. When we objected to the constables presence on July 1, they assaulted and threw us out of the compartment.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report, 10 days for normal train traffic (July 1), brings to the fore three major lapses in the Indian Railways. First, it points to the vulnerability of the railways to natural phenomena like heavy rain. The running of the trains started going haywire around June 18 when the railbridge in the Bhadrak region was damaged by flash floods and heavy rain. Trains in the Kharagpur-Bhadrak sections were diverted from June 24. The fact that it will not be possible to resume regular services until July 10 (if not later) indicates the real nature of the work supposedly being carried out round the clock.           
	Second, while the railway officials sit smugly after diverting a few trains connecting Calcutta with the southern states, people like me, who live in Jharkhand, are being hassled to no end. This is because all the trains connecting the major cities of Jharkhand to the South have been cancelled. What is more galling about this favour granted by the South-Eastern Railways to Calcuttans is the fact that the diverted trains are running on the route usually used by trains from Jharkhand to south India.           
	Third, passengers like us are concerned about never being able to get accurate and timely information about train schedules. I had to travel by the Hatia-Yesvantpur Express on July 1 to Bangalore and had been trying repeatedly to find out whether the train was running on time. Till the evening of June 30, no one could provide any clear information and late at night on the same day, the train was announced cancelled. The Jamshedpur edition of The Telegraph had stated that regular train services would resume from the July 1 (Trains to south on track, June 27). While that, of course, has not happened, even the report, 10 days for normal train traffic, gives no indication of when the trains from Jharkhand will restart.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Singh, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  Although the normal running of most trains in the busy Coromandel line has resumed more than 20 days after a snag developed in the Kharagpur-Bhadrak section, the Howrah-Chennai mail is still running on a diverted route. As a result, the journey is being delayed by ten hours or more every day. This is unacceptable, since this is normally a superfast train, and its arrival and departure timings are ideal for many senior citizens. East Coast Railways should immediately restore the normal schedule.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  On July 5, my uncle and I had bought two tickets for Rabindra Sarobar from the Esplanade metro station. I was carrying a folding umbrella and a poly-pack containing vitamin capsules while my uncle had a small carton of torch bulbs. When we were about to insert the tickets at the gate, two security personnel stopped us and asked about the contents of our bags. They examined them and seemed satisfied, but we were denied permission to travel by the metro. When we protested, we were taken to an officials at the Esplanade station, who seconded the security personnels decision. We were shown the list of prohibited articles on the metro. The list did not include capsules and bulbs. But we were forced to return our tickets.           
	When we went to the Park Street metro station, we were able to pass through the security gate, punch the tickets and board the train without any hassle. None of the security personnel at the Park Street or Rabindra Sarobar stations stopped us, although we were carrying the same parcels.          
	Yours faithfully,

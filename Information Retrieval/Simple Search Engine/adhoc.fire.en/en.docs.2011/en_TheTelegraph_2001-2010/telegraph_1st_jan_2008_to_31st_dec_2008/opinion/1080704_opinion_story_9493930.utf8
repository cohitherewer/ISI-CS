	Oscar Wilde made an enigmatic statement: Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone elses, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation. You may not agree with this entirely but there is no doubt that people with whom we identify influence us and to that extent everything is somebody elses, too.         
	 When it comes to publishing it means that we build on the works of others  we borrow their ideas and transform them according to what we make of them. All forms of writing require that we are free to borrow and not required to get permission in advance. Does this mean theft, or what is loosely described as plagiarism? What is plagiarism, after all? Where do you draw the line between plagiarism and plain intellectual theft?        
	Because all writing is a collage of ideas and where they have been borrowed from are often hard to know, there is no fixed definition of plagiarism. Borrowed ideas are not plagiarism but the words used to express ideas without acknowledging the original sources amounts to plagiarism. This begs the question: How many words in continuous prose can be used without taking a formal permission? For instance, is the Oscar Wilde quote, for which no prior permission has been taken from the publisher or the authors assigns, constitute an act of plagiarism?         
	Basically there are two rules of thumb that publishers apply the world over. First, no more than 500 words in continuous prose can be used without formal permission; if more are used copyright permission must be taken before publication. Second, if the work is published and marketed for commercial gain, permission must be obtained from the copyright holders. All doctoral thesis that carry extensive quotes from several authors can be submitted for the award of a doctoral degree without payment of a copyright fee. But if this work is subsequently published in a revised form and sold for profit then copyright permission have to be sought, and the fees paid.         
	In practice, at least in India, the rules work somewhat differently. The 500-word limit has the operative word continuous. If the sentences are broken up, and the gaps are filled in with ellipses, then the word limit is not strictly applicable. This does not mean that we use 450 words in continuous prose, cut the sentence, and then use another 400 words, and so on. This is not just an intellectual sleight of hand but would constitute copyright violation.        
	Most doctoral theses manage to get published. Authors believe that because they have obtained permission to use extensive quotes for the thesis, the same holds if the work is published and sold for profit. It does not. Permission has to be taken afresh, and copyright fees paid pre-publication.         
	Indian publishers are only just beginning to respect intellectual property rights. But the awakening that we need to pay something to the author whose ideas we borrow for our profit is beginning to come home. All that needs to be done is seek permission, which doesnt cost too much after all.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | just tea and madeleine
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JUST TEA AND MADELEINE                                                          
	Shakespeare is shrinking. A recent survey conducted by a British newspaper shows that of his thirty-odd plays, numerous sonnets and two long poems, only a handful of plays and sonnets remains the basis of what he stands for today. Hamlet is still the best play, and Hamlet the favourite hero; Beatrice is the favourite heroine, Bottom the funniest character and Iago the favourite villain. The names of only four or five of the most predictable plays crop up over and over again in this survey, and what is most disheartening is that the respondents were more than 300 of Britains most eminent actors, writers, directors and producers.        
	To canonize is always to reduce. Icons have to be manageable and, in Britain after Tony Blair, accessible (like public lavatories, a modern poet rued). They must leave people with the comfortable feeling that the great men and women of the past were People Like Us. So the giants shrink, the unwieldy and the unsparing become sweetness and light, and political correctness washes the dirty dishes and leaves them squeaky clean. Great literature is now full of settings and stories and endings  and it must not take too much time. Think of what has happened to Rabindranath Tagore. The Nobel is perhaps the quickest path to iconhood in India, and the most reassuring thing about Tagore and Amartya Sen is that the Bengali language in the former and the rigours of economics in the latter absolve most Indians from having to read them. So, even in Bengal, only the tip of the Tagorean iceberg is endlessly rehearsed and actually engaged with. The vast expanse of his canon, the many forms, voices, registers and flavours in his writing and thought, his constant re-invention of the self, have now been brought down to a few quotable quotes, singable songs, muggable poems and filmable stories. And this Tagore, before or after copyright, is wonderfully respectable, familiar and safe, holding out a posy for every occasion. The disturbing and the difficult, what most discomfits and challenges, are easy to ignore and forget in such a fabrication of greatness. Shakespeare has always been, as Borges had put it, Everything and Nothing. So every age makes it own nothing.        
	But the giants wreak their own vengeance upon their shrinkers. It is Shakespeares triumph that his most popular hero is also the master of the difficult and the unmanageable. Hamlet refuses to be nice, or is so only to fools. Shrink Beethoven and you are left with the Ninth, condense Wagner and you are left with the Valkyres, sanitize Mann and you are left with Death in Venice, prune Marx and you are left with the Manifesto, digest Freud and you are left with Dora, or trim down Tolstoy and you are left with War and Peace. Only Proust, physically the frailest of them all, is proving to be shrink-proof. But you can settle for just tea and madeleine.

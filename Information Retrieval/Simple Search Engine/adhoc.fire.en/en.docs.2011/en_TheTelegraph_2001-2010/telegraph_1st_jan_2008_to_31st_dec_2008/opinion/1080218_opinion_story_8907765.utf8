The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | tax woes
                                                                                                                 TAX WOES                                                    
	London is a good place for shopping, as generations of Indians will testify. Most of them only made forays there and retreated to cheap India. But there are some who could shop every day without running out of cash. For such people, the British government made it easier to live in England a decade ago. It eased visa restrictions for people whose income ran into millions. But visas are hardly rich peoples biggest worry; they are more concerned about taxes. The British government obliged them in that respect too. If they kept their assets in so-called offshore trusts, they paid no income tax in Britain, and the government did not ask them questions about how they got their money. The tax regime led to a magical marriage of shoppers and shopkeepers. Over a hundred thousand rich people took refuge in Britain. They brought in so much wealth that London overtook New York as the worlds biggest offshore financial centre.         
	That was when Gordon Brown had just become chancellor of the exchequer. His tax reforms made the British treasury rich; the buoyant revenues enabled him to spend more on social services, brought the Labour Party back to power in two successive general elections, and took him to 10 Downing Street. Now, however, the bonanza is over. The budgetary position is no longer so sound, and the government is looking for revenue. The Conservatives helpfully suggested last October that the government should impose a flat-rate tax of 25,000 a year on rich non-domiciled people. The chancellor himself proposed 30,000. But the proposal raised such loud protests from bankers, accountants and others who made their living off the rich that he dropped the idea. Their numbers may not be large, but hardworking Britons find it incongruous that they should pay taxes through their nose while filthy rich foreigners can get away without paying a penny. To avert their backlash if for no other reason, the British government will return to the idea of taxing the so-called non-doms.         
	But it would not be a bright idea. No country taxes a non-residents income that does not arise within the country. All that a tax on non-doms will achieve is that they will stop living in England, and go to Switzerland instead. There is global competition in tax breaks as well. A flat-rate tax might still be feasible if the British government gave a rebate on non-doms expenditure in Britain. The British value added tax is high. If it were rebated against the flat-rate tax, someone who spent roughly five times the tax would be able to recover it in full. The British would have to make up their minds which they mind more  fat cats who get away without paying taxes, or moneybags who live and spend like lords in their midst. Envy is unavoidable; Britons can only choose what to envy.

	Whats improper about it?                  
	Sir  Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican senator in the US, was recently indicted, for allegedly receiving home improvement articles as gifts from a company which had remodelled his vacation house. The gifts included plumbing and electrical wiring and a gas grill. Stevens had also failed to report the exchange of his old Ford car for a new Land Rover. However, the news received scant coverage in India. Perhaps this was because Indians, with their experience of politicians, could not see what Stevenss crime was.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Fallen into darkness          
	Sir  The power situation in Calcutta is worse than it has been in a long time, and deteriorating even further. We have been experiencing power cuts in phases, summing up to for five to six hours a day. Sometimes, the power goes off after midnight and does not return before sunrise  an ordeal that the people of the city did not have to endure even at the height of load shedding raj in the 1980s. Surprisingly, in the Salt Lake area, and in some others that are not served by CESC, power cuts are shorter and less frequent.          
	The state government has all this while played mute spectator to the collapse of power in the state. It must act immediately before the situation goes out of control.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The CESC has reportedly claimed that load shedding in Calcutta could continue for another year, till the third unit at Budge Budge, with a capacity of 250 MW is commissioned around the last quarter of 2009. But a look at the present load shedding figure of 500 MW and above shows why people will continue to suffer from power cuts even after capacity-addition in 2009. The current 500 MW will rise by 100 MW against an installed capacity of 1,225 MW next year. Import not being a dependable option for CESC and there being little surplus elsewhere in the country, power cuts will continue, at least till Haldia becomes functional. CESCs plants in other states will enrich the company, but how far it will be possible to channelize that power to Calcutta is the big question. It all depends on how CESC gathers its resources. For Calcuttans to gain freedom from load shedding, it is important to build Haldia to its 1,000 MW capacity on a priority basis by removing the stumbling blocks.

	No to empty cabs          
	Sir  While coming to my Shakespeare Sarani office from A.J.C. Bose Road recently, I noticed a sign installed by the citys traffic police on the entrance to Camac Street. It said: No Entry  for empty taxis. Needless to say, the sign meant nothing to the cab drivers, a large number of them being unlettered.           
	There was a policeman perched on the grilled counter at the crossing, but none on the road to stop empty taxis entering Camac Street. Vacant cabs came in freely and even parked in front of the office buildings in search of passengers. I tried to guess if it was one of the means of the police to raise money for their benevolent fund. It seemed unlikely, since no policeman was interested in fining truant cabbies.           
	My question is, why put up a restrictive sign that would not be implemented? Camac Street is a busy commercial area where people require cabs all the time. What is the point of wasting their time and effort by making them walk down to A.J.C. Bose Road or Park Street to get a cab?           
	If the intention is to unburden Camac Street, the parking of cars and cabs on both sides of the road should first be stopped. We need traffic police high on both intelligence and noble intentions.          
	Yours faithfully,

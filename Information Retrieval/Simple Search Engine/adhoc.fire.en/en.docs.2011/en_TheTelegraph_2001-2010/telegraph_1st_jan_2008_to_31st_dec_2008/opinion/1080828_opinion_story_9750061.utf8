The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Little monkeys and fairies have a way of enduring
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LITTLE MONKEYS AND FAIRIES HAVE A WAY OF ENDURING                                                                  
	Where do childrens books endure? Is it in the childs memory tucked away in the grown-up mind, revived by the coming of new children, in parents and grandparents, in uncles, aunts and the lady next door who feeds you with mouth-watering achar? Or in bookshops, publishers lists and the efforts of enthusiastic book-lovers keen to preserve the best of every age? Or maybe in libraries, and in the scholars assessment of classics, or perhaps in dusty corners of old rooms and shelves, waiting to be read again, to be touched again by wonder and new love? It is like a magical conspiracy, by which each individual childs delight, at hearing, reading, looking, touching, smelling, dreaming, imagining and longing joins every other childs in a shimmering fabric that holds in it those uncounted moments of the first awakening to beauty. So even though new writers are born everyday, the old ones refuse to grow old.        
	If someone had told me when I first read Abanindranath Tagores Kshirer Putul that the story turns on the cleverness and daring of a loyal little monkey and a small slip on the part of Sasthi Thakrun, the deity of children, I would have been tearfully furious. (As I was, when my irritated father, leaving on a tour, dismissed my fixed belief that there are fairies in Delhi, exactly like those pictured on one of the pages of Nije Paro by Sukhalata Rao.) Like all children through the years, I was transported by Abanindranaths lilting, luminous words into a world of kings and queens, glittering ships and impossible adventures, where being poor is sad and noble, and it is always goodness, purity and love that win at the end.        
	The child born in Bengal is lucky. He is given a childhood that overflows with rhyme and poetry, from Khukumonir Chhara to Abol Tabol and Shishu Bholanath, its geography ranging from Kumorpara to Bombagarh, with unforgettable pictures, line-drawings, etchings and wood-blocks, with stories from Thakurmar Jhuli to Chander Pahar, written or collected by the greatest writers or the best scholars. It is an unforgettable banquet, but it is a banquet that cannot be approached without a hunger for the language. The strange riches of tales like Abanindranaths Alor Phulki or Girindrashekhar Boses Lal-kalo or Leela Majumdars Podipishir Barmibaksho can abide the change in time. But they cannot fight the indifference to the Bengali language. I was an urban child, and I watch my childhood fantasies through books being relived only by the children in villages, for whom any language but Bengali is a terrifying mystery. This imbalance is the real inheritance of this moment in time. But then, fairies have a way of enduring, whether in Delhi or in other unlikely skies.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

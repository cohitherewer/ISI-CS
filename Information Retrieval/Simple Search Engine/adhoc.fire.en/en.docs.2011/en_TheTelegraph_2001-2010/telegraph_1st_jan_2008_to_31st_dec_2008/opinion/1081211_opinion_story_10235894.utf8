	Two children were caught fighting by a teacher at the end of a long workday. His first instinct was to thump the little ones on their heads. Instead, he sternly asked them to retreat to the corners of the classroom, think about their action, and come up with a solution. Without physically hurting or humiliating the children, the teacher had managed to make them part of the disciplining process itself. This instance, recounted by the male teacher during a workshop in a Howrah correctional home, is an example of alternative punishment or positive disciplining, a concept favoured by teachers and activists today. Implementing behavioural changes in schoolchildren without instilling shame, fear or guilt, besides being humane, also honours the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.         
	Many schools in the West desist from physical correction, but alternative punishment has its own problems, both here and in the West. In America, for instance, corporal punishment remains legal across 21 states; race, class and gender further complicate the alternative strategies. A recent CNN report stated that more than 200,000 children were paddled across the US and that this punishment was meted out disproportionately. Afro-American students were 1.4 times more likely to be paddled than were white students. In India too, class, gender and caste have a bearing on positive disciplining. Poor children from lower castes are more likely to be physically reprimanded than those from affluent families or from higher castes. Boys are also likely to be punished more severely than girls. But crucially, in India, unlike in the West, the use of positive disciplining is still in its early stages. Few tool kits and modules specifically designed for India are available. Not enough is also being done to explore culturally ordained, traditional practices founded on positive disciplining.        
	In Discipline and Punish, Michel Foucault argues that one of the unintended consequences of public torture was that it reduced the convicts body to a site of conflict between the sovereign, in this case the State, and the masses. Riots after public executions were common, and they heightened the political cost of this form of censure. This prompted reformers to look at prisons as a more humane option to counter the possibility of unrest. Discipline thus generated a new economy and politics whereby institutions created docile bodies that needed to be constantly observed, and thereby controlled. Foucaults analysis is not irrelevant to the idea of positive disciplining. Alternative punishments can be considered a conscious attempt to reduce the tension created between the sovereign, the school in this case, and the subject (students) as a result of the violence that the former perpetrates on the latter. Much like Foucaults systems of micro-power that are essentially...assymetrical, the thrust in positive disciplining is on reproducing the unequal power relationship between teacher and student in an apparently egalitarian space.        
	But can one do away with punishment altogether, and still maintain order? Probably not. Human collectives are founded on domination and control. The school, a microcosm of larger social forces, cannot be an exception.

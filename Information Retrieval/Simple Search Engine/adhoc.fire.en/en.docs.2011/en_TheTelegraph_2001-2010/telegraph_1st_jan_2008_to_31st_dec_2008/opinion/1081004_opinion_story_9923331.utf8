	When Alexander Hunter, a surgeon in the British military, founded the Madras School of Arts in 1850, he could have scarcely anticipated the direction in which this institution would move in the next hundred years. By the time the Madras Art Movement took off in the early Sixties, the ethos had changed, quite fundamentally, from Hunters imperial, and strictly utilitarian, dream of giving the rising generation of the country the means of acquiring useful handicrafts. The first wave of avant-gardism began in the Thirties, when Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury  who was renowned as much as a hunter and wrestler as an artist  took over as the principal of the newly reconstituted Government College of Arts and Crafts. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, Roy Chowdhury brought to the college curriculum the best tradition of draughtsmanship of the Bengal School. By the mid-Fifties, this pedagogy had taken a fascinating turn, as teachers like K.C.S. Paniker, S. Dhanapal, L. Munuswamy and A.P. Santhanaraj introduced the ideas that had been changing the history of the Western eye throughout the high noon of European modernism.         
	The artists, who were shown at the Ganges Art Gallery last month (From Beyond the Vindhyas, September 10-27), are the inheritors of this impossibly complicated line  a fact that is belied by the pedestrian quality of the work that most of them had to offer. The reason for this decline becomes apparent if one samples the opening sentence of the catalogue essay by the art historian, Ashrafi S. Bhagat: Within the postcolonial discourse, the narrative of the Indian modern takes on a trajectory to mark it as a site for constructing its identity or the issue of the subjectivity formation of the colonized on its own term including recognizing its ethnicity, race, and gender, which the colonizers had subverted for their hegemonic agenda.        
	As the foundations of creativity are reduced to gibberish in the academies, artists seem to be willing to play second fiddle to the mumbo-jumbo. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain the proliferation of works that seem to have been tailor-made for the newest theories in vogue. As if on cue, each of the participating artists invoked the question of identity unfailingly  although their queries were posed exclusively around the holy trinity of ethnicity, race and gender. The first of this venerated trio  ethnicity  seeps, rather obtusely, into the ceramic sculptures by S. Gopinath. These bowl-like objects have a thin crust of gold leaf on them and look like vague imitations of fossilized relics from pre-historic times. Even the crude attempt at symbolism  a rose snaking out or the foetal twins  cannot quite save these vessels from looking like ornate ashtrays. S. Nandgopals mythical figures, sculpted out of welded copper, look relatively less juvenile. In Garuda, the winged god appears to be part-machine, full of might and a suppressed menace.         
	K.M. Adimoolams pen-and-ink drawing of a battle scene revisits the distinctive tradition of Chola temple-art, but the flaky lines lend to it an unmistakably modernist idiom. However, this purely black-and-white mode, excluding all colours, might become somewhat predictable, especially if there is a lack of lively interaction among the lines. M. Senapathis Love depicts Radha and Krishna held in an embrace that is charged, despite the lurid colours, with an erotic gracefulness. In K. Muralidharans Garden series, the kitsch element is not modulated as expertly. The effect, at best, can be described as calendar art.        
	Laxman Aelay seems to be graphically representing the thickly-laid bronze sculptures of Laxma Goud, and with rather appalling results. Judging by his endless enthusiasm for pointilism, Surya Prakash appears to be besotted with this style to the exclusion of all else. K.S. Chari, on the other hand, seems to have conveniently discovered Ganesh Pynes unforgettable works in tempera, just as C. Douglas has found his inspiration in de Chirico. With both Chari and Douglas (as with most artists in this show), there is a singular lack of introspection that leads to the awakening of what Bridget Riley has described as the eyes mind. There is a festering quality about these tired imaginations, burdened with stale academic jargon and clichs. Polemics have been blindly substituted with jaded agendas.        
	It is only with Rm. Palaniappans unique drawings in conte that one starts anticipating the truly polemical. With this 2007 series, Palaniappan has moved away from his earlier, highly-layered, style that can only be fittingly described as Borgesian. Using a cartographers precision, Palaniappan used architectural blueprints, maps, photographs, and even mathematical equations to create a lyrical syntax. However, in the 2007 works, the dissociation from the figurative is absolute. In Border Negotiations (picture) a swirling unit of lines is almost graphically plotted in relation to a row of dots along the edge. This pure abstraction is directly challenged by the resonant precision of the title. By associating the ineffable with the effable, the icon with the idea, Palaniappan invents a totally individual scale of time and space that is post-historical  referring to, yet always beyond, reality.

	It is a little embarrassing when a desperate bid by a senior politician fails at the last minute. All D.D. Lapangs efforts to transform the Congresss single-largest-party status after the Meghalaya assembly elections into the majority formation in order to remain in government came to naught. Donkupar Roy of the United Democratic Party has been sworn in as chief minister. He now heads the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance, the front efficiently forged by P.A. Sangma, the leader of the Nationalist Congress Party in Meghalaya. Mr Sangma made hay out of the discontent of regional parties with the previous Congress government led by Mr Lapang, and was wise enough to offer the first round of leadership of the MPA to the UDP, which has won 11 seats against the NCPs 14. It is a power-sharing agreement; Mr Sangma takes over the reins two-and-a-half years from now. The twos and ones of the other constituent parties make up that significant 31 in the 60-member assembly. Mr Lapang could not get more than 28 members of the legislative assembly on his side, of whom 25 are of his own Congress anyway.         
	Mr Sangmas triumph has probably been sweetened by the fact that the governor, S.S. Sidhu, had called on Mr Lapang to form the government, giving him 10 days to prove majority support. Mr Sidhu can claim he exercised his discretion as governor, allowing the largest single party the first go. He evidently felt that a Congress-led government would be stable; a perception that the constituents of the MPA felt was dictated by the presence of the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre. The Supreme Court too, dismissed Mr Sangmas petition that the floor test be brought forward. The net result is that Mr Lapang has now become the shortest-reigning chief minister on record. But Mr Sangmas situation is not free of ironies. The Bharatiya Janata Party is a constituent of the alliance he has authored, irrespective of the fact that the NCP is a partner of the Congress in the UPA. As Mr Sharad Pawar, the national leader of the NCP, urges UPA unity for the Lok Sabha elections, Mr Sangma hastens to say that the NCPs alliance with the UPA at the Centre is owing to political compulsions. Politics and power are interchangeable words.

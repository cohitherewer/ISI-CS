	Locked in a mute dialogue stand the two heads, facing each other, the space between and around them rendered inviolable (picture). Is there a hint of amusement around the pouting mouth of the woman? And a stony vigilance in the aspect of the man? You cannot say. While walking around them, you find yourself tempted to interpret the atavistic inscrutability they are wrapped in. The five-feet-high bronzes bring to mind the inspired simplification of syntax that is seen in tribal carvings and, not surprisingly perhaps, echo in the faces of Paresh Maitys paintings. Maity, whose reputation rests on the paintings, presented sculptures for the first time in his exhibition at CIMA Gallery, which ended on December 29.        
	Along with the sculptures, on view were his oils and watercolours, mixed-media works, pen-and-ink sketches and photographs. The common element that links these works is Maitys characteristic way of interpreting objects  scenes and faces  by paring down naturalistic minutiae to abbreviated phrases: semi-geometric fragments at times, emphasizing lines and angles, planes and colours.         
	Yet, like many young artists, Maity began with photographic representation. Two watercolours on paper from the mid-Eighties in this exhibition  Victoria Memorial (1985) and Khandagiri (1987)  show how the artist has evolved over the years, moving away from his early, somewhat earnest, style. Watercolour had been Maitys most used medium then. This exhibition had oils of magnum size.        
	The distillation of form dissipates meaning, which emanates from representational associations in viewers, and loads the visual excerpts with symbolic charge. Among the paintings, this was evident in the Benaras series in oil. Twilight, a large canvas, reinvents Benaras as a subtle mirage of overlapping shapes and luminous colour planes, of uneven steps and darkened doorways. Similarly, Benaras City, with its conical and rounded shapes with flags on top, staircases disappearing into dark arches, and the deep blue of night, is not a view of the holy city, but Maitys vision of it.        
	There was another impressive series. The Alaska paintings, watercolour on board, evoke a different spell. The intelligent division of space into a black, looming iceberg of jagged edges and an inky-blue sky, a smoke-coughing ship and a striking interlude of red in Alaska II, for example, suggests a terrain that could be fatal in its seduction.        
	Maity plays with faces in the same spirit. Indeed, both scenes and faces are structures that can be edited and re-ordered, with little regard for realistic parameters of proportion and perspective. The noses are straight and long, the eyes frontal, staring, and the lips often full and pouting. The tight, tidy arrangement of lines and angles in Santhal Couple can be cited as an example. More complex is the exploitation of space in Sages, a rather opulent diptych of commanding size, in which a number of lean heads appear in a field of mud brown, brilliant red and burnished yellow.         
	But to come to the black-and- white sketches after the paintings is like sipping fragrant Chinese tea after a banquet. They are as lean in body, light in tone and delicate in flavour. You can see how a few spare lines and spry scribbles can speak with brevity. While Nos 2, 6 and 14 are expertly understated, the best certainly are Mt Fuji and Journey to Kyoto, which reflect a Japanese influence.        
	And last, there were a few photographs. These, too, carry the artists search for other ways of seeing things to discover the magical by refreshing the mundane. The photographers eye seeks out close-ups that magnify details, which take on a life of their own  skin textures, smoke hazes, the fine mesh of lines left by the action of smearing mud on hovel walls, the threadbare weave of sagging jute cradling fragile shadows. If the image of a vendor pushing his cart behind a lengthening shadow is cinematic, a composition with coconut shells containing colours and a squat deity caught at an angle from above is closer to semi-abstract art. In both, however, it is a matter of eternalizing an instant, so that flow can be summed up in a frame.

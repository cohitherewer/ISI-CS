The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | And the feasting goes on
                                                                                                                 AND THE FEASTING GOES ON                                  FOOD FOR THE SOUL      So much of our awareness of other faiths is shaped by food                                                  
	Last Christmas eve, my friends and I had a duck-roast party. There was plum cake from New Market too, but no Santa Claus or Christmas trees. We have little patience for all that. I have no clue about the difference between Id-uz-zoha and Id-ul-fitr, but I look forward to the month of Ramadan because that is the only time Aliyah restaurant makes haleem. And the halwa they serve at the Harish Mukherjee Road gurdwara is as good as the sherbets they ladle out on Guru Nanaks birthday.         
	Am I what Praveen Togadia would call pseudo-secular? Or just prone to committing the deadly sin of gluttony every now and then? Neither of the possibilities is particularly comforting, but at least I can take heart from the fact that I do not make up a one-member species. Most of my friends from a similar majority-religion background  which tells you rather sternly that you can extend your liberalism only up to a point  behave exactly as I do. Which is another way of saying that our knowledge and awareness of other religions are based purely on culinary specialities.        
	Is that good or bad? Given the time and place we inhabit, I would say good all the way. Which is worse  the fact that I dont know what the different kinds of namaaz are, or that I maintain a distance from Muslims and Christians because they eat beef and pork respectively? People like Bal Thackeray and Narendra Modi must have spent a great deal of time learning about minority religions in order to adopt their majoritarian political stands. But it must also have been a time spent looking only for difference. Why look for differences when you can find delightful similarities? The clove, cinnamon and cardamom that goes into the yakhni of a biryani are also integral to the pulao that is offered as bhog to Hindu deities. But perhaps the bhog cook and the biryani cook would not buy their garam masala from the same shop (but maybe they are sourced from the same farm?).        
	While reviewing a book on south Asian food writing, I came across an account by Kamila Shamsie where she made no bones about the fact that during her childhood and adolescence, the month of Ramadan had less to do with religious devotion than it had with culinary devotion, because of the iftari meal that would follow the breaking of the fast. In a practising Hindu household, children are often more taken with the puja-day meal of luchi-payesh or khichuri than with the scriptural reasons behind the vegetarian diet. Is it necessary that the religious roots of a festive meal be understood first for the meal to be properly enjoyed?        
	I remember the time when a shop in my para in the southern fringes of Calcutta started stocking pork salami, sausages and ham in the early Nineties. Till then, salami sandwiches were something exotic that posh classmates got for tiffin. The first time I bought a packet of salami and tried to put it in our fridge, my mother threw a fit. But the innocent-looking pink roundels slowly gained acceptance when she realized that they were a lot less smelly than the fish-heads that she stuffed in the freezer for the next days muri-ghanto.        
	In this respect, the supermarkets and hyper-markets have been a great leveller. The heads of the Bhattacharya, Ahmed and Gomes households buy fish fillets, salted beef, and pork chops respectively from adjacent trays in the same section of their neighbourhood hyper-market these days. What if Mr Bhattacharya feels a rising inquisitiveness in his palate for beef, and Mr Ahmed for pork, after a few such outings? Will both of them feel terrible and try to suppress their curiosities, fearing for their faith?        
	These are the mere imaginings of an idle brain, and I can almost hear voices saying, It is very easy to say these things sitting on the high perch of a majority religious community. Will it quieten these voices if I say that I know as little about the anjali offered in our pujas as I know about the zohar namaaz or the hymns sung during the midnight mass? I am mildly ashamed to say that I did not read the Bible with as much care as I was expected to for my English literature course. I have probably denied myself a way of looking at things forever. But can I help it if religion, as it unfolds in the words of god or men, does not excite me?        
	I realize that there is a trap here. Would haleem or pork vindaloo be half as attractive as they are if religion hadnt tried to make them out-of-bounds for me? In a world without religious divides, how would you experience the thrill that comes from tasting forbidden meat? This brings me to the most pressing question of the moment: what should be the menu for a day on which we celebrate Holi, Good Friday and Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham?                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

	All in the name                  
	Sir  Is it fair to get angry with a man, not because he has raped a woman, but because he happens to share his name with Indias first prime minister (Out of a name, June 17)? In all likelihood, the man had no say in his naming. The hugely experienced judges in India must also have sat on judgment in countless cases where the accused have been named after gods and mythological heroes. In fact, the elusive king of the Mumbai underworld, Dawood Ibrahim, gets his name from two Biblical patriarchs, David and Abraham.           
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta
        
	A death hastened          
	Sir Saheli Roy met an untimely death under the most tragic of circumstances. She might have lived if Calcutta police had taken her to a nearby private hospital instead of carrying her to the Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College and Hospital at least six kilometres away. The authorities at the NRS hospital sealed her fate by delaying treatment (Fatal delay, June 16). This clearly violates the instructions in the police rule-book to the effect that the police must remove an accident victim to the closest available healthcare centre. Shouldnt the policemen in question be penalized for not knowing the rules, or, worse still, for feigning ignorance of them?           
	No less culpable than the police was the NRS administration that wasted valuable time in arranging for Sahelis transfer to a better-equipped hospital. Can the doctors who took the Hippocratic oath be so callous as to let a patient die before their eyes? Whether Saheli would have survived or not is a different issue. But doctors, who are supposed to know what difference a minutes delay might cause, cannot be excused for frittering away valuable time. Their attitude is symptomatic of the much-maligned healthcare system in the state. The government ought to take immediate steps against the doctors and policemen responsible for Sahelis death, to try and prevent more such avoidable deaths.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Arlington, US

                
	Sir What happened at NRS hospital when a critically injured Saheli Roy was taken there would not surprise anyone who has had the misfortune to visit a government hospital. While the staff at these institutions behave as if they have all the time in the world, the doctors pretend as if they are too busy to be bothered by yet another patient. And nobody in the government hospitals seems to know how to handle emergencies. Women give birth in the hospital compounds, while people breathe their last lying at the gates. The monumental irresponsibility of doctors and staff at state hospitals has resulted in people preferring private healthcare centres, even at the risk of going broke. Saheli would surely have survived if she had been taken to a private hospital.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sujit K. Sengupta, Monirampore 

                
	Sir The events surrounding the death of Saheli Roy prove that the policemen of Calcutta are not only insensitive but are also irredeemably stupid. If they do not know how to act in an emergency in spite of being in the force, they should be sacked right away.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir Saheli Roys death has exposed the ugly face of police and doctors, who seem to lack all human and ethical values. In any civilized society, such rogue policemen or doctors would have been eased out without further ado. But in Calcutta they escape unscathed, as their colleagues in other departments close ranks to protect them. It is ironic that a city once renowned for its compassion has ended up as one of the cruellest metropolises of India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

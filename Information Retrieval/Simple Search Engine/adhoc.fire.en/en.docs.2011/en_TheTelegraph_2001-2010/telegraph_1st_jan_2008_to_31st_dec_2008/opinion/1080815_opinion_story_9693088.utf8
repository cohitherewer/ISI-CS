	Nothing funny about it              
	The Classic Popular: Amar Chitra Katha, 1967-2007 (Yoda, Rs 395) by Nandini Chandra is a brilliant exposition of that iconic cultural artifact, the Amar Chitra Katha comics, also known as ACK to its legion of fans. The relationship of this series with the readers is both complex and troubling. This communal ideological apparatus, Chandra argues convincingly, uses images, narratives and myths to merge the exclusive identities of the Hindu with that of the nation, thereby imperiling Indias inclusive character in the collective consciousness. Chandra also explores how its creators fused local traditions with calendar art, thereby co-opting localized art practices into a realist, nationalized imaginary. Equally disturbing is the manner in which ACKs cleverly blur the lines between the binaries of shakti and sati in their portrayal of women, glorifying feminine subjugation further. It is true that Chandra is not exactly breaking new ground with her arguments about the designs behind popular culture and consumption. But her lucid, if academic, prose, comprehensive research and the compelling illustrations help reveal the mischievous potential of seemingly innocuous comic books.                                   
	In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs: A memoir of Iran (Harper Perennial, 8.99) by Christopher De Bellaigue begins by asking why Iranians dont smile. It continues in this investigative vein, peeling away layers of mystique to reveal a nation in a state of flux. The West perceives Irans Revolutionary Islamic regime as a scourge. De Bellaigue, however, examine Irans deficiencies  the limitations of Khomeinis successors, malignant corruption and the Revolutions broken promises  with empathy. What makes de Bellaigues narrative arresting, even beautiful, is his capacity to weave the story of a nation through the fabric of its peoples lives. The political thus becomes endearingly personal here, transporting readers into the heart of a faraway land.                         
	Ghalib: The Man, the Times (Penguin, Rs 325) by Pavan K. Varma portrays the life and times of a great poet: Ghalibs early recognition, his subsequent, but difficult, rise to prominence and his tragic death amidst the ruins of his beloved, broken city after the Revolt of 1857. The preface describes the work as an act of penance: for Varma attempts, and is moderately successful, in restoring Ghalibs literary legacy much of which has been forgotten by an uncaring nation.

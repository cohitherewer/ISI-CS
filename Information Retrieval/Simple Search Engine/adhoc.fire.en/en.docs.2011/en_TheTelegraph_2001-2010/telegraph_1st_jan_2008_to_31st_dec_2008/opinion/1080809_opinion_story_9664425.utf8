The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Beauty in a brutal world
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BEAUTY IN A BRUTAL WORLD                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	It is a pleasure to introduce the next important Indian dramatist: Gowri Ramnarayan, from Chennai. JustUs Repertorys Water Lilies gave enough evidence of a distinctive new voice, which, if cultivated, should offer Indian theatre superior texts in the future. Calcutta has seen only one of her four English plays previously  Dark Horse, on the poet Arun Kolatkar  but this trilogy improves upon it so much that we must start clamouring for her two other productions.        
	Water Lilies seemed to begin unpromisingly, for we wondered why we should be bothered about a conversation between strangers in a park in Columbus, Ohio, one of them so obviously an Indian acting a white American. But Ramnarayan weaves precisely this pattern: of three chance encounters in the US between a man and a woman from different ethnic origins and belief systems, with no obligatory sexual frisson and no possibility of ever meeting again, only to evoke human communication in lives touched by violence.        
	So, in Fawn Lilies, the first episode, a Telugu dietician, ditched by her ornithologist-turned-revivalist fianc, watches birds and speaks to a gay drifter, who reveals that he had tree-sat to prevent the chopping down of ancient American forests. In the second vignette, Water Lilies, a part-time painter of Lebanese ancestry chats at a Houston art exhibition with a visiting Sri Lankan woman from Norway (picture); they discover each others traumatic roots in war-torn regions. Lastly, in Black Lilies, a cynical Nobel laureate and a nervous, but devout, Tamil teacher returning from her first trip abroad wait to depart from Washington airport soon after 9/11.Nothing happens in this impressionistic triptych, other than the warmth of talking and empathy. Ramnarayans achievement lies in liberating this essence of humanity. And she does this delicately, like a poet and the nature-lover she is. The dialogue is spare, not verbose. Almost naturally, poetry forms the nucleus of each exchange: the drifter quotes a poem, Fawn-Lilies, by minor science-fictionist, Clark Ashton Smith, about flowers growing upon a fallen trunk; the Sri Lankan recites Ted Hughess vibrant How to Paint a Water Lily to interpret Claude Monets serene classics to the artist who prefers Edvard Munchs agonized The Scream; the Tamil girl invokes mantras from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (echoed by Eliot) to dispel her fears.        
	This is a tough assignment for a relatively fresh cast, except Dhritiman Chaterji. Yet, the acting is effortless, particularly by Sunandha Ragunathan, Akhila Ramnarayan and Prateeksha Chandrasekhar, supported by Chaterji as the men in the first and third pieces, and V. Balakrishnan in the second. Ramnarayan directs her own script gently, and uses a large-screen monitor effectively for the paintings at the exhibition. Water Lilies recreates its namesakes in Monet and Hughes: still points of beauty in a fluxional, brutal world.

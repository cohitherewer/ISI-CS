The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a place in the shade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A PLACE IN THE SHADE                                                          
	Bad money drives out bad money. Manmohan Singh, a distinguished economist, might think that The Telegraph is misquoting Greshams law. In fact, The Telegraph is putting into words a law whose author is Mr Singh himself. The prime minister, in the course of one of his rare visits to West Bengal, announced a special grant of Rs 95 crore to Visva-Bharati University. This generous endowment was declared during the speech Mr Singh made at the convocation of Visva-Bharati, which, by any sensible reckoning, will rank as the worst run of all the central universities. Many have argued that the university should lose its special name and status and be renamed the University of Bolpur in Santiniketan, and be treated as such. Since the time the seat of learning that Rabindranath Tagore created became a central university in 1951, the University Grants Commission and other bodies of the government of India have poured enormous amounts of money into the institution  to no purpose. Has the university accomplished anything that justifies the global status to which its name aspires? The answer to the question, unfortunately, has to be in the negative. Visva-Bharati has a past; it has no present; it possibly has no future.        
	The history of Visva-Bharati as a central university is one of internal squabbles and bickerings; of declining academic standards; of administrative neglect of priceless possessions; and of scandal. The factionalism within the university has forced many vice-chancellors  eminent economists, famous historians and well-known anthropologists  to throw up their hands in despair. Any tourist walking around the campus will notice the condition of Benodebehari Mukherjees murals in China Bhavan, and know the years of neglect that have made them almost unrecognizable compared to their original state. Any assiduous researcher who wants to work in the treasure trove that is Rabindra Bhavan will encounter red tape and obstruction. No one is interested. The university authorities wake up briefly from their somnolence when scandals, like the disappearance of Tagores Nobel Prize, hit the campus. Today, Santiniketan is no longer an academic destination but it is a place where the affluent of Calcutta build houses for their weekend retreat. People go to Santiniketan to meet the same people they usually meet in Calcutta. Even the romance of a rural idyll has evaporated.        
	Yet it is to such a place and to such an institution that the prime minister has shown his generosity. He wants the university to reaffirm itself as a centre of excellence. A university, which from 1951 has never been a centre of excellence despite no dearth of funds cannot reaffirm its position as such a centre. Enough bad money has been spent on Visva-Bharati, more bad money will not change things a jot. It might create a new law in economics.

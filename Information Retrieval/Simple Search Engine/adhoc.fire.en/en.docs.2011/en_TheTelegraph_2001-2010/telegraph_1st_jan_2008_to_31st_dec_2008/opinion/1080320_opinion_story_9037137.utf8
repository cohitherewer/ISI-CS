The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Laughter and sermons in an airy room
                                                                                                                 LAUGHTER AND SERMONS IN AN AIRY ROOM                                                                  
	I remember my school chapel very well. A large, airy room, it looked down on the city from its perch on the fourth floor. The pews, with their gleaming dark wood, were arranged in neat rows. Along the walls were the windows, letting in the morning light and cool air. The pulpit was at one end. On it, every other week, Brother Wang would preach the word of god.        
	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, he would say. The dozing flock would murmur in their sleep. But the world, much to Brother Wangs disappointment, had forgotten the Word. It was now time to put things in order: retrieve the Word, and impose it on us, lost souls.         
	Brother Wangs sermons made me uneasy. His vision of a world in which everyone was expected to follow the same faith matched other voices that were getting louder in the country at the time. This was the mid-Nineties. We would see and hear them on TV  the podgy men in saffron, bearded youth in green bandanas. One could (and still can) switch off the TV. In school, there was the bell, its shrill, electric sound would cut Brother Wang short precisely after a quarter of an hour. We would then stretch ourselves, thank god for the bell, and troop towards the classrooms.        
	Thinking about it now, I realize how blatant, and futile, were Brother Wangs attempts at proselytizing. He was, of course, not alone. There was Pastor Woods, who would start his sermons only after reading out jokes from the Readers Digest. Laughter, the pastor had discovered, made bitter medicine taste sweet. And there were those who were flown in occasionally and who spoke with a drawl. (One of them even confessed that he had been expecting to see brown faces with white teeth!) We were, of course, too sleepy to bother.        
	But the students remained unaffected by these strange men and their beliefs. All of us loved the chapel. Quiet and beautiful, it was the perfect place for juvenile romance. We had friends who differed in looks, aptitude and faith. Some of our Christian friends fed us thick, toasted sandwiches, stuffed with spicy beef. The home-made cakes were wolfed down before Christmas. We would help these friends with their homework, hoping that they would pass the exams so that the cakes and sandwiches would never run out. There was a Muslim girl in my class, whose brother, we were told, was a local toughie. She had a heart of gold though, and a ringing laugh that I still remember. There were a few Armenians too, who played rugby and flunked Economics. A boy from Sikkim, and a devout Sindhi, who ran a business and sobbed while watching Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, completed my circle of friends.        
	My world of lovely people  friends, teachers and a beaming, half-Irish principal who dozed in chapel as well  never changed in those years. The Brothers Wang and Woods were a part of it, but only as minor irritants. I wonder if the two are still around, trying to spread the Word. But even if they are, the boys and girls, I am sure, are busy doing other things: scribbling notes, sharing an early lunch or simply nudging each other to stay awake in a cheery, sun-lit room.

	The heart of the governor of the Reserve Bank of India does not bleed easily; he is made of more solid stuff. So it was a surprise that he rushed off to not too famous a town in the deep south called Tiruppur. It may be thought that he went to thank Sri Venkateswara. But that would be incorrect. He went to look into the woes of garment exporters. Exporting is risky; there is no reason for exporters to complain. But apparently, they had a grouse he had to listen to. Somewhat more than a year ago, he suddenly started appreciating the rupee. That was most uncomfortable for the garment-makers. Their profit margins were less than 10 per cent; if he appreciated the rupee by that much, their profits would turn into losses. And they never knew when the misfortune would strike them. The RBI is an open and transparent institution in many ways. But the governor did not issue a time-table of exchange rate appreciation. For, if he had, the entire world would have bought rupees and made a packet.        
	This is not the first time Indian firms have complained about exchange rate flexibility. Indian interest rates are high, and Indian banks are stodgy. So Indian companies had taken to borrowing abroad, and keeping money there until they needed it at home. They were not such country yokels; they had insured themselves against exchange and interest losses by resorting to futures and options. But they too made losses because interest rates moved beyond the hedged limits. They blamed their New York banks for misselling futures, and complained to the RBI. The governor listened to them with sympathy. He called the bankers and upbraided them for sharp practices. It is likely that he will call Tiruppur exporters bankers next for reproval. He does reproving with gusto.        
	There is a simple solution to the exporters plaints, and it lies in the governors hands: he should freeze the exchange rate. But it is not as easy as it sounds. For there are at least two major international currencies, the dollar and the euro, and he does not know which currency to freeze the exchange rate of again. The two have been gyrating crazily against each other, so it is necessary to choose between them. The RBI has been encouraging exporters to ask for quotes in euros; but American importers see no reason why they should quote in anything but dollars. So exporters have no option but to go in for options and futures; and if they do not know how, they must learn it. When they gain, they will celebrate; when they lose, they will blame banks. They can do so only because the governor does not allow currency forward markets to flourish in India. He should make it easy for exporters to place the bets themselves, and learn the game.

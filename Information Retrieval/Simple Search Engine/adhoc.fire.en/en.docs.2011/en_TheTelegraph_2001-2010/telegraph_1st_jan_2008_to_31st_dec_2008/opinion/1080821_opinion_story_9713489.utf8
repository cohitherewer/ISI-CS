	Not granted                  
	Sir  In Inflation and morals (Aug 18), Ashok Mitra writes that the votaries of free market economy are against subsidies. Not just the votaries of the free market, but every sensible person should discourage subsidies. Subsidies encourage inefficiency in the work force, seldom reach their intended target and do more harm than good to society at large. They end up helping politicians further their nefarious designs. For example, Indian politicians often gloat about giving free power to farmers. But in the end, such a move turns farmers into irresponsible power-users, depleting groundwater resources further. The subsidy on petrol is another case in point. Such grants, in effect, encourage traffic pollution and congestion, forcing the government to subsidize health services. And the vicious circle goes on. Lastly, it is time someone reminded Mitra that the Soviet Union crashed under the weight of its own faulty ideology, and not only because it offered subsidized social welfare schemes.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir In his article, Ashok Mitra argues that cutting down defence expenditure and spending what is saved in the process help quell inflation. Unfortunately, Mitras reasoning is severely flawed. The development of a country is not deterred because of its high defence spending. Israel reportedly spends about 9 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence, much higher than Indias expenditure of less than 2 per cent. Yet, Israels per capita GDP is higher than Indias. Defence budgets depend on a countrys security needs. Canadas defence budget is even lower than Indias but it can afford to spend a meagre amount on defence as it has been spared of the spectre of militancy. A nations defence budget is not a hindrance to its prosperity, which depends upon the dynamism of the people.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Golden boy          
	Sir  The Beijing Olympics will be remembered for Michael Phelps and his extraordinary feat (Eighth wonder of the water world, Aug 18). The American swimmer now has 14 gold medals, more than any one in the history of the Games. From the moment Phelps stepped into the Water Cube, leading his country, the United States of America, all eyes were fixed on him. He did not let the crowd down, winning eight golds.           
	No one could imagine that Mark Spitzs seven-gold record in Munich, in 1972, could be broken. But Phelps with his eight golds replaced Spitz as the champion of the pool. Phelps will surely be adjudged the best Olympian of all time, not only because he has more gold medals than anybody but also because of the manner in which he handled himself under pressure. If Phelps makes to the London Olympics in four years time, he could effectively end all arguments about greatness. The US along with the rest of the world should applaud this outstanding sportsman.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  The Indian electronic media are overexcited with Abhinav Bindras achievement: Bindra won the countrys only Olympic gold thus far. Surely, bronze winner Sushil Kumar can expect a rousing response too from desi news channels. One wonders whether American news networks too have gone overboard with the swimmer, Michael Phelps, for his record-breaking performance. The CNN broadcast certainly does not give us that impression, at least. It is true that Indias medal wins need to be celebrated. But the exaggerated manner in which the media have gone about doing so has come as a shock. Reporters covering Bindras homecoming described how the entire nation was leaping with joy. Perhaps that was what they wanted their countrymen to do. It is a pity that a medium often becomes the message.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The decision to replace giant goal-post type billboards with single-pole ones to reduce encroachment is welcome (Civic body mulls curbs on billboard, Aug 18). However, something should also be done to remove the countless ugly posters that are pasted on every available space in the city. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, in a recent drive, installed box-type waste bins on footpaths but they too were soon covered with posters. A law needs to be framed and strictly enforced to ban the use of posters in public and those found flouting the rule should be severely punished.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

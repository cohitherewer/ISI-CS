	Sea of Poppies By Amitav Ghosh Viking, Rs 599        
	Land, River and Sea the topographic themes of the three sections into which Amitav Ghosh divides his tale of migration seem to speak of unimpeded space, untried possibilities. Yet most of the episodes take place in claustrophobic settings  the opium factory in Ghazipur, lock-ups and prisons in Calcutta, the dark belly of a Baltimore schooner designed to carry slaves and now fitted to transport indentured Indian coolies to Mauritius  oppressive interiors with no hint of exit. One could say that the novel lurches unsteadily from the despair of marooned lives to the hope of reprieve, from the dull certainties of confinement to fleeting portents of an unborn freedom.        
	Trade and migration are familiar themes in Ghoshs work, with voyages and journeys providing the central thread around which are braided multiple narratives, times, locations and languages. His most recent variation on the theme is set in the earlier 19th century, in the years preceding the Opium War. Naming a location is less easy. The only stable setting is that of the ship Ibis, which draws on board dispersed narratives as much as its varied crew and human cargo. The slump in the opium trade affects lives of Bhojpuri peasants and factory hands in Ghazipur as much as the fortunes of European merchants and Bengali zamindars living in Calcutta. The impersonal currents of colonial commerce gather in their wake the debris of intimate histories until such fragments of broken lives end up aboard the Ibis. The voyage across the black waters, however, fails its narrative destiny, as an improbable mix of passengers and crew breaks away, perhaps as a signal of the promised sequel.        
	Ghosh has always been good at telling stories, but he has never used less pretence in their purposive ordering. Accidents and contrived co-incidences are employed almost as candid tropes for the disastrous fickleness of historical causality. The effect, oddly, is not one that disregards the demands of narrative logic. The reader yields to the powerful surge of unfamiliar tales. At the same time, as lives and stories head toward an unlikely convergence, one senses in it a just representation of a non-subjective intentionality, of a process not too remote from the logic of colonial capital. Such a description might appear short of the full reach of the novelists powers. But the hint of abstraction need hold no terrors for readers familiar with Ghoshs manner. History is more personal and strange than its disciplinary protocols might allow, and few writers of fiction are better than Ghosh at committing historical strangeness to narrative form.        
	Convergence of cultures entails that of languages. Sea of Poppies will be remembered for the baroque abandon of its mixed idioms. Languages shuffle and mix as much as do class registers, lowly and lordly idioms, the oral and the graphic. The second mate, Zachary Reid, is a key representative of the hybridity of race, class, costume and language impelled by the colonial sea trade, as is Paulette Lambert, the daughter of a godless French botanist at the Royal Botanical Gardens across the river from Calcutta. Attracted as they are to each other, their story is swept along by a comic sequence of misconstructions of each others language. Neither is skilled in the sly art of translation, and mistranslation, that is the source of the colonial subjects limited control over their material destiny.         
	Such skill may be the gift of a privileged education, as in the case of the convicted Bengali zamindar, Neel Ratan Halder. But the less fortunate are also schooled in the art: the gomusta Nabo Kissin, the Mag pirate Serang Ali, the Bengali boatman Jodu, the convict of Parsi and Chinese descent Ah Fatt. Pitted against such survivors who speak a whole farrago of tongues ranging from chaste Bengali to lascar pidgin, are the clueless progeny of a contained linguistic culture  the unlettered Bhojpuri peasant and the pompous English judge. If language is the matrix of collective memory, it is a fugitive memory for a collective as fluid as the novels cast.        
	Promiscuous philology brings in its own problems, but the novelist has turned some of these into technical advantage. Multiplicity of registers alongside the demands of local consistency might make it difficult to fashion a reliable narrative voice or a character that might function as one. Ghosh tackles the problem by keeping alive the illusion of an all-knowing narrator, only to trap such omniscience into impossible situations. Such moments function as ironic  or at least comic  highlights, as in the descriptions of the strange bonding of women inside the hold of the schooner or in the salacious remarks of Neel Ratans mistress and her companions from behind the purdah that almost break up a formal dinner with European guests.        
	A location for a novel on the move is difficult to name. Sea of Poppies might strike one as a novel about rivers and seas, about the making of new communities composed of lives unfixed from their cultural moorings. Such fiction has had considerable success in the recent past: one thinks, for instance, of Barry Unsworths Sacred Hunger that won the Booker in 1992. In one respect, however, Ghoshs novel is without precedent. Sea of Poppies is, among other things, a Calcutta novel. It would be hard to think of another novel and one may include Bengali fiction in the count that is more convincing in depicting the multiple and exigent lives of a colonial port town with a still inchoate identity. One is familiar with fiction that regards such urban identity in the light of the Bengali reconfiguration of colonial history. Sea of Poppies picks up the challenge of a more difficult and inclusive story.                    SWAPAN CHAKRAVORTY

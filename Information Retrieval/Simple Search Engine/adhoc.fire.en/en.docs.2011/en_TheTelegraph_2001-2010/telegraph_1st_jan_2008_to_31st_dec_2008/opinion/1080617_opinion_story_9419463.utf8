                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       OUT OF A NAME                                                    
	The name makes the man. Indians do not take it very well when criminals go by the names of great men, especially when the great men in question are exalted national leaders. The Supreme Court has reportedly been outraged by the fact that a convicted rapist who had to appear before it answered to the name of Jawaharlal Nehru. The judges sitting on the case apparently felt that criminals had no right to the names of national icons. Something should be done to change the names of such offenders, seems to have been the feeling of the bench. There may be a faint hope that the judges were not seriously of this mind, that they were just irritated to have to address  or pronounce on  a rapist with that name. Else the question of the right to ones name could become embarrassing, one that even the most active judiciary might leave alone. The court cannot be seen to behave like an old-fashioned marital home, where the name of the newly-arrived daughter-in-law is changed so that the identity bequeathed her by her parents is erased for good. The court is not anybodys in-law, strangely enough, not even the criminals.        
	 A childs name is often symbolic of its parents fond hopes and ideals, given without an inkling of what the child might turn out to be. To a certain extent, parents in India are not fundamentally different from the irate judges in their attitude. There is something almost animistic in the Indians approach to names and naming. A name is like a magic token, a kind of verbal amulet, that endows a child with the qualities and virtues it is associated with. The secret prayer hidden in the act of naming is best illustrated in the names of little girls coming at the end of a line of sisters. Their names often signify a plea: No more, please. But there is another element in Indian culture that is prominent in the judges remarks  the deification of national leaders. It is as if their names cannot descend any lower than the heights they have ascended to by belonging to a great man. More, it is an august institution of India, such as the court, that will decide which individuals are unfit for the names they carry, and will take those names away as the keepers of national honour. The image of possessiveness and ruthless intervention this calls up is terrifying. Even more terrifying is the possibility that in some not-too-distant world and time, changing names might become a more absorbing preoccupation than changing criminals.

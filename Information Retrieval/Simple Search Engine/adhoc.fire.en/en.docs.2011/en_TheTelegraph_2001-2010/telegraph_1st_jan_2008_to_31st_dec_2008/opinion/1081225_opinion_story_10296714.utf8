	Research into colonial photography is endlessly challenging. The sepia-tinted calotypes, the salt-and-albumen prints and the occasional silvered daguerreotypes available in various libraries, museums and private holdings the world over are only a fraction of what had been photographed since 1839. Even fewer in number are commentaries on methods, experiments with new equipment and the life and times, so to speak, of photographers. While there is scattered information on important photo studios like Bourne amp; Shepherd, stories of individual genius are rarely available  and in fact, for some inexplicable reason, anonymity, even in the domestic sphere, characterizes much of the corpus of colonial photography.        
	Nor are there too many diligent excavators in the field, pre-eminent among them being the social anthropologist, Christopher Pinney, whose works in the late1990s carved an important niche for colonial photography in academic discourse. His discoveries continue apace. In The Coming of Photography in India (OUP, 2008), he reports that the earliest calotypes from India were possibly made by a woman photographer between 1843-5 in the United Provinces; his source  a 1996 auction catalogue from Christies. Undoubtedly, the lady was a Caucasian; more than a decade later, the studio-trained Jnanadanandini Debi, wife of civil servant Satyendranath Tagore, was taking photographs of women in the family in Calcutta. My source  Siddhartha Ghoshs invaluable Chhobi Tola (Taking Photographs), where he had reproduced a postcard written by Jnanadanandini Debis daughter, Indira Debi, to photographer Debaleena Sen Roy, commenting on her enterprising mothers photographic pursuits. Her child-marriage, companionate life with Satyendranath and journey to England with three young children have been discussed at length, often in hagiographic terms; but there is a silence around Jnanadanandinis unusual hobby. Dredging material that a purist would hardly consider to be conventional sources as well as having ones antenna tuned for the occasional textual comments  often made in passing  are essential for the photographic researcher. Nothing comes too easily  and when a nugget appears, the exhilaration is unmatched.              
	Not unexpectedly, most early Indian photographers were men, and difficulties in maintaining and acquiring materials made it an elite preoccupation, the hobby of zamindars, rajas and nawabs. The initial domestication of photography took place in palaces and mahals and by the closing decades of the 19th century, there were departments of photography attached to the courts of Tripura, Travancore and Jaipur. Photographic eq uipment were often cherished like trophies of conquest. While on his trek to Kashmir in 1864, the leading photographer, Samuel Bourne, wrote with characteristic condescension of his encounter with the Raja of Chumba (Chamba), apparently a collector of cameras and an amateur photographer: I of course said that his cameras and lenses were exquisite, that they looked much nicer than mine, that his room was perfection, and that his bottles were manifold. Samuel Bourne was a brilliant photographer and an intrepid adventurer  but he also was an imperial racist. As for the Rajas photography, Bourne concluded wryly, I cannot say much for the quality of his works.         
	This, however, cannot be said of Maharaja Birchandra, who ruled Tripura from 1862-96. A painter, photographer, composer of music and scholar of Vaishnav literature, Birchandra spent lavishly on his pastime and also enlisted the active participation of his staff: these were light years before the look-and-shoot of today, when setting the stage, posing, focussing and finally pulling the lever were intense technical activities that not only meant specialized expertise but also involved considerable time and energy. The Maharaja would experiment with many poses, and his trusted ADC, the hapless Colonel Thakur Mahimchandra Dev Varma was ordered to focus and re-focus time and again, until finally Birchandra zeroed in on an acceptable frame.        
	These details of Birchandras photography sessions have been gleaned from the colonels writings; he soon learned enough to comment with some confidence on the functioning of the Maharajas photographic studio cum laboratory area. A sacred space where only a few were allowed admission, it was where the negative would be developed in the presence of the Maharaja, a trenchant critic. An enthusiastic outdoor photographer as well, the Maharaja introduced his son Shamarendra and third wife Monomohini to the practice. From 1880 onwards, members of the royal family as well as Europeans and some Bengalis exhibited at the annual photographic exhibition that Birchandra organized in the palace. Shamarendra was also a chemist who experimented with chemical substances to produce photographic papers that could withstand the damp climate of Tripura. He won awards for his work in England  and once again, this information is a mere mention in a general 1890s book on contemporary landscape photography.         
	Clearly then, an inevitable serendipity marks an understanding of the early history of domestic photography and the emergence of the serious amateur. Unless, of course, following generations have an interest in not only recovering their legacies but, as in the case of the artist, Vivan Sundaram, and his film-maker sister, Navina, are intellectually and artistically equipped to do so. The grandchildren of Umrao Singh Sher-Gil (who was born in 1870) are the executors of an estate to preserve the almost 2,000 photographs that he took over more than half a century, both in India and Europe. Well over a hundred of his photographs have been reproduced in the attractively-designed Umrao Singh Sher-Gil: His Misery and His Manuscript (Photoink, 2008). Vivan Sundarams foreword and an essay entitled The Gaze of the Amateur by the Paris-based art historian, Deepak Ananth, contribute to the growing discourse around photography, the photographer and the colonial subject in India.               
	Umrao Singh Sher-Gil enjoyed portraying his beautiful daughters, Amrita and Indira, and his Hungarian wife, Marie Antoinette, in their various homes in undivided India and Europe. As the eldest son of Raja Surat Singh of Majithia, Umrao Singh was born into a family that could well afford his fascination with the camera and allow him to live in well-appointed residences in Lahore, Simla, Paris and Budapest. While the book does not mention whether the photographer ventured into landscape and the Views of India genre, it quite unequivocally displays the talent of the self-taught Umrao Singh in creating a visual family history. Each shot was carefully composed, some mise-en-scnes echoing the trends of studio frames, others reflecting an imagination and sense of either completeness or of ennui, isolation of the subject, perceptions that only a sensitive family photographer was privy to at first hand. This last photograph of 27-year-old Amrita taken in 1941  she was to die shortly afterwards  reflects poignantly the fathers eye: she sits in the middle of the sofa, in a chiffon and gold-bordered sari, her hands clasped lightly. It is her pensive look and the wide expanse of empty space that speak to the observer. Such an interpretation may be written off as hindsight  but though her death came as a shock to the family, her father was well aware of his daughters brilliance as well as of her angst.         
	Like many other domestic photographers, Umrao Singh never wrote of his many years with the camera; however, he was marvellously organized and his visual articulation of the familys life course is now available to us through the commitment of succeeding generations. The legacies of Birchandra and Umrao Singh have survived because they took their work very seriously; in the case of Birchandra, his ADC noted down procedures while Umrao Singh provided dates, if not brief explanations, at the back of many of his photographs. However, many of the thousands of family photographs that lie neglected in trunks, lofts and below beds before they inevitably find their way to kabbadiwallas, if not to bonfires, are hardly so fortunate. Most people cherish the cameras role in representing the present; few value its role in the historical construction of this ephemeral present.       karlekarsgmail.com

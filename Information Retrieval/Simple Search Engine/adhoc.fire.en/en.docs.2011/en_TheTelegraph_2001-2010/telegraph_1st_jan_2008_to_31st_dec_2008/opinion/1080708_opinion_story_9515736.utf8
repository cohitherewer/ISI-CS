                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DO NOT LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The coming together of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress in this age of coalition politics makes sense for both parties if Mayawati is to be stalled in any way. Opportunistic politics such as this had started in the mid-Seventies when the Congress declared the Emergency and damaged the democratic processes that were beginning to emerge out of adolescence. The first Janata collective proved, in no uncertain terms, its inability to bury petty, parochial and short-term interests in favour of a national consensus. It thus started the trend in Indian politics of many such divisive alliances that would put the welfare of the country into jeopardy.        
	Since there is no single leader or party willing to break out of this dreadful impasse and go alone, sit in the opposition benches with the aim to rebuild a national party, India will continue to struggle at the hands of self-serving politicians and will descend deeper into socio-economic and political anarchy. The citizens of India damn all politicians because they are all the same. Their reluctance in trying to emerge out of the regressive status quo makes the major political dispensations appear weak and bungling, corrupt and inept. In this scenario, regional leaders like Mayawati have been able to win a substantial mandate in a large and diverse state like Uttar Pradesh. She has firmly established her presence in the national scene and proved her obvious hunger to dominate Indian politics. Yet she does not spend her time flying round the world, partying with her counterparts from other countries, looking for ideas!                
	Reinvent to survive        
	Mayawati is strong in UP at the moment and is making her presence felt in other states as well primarily because the Congress, over the last many years, lost the trust it had gained in the early decades of Independence because of its own stupidity. It has been the failure of the Congress to deliver on the commitments made over scores of years that not only disillusioned the electorate but also diminished the play of politics across parties. The comfort of corruption enforces the status quo and the hollow belief of let sleeping dogs lie and why rock the boat. In this new millennium, such governance amounts to failure and the creation of a soft state where poverty is misused for staying in power and where sane rhetoric is followed up by conscious inaction. The cocktail is poisonous.        
	If the Congress decided, ruthlessly, to step out of this ongoing tango with incompatible partners only to stay in power it has a great chance of making up lost ground with serious hard work. If the grand old party believes in democratic processes, it should compel the desperately needed change in mindset from the opposition benches. Dancing with fairweather friends can only shove its reputation further into the quagmire. Abstinence from the perks of governance, large and small, tangible and intangible, is bound to cleanse the souls of the Congress leaders who are now eager to find allies that will prop the party up in 2009. India and Bharat are of no concern whatsoever to them. The Congress was, once upon a time, the great Indian catalyst, a party that brought about much-needed changes in the polity. Today it has managed to become a desperate party trying to retain its national status as regional groups begin to overwhelm it, eating into its fundamentals, destroying its very foundations.        
	The degradation of the Congress could have been reversed with ease if there was a will, a strong commitment to and a profound aspiration for the future of the subcontinent. All the leaders of the party should purge themselves if the party is to reinvent itself and become relevant again in a changed India.

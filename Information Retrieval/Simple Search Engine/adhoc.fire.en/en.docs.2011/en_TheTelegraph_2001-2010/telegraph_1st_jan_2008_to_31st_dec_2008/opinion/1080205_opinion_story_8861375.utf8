                 What Mohammed Haneef and Aftab Alam Ansari have lost cannot be compensated for by the State, writes Somak Ghoshal
              Haneef and Ansari: unequal worlds
                
	A strangely familiar circle of terror closed in on two men last year in two unrelated incidents. These individuals, both in their late twenties, could not have been more apart  geographically, socially, culturally  in every sphere of their existence. 
    
	Mohammed Haneef, a doctor from Bangalore, had been working at the Gold Coast Hospital in Queensland, Australia, while Aftab Alam Ansari, an employee with the CESC, lived with his family in Calcutta. In all appearances, Haneef and Ansari were inhabitants of two mutually exclusive, unbridgeably distant worlds. Globalization, however, brings far-away worlds closer. It puts us, global citizens, in an interconnected world, and only within this totality can our private worlds exist. Placed in a global context, beyond the local structures of life, the doctor and the government clerk were suddenly perceived to be equals. Not because of some intrinsic logic of human-rights discourse that preaches the equality of all men, but rather, because both these men belonged to a distinct religious community. In each of their lives, identity became destiny. 
       
	A combination of unreason, malice and preposterous assumptions moulded their fates. On July 2, 2007, Haneef, on his way back home from Australia to see his newborn child, was detained by the police on suspicion of abetting terrorist activities. A few of days ago, on June 30, his distant cousins, Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, had tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up the Glasgow airport. Investigating that terror trail, the police chanced upon Haneef. Conveniently for them, he was carrying a one-way ticket (because his father-in-law had sponsored that trip, he had explained), and a mobile-phone SIM card, once used by him, had been found on the burning jeep that Kafeel had driven into the international terminal of the Glasgow airport. (This, as it turned out later, was misinformation.) The government then released excerpts from Haneefs online chat with his brother  bits and pieces were put together expertly, suggesting the right mix of secretiveness and cunning. What lent credibility to these pieces of evidence were certain unspoken, but omnipresent, convictions: wasnt Haneef a devout Muslim? Hadnt he attended the Friday prayers while staying with his cousins in England? And arent Terror and Islam mutually inextricable phenomena? 
    
	Haneef lost his job, was kept in solitary confinement, questioned for weeks, and then expected to remove himself from Australia because he had failed the character test under the Migration Act, 1958. The John Howard government would, under no circumstances, do the unfair thing of deporting Haneef. So they sent him back on a bridge visa. After a protracted legal battle, upheaval in the Australian media and a change of regime in Canberra, an Australian court finally reinstated Haneefs visa on December 21, giving him the right to seek employment in that country.
    
	Terror had come full circle for Haneef, but for Ansari it was just the beginning. Six days later, on December 27, he was picked up from Calcutta by the special task force of Uttar Pradesh and later moved to Lucknow. He was allegedly involved in the serial blasts that had shaken the state in March and May 2006. No amount of denial worked, Ansaris resistance fell flat before overwhelming evidence. All terrorists say they are innocent, his interrogator yelled back, and physical torture went on freely.
    
	As in Haneefs case, there was confusion over Ansaris mobile phone as well. Apparently, on the train to Gorakhpur, Ansari had let a fellow passenger use his phone, which is probably why a suspicious call had been traced back to it. Ansaris innocuous replies, as a consequence, were interpreted by the officers as being laced with conspiracy. When he claimed that he had visited Gorakhpur in 2006 to get married, they gave him back a mouthful: Marriage? Was it a code for something? 
    
	After a series of miscommunications between the STF, CID and the West Bengal police, Ansari was released on January 17, 2008. By this time, he had experienced the same cycle of mistaken identity, coercion, incarceration, and release, as Haneef. The order of injustice, experienced by each of them, has been different  both in degree and in kind. The transcripts of Haneefs interrogation by the Australian police (released by his lawyer, Peter Russo, and now available on the internet) reveal abysmal ignorance, bordering on racism on the part of the officers, about Islam. The intimate structures of a private life  phone conversations, bank statements, endearments, likes and dislikes  are systematically dismantled in the course of several conversations, then carefully archived by the State.
    
	Ansari, too, was questioned by the STF, but the methodology was starkly different. It involved a journey from Calcutta to Lucknow in the backseat of a Tavera car, with his hands tied and face hooded with a piece of red cloth. By now, details of that encounter have been pieced together from various media reports, but we do not yet know if Ansaris interviews were transcripted. Did he ask for a lawyer? Or, for that matter, did he know that he could do so? Was Ansari then just a victim of local mismanagement, outside the context of the global map of terror? 
    
	Most intriguing of all, had either of these men been proved guilty, would there have been a comparable outburst of protest? Does it mean that human rights violations are justified if suspected terrorists stand up to the test of suspicion? Clearly, it is only because Haneef and Ansari have been proved innocent that we can speak out with just outrage. We refute the tricks of contingency that try to persuade us that exceptional times require exceptional measures. 
       
	But even if we agree that Haneef and Ansari have both suffered human rights violations, have they suffered equally? There is, unmistakably, a structural congruence between the two incidents. Both cases originate and develop around similar motifs of mistaken identity, falsely authenticated by the trappings of technology, interrogation, harassment and, finally, recognition and release. However, Haneefs story enfolded on a global stage because it started out in the West, whereas Ansaris trials began in obscurity and remained confined there. Haneef is now expecting to sue the Australian government for a heavy compensation, Ansari is simply relieved to be back with his mother and wife.
    
	In their freedoms, too, Haneef and Ansari are bound by a common desire to return to their respective jobs. Haneef wishes to go back to his former workplace at the Gold Coast Hospital because he sees a better future for himself in Australia. The former chief minister of Karnataka, H.D. Kumaraswamy, had offered Haneef a government job of surgeon rank, though Haneef has only cleared his MBBS. How does one read this gesture of excessive generosity? Is this a way of compensating Haneef personally, since the diplomatic exchanges between India and Australia on this incident have been few and far between?
    
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the Bengal chief minister, too, had followed protocol: by promising Ansari that his belongings seized by the CID  mobile phone, Rs 450 and watch  would be returned. Hopefully, his job at the CESC would stay as well. What cannot be returned, in both cases, is something more complex, and intangible. As Haneef himself confessed tellingly, The prospect of going abroad for further studies anywhere in the world or to work for any other institution in the world or attending any conference, anything like that, it all depends on me having a clear record.
       
	Individual cases can have closures, but the individuals live on, and thus the routine of indignity, loss of self-esteem and even a kind of abjection is perpetuated. It is because of this ineffable loss  a violation of personhood, experienced as both identity and possibility  that the circle of terror can never come to a close.

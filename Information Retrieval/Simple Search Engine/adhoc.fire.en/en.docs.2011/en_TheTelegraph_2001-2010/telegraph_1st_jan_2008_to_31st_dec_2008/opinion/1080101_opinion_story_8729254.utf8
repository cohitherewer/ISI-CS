	Does the propensity for fatalism that south Asia is reputed to have spring from the irresistible course events there seem to take, or do events take direction from that ineradicable philosophy? It is a question Bilawal Bhutto  with the Zardari now formally removed from his name  could have asked. There would have been a sense of destiny in the way the 19-year-old was pushed into the chair his mothers will directed him to, had it been possible to forget that the violence that killed Benazir Bhutto, her father and brothers, and so many other political leaders in the subcontinent, has nothing metaphysical about it. It may seem a pity that a young man, not particularly interested or experienced in the tussle for power but devoted to his mother, busy with his studies and happy in his privileged world of sports and computers, imagining he would have choices for his future, should suddenly become the chairman of the main opposition party in an army-dominated, terrorism-ridden country. But Bilawal Bhutto could not have been unaware of the ruthlessness of the heritage he bore, a heritage of country and family. His mother may not have wanted to expose him to the dangers she faced  and might have once posed to others. But she knew full well the risks she was taking, and that her will would force her son into a dangerous world where he would have to be as wily, courageous and ruthless as anyone else to survive.
    
	The comparison with Rahul Gandhi falters because he is maturer, allowed by his mother time and exposure before his formal entry into politics. But Asif Ali Zardari cannot wait; he needs to have his son as figurehead, a symbol carrying the Bhutto legacy, while the Pakistan Peoples Party forges ahead into the elections flying the flag of Benazir Bhuttos martyrdom. It is also a measure of the quasi-feudal attitudes underlying so much of the subcontinents politics that the followers of Mr Zardaris wife and her father before her need an heir to dedicate their passions to, even as they aspire to a democracy. It does not matter that Bilawal is just a name, a face: the symbol is strong enough for the PPP to insist on holding elections on the scheduled date, and to persuade Nawaz Sharif to participate as well. Benazir Bhuttos death may help the cause of the people and of democracy in Pakistan, it may help her own party too. For the moment, her son, the new leader, has gained the least.

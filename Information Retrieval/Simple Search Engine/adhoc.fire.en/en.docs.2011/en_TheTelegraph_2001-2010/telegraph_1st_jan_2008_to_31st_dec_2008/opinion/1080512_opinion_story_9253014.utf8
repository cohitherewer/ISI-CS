	With people, without power                  
	Sir  Gopalkrishna Gandhi may be highly regarded in the corridors of power all over the country, but the West Bengal government seems least bothered by that. Gandhi has set a commendable precedent by sharing the common mans plight and switching off power in the Raj Bhavan for two hours every day (Power cut-giri shocks govt, May 7). He obviously cares, unlike the government that is taking advantage of the confidence that people have put in it. By criticizing the governor and asking him to give over the Raj Bhavan to slum-dwellers, members of the ruling Left Front have displayed their stupendous insensitivity.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Denaz Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Environmentalists all over the world are campaigning to save electricity for reducing the effects of global warming. If the governors decision to suffer voluntary power cuts was triggered by this global crisis, then it is laudable. But it seems from Gopalkrishna Gandhis statements that his act was politically motivated. In wanting to share the woes of the citizens, the governor is clearly highlighting the governments failure to tackle the power shortage in West Bengal. But it remains a fact that Calcutta is much better off than cities like Mumbai and Delhi in terms of power cuts.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Swapan K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Kudos to the governor for inviting load-shedding upon Raj Bhavan. I stay in Golf Gardens, and have suffered frequent power cuts in the recent past. One of the days, electricity went off for five hours. When we called the CESC to lodge a complaint, we were informed that the high power output required to keep the South City complex lit up was affecting power supply in the surrounding areas. Is there no way to seek redress?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Samir Ghosal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The governors gesture of solidarity with the power-cut-drained citizens is a far better expression of protest than the usual mode of taking to the streets and shouting useless slogans. The acidic responses of the leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) prove that Gopalkrishna Gandhis act has jolted their conscience.           
	Before unleashing all their sarcasm on the governor, the leaders of the CPI(M) should look in their own backyard (Shock treatment, May 8). Not so much as 25 miles outside the city limits there are areas that do not have access to the basic amenities. The people are weary of a government that only makes empty promises.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vandana Pavamani, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The comments of the CPI(M) state secretariat member, Shyamal Chakraborty, against the governor are in bad taste and an insult to the most dignified chair of the state (Shyamal: Governors gesture aiding rivals, May 9). Gopalkrishna Gandhis decision to introduce voluntary power cuts at the Raj Bhavan every day may be surprising but cannot be ridiculed. Everyone, according to our Constitution, has the fundamental right to freedom of expression as long as the act of expression does not cause harm to people.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Samindra Mohan Roy, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  Gopalkrishna Gandhis gesture, however small it may be, is certainly a lesson for politicians on how to share the pain of the people (only, of course, if they are willing to learn). The governor has been successful in highlighting the abysmal power situation in Calcutta. The CPI(M)s response to Gandhis act shows how much it is opposed to criticism. The party leaders have questioned the relevance of the position of the governor, forgetting that the founding fathers of the Constitution had created the post as a check against totalitarian governments  such as the present one in West Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurabh Pal, Santa Clara, US 

                
	Sir  Biman Bose is all for the abolition of the post of the governor. The post was incorporated into the Constitution precisely to keep the likes of Bose  heady with power and in the habit of shooting his mouth off at the slightest provocation  from running amok. Politicians like Bose need to be reminded constantly that their job is to run the party and not the government. Our leaders, it seems, have not outgrown their student radicals garb even after so many years in power.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Uday Shankar Hajra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I was amused to learn that the Bengal governor has decided to turn off the lights in the Raj Bhavan for two hours every day to make common cause with the people. But wouldnt it have served the people better if he had discussed this problem with the government and worked towards a solution? Taking the bull by the horn makes better sense than histrionics. The police are known to be providing more personnel at the Raj Bhavan for better security in the darkness. So extra money is being spent on account of the governors sacrifice. This negates any gains Gandhi may have had in mind.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Abhijit Guha, Mississauga, Canada

      
	Sir  Voluntary power cuts is the new rage among our leaders. Gopalkrishna Gandhi has shown the way and Mamata Banerjee has followed. But why do these gestures ring untrue? I wonder how many other compassionate figures will join the party and try to share our troubles, while the power cuts continue unabated.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sayak Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The governors sacrifice is not unprecedented. In pre-Independence Bengal, people used to practise arandhan to express solidarity with the suffering freedom fighters. It is unfortunate that the example Gopalkrishna Gandhi is trying to set has been misinterpreted. The loss is ours, not his.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sujit K. Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The governors request that Raj Bhavan not be exempted from power cuts seems to have embarrassed some members of the CPI(M) state secretariat. This is ironic, because the first example of such citizenship was set by one of their own leaders. More than 20 years ago, at the height of power cuts in Calcutta, Jyoti Basu, as a resident of Hindustan Park, had requested that the area not be exempted from power cuts. At that time, many residents of Hindustan Park were upset at having been denied the privilege of exemption. But looking back, it makes us proud to have had such leadership.          
	Just as it makes us proud today to have an exemplary individual such as Gopalkrishna Gandhi in the Raj Bhavan.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bonani Kakkar, Calcutta

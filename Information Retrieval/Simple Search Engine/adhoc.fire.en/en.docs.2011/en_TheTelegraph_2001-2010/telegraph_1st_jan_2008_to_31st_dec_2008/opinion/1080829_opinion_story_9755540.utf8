	To view all human beings as equal is doubtless noble. But to do so, just in order to stop a college from receiving the minority status certificate that the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions feels it deserves, argues something rather different. North Bengal University has done just that, rejecting the minority status certificate that Cluny Womens College in Kalimpong applied for and received from the NCMEI. The commission was formed in 2004, in order that Article 30(1) of the Constitution  giving minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice  could be implemented. The many disputes regarding the minority status of schools and colleges, by virtue of which each is granted autonomy regarding admission of students, appointment of teachers and nomination of board members, can be referred to the commission. And colleges can apply directly to it for minority status without getting into shadow wars with either the affiliating university or the state government.        
	Cluny Womens College, run by a Christian society and established in 1998 to educate young tribal and village women of Kalimpong, received its certificate from the NCMEI last October. Refusing it recognition, the NBU has argued that the college did not consult it before applying. Yet the West Bengal minorities development minister has stated that a college has every right to apply directly to the NCMEI, while the University Grants Commission has pointed out that a university is not empowered to reject minority status granted by the Centre. No state government can do so either. The relationship between university authorities and the state government is rather intimate in West Bengal. The government is always reluctant to let go any part of its control over educational institutions; the NBUs opposition to the womens colleges minority status is another manifestation of this. This time, there appears to have been an actual violation of rules. So far, West Bengals hostility to minority groups problems in education had been limited to numberless disputes: the NCMEI heard 54 cases from the state on July 22 alone. The other communist state, famed for education, Kerala, had 47 complaints for the NCMEI on July 1. The outcome of the Cluny Womens College case is important: it might decide for the minority-friendly Left whether or not it will start opposing minority certificates on a regular basis.

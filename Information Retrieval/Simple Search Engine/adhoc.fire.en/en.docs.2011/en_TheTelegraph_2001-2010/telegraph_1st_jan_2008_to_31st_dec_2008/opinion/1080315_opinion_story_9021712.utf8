The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The battered half
                                                                                                                 THE BATTERED HALF                                  One of the posters on display at the exhibition titled Poster Women (March 1-10) at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre showed a Bengali bridegroom in his wedding finery shedding copious tears in the foreground. Behind him, there is complete mayhem, with his young bride running away gleefully while the relatives stand dumbfounded around the deserted mandap. A rhyme, giving voice to the runaway bride, reads Borta amar chuloy jak/ Porbo ami, khelbo ami/ Jabo na ami shoshurbari (Let my husband go to hell. Ill study, Ill play and will not enter my in-laws homestead). An anti-dowry poster by Swayam showed a collage of newspaper clippings on dowry deaths in India with the symbolic fire, representing both marriage and death, at the centre. Similar posters registering womens protest against their exploitation formed the content of the exhibition, which chronicled the history of the Indian Womens Movement since the Seventies. Inspired by rage and aimed at evoking anger in the viewers mind, these posters constitute art for peoples sake. While the impact of posters lies mostly in the immediacy of the issues they are dealing with, they can also serve as valuable historical records if preserved properly. Swayam and Zubaan have done a commendable job of documenting the posters. There were posters recording such seminal events as the Mathura rape case or the rape and murder of Thanjam Manorama. The captions beside the posters, in Bengali and English, were well-written and instructive.

	On January 23, Rashmi Welfare Society and Eshana got Rahul Mitra to sing Rabindrasangeet based on tappa at Rabindra Sadan. Shesh je na paai, a documentary on the living legend of Bengali tappa, Ramkumar Chattopadhyay, was also screened. Mitra began with E moho aboron, which impressed despite the initial uneasiness. The next three songs, E ki koruna korunamoy, Hridoyo bashona purno holo, and Aro aghat shoibe amar fell short of expectations. The artists excessive emphasis on notation made his singing somewhat mechanical. Dino jay re was his best performance, combining expression with correct notes. Some of the songs such as Kichhui to holo na demanded a better modulation of voice. Some words appeared indistinct, but that could be a fault of the sound system. The minimalist instrumental support of esraj, tanpura and harmonium was appreciable, but Mitra could have selected a few songs suited for the tabla, if only for variety.

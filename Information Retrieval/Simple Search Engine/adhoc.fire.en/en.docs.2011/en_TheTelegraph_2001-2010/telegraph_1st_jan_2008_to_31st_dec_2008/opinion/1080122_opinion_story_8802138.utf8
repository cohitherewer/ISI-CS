	Nightmare in uniform
         
	Sir  Tapas Chakrabortys interview of Aftab Alam Ansari revealed the extent to which the young man from Cossipore was made a scapegoat for a crime he had no clue of being complicit in (I was whipped with a belt until I screamed, Jan 18). It is not as if such violations of human rights are unheard of in India. In 2001, S.A.R. Gilani and Afzal Guru were arrested as potential suspects of the attack on parliament. While Gilani was released on grounds of insubstantial evidence, Guru continues to live in uncertainty. He was given the death sentence only to have it stayed indefinitely, and the situation has not become any clearer over time. Ansaris case points out, yet again, that unlawful arrest and detention of individuals continues unabated in our country. The police take advantage of the helplessness of people, perhaps with a helping hand from the judiciary, to patch together a case of some kind, even when the most fundamental evidences are wanting. Now that the media have exposed the irregularities in Aftabs case, the human rights commission should take over and ensure a suitable compensation for him. The court, too, should take suo motu cognizance and ask the Centre to explain the actions of the police. However long and tedious the process might be, it is time the government learns to discriminate between real and assumed terrorists.

	Sir  Perhaps it was a vital flaw in information or a minor misunderstanding among policemen, but the consequence for Aftab Alam Ansari was life-changing. The police might click their tongue and make excuses, but what does Ansaris future look like now that he had been hounded as a terrorist? And how exactly do the police intend to explain their grievous error of judgment? Mistaken identity? Momentary confusion? Perhaps the most plausible reason would be that Ansari happened to be a Muslim. True, in the terror-ridden world of today, it is possible for the police to mistake an innocent citizen for a terrorist. But that does not give them the right to torture him  or for that matter, to hold him in custody without crosschecking his identity against available documents. The blunder is inexcusable. Given the physical and psychological trauma caused to him, it would be too much to expect an ordinary man like Ansari to take the police to court. So instead of making grand suggestions for getting him redressal, maybe we should feel thankful that he has got out of the clutches of the police in one piece. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although it is undeniable that Aftab Alam Ansari has been through a nightmare, I must also point out that The Telegraph has been unfair towards the protectors of our national security. As it is, our security systems are nowhere near global standards. India has been blighted by bomb blasts too often for the public to have faith in the polices ability to prevent terror attacks. I have nothing to gain from defending the police force. But even as a civilian, I think it is not fair to condemn the officers in such an unqualified manner. It can only lead to more people losing their respect for the police. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Paras Khaitan, Kharagpur

        
	Sir  Indian police are known to have killed many innocent people in fake encounters. Many have been put behind bars in the name of curbing terrorism. Yet Aftab Alam Ansaris ordeal stirred me afresh. What instantly came to the mind was Sohrabuddins death in a fake encounter and how Narendra Modi helped the culprits get away with murder. In Ansaris case, one wonders if the police were enjoying some kind of political backing. It remains for the human rights commission and the judiciary to take action and ensure justice for Ansari at the soonest.

	Ghostly tricks
     
	Sir  It is amazing how the guessing game on the cause of the blast on Shakespeare Sarani took a life of its own in a few hours. Five different agencies ruled out all the five possible theories. Our forensic experts made a laughing stock of themselves once more, after the Rizwanur Rahman case. Perhaps the police should just declare the blast to be the handiwork of a ghost and shut the case.
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  The Telegraph had a sarcastic take on the police in the report, Boom! But cops are clueless (Jan 17), claiming, Blaze or blast, dont expect any quick answers in the do-it-now capital called Calcutta. Shouldnt we rather be thankful to the police for not coming up with any guesses on the cause of the blast? 
     
	After the explosion in the McDonalds outlet in Park Street in August 2007, the former police commissioner had come up with the methane theory without any evidence to substantiate it. Perhaps it was a clever way of denying compensation to the family of the lone victim of that blast?
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

        
	Sir  The achievements of modern science are sometimes difficult to fathom. On the one hand, even a sizeable group of experts seem unable to determine the causes of the explosion on Shakespeare Sarani. On the other hand, Tata Motors has proudly presented its Rs 1 lakh car. In the near future, every Indian family might be able to afford a car, while unexplained blasts on the streets will continue to intrigue our scientists.

	Parting shot
     
	Sir  It feels good to learn that Orient has given up Longman and not allowed itself to be taken over (Orient loses Longman, Jan 15). Whatever Orients new name may be, I would like to thank the house for publishing wonderful titles like Gulmohar Graded English Course, Staynors Modern School Arithmetic and Junior College Geography. As an Indian student, I am proud that the company is now fully Indian.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Pritha Das, Calcutta

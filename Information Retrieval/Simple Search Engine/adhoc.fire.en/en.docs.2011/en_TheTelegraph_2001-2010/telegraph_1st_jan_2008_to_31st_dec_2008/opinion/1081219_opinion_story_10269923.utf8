                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FRESH START                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Having spent the last year and more going on and on about the corrupt and self-serving political class and its bureaucracy, with few exceptions, the many critics of the system and its operation have been proved completely right by the events in Mumbai during last month. Misuse of government machinery to misgovern for petty political ends has destroyed India and its socio-economic realm. Independent India is paying the price of having allowed elected representatives to rule us using laws that were enacted to suppress and cause fear amongst the natives, to protect an alien, exploitative, demeaning, oppressive and ruthless set of bureaucrats, who owed their allegiance to the crown. There is no difference between then and now, except that at present the native bureaucrat cowers and cringes, doing the native, elected politicians bidding, even if it means shamelessly breaking the laws of this land. Some of them betray and connive against their bosses, feeding half-truths and more, in an effort to divide and rule, and survive.        
	Mahatma Gandhi led a movement in the last century that gave the world a new mechanism with which to fight for human dignity and liberation. The incoming government in 1947 did not write down a fresh set of laws, or establish its own code of conduct. It put together a Constitution but failed to make those who rule and administer accountable to that book. Through the decades, our political class has managed to reduce a willing administration into putty, the single most dangerous reality we face as a nation today. Immediate restoration of accountability is imperative. There are numerous recommendations for restructuring the various arms of the government.                
	New rules        
	To begin with, the breed of the VIP must be buried with full honours. Indians, across caste, creed and class, will throng the streets and celebrate this move. All perks must be withdrawn, except those for the president and the office of the prime minister. Those who feel mortified and want protection for their misdeeds should apply for it and pay for the service from their personal accounts. All red lights atop sarkari cars that symbolize the violation of traffic regulations by a privileged caste of non-performers responsible for the dire straits that our nation is in must go.        
	With the exception of the president, the prime minister and cabinet ministers, all parliamentarians must hand over the government properties that they have usurped as private homes for themselves and start to live in their personal houses or in rented buildings like ordinary citizens. They must, with immediate effect, begin to pay market rates for electricity and so on, and also pay their personal staff a salary rather than extract work from them in lieu of shelter in the quarters that each palatial mansion has behind vast gardens. These seemingly irrelevant correctives will be symbols of the intention for the restoration of dignity and civil society.         
	Then, rewrite the police laws and activate the recommended reform. Get Kiran Bedi, Nikhil Kumar, Ved Marwah and suchlike, people with experience and integrity, to form a small war group to bring about change. Cut down government strength by two thirds. Attract the best and the brightest, like in the Fifties, and fire non-performers. Reduce government spending on housing and perks. Ban the lowest tender norm which celebrates all that is substandard, root out the corruption it brings, and buy the best. Dismantle archaic and ineffective rules. Empower the generation that has to reform all that is a result of the betrayal and corruption of our governments and administrators, and allow them to determine the policies for their future. We must step back, dismiss all the old honchos who have failed us, and compel young men and women to bring the change. They know better than us.

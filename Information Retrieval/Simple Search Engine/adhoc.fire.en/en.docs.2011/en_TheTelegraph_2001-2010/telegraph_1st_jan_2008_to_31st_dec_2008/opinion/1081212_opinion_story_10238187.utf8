The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The plot thickens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE PLOT THICKENS                                                    
	It would have looked absurd had democracy made an eerily quiet return to Bangladesh. With the army-backed caretaker government refusing to lift the emergency (imposed in January 2007), the forthcoming general elections were expected to be a bleak and unnatural affair. But thankfully, the restoration of normalcy in Bangladesh would now take place along a normal path. After endless dilly-dallying, the interim government has decided to end the emergency on December 17. It may sound too good to be true, but political parties will finally be able to campaign freely, hold public rallies and canvas for votes fearlessly. The two main parties  Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by Begum Khaleda Zia, and the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina Wajed  had repeatedly complained against the severity with which military leaders have maintained an iron grip over the polity. Bangladesh is, undoubtedly, one of the most corrupt countries in the world. A rigorous cleansing of its political establishment was a pre-requisite for the general elections. But the enthusiasm of the military government in purging the impurities has sometimes been overstated.        
	The end of this prolonged period of constitutional restrictions brings in its wake risks as well as responsibilities. There is always the danger of fresh scuffles breaking out prior to the general elections. In fact, the emergency itself had been imposed after violent clashes broke out between the BNP and the Awami League days before the ninth general polls last year. After a stringent clean-up act over two years, it can be hoped that the army has finally resolved the endless law-and-order crisis in the country and that Bangladesh is now ready for free and fair elections. But the self-interest of the military commanders and the armys eagerness to have a share of the political pie have added a fearful edge to the electoral game of chess. The former military dictator, H.M. Ershad, with his Jatiya Party, is desperately keen to make a comeback. His desperation is palpable from the fact that he has already tried to strike a deal with his former enemy, Ms Wajed, who (along with Ms Zia) had ousted him in 1990. After failing to arrive at a consensus over parliamentary seats, the deal has fallen through. If Mr Ershad turns to Ms Zia and her Islamist bloc now, things may take an ugly turn. The plot has thickened quite darkly, and already there are sinister echoes of the Bhutto-Musharraf-Sharif trio.

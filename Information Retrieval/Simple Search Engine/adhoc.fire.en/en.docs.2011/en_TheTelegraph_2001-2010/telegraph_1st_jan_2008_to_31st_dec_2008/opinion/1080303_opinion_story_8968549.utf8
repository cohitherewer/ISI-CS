The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the buck Passes 
                                                                                                                 THE BUCK PASSES                                                     
	Prathibha Murthy worked for HP GlobalSoft, a business process outsourcing unit in Bangalore. She worked night shifts, and was picked up from home and dropped back by taxis engaged by the employer, as is the common practice. On the night of 13 December, 2005, a taxi-driver picked her up, took her to an isolated spot, raped her and killed her. He was caught two days later. To the common man, the case looks straightforward. The taxi-driver was the rapist and murderer. He was caught, and he confessed. He should be punished. But the police did not stop there. In the first information report, they mentioned that Murthy was employed by HP GlobalSoft, whose managing director was Som Mittal, and cited a law made by the Karnataka government that placed the responsibility for the safe transport of employees on the employer. Mr Mittal was charged in a Bangalore fast-track court. He appealed to the Supreme Court; it turned down the appeal last week. So now, two years after Murthy was murdered, Mr Mittal will be tried; it is highly likely that he will be convicted.        
	He will not be hanged; even the Karnataka government is not so crazy. But what happens to him will be watched by many executives in similar positions. Bangalore has over 200,000 BPO workers, working in a few thousand firms. Each must have someone in charge. Each of them will be liable to be punished if an employee of his suffers harm. The first ripples are already visible. Nasscom has drawn up new guidelines. Under them, a woman must not be the first to be picked up or last to be dropped by a taxi-driver; in other words, women must always be accompanied by men. So BPO firms will now have to hire male escorts for their female employees. Since the males would be largely useless otherwise, the firms will probably hire buses to save on males; taxis will lose business.         
	But the most rational thing for firms like HP would be to move out of Bangalore. It has already suffered erosion of its brand value on account of congestion and pollution; the BPO industry has been growing faster elsewhere. Now the trickle may turn into a flood. Calcutta will improve its chances; but it is Chennai that will reap the whirlwind. In the midst of these unintended consequences, someone in the courts should be asking the question: does the Karnataka government have any responsibility or not? Should it not be using its police to screen taxi-drivers? Will it be passing a law next that if a domestic servant murders a housewife, her husband should be convicted for having employed the murderer? It is sad that governments in India are so poor at carrying out their duties, but even sadder that they pass on their responsibilities to those they should serve.

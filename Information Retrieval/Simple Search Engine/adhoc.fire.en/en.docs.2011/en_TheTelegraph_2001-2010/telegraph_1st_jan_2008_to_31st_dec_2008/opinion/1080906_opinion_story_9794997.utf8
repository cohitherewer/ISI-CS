The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A song for the promised day
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A SONG FOR THE PROMISED DAY                                  India should help Pakistan establish democracy, since justice cannot prevail in the subcontinent in its absence, writes Surendra Munshi                          Asma Jahangir (right): voice of freedom                                  
	Asma Jahangir, the renowned human rights activist and lawyer from Pakistan, was in Calcutta recently. She came at the invitation of Bengal Initiative to give the Third Amiya Gooptu Memorial Lecture. My evening at the lecture was doubly rewarding since I not only got to listen to Jahangir but also had the opportunity to meet Salima Hashmi, the Pakistani painter and activist who had come from Lahore. For me, I must admit, it was important to meet Hashmi, who is also the daughter of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, a poet I admire. Faiz was one of the most distinguished poets of the Indian subcontinent. If a list is made of the persons who were not awarded the Nobel Prize even though they richly deserved it, Faizs name would feature high up there. However, Faiz was suitably rewarded in his lifetime by the admiration he enjoyed in Pakistan and abroad. I was happy to hear from Hashmi that he was still popular, even among the younger generation.        
	Jahangirs role in the human rights commission of Pakistan is well known. Her life has been a struggle against the abuses of human rights in Pakistan under military dictatorships. She deserves to be heard seriously. Jahangir noted that a common attitude she encountered in Pakistan and also in India was what she termed self-denial. There is a tendency in these countries to deny what needs to be admitted based on what is actually happening there. If Pakistanis deny the existence of the jihad industry, Indians remain blind to the issue of religious intolerance that has assumed alarming proportions recently. But how can corrective actions be taken if the existence of problems is not admitted? For Pakistan, a major problem is that democratic institutions have time and again been thwarted by the role played there by the military.              
	This has created a situation that is characterized by a misguided concept of governance and a lack of access to justice. There is, above all, a dearth of wise political leadership. While there are many clever politicians who engage in politics for their own gain, one looks in vain for politicians who can consider the larger interest of the nation in a far-sighted manner. And yet, politicians and political parties are of crucial importance in a country like Pakistan. It is wrong to believe, Jahangir emphasized, that democracy can be founded just on the strength of civil society organizations. Such organizations play a significant role in a democratic society, but they cannot replace political parties.        
	This brief report on Jahangirs lecture cannot do justice to the richness of her views. She spoke as a woman and a human being, as a citizen of Pakistan and at the same time as a person from the Indian subcontinent who is well-aware of the problems that are common to different countries in this part of the world. If she could begin her lecture with an open admission of her admiration for Mahatma Gandhi, she could close with the words of Faiz. She was bold, yet responsible in her speech. It was clear to all those present in the hall that this was the voice of a person who had, at considerable risk to herself, challenged the armed authority of Pakistan for several years now for the sake of justice for those who were denied it.        
	Politics has acquired a negative connotation in Indian public life. It is not uncommon to put the blame for the decline of institutions on the manner in which everything gets politicized here. Politicization then comes to mean the use of intrigue and manoeuvre for gaining power to further ones interests or those of family and friends. We see political players not only in the political arena but also in different institutions and professions. Thus, a university or an association of doctors or any other voluntary organization gets hijacked for petty political reasons and fails to develop properly. It is therefore not surprising that politics is distrusted in this country. Decent people stay away from the murky game of politics.        
	However, there is another side to the story. We need to understand that for democracy to function properly, it is important to find ways to institutionalize the participation of different social groups in the democratic process. Political parties play, or are supposed to play, a significant role here. They represent different social groups and this makes it possible for them to engage in the competition for power. If different political parties perform this function even to some extent, they would serve a useful purpose in a democratic society. They would give the people some say in the process of decision-making.        
	For a person like Jahangir, living as she does in Pakistan, where the military used to be an overwhelming presence even some time back, it is understandable that she recognizes the usefulness of politicians and political parties. Politics means participation that the military denies. It denies human beings their dignity. A case in point is that of Mukhtaran Bibi, a Pakistani woman who was gang-raped in 2002. She received national and international recognition for the manner in which she fought for her rights and the way in which she went beyond herself and worked for the benefit of those who might become victims like her. She was fighting, as she said, for the rights of the next generation. At the height of her popularity, she was prohibited from travelling abroad. Pervez Musharraf admitted that he was responsible for this prohibition. He saw in her popularity a scheme to malign Pakistan and to undermine him. He went so far as to say that proclaiming oneself as a rape victim has become a money-making concern in Pakistan.              
	What is common to both Pakistan and India is the manner in which clever politicians live off politics. In the pursuit of their personal interests, they obstruct the real participation of the people. There is hardly any politician in India who does not claim to serve the poor of the land. The promises that are made before an election are generally forgotten as soon as the election is over. Those who claim to represent the poor and yet betray them can be more harmful than those who make no such tall claim.        
	It is in the interests of both India and Pakistan and their neighbours to evolve democratic practices founded on age-old wisdom and to devote politics in the subcontinent to the pursuit of justice, not of armed injustice. If one thinks of it, it is not really impossible to move in that direction. Against the charge that such a hope is nave, I can retort in the words of one of Faizs most famous poems, movingly sung by Iqbal Bano. We shall see, he wrote, we shall certainly see the promised day.

	One more time                  
	Sir  Alright, so Sourav Ganguly has come back virtually from the dead. But was there nothing more important happening on October 1 in the city, country or the world to get precedence over the news of Gangulys inclusion in the first two Tests against Australia (Sourav stays amid bowout buzz, Oct 2)? While one can understand the average Bengalis obsession with Dada, it is quite bewildering to see the media being so ridiculously besotted with the icon. The day-to-day developments in a cricketers life cannot be regarded as more important than all else. Will it be too much to ask the Indian press to please leave Ganguly alone so that he can get on with the task of playing cricket to the best of his ability? Ganguly has been a good cricketer over a period of time and has served his country well. But like everyone else, he is nearing the end of his career. (He has announced his retirement from cricket after the Australian series.) No purpose will be served by constantly reminding him that the end is near.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Chanchal Banerjee, Croydon, UK

                
	Sir  The selection of Sourav Ganguly for the first two Tests against Australia is a welcome move by the new selectors who have been appointed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Too much was being made of his omission from the Irani trophy. Moreover, it was unfair to single out Gangulys failure in the Sri Lanka series because other senior players had fared no better than him. It has become a routine affair with some self-styled experts to make Ganguly the scapegoat when the team fails to cover up the poor performance of other seniors. It was good to see an ex-cricketer like Syed Kirmani wholeheartedly supporting Gangulys inclusion, just as it was disturbing to read Kiran Mores continuing tirade against the most successful cricket captain India has produced.           
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  One must congratulate the BCCIs newly elected president, Shashank Manohar, and the new selection committee headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth for selecting the Fab Five (Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Kumble and Ganguly) to represent India against Australia. Taken together, their performance has few parallels in Indian crickets history. One understands that all the players have been selected for the first two Tests. Then why is it being said that only Ganguly will be dropped if he fails to perform in these two Tests? Doesnt the same go for the others too?           
	It is time, though, for our iconic cricketers to plan their future, if they have not done it already. The nation should not go on guessing every time a team selection is on the cards.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Troubled triangle           
	Sir  From the conviction Ashok Mitra shows while arguing that Asif Ali Zardari was installed as the Pakistani president only after the American administration vetted the decision, it seems that Mitra is privy to the goings-on inside Pentagon (Terror, come, soon, soon, Sept 26). He must have really strong sources, since not even Zardaris opponents in Pakistan have raised this allegation. Mitras target, obviously, is the impaired administration of Pakistan. Most Pakistani politicians may have a long list of corruption charges against their names, but using the worn-out argument of a US-Pak nexus to condemn Pakistans administrative failures is in bad taste. Also, the warning that India too is succumbing to the political supremacy of the United States of America is an argument used on and off by Indian Marxists. True, the US plays the Big Brother in global politics, but linking all national ills to it has outgrown its novelty.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is understandable that Ashok Mitra, a diehard communist, is against any proximity between India and the US. But his condoning of the barbarism of the Taliban in order to tarnish the US is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. He presumes too much if he thinks that the US had influenced Pakistan to bring about all kinds of socio-economic disasters on itself. Pakistan suffers from the misrule of its short-sighted dictators.           
	The US army decided to attack the Taliban from inside Pakistan, not with the purpose of devastating the nation but because the Pakistani government has been harbouring and training terrorists. Although Pakistans primary aim for giving shelter to terrorists had been to upset Indias social equilibrium, the Islamic jihadis are running a terror regime all over the world. Even after 9/11, the US government sent aid worth billions of dollars to the Pervez Musharraf regime to help it uproot terror elements from Pakistani soil; but he spent the funds to provide them further nourishment and encouragement.           
	Mitra has also erred in comparing India and Pakistan in their inclination to bow to the USs commands. The Indian government may not have been very successful in managing its internal affairs, but that does not call for its comparison with a failed State. The US and India have come close because the latter is fast emerging as one of the global powers. Mitras cynicism about Indias relationship with the US has only belittled the glory of our country.           
	Yours faithfully,

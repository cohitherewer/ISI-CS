The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the beginning, there was the force
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS THE FORCE                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      Dance                                                
	Shinjan Nrityalay presented Nrityanjali at Rabindra Sadan on October 26. Under the guidance of Aloka Kanungo, an established Odissi dancer and a senior disciple of Kelucharan Mahapatra, the programme featured the students of this institution and they presented traditional Odissi numbers as well as other innovatively choreographed performances. The evening commenced with saswata chakra, narrating the journey of ones life with the help of simple, yet beautiful, compositions.        
	The participants performed with great enthusiasm and displayed their mastery over rhythm through the different beats of ektaali, tripata and taalamalika. Most of the performers in this group were young. Bearing this fact in mind, the choreographer composed the show brilliantly by incorporating the element of chauk bhangi, one of the basic standing positions in Odissi. This presentation concluded with the Shankaracharya shloka that set the mood for what was to follow later in the evening. Next in line was pallavi, a performance based on raga Vasant. Maintaining the originality of Kelucharan Mahapatra, Kanungo improvised it for the group presentation. The participants succeeded in creating the colourful mood of spring through their fluid moves and joyous expressions. The dancers were accompanied by Bamadeb Biswal (pakhawaj), Tarit Bhattacharya (vocals), Sukhomoy Bhattacharya (sitar) and Gour Ghosh (flute). Lalita labangalata, an abhinaya from Jayadevs Geetagovindam, was an average presentation and failed to impress.        
	Introducing innovations and experiments in a classical format can be a challenging task. However, it can also motivate dancers to infuse new elements into a traditional form.The second half of Nrityanjali dealt with such an experimental presentation: Shakti. Based on ravana chhaya and sabda nritya  two now almost extinct forms of Odissi  the production tried to portray the energy that controls, preserves and destroys life in this universe. Divided into different scenes, the presentation progressed through a crisply woven medley of dance, music and power-point presentations. Various stories from the Hindu mythology were used to depict shakti in different forms, both fierce and gentle. The graceful movement of the dancers, who used speed and the stage to perfection, was delightful. Their exquisite command over rhythm and the difficult static poses deserve praise.         
	Like any other successful presentation, Shakti was marked by excellent teamwork, authentic postures, and flawless control. The participants included Arpita Venkatesh, Debipriya Dutt, Ishita Mandol, Nabanita Bannerjee, Nivedita Daw, Suparna De and others.

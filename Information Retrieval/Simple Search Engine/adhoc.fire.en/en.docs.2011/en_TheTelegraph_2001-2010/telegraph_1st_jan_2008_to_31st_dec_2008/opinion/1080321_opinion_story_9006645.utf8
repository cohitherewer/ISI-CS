	The Oxford Companion to Italian Food
  By Gillian Riley, Oxford, Rs 1,450  
	Ask anyone remotely interested in food about Italian food and the inevitable response will be pasta, or more specifically, spaghetti. Yet, if one looks up the entry under pasta in the book under review, one learns that pasta did not become the national food of Italy until after World War II. Pasta as the global symbol of Italy and its food is thus very recent. It is gems like this that make the Companion not only a gastronomes delight, but a historians as well.  
	There is a wonderful section on Italian table manners. It will make a stiff-upper-lipped Anglo-Saxon toff digging into his half-cooked steak in his club squirm. In Italy, slurping of pasta is not only permitted, but encouraged. It is peccato mortale, a mortal sin, not to take up a lamb chop in ones fingers, for the teeth to get at the last tasty morsels. Riley proceeds to describe the recommended mode of eating: The knife is used to cut things up, then put neatly to one side, and the fork is taken in the right hand and, helped with a lump of bread in the left, conveys food to the mouth. The bread does not sit, buttered, in neat slices on a plate; it is broken up into serviceable pieces on the tablecloth, sometimes balanced on the rim of ones plate. It is used to mop as well as push, for another mortal sin is to leave the juices uneaten.        
	This mode of eating makes it obvious that the Italians have a healthy, down-to-earth attitude towards food. Their passion for food is driven by enjoyment. The food (or the way of eating it) may or may not be appealing to look at, but so long as it is tasty, and so long as it is enjoyed, all is well. This book conveys the Italian passion for and enjoyment of food, as well as the infinite variety the country provides for the palate. Italy induces hunger.        
	There is another hallmark of Italian food. It is prepared in a simple fashion in comparison to, say, the French style of cooking. This simplicity is deceptive. Every cook thinks he can make a good pasta. It is only after one has tasted a properly made pasta by a master cook that one realizes the difference between the ordinary and the real McCoy. Riley pushes to be more knowledgeable and discerning about the real stuff.        
	This review began by talking about the commonest misconception about Italian food. Another misconception, as Riley notes, concerns Parma ham. Riley upholds it as one of the greatest glories of the region. Yet, in the form that it is known today, it is a relative newcomer...a century ago, Parma ham as we know it did not exist. Ham from other regions have a longer lineage: San Daniele, for example, probably goes back to the 11th century. Fine cured ham, Riley says with every good reason, is usually enjoyed as a luxury, on its own; but in Saltimbocca alla Romana, it is pressed with a fragrant sage leaf into a thin slice of veal; or it can be wrapped round sea bass, to bake in the oven, sprinkled with grappa. The mouth waters just reading this decription in the book.        
	Another small surprise is an entry called Goby. Nothing to do, of course, with either the desert or the Indian vegetable. In Italian cuisine, it is a small, undistinguished fish much loved by the Venetians. An old ditty says, At Venice, famed for dainty dishes,/The Gobies rank the first of fishes. Today, this fish is the essential element of a dish called Brodetto in which the fishes are cooked in oil flavoured by browning onion and garlic which are then removed, continued with vinegar or wine, and finished in sea water or salted water and eaten with polenta.        
	It is not just nuggets like this that make this book a treasure trove which can be dipped into again and again. To her immense knowledge of Italian food and cuisine, Riley brings a perceptive appreciation of the intermeshing of food and culture. Her writing is clear, evocative and made charming by just the right amount of humour. The way she manages her ingredients to make this a gastronomes indispensable bedside reading suggests that she may be a good cook herself.

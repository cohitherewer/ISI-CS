	Flickering hope                  
	Sir  With the fate of the small-car project in Singur still uncertain, the government of West Bengal has salvaged its dented image by securing a key licence for the German wholesaler, Metro Cash amp; Carry (Bloc to issue Metro licence, Sept 29). The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, deserves to be applauded for his tireless efforts to bring investment to the state. Bhattacharjee has not only proved himself before the people of West Bengal, but also before the members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).           
	In Singur, the CPI(M) is at loggerheads with its opponent, the Trinamul Congress. The fiasco over the German firm had a more complicated provenance, since it was the Forward Bloc, an ally of the Left Front, that was standing in the way. Perhaps it is the uniqueness of Indian democracy that fosters a bizarre situation in which a political party has to deal with opposition not only from its rivals but also from its allies. Having resolved the Cash amp; Carry crisis, the chief minister now needs to ensure that adequate security is promised to the Tatas as well. That can be the only way of winning the trust of those investors who are keen to put their money in Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,        Gautam Das Gupta,Hakimpara, Siliguri              
	Sir  Most Calcuttans will welcome the arrival of Metro Cash amp; Carry, but the whole episode should be a lesson for the Left Front government. Next time Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decides to invite investors to the state, he better be forthright about his plans. Instead of going by his own whims and fancies, as he has done with the Tata small-car plant in Singur, he should seek the consent of his rivals as well as his allies. Such prudence is going to save him a whole lot of embarrassment and the industrialists a lot of unwarranted trouble.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Navin Malhotra, Calcutta

      
	Sir  It is a great relief that Metro Cash amp; Carry has been allowed to open its outlet in Calcutta. As it is, the Singur chapter is far from closed, and several blue-chip companies seem to be on the verge of leaving as well. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has proved his mettle as chief minister by securing the licence for the German company. The people of West Bengal should give him the credit he richly deserves. They should also realize that if Mamata Banerjee were to become the chief minister someday, Bengal is bound to plunge into an economic abyss.             
	Yours faithfully,      
Vijay Kumar Lunia, Calcutta

    
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee showed great strength of character by directing the agri-marketing board to issue a licence to enable Metro Cash amp; Carry start its business operations. However, Bhattacharjee should have taken such a step a long time ago. It was disappointing to see the chief minister act only when the Germans threatened to leave. One hopes that Bhattacharjee will succeed in desisting the Tatas from leaving Singur, thereby defeating the evil designs of Mamata Banerjee.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Vijay Mahajan, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not have used his special powers better than to renew the licence of Metro Cash amp; Carry. This step has not only been welcomed by the business fraternity in Bengal, but it has also restored the faith of the people in the office of the chief minister after the interminable, disheartening negotiations over Singur.  
	Yours faithfully,      
Aamir Sajjad Ahmed, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The huge structure from which the German firm, Metro Cash amp; Carry, is supposed to operate, did not come up in a day. Considerable time and money were spent on it. The Forward Bloc may have a policy against the entry of multi-national companies in retail trade, and their policy may also have genuine merits. But such a policy cannot be implemented in the final stages of the completion of a project, which had been started a long time ago.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarmi Das Gupta, Calcutta 

              
	Sir  Investors in Bengal are facing a catch-22 situation. Mamata Banerjee is still opposed to the Tata project in Singur. The Forward Bloc failed to stop Metro Cash amp; Carry from entering Bengal, largely because of the chief ministers firm intervention. The work culture in the state is already below par, with trade unions ruling the roost in government offices.           
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dream of a resurgent Bengal is in tatters because of insensitive and ruthless policies. Bhattacharjee and his party would have to change their mode of operation by involving people at the grassroots as well as all other political parties in the negotiations if they want Bengal to prosper.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

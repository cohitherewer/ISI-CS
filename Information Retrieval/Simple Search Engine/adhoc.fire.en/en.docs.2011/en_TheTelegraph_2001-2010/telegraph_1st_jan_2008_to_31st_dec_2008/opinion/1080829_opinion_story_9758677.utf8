	With increased air traffic and modernization of airports, the airport bookshop has become a vital retail outlet for all publishers. But unlike other city outlets that specialize in some subjects or the other, airport bookshops go strictly for entertainment of the lowest kind so that passengers can flip through the books during their journey and then toss them aside. Few have understood this as well as Harold Robbins who has been described as the man who invented sex, or, perhaps even more appropriately, as the godfather of the airport novel. With over 750 million copies sold of his novels salacious, eminently readable stories of greed, sex, and moral compromise  Robbins has a thing or two to tell us of the reading habits of the elite and what lessons they hold for mass market publishers. Is it just that people are similar in their prurient interests? Or is there something more than a simple formula of sex plus violence plus wealth plus decadence that runs through all his novels?         
	What makes Robbins click? It isnt pure bilge because Robbins cites John Steinbeck, John Dos Passos and other 20th century American writers as influences. He counted James Baldwin and Pablo Picasso among his friends and earned praise from a number of literary critics. It isnt just the storyline either. It is not very original, the usual mix of sex and violence. It is his style that is appropriately chatty and crisp, elegant and thorough  a mass market tale told in near-literary terms. Robbins puts a high premium on style as prescribed in Raymond Chandlers classic essay, The simple art of murder: spare, frugal, hard-boiled.        
	Robbinss success points to two obvious conclusions. First, prurience has many takers even when the market is sharply fragmented between high-, middle-and low-brow. Therefore, if you want numbers, stick to the middle road, which means language and style must relate to the speech of common men. More importantly, understanding the text and subtext should not require much effort. Some of our writers who have taken to downmarket fiction have failed because their language has become a literary medium that only looks like speech.        
	Second, publishers and authors must learn what constitutes style as far as thrillers are concerned. It has to be learned the hard way by walking the streets with a ear for gangsterese. It cant be taught in writing schools; nor can throwing in some four-letter words do it. It has to come from experience that all great crime-writers have gone through.         
	Which brings us to the difference between American and British mass-market paperbacks. Chandler had said that the English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers. Airport bestsellers, all said and done, must entertain and the Americans are better in this business than the Brits.

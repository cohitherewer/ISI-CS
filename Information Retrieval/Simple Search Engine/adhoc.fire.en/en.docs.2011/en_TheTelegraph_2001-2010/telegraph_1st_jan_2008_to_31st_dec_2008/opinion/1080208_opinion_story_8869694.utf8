				       MALVIKA SINGH                         
	Wherever you go in India and ask whether the Congress has any hope of resurrecting its diminished fortunes as the Grand Old National Party, once the mother of all others because it encompassed the diverse realities of this subcontinent, the unanimous response is that the inability of the party high command to empower a leader to fight and win a state, choose his or her team, call the shots based on local and real issues, has managed to destroy its large base, has radically corroded the trust of people across caste, creed and community, thus dramatically reducing its footprint to a few toes.        
	In the last month, whether in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, the public opinion has been identical  the Congress has too many individuals fighting to be leaders in each of the states, with no one leading and no hope of delivering on the promises made before each election.         
	This is because there is no accountability at the leaders doorstep. Touted by the Congress as a democratic process, this business of not empowering regional leaders and making them and their teams accountable for their electoral performances, is centralizing decision-making, with party politicos who claim to have the ear of the isolated rulers consciously pitting one good person against another, thereby corrupting the social environment.         
	People are sick of this political opportunism that the Congress represents. Therefore, it is losing by default and not necessarily because the voter wants to reject the party.        
	Isolated at the top, thinking that they understand what is happening down below, dependant on devious, scheming individuals (men and women who have other agendas and often work for the enemy) who display subservience deemed to be loyalty, out of touch with the truth and overwhelmed by the curiosity shown by constituents when they are on the road a few days before polling, good human beings and honest leaders of the Congress are being betrayed by their trusted lieutenants who are the real traitors within the sanctum of the party headquarters. The public can see this problem being aggravated with no one putting a foot on the brakes.                
	Irrelevant ways        
	Traditional tactics of the Congress, in a hugely transformed country with new aspirations, hopes and demands, have stagnated the party and confined it to near oblivion and irrelevance.         
	The rationale one hears from its leaders is silly  we had our turn, now its theirs  which is another way of saying that we are making good while the sun shines and could not care less about facing the challenges that could work to extricate the country from being a third-world symbol of two steps forward and five steps back.         
	Just read a historical novel set in the period of insular rule and decay, and it will be a description of the Congress, circa 2008.        
	The old hands in the party continue, unabated, to betray the possible renewal because a resurrection will discard them and their dishonest exploitation of their top leaders as well as the party workers on the ground. Indians across all strata can see, clearly, the shenanigans and have no option but to vote elsewhere.         
	Action in the form of quick response, decisions, delivery of commitments, tangible and visible change is what this country yearns for, and the Congress has let it down. Will Sonia Gandhi whip her party leaders into a new mode? Will she be intolerant of those who are in the sanctum but betraying her and, therefore, the party? Will she empower, substantially, regional leaders, one to each state? Will she step away from her advisors and extend herself to the realities outside the gates of 24 Akbar Road? Will she be proactive, taking on the challenge, whipping the party into shape and regaining the lost ground?

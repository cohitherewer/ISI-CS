                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PARTY RAVAGE                                                    
	Picnics, in the right spots, are civilized affairs usually not associated with gross misrule. But Calcuttas Brigade Parade grounds and the adjoining Maidan have become a site for the breaking of the law and of every norm of civic behaviour to an extent that is comparable to the worst excesses of vandalism. And the most outrageous aspect of the situation is that this lawlessness is actively perpetrated by West Bengals ruling party and condoned by its chief minister. The Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), held its rally on these grounds on Saturday, defying the Calcutta high courts ban of parking around the Maidan and cooking within a certain radius of the Victoria Memorial. The DYFI brought 130 busloads of cadre to the rally, parking these vehicles illegally, and then proceeded to cook chicken curry and rice for the entire gathering on the grounds. They dug holes in the ground to make ovens and plant flagpoles, leaving huge quantities of rotting food, garbage, plastic bags and other kinds of refuse behind them after the event was over. Such an astounding combination of lawlessness, damage and lack of hygiene was implicitly endorsed by the State as the chief minister, once part of the DYFI leadership, graced the rally with his presence and a speech.        
	Given the governments role, over the last few years, in opposing and undoing every attempt on the part of Calcuttans and the court to rescue the Maidan from precisely such damage, there is perhaps little reason to be astounded by the DYFIs latest depredations. Its state secretary has asked people who have protested against this to be humane and consider the rural cadres inability to understand the nitty-gritty of the law, ecology and preservation. But one does not have to go to the villages to see the partys indifference to the rule of law. It is up to the courts to decide how the lawlessness will be punished. What is most shocking is the chief ministers utter inability to keep his own position and actions distinct from his partys destructive nonchalance. From paralysing the city with bandhs and rallies to choking its lungs with poison fumes emitted by illegal vehicles using illegal fuel, his failure to go against his partys entrenched forms of misrule is the real cause of alarm.

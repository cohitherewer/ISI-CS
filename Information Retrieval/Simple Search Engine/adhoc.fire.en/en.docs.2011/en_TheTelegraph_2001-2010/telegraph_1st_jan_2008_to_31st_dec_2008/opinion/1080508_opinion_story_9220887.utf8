	The son who went missing                   
	Sir  As the first citizen of India, Pratibha Patil is perhaps entitled to include members of her family in her official entourage. Rajendra Singh Shekhawats joining the travel group of his mother, the president, should have raised no cavil therefore. However, it was unethical on Shekhawats part to have broken off from the delegates team in Mexico to visit the Florida Atlantic University (First sons Florida flight, May 1). Although the presidents office has conceded that Shekhawat went to the neighbouring country on private business, the university officials initially denied knowledge of his visit. Shamelessly enough, Rashtrapati Bhavan appears to have sent an instruction to the Indian embassy in Washington to appoint an official to look after the presidents son during his stay in Miami, even though his was not a State visit. In fact, his visit concerned the expansion of the educational institutions run privately by the Patil family under the Shram Sadhana Bombay Trust.          
	Sekhawats 36-hour absence from Mexico when a dinner party was arranged in honour of the president has raised questions which Patil will be hard put to explain. The matter has featured in the American media too. Patil should be prepared to answer some tough questions on it.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Arlington, Texas

                
	Sir  There seem to be contradictory versions in the press about Rajendra Singh Shekhawats visit from Mexico to Miami on taxpayers money. It is clear in one version that Shekhawat had visited the Florida Atlantic University keeping in mind the possibility of a tie-up between the university and the number of educational institutions that he is a managing trustee of. It must be kept in mind that many of these are private, profit-making institutions. Apart from being the head of state, the president of India is also the supreme commander of the armed forces. Every bureaucrat in the country holds office following appointment by the president. Once the presidents credibility is questioned, the image of the nation suffers a setback as the president is among the primary representatives of the country at the international level. The public relations managers at Rashtrapati Bhavan must do some quick damage-control and restore the image of the president at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.N. Ojha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The presidents son broke off from the official entourage to Mexico to make a detour to Miami, allegedly to further his private interests in the field of education. Did he also take some time off to relax on the beaches of Miami? It is one of the vile practices in India that senior public servants travel at State expense with members of their extended families. This would surely be considered an abuse of power in any other country. It is because of practices like this that Indian State delegations are a laughing stock abroad.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashim Choudhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the countrys 12th president, Pratibha Patil, has again got embroiled in an embarrassing scandal. Patil stormed into Raisina Hill, aided by her fairy godmother, Sonia Gandhi. She has since been plagued by controversies  from her belief in the supernatural to the mismanagement of her finances. Her presidency is the reward for her loyalty to the Gandhi family post-Emergency. While the country grapples with rising food prices and the poor die of starvation, the president makes no bones about taking her family on vacation on the citizens money. One wonders if she stopped to think of the people who were sponsoring the trip for her and for her son. Patil should be more careful about her public image because she has taken over from, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, a thoroughly upright man. She also has a lot to learn from the examples set by the likes of Rajendra Prasad, Indias first president, who would forgo half of his salary. While the government has made several amendments to the Constitution, it has never felt the need to do away with the purely ceremonial offices of the governor and the president, whose expenses are an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer. Instead, the present government has raised the salaries of these white elephants.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  Too much is being made of Rajendra Singh Shekhawats detour to Miami while travelling as a member of the official entourage of his mother, the president of India. Some reports mention that Shekhawat paid for his private visit to the Florida Atlantic University from his own pocket. It would appear then that all the hue and cry about his having spent taxpayers money is unwarranted.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bappa Samanta, Howrah

                
	All hail          
	Sir  It is difficult to agree with Ashok Mitra that the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)s victory in the neighbouring country is cause for celebration for communists in India too (History with grandeur, April 25). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has always maintained contact with the Maoists and lent support to their democratic movement against the Nepalese monarchy. The politburo of the CPI(M) had openly welcomed the results of the election to the constituent assembly in Nepal and the countrys transition to becoming a democratic republic. But manners of celebration have changed. It must be kept in mind that the Maoists and their underground struggle in Nepal as well as in parts of India, such as West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh or Chhattisgarh have never been encouraged by intellectuals like Mitra. A celebration of the Maoist win in Nepal might be construed as tacit support to Maoists in India who have mostly been violent and killed civilians.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Work without hope                  
	Sir  In his open letter to the citizens of West Bengal, Ratan Tata has given a fitting reply to those who have been critical of his decision to withdraw the Nano project from Singur (Ratan Tata asks Young Bengal: Jobs or lawlessness?, Oct 17). After the ordeal that Tata has endured over the last two years, it would be thoughtless to say that the pull-out was hasty and politically motivated. Any self-respecting industrialist would find it impossible to run a business from a place so steeped in anarchy. The Tata factory had ushered a ray of hope into Bengal. Had it taken off, ancillary industries would have evolved around it. Apart from the growth in rural economy, life in the villages would have improved over time. However, the opposition leaders chose to put self-interest before everything else and ruined the prospects for Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Priyadarshini Bhaduri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ratan Tata cannot be blamed for Bengals shattered dream of industrialization. He had made it clear to the government at the outset how much land he needed to get the small-car project rolling. It was entirely up to the latter to provide the land, and factor into its acquisition process all the possible social and political repercussions. The state blundered from the beginning by taking away land using an archaic law. The prices offered to the landowners were much below the market prices in the rest of the country. Tata was not a party to the deal between the government and the farmers. To accuse him of being insensitive is to disavow the excellent record of corporate social responsibility that the Tatas are known for. It was Mamata Banerjee who smelled an opportunity to overhaul her career, when she turned herself into the saviour of farmers. But the longer perspective eluded her. No matter how fertile the land, it cannot provide income to generations of farmers. So, these plots would have been sold off by their owners eventually. It is sad that they could not do so when the best opportunity was offered to them.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Saroj Kr. Mehera, Calcutta

                
	Sir  One expected better sense from a man of Ratan Tatas stature than what he has shown in his open letter. His attempt to justify the end of the Nano project in Singur by putting all the blame on Mamata Banerjee and her party, while exonerating Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his cadre, shows his ignorance of how party politics works in Bengal. He should have also stopped himself from defending the legality of the acquired land as the matter is still unresolved. Moreover, the deal between Tata and the government was far from transparent. It remains carefully protected from public view this day.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ratan Tata has provided the CPI(M) with the ideal lever to use in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections by praising the present Governments progressive policy. Those who have seen the rise of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s labour wing, Citu, in the 1970s and 1980s, would agree that terror drove away many industries around 30 years ago. But how can Tata say that the present government has been able to rebuild the confidence of investors to invest in the state?           
	The Bengal chief minister has failed to attract investors because he is unable to deal with the unruly cadre of his party. And Tatas criticism of the Opposition for doing nothing for the rural poor, other than making promises makes better sense when applied to the Marxists. The Left Front government has been a failure in all spheres of administration: education, healthcare, transport, environment. It has reduced law and order to a farce in the state. No action is taken against rash bus-drivers or the pilfering of katatel by autorickshaw drivers as they are protected by the Citu.           
	There are loopholes in Tatas reasoning as well. He claims that he could not run a factory with police protection. In that case, he should have wound up the show much earlier, when section 144 had to be promulgated in Singur soon after the acquisition of land. If he is so concerned about the farmers, he should have insisted on paying the market price rather than let the government acquire the land for much less. And the terms of the agreement should have been made public long ago.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Being a Gujarati, I am glad that Ratan Tata has moved the Nano factory to Sanand. No matter what their differences, political parties in Gujarat are unanimous in their support for development projects. As a resident of Bengal, I am also saddened that Tatas exit has ended the job prospects of so many young men in the state. Given Bengals wealth of natural resources, it would not take long to convince industrialists to put their money here if the politicians are able to rise above their disputes. The Opposition is so deluded that it is fails to realize the harm it has done to the state. Leave alone the urban masses, what has the TMC done so far for those whose cause it claims to champion?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Feny Mahendrabhai, Calcutta

                
	A correction          
	In Simon Digbys tribute to Ralph Russell (Oct 21), General Slim has been mistakenly identified as Arthur Slim Evans. The actual reference was to William Slim. The error is regretted.

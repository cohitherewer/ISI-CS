	Matter of terms  
	The UP government issued an order that all agricultural implements driven by hand or animal would have to be bought from the UP State Agro Industrial Corporation Ltd. The government then issued an order that all Animal Driven Vehicles (ADVs) should be bought from the corporation. As the govern-ment grants subsidies for such purchases, the order seemed to imply that to enjoy the subsidy ADVs would have to be bought from the body. The union of cane growers filed a writ petition contending that ADV carts were not agricultural implements. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that while a plough driven by oxen or horses could be called agricultural implements, a bullock cart did not qualify as such. The latter was merely used to transport cane. (UP State Agro Industrial Corporation vs Kisan Upbhokta Parishad)  
	Brotherly act        
	 When an invalid brother claimed compensation after a man died in an accident, the insurance company refused to pay. It held that as per the definition of the Code of Civil Procedure, a brother did not qualify as a legal representative. Disagreeing, the Madhya Pradesh High Court held that the term legal representative under the act did not mean only wife, husband, parents or children. If the bread-winner of a family died, all his dependants were entitled to claiming compensation. As the brother was physically handicapped and unable to work, he was dependent on the victim. The court held that for claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, a brother could also be regarded as a legal representative.

	Only notional        
	 After winning a case of reinstatement at a Labour Court, an Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation employee claimed that consequential fixation of pay should include notional increments. When the Andhra Pradesh High Court dismissed the claim, he went to the Supreme Court which held that only if the reinstatement order contained a specific direction for providing all consequential benefits would it include such increment. However, it added that an order of reinstatement that provided for continuity of service would not include notional increment. (Laxma Reddy vs AP State Road Transport Corporation)

                                                                                                                 CRACKING DOWN                              A new directive on stringent punitive measures in the Foreigners Act, 1946, is going to make it tough for illegal entrants to India to go back home.   Dola Mitra reports                                        
	From her little mud hut by a stretch of golden paddy fields in Bangladesh, 50-year-old Firoza Khatoon could see India on the other side of a large, blue pond. For fear of being caught by border security people, she never went beyond a few steps when she got down into the water to bathe. But then she fell ill and the village doctor told her that her only chance of survival was to visit a physician across the border.         
	This physician lived in a house on the Indian bank of the pond, says Firoza sitting inside her cell in Calcuttas Presidency Jail. At first I didnt want to go because I was afraid. We are poor farmers and we dont have the kind of money you need to get a passport and a visa. But an agent told me that it would cost me much less if I paid him to sneak me in. I was so sick that I decided to go. The first couple of times I visited the doctor and came back home. The third time, on my way back with the medicine, I got caught.         
	According to Firoza, she was about 10 steps away from her home in Bangladesh when plainclothes border police arrested her.         
	That was seven months ago. For the widow, who has just one daughter in Bangladesh by way of family, the only consolation has been the thought that she will be released soon. The police took pity on me and informed me that the punishment is not that severe in such cases and we are usually let off after about three months in jail.         
	But what Firoza doesnt know is that she probably doesnt have a hope in hell of walking out of the iron gates of the prison before another couple of years at least. Because of a new directive issued by the government of West Bengals home (foreigners amp; NRIs) department, enforcing a set of stringent punitive measures in the Foreigners Act, 1946, it is going to get very tough for illegal entrants to India to go home in a hurry.         
	The provisions of the Act which are being upheld as per the new directive, are specified in Section 14 (a) and (b) of the FA, 1946. In the category, Penalties for entry in restricted areas, it states, whoever enters any area in India, which is restricted for his entry without obtaining a permit from the authority or remains in such area beyond the period specified in such permit for his stay or enters into or strays into any area in India without the valid documents required for such entry or for such stay shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than two years, but may extend to eight years.         
	While officials of the West Bengal home (foreigners and NRIs) department justify the imposition of this order as a mandatory step, taken in order to discourage illegal entrants to India, West Bengal correctional services (prisons) authorities are not so sure that its such a good thing. In fact, West Bengal prison authorities are downright anxious that instead of solving the problem of illegal immigration the extended period of imprisonment will result in severe overcrowding of jails.         
	Spelling out the downside of the new order, inspector general of prisons B.D. Sharma says, Sentencing a person to a minimum of two years in prison for illegally entering India is not necessarily going to stop people from coming into the country. What will happen is that our jails are going to be choked with illegal immigrants, who cross the border in large numbers almost everyday into India from bordering countries like Bangladesh. People will be coming in, but not going out.         
	In fact, according to statistics on the 53 jails in West Bengal, ever since the order has been in force, the number of people serving sentences  whether convicted or under-trial prisoner  for illegal entry into India, has almost doubled.         
	Moreover, the new extended terms entail that even those who gained released prisoner status as per the earlier regulations will now have to languish in jail until they serve the new, extended-period sentences. In fact, right now the released prisoner population itself is as high as 1,038 (852 males and 186 females).         
	In this category is 28-year-old Swapna Khatoon, who trespassed into Indian territory to meet a boy  an Indian rickshaw puller  with whom she fell in love. In jail since November 2007, her prison term was supposed to come to an end early this month, but now she says, tears rolling down her eyes, she has no idea what will happen.         
	Meanwhile, Firoza Khatoon sobs, If I ever go back home, I promise I will never again trespass. She stares out of the bars of her prison cell. Maybe all she can see is her little mud hut by the golden paddy fields and across the blue pond her Bangladesh.
    What the new order means
    Earlier the process of ldquo;repatriation rdquo; by countries having a bilateral agreement on deporting illegal immigrants started within three months in India. When a person was arrested, depending on the case, a ldquo;summary rdquo; or speedy trial would take place at the level of the district magistrate. The sentences could be as low as three to six months. When the sentence was completed, as per the regulations, the Indian jail authority would inform the police, which would inform the Indian Border Security Force, which, in turn, would contact the border officials of the prisoner rsquo;s country of origin. At the country of origin verification would take place of the claim that the released person is indeed a citizen of that country. The prisoner would be taken in a police vehicle to the border and handed over to the border officials of the country of origin. ldquo;Earlier, almost every 20 days there would be a group of released prisoners taken to the borders for deportation. But now, for days we have not had a batch that was ready for deportation. The process has come to a complete standstill, rdquo; says B.D. Sharma, IG (prisons), West Bengal. 
    This is because, according to the new rules, not only does the process of repatriation start much later (minimum two years), but the trial takes place at the sessions court which does not dispose of cases with the speed of a trial at the district magistrate level. 
    Moreover, the process of repatriation has become more complex. In the new system, when a prisoner has served a sentence, the jail authorities inform the police, which informs the state home (foreigners and NRIs) department, which in turn, informs the central ministry of external affairs, which then contacts the high commission or consulate of the country of origin of the released prisoner. Then the verification takes place at the country of origin, the consulate of which then gets back to the MEA with its reply. 
    Jail authorities find the process so time consuming and slow that the minister of jails in West Bengal, Biswanath Chowdhury, has written to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee requesting him to look into the problem. In the meantime, the inspector general of prisons, West Bengal, has met with the Bangladesh deputy high commissioner to discuss the issue as according to the former ldquo;more than 96 per cent of the illegal immigrant population in the jails is of Bangladeshi origin rdquo;.

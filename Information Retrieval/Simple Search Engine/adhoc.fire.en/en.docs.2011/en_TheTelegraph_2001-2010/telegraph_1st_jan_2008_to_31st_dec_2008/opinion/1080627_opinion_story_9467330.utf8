	There is nothing wrong in a hesitation to impose the death penalty. But the decision of the supreme court of the United States of America to abolish capital punishment for child rape raises certain questions. The court ruled on the case of a man called Patrick Kennedy, who had been convicted of raping his eight-year-old stepdaughter in 2003. He had been sentenced to death in Louisiana, where there is a law allowing the death sentence for the rape of a child under 13. In the US, capital punishment is imposed in the rarest of rare cases in personal crimes, usually when the victim has been killed. So those on death row are convicted either of homicide or of a completely different class of crime, such as treason or espionage. Five states besides Louisiana allow the death sentence for anyone who rapes a child if he has an earlier offence. The death sentence for rape without death of the victim has been considered by the majority of supreme court judges as cruel and unusual punishment according to the eighth amendment to the US constitution.        
	Can any punishment be considered cruel, unusual or disproportionate when the crime is of raping a child? Life imprisonment without parole, the alternative to the death penalty in the US, would bring for the child victim neither closure, nor security, nor the sense of justice done. It has also to be asked whether an adult who has raped a child is among the types of offender society wants back on the streets after a period of incarceration. Because in parts of the world, including India, life imprisonment is usually for a fixed number of years, with early termination for good behaviour. It is quite possible that most people who believe in capital punishment would agree that someone who has raped a child deserves death. The real issue is that of responsibility: in this, the State is as hesitant as an individual would be. One of the arguments against the death penalty for such a rapist is that there would be a dramatic fall in the rate of reporting it if the punishment were death. Usually the rapist is close to the child: this would make it worse. And rapists would kill their child victims to ensure that the deed is not reported. These arguments go on, some practical, some timid, some downright bizarre. But there is no escaping the fact that the possibility of the death sentence is perhaps the only deterrent that might work with an adult capable of raping a child: he would be afraid only of the crudest realities.

It brings together eight essays, each mainly on a single painting by Khanna (born 1925), apart from a rather slight piece of retrospection by the artist himself (on his Jesus Christ tryptich of 2006) and a chronology. The reproductions of the work (entire paintings as well as numerous details) covered in this volume are lush. But the interpretative essays (by Ranjit Hoskote, Gayatri Sinha, Norbert Lynton, Marylin Rushton and Tanuj Berry) are printed in such an enormous typeface, without proper paragraph divisions, that they look like very long essays, when they are actually quite short. Khannas best work  abstract, Progressive or figurative  is eloquent enough for more-or-less tuned-in people to figure out whats happening in them without being served up this bio-historical waffle trying to place the paintings in socio-political context. On the left is The Raising of Lazarus, oil on canvas, 48x72 inches, 2005. It shows Khannas indebtedness to Piero della Francesca, Giotto and Uccello, all of whose work he was directly acquainted with through his British education and European travels. On the right is another oil on canvas of exactly the same proportions, Evening News, also painted in 2005.

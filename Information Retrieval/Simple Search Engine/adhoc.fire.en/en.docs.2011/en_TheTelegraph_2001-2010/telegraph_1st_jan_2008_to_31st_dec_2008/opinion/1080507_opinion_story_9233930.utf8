	Inanity is ideology-neutral. This is demonstrated by George W. Bushs recent comment on the global food shortage, and also by the response to it by Indian politicians, especially those with a pronounced Left and anti-US tilt. Mr Bush ascribed the shortage of food to the growing demand on the part of the Indian middle class, which has become wealthy and is eating more and better. There was a king of England in the 17th century who earned himself the epithet, the wisest fool in Christendom. Mr Bush could easily be described as the most powerful ignoramus in the world today. That sections of Indians are earning more is undeniable; similarly, it is also true that the demand for food has risen in India and this has been reflected in global markets. But these facts cannot lead to the conclusion that they have resulted in the global food crisis. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the demand for foodgrains in India compared to 2006-07 has risen by 2.17 per cent in 2007-08. In the same period, the global average demand for foodgrains has risen by 2.06 per cent. In other words, the increase in Indian demand has kept pace with the rise in global demand. Thus, the conclusion that the growth in Indian demand has resulted in a world shortage of food falls through the trapdoor of statistical evidence. Mr Bush, not uncharacteristically, has not looked at his own back garden. In the period mentioned above, the demand for foodgrains has increased in the United States of America by 11.81 per cent. Following Mr Bushs (il)logic, it could be said that the source of the food crisis  like many other global crises  lies in the US.        
	Other kinds of quantitative evidence also point to the absurdity of Mr Bushs assertion. In 2006-07, the demand for foodgrains of 1.19 billion Indians was 193 million tonnes; in the US, the demand of 301 million people was 277 million tonnes. It is important to underline that the entire demand for foodgrains in the US does not emanate from humans, but also from the need to feed animals. Looking only at human beings, Indians consume 2,400 to 2,600 calories per day, while in the US, calories consumption is at the level of 3,400 to 3,800. The rise in world food prices arising out of a scarcity of food is rooted in a complex web of economic factors. This, understandably, is beyond the ken of the worlds most powerful man. His comments are best treated with contempt.

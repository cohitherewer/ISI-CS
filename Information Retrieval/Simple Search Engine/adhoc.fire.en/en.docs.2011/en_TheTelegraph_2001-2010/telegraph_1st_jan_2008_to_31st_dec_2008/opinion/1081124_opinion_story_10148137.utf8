	Politics is a frustrating game, especially for those that stoop to win. Sonia Gandhi faced vile vituperation for years from leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which likes to claim a monopoly of patriotism. The argument, that she was a foreigner, was puerile, but anything is fair in war and patriotism. Many must have been the times when Ms Gandhi was tempted to reply in kind. But she kept her balance, rebuilt the defeated Congress, and led it back to power. Many were the pinpricks she had to bear from her leftist allies. But she bore them stoically because she regarded staying in power not as a selfish foible, but as a duty she owed to the dear and departed  to wit, her husband and mother-in-law. So it is not surprising that her image of them is more flattering than the common mans. She is not likely to remember easily the imprisonment of thousands for political disagreement during Emergency, nor how the law was changed to deprive Shah Bano of the paltry alimony a court had awarded her.        
	Nor is it surprising that she thought this time of global financial crisis the right moment to praise Indira Gandhis nationalization of banks. She naturally omitted the political context: that Indira Gandhi had alienated the Congress leaders, who she thought were supported by the industrialists of the South and the West, and nationalized banks simply to cock a snook at them. If there was any reason or ideology behind it, it is still to be discovered. Her excesses led to her defeat, and when she returned to power, she had left behind her hostilities and her socialism. In other walks of life such behaviour would be called opportunism; in politics it is called resilience.        
	Ms Gandhi may not have noticed it, but her government banks too run out of money, and when they do, are bailed out by the Reserve Bank of India. Banking business is highly leveraged; though not as leveraged as in the United States of America, Indian banks lend 15 times as much as the cash they hold. If depositors decided to withdraw more than a fifteenth of their money at one time, a bank would run out of cash  and would go and borrow from the central bank just like a US bank. Nationalization does not make Indian banks safer or better-run; it only makes the Indian taxpayer pay for their follies. And despite being charged with social goals, they have confined their services to towns and safe borrowers; they have largely passed villagers and small businessmen by. If Ms Gandhi were to examine banks performance on the basis of the inclusive politics her party swears by, she will find it wanting. It can be plausibly argued that vigorous competition amongst private banks, freed from the RBIs licence raj, would have served the common man better.

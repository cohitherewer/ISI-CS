	Some murders are bewildering because the entire community works as a single murderer. This happens in the case of sati, and also when a village decides that someone is a witch. It is not easy to believe nowadays, in the case of witches for example, that the unity of feeling in the community springs from a belief in the existence of dark powers that can be tamed by human beings. When the villagers of Maguria in West Midnapore beat up and killed Tapan and Pramila Murmu because their daughter-in-laws 15-year-old brother had died, it suggested one of two things. One, that the whole community is so immersed in superstition, ignorance, and barbarity that it was willing to believe Baidyanath Murmu, the dead boys uncle and a witch doctor or gunin, who brought other witch doctors to pronounce Tapan Murmu guilty of his nephews death. Even if the whole village is unlettered, the story seems absurd. Two, Baidyanath Murmu had his own motive  perhaps a show of his powers or something more material  and he could swing the rest of the village where motives could abound in combination  envy, old quarrels, personal hatred.        
	However strange the explanations may sound, the violence is both real and extreme. The cruelty of a whole village that participated in beating up and killing an old man and woman as their sons watched has to be confronted not merely by law, although that is primary, but also by trying to analyse how old beliefs are being quietly used to fuel feelings of deprivation, fear and insecurity in the face of new power-games, so that the only action possible  and the only excitement in life  is violence. The letter of the law is sometimes inadequate. Baidyanath Murmu has been arrested, but the whole village did the double murder. There has to be a way to deal with that.

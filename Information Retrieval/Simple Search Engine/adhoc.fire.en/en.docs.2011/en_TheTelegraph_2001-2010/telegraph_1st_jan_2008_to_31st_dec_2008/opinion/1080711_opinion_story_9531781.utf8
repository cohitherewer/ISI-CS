	Saints, mystics and messiahs, in quite another age, were the ones to have visions. Today, only rich and powerful world leaders are allowed to have them, and to describe them to the rest of the world, every now and then, from picturesque locations. These occasions are usually called summit meetings. The meetings are named by combining a letter of the English alphabet (usually G, for Group of) with a numeral denoting the number of nations forming the group that, most recently, happened to be eight. The G8 summits most risible vision this time was to do with climate change. The eight world leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States of America think they have just given the world a ground-breaking vision. But serious environmentalists and many developing nations (some of whom, including India, were invited to Japan to join a few sessions at this summit) think that vowing to consider and adopt a target of at least a 50 per cent cut in carbon emissions by 2050 boils down to very little in actual terms. No interim goals have been set, and no decisions made as to what the baseline for the reduction is going to be. From declaring that there is no such thing as climate change to having such a vision of it is definitely a progress for President George W. Bush. But many of his G8 peers have not agreed to share this vision, until the developing nations (mainly India, China and Brazil) also chip in. And this last condition is another hurdle to the realization of this G8 vision.        
	Quite rightly, India and its peers have argued for more concrete goals and commitments from the G8 nations  not just dates and numbers, but also some evidence of real political will. It is this global contest for the imposition and acknowledgment of responsibility that is changing the nature and composition of the G8 summit every year. The biggest leaders alone cannot seem to solve most of the worlds most pressing problems  food, oil, carbon, Iran, Zimbabwe, among others. So more and more emergent nations have to be called to the banquet, even if only for sweets and coffee, to thrash things out. But this immediately complicates matters, and gives rise to other kinds of stalemate. And something of the sort is happening now with the question of who will come forward and take the lead in going beyond ritual and rhetoric, taking climate change seriously.

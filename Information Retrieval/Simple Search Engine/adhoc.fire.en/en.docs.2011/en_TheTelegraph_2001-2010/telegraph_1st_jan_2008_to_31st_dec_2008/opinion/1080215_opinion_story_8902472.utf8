	The belief in the efficacy of saying sorry comes close to the quality of magical thinking. By just speaking a few words, something can be made to happen - or unhappen. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has apologized in parliament to his country's Aboriginal population. Between 1910 and 1970, around 100,000 mixed-race children, mostly of Aboriginal mothers and European fathers, were taken away to orphanages, church missions or foster homes to be raised separately from their original families. This "Stolen Generation" is thus the result of a policy of "assimilation", the ultimate goal of which was the extinction of Aborigines as a distinct race. They are the "broken people" (as one of them puts it), victims of profound physical, psychological and sexual degradation, to whom the Labour prime minister's apology was particularly addressed. (Aborigines form 2 per cent of the country's population, and the life-expectancy gap between them and other Australians is 17 years.) Mr Rudd's Liberal predecessor, John Howard, had refused to apologize, and had only expressed regret. (Notorious for his right-wing immigration policy, Mr Howard was one of President Bush's partners in the War on Terror.) Then there was a Labour-led inquiry into the Stolen Generation. Its report had recommended not only an apology but also financial compensation from a national fund of almost one billion Australian dollars.         
	The wrongs of the past can thus be "righted" by one or both of two magical entities: words and money. Many Aborigines and activists feel that the former without the latter would keep reconciliation within the realm of the purely symbolic. For the Aboriginal leader, Noel Pearson, the sleight of hand is devastatingly simple: "Blackfellas will get the words, the whitefellas keep the money." According to this position, the transition from Liberal to Labour has meant only a change of "the saddle blankets"; the Aborigines are "still dealing with the same horse". Mr Rudd's apology has been broadcast all over the country on giant public screens to general applause. By another sleight of hand that many would find obscene, the person saying sorry has now become the hero, taking his nation from the blighted "past" straight into an instantly repaired "future". The righting of the wrong keeps in place the very asymmetry of that wrong.

                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Burning bright                  
	Sir  K.U. Karanths fight to save the tiger should inspire those who want to make India a better country (Tte--tte, Feb 24). Tigers cannot vote. Hence our politicians are unconcerned about their fate, as well the plight of their protectors: a reputed conservationist like Karanth was once accused of poaching. It would not surprise me if an unscientific method for counting tigers had been used deliberately to fudge figures. Isnt it time we forced the government to listen to Karanth so that the tiger lives to see another day?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

                
	Hail the league?          
	Sir  The Indian Premier League is perhaps the final step in crickets journey to become a lucrative enterprise (Sports new motto: Fitter, better, richer, Feb 23). The idea of such a league has its share of problems though. For instance, purists might scoff at the concept of auctioning cricketers. Questions will also be raised about the transparency of the deals, and the IPLs iniquitous nature. Some of the players would be paid much more than other deserving candidates. These are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed if the IPL is to become more than an annual jamboree of the rich and famous. Cricketers must never allow monetary concerns to prevail over their country. However, at the moment, it seems that few of them are willing to lend their ears to such advice.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  This is a very significant phase in the history of cricket. The IPL has opened up new dimensions that need to be explored carefully. The IPL has been modelled on European football, such as the leagues in England, Germany or Spain. Some experts have expressed concern that the IPL would eat into the popularity of Test and one-day cricket. However, this is an unlikely possibility. On the contrary, with international players sharing the same dressing room, there is a distinct possibility that the IPL will end up improving ties between cricketers of different countries. This can put an end to the problem of sledging in cricket. The spectators too will get their moneys worth, watching the big stars compete with each other. It is a win-win situation, both for the cricketers as well as their fans.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Titas De Sarkar, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Board of Control for Cricket in India first allowed international cricketers, and Indians too, to be auctioned like cattle. To add insult to injury, it has not decided to lodge a complaint against Cricket Australia for allowing its players to intimidate and abuse the touring Indians. Look at what Matthew Hayden said about Harbhajan Singh: obnoxious little weed. Hayden was let off with a warning only.           
	International games are supposed to foster friendship between cricketing nations. Indias current tour Down Under seems to be an exception, what with the Australians behaving despicably on the field. If the BCCI has any concern for its players respect, it should call off the tour immediately. The Australian board would also do well to put their players through a refresher course on sportsmanship.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                          
	Erratum          
	In Susanta Ghoshs letter on the hike in postgraduate diploma fees of the IIMC (Low, yet high, Mar 1), the annual fee of Rs 500 in 1964 has been mentioned to include food charges. The fee, in fact, did not cover food. The error is regretted.  The Editor

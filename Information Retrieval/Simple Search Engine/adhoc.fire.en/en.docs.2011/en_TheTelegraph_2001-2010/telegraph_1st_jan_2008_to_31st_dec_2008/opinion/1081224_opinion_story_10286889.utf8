	Touching gesture                  
	Sir  The tradition of bowing down to elders and touching their feet as a mark of reverence has been prevalent in Indian society for ages (A touch too much, Dec 20). We read about such etiquettes in our ancient literature and scriptures. The practice is by no means confined within Bengalis alone, as Ramachandra Guha also concedes later in his article. As to the episode narrated by Sham Lal that Guha writes about, I think that there had been a leap in Sham Lals reasoning. If on seeing Sham Lal approach him, Rabindranath Tagore had put his feet out about six inches, then wasnt it a bit hasty of Sham Lal to immediately come to the conclusion that Tagore intended him to touch his feet? Perhaps when Sham Lal had travelled to Santiniketan in his youth, he did not know enough about the poet. During his long, distinguished and eventful life, Tagore had met hundreds of people, both Indians and foreigners, who had come to pay their respects to him. Apart from being a great poet, thinker and visionary, Tagore was also one of the earliest Modernists, whose ideas and views were far ahead of those of his time. As such, it is unlikely that Tagore would have craved for attention or for the customary tokens of reverence in the way Sham Lal had imagined. It is unfortunate that Sham Lal decided to leave Santiniketan in a hurry, without having his notion tested. Had he ventured to know the poet, he would definitely have cherished the memory throughout his life.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  If one thinks that the custom of touching the feet of elders implies a blind adherence to tradition, and decides to do away with it, that is his or her personal choice. But one cannot say that in deciding not to bow down in front of the elderly, Punjabis prove that they are more self-respecting than Bengalis or South Indians. Ramachandra Guha talks of the hockey player, Balbir Singh, who had pulled away in disgust when the author had tried to touch his feet. For Guha, Balbir Singh, as a proud Sikh, was even more self-respecting than the Hindu, Sham Lal, about whom Guha had talked of earlier in his article. But do Sikhs not bend low in gurdwaras? If lowering ones head in front of god does not deflate the pride of an individual, then doing the same in front of elders should not also devastate him. If god exists at all, he resides not only in holy places but also in the human soul.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Complex problem          
	Sir  I completely agree with the views of Chirosree Basu as expressed in the article, The brutal and the noble (Dec 11). I think it is imperative that schools form bodies that enable parents to have a voice in the running of the institutions. If the parents suggestions are taken into account, corporal punishment in schools would become a thing of the past. However, the issue is not so simple that it can be solved merely by incorporating parents in the schools decision-making bodies. Parents have a tendency of losing their composure where their wards interests are concerned. At the drop of a hat, they demand severe punishment for the teachers who have hit their children without looking objectively into the facts of the case. This is not to say that children deserve to be beaten up, but to acknowledge the fact that todays children respond to situations in ways quite different from those of kids belonging to earlier generations.           
	Besides, teachers are one of the most exploited professionals today. One look at the teachers qualifications and then at the remuneration they receive, especially in private schools, would partly explain the apathy, bordering on unkindness, towards students on the teachers part. We cannot expect a teacher to behave nobly when he is himself being treated badly. Ideally, there should be specialized training centres for teachers where they can be made to interact with, and thus understand, the younger generation better. There should also be cells to counsel students, where parents can participate with the counsellors in solving the attitudinal problems of their wards. And, if good teaching standards are to be maintained, and both teachers and students made happy, then schools need to pay better salaries to their teachers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Cease work          
	Sir  So, it is official now, that the rural poor are unwilling to work hard (Target 100, state scores 25 in job scheme, Dec 22). As an amateur demographer, I had long suspected a correlation between rural poverty and the peoples reluctance to labour but was scared to assert it lest I sounded politically incorrect.           
	Our taxiwallahs prefer playing cards daylong to taking passengers wanting to travel a short distance. Small shops put bikes horizontally before the shop so that no one can enter, and are irritated at the sight of customers. In recent years, employment opportunities for women, especially in the unorganized sector, have skyrocketed. Women nowadays work for self-help groups, in beauty parlours, in small factories making soft toys, as ayahs in health care centres, or as saleswomen. Women, being nurturers, do not spend on addictions, and take home their earnings intact. As a result, in families with earning women, all that the males have to do to is earn the cost of their addictions. And if they cannot even do that, they can always beat up their wives and take their money. They need not fear the domestic violence act, which is yet to reach the lower strata of society.          
	Our culture and economics also encourage the belief that you cannot be rich by working hard. This explains the proliferation of sciences like vaastu, numerology, feng shui and astrology, which sell perverse dreams to men who want to be rich without having to work for it. The political leadership of Bengal, for quite some time, is working overtime to create more employment opportunities for the rural youth. But the prevalent mindset of the people may well jeopardize that effort.          
	Yours faithfully,

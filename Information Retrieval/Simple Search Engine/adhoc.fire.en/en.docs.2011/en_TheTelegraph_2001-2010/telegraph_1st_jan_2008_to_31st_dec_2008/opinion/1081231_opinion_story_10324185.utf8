	Delay wont do        
	A purchase of spare parts had been made for a milk plant in Maharashtra without taking a quotation. Owing to the delay in the police investigation when the matter came to light, the trial began only after eight years. The Supreme Court noted that the delay could not in any way be attributed to the accused. At the time the incident occurred, the accused was only 18 years old. Besides, it was his parents, who had died since then, who used to manage the business at that time. The court held that no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings against the accused. The Supreme Court held that a citizens right to speedy trial was applicable not only to proceedings in court but also to police investigations.

	Fund flow        
	n The Madhya Pradesh government decided to withhold funds for the developmental plans of a village in which a woman had been forced to commit Sati. A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed against the government, stating that such an act did not warrant the withholding of funds for the progress of an entire village which was badly in need of funds for development. The Madhya Pradesh High Court held that withholding the funds was not justified since only certain individuals in the village were responsible for the offence and criminal proceedings had already been initiated against them.

	Accident blues        
	n After being injured in a motor accident in 1994, the victim suffered from mental depression and finally committed suicide in 1997. His legal representatives claimed compensation on the ground that his suicide was caused by depression after suffering injuries in the accident. Upholding the contention of his heirs, the Kerala High Court said that the man took his life because he was convinced of his worthlessness and did not want to be a burden on his family. The court felt that the compensation to his heirs was justified as the suicide was a result of mental depression caused by the accident.

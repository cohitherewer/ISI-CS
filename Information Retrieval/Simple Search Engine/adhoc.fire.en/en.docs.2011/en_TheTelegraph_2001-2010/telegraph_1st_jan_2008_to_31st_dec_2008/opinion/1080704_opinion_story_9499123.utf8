The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Seeking a Fresh Verdict
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SEEKING A FRESH VERDICT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The Left, led in New Delhi by Prakash Karat, A.B. Bardhan and D. Raja, has exposed its immaturity and irresponsibility towards the United Progressive Alliance government and the nation by its stubborn and unrelenting bullying tactics that amount to blackmail. What comes across to the national audience from the behaviour of the Left is the image of a confused party, superficial in its loud rhetorical posturings, unable to pull the rug in one decisive movement, but constantly threatening to do so before the UPAs completion of the five-year term. The national press has also got utterly confused in the melee, losing all sense of proportion and judgment.         
	Since the nuclear deal does not need a ratification by either the lower or the upper houses of parliament, it is not necessary to be strong in numbers to sign the deal and the cabinet has already approved of it even if some of the constituents of the coalition are getting cold feet on the issue. The thought of the possibility of losing six months in a lucrative gaddi has put them in a defiant mood. Television channels keep boring us with the same old scraps of news with no reprieve whatsoever  Is it worth going ahead with the deal at the cost of the government?, is what they chant.         
	What government? If a government is not permitted to conduct its bona fide business, to take executive decisions because it is perpetually stalled by its enemy partners, who have no accountability whatsoever, it is better to seek a fresh verdict from the people. That will cease the continuous mockery of the democratic process taking place these days. India cannot be ruled by diktat.                 
	Future thoughts        
	The Left and the Congress can never merge or mix, because they are like oil and water. The opportunistic coming together of the two parties in the UPA has, in fact, put us back by three years, if not more. The Left has always been intolerant of the Congress. It joined hands with the Congress last time ostensibly to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party but instead, fought with its partners and the two parties derailed each other. The BJP, smartly enough, encouraged the petty politics of the two eternally squabbling partners and got on with the task of winning back some of the states it had lost. The great loser has always been the UPA, as it dithered and delayed, trying to please and placate the other failed party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist).        
	To bring about an egalitarian society where roti, kapda, makaan, health and education are the priorities, and where the entrepreneurial spirit of the people is enhanced with open, generous policies is the manifesto of all political parties vying with each other to rule India, or so they all say. Therefore, the Left is not an exception, as far as the ideology professed by it is concerned. Therefore, it should get off its high moral ground and look at its own weakness, its track record, and work to realize some of the ideals rather than waste time in bickering over petty matters.         
	It makes good sense for the Congress to cut the weak and corroded cord, liberate itself from its internal enemies as well as from its fast diluting coalition partners. It must cleanse itself, split, if need be, sit in the opposition benches if the people so demand, and start anew with an honest and clean administration. Someone has to sit in the opposition benches to enable intelligent debate, and the Congress could lead the way and stop the insane disruptions and adjournments that have insulted our democracy.         
	What the Congress definitely does not need is the Samajwadi Party formally lending its support, since this party is just as capable of stepping away at that critical moment when Sonia Gandhi stands in front of the president of India to take the oath of office.

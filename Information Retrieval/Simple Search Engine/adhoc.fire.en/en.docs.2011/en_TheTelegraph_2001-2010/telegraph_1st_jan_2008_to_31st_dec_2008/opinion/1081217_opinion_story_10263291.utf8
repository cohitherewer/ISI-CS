										      On the course
    An unsuccessful examinee challenged the departmental examination for the promotion of accounts officers, claiming that some questions were on topics that were not in the syllabus. The Central Administrative Tribunal allowed the application, directing that the minimum qualifying marks be awarded to all applicants in the questions concerned. The authorities won the case at the Andhra Pradesh High Court. When the examinee appealed to the Supreme Court, however, it dismissed the appeal, holding that the accounts officer was expected to have an overall knowledge of the accounts code, treasury rules etc. It added that it was not for the tribunal to pass an order on the supposition that the examinees had misunderstood the extent of the syllabus. (N. Lokanadham vs Telecom Commission)             Fatal neglect 
    A deaf and dumb boy fell from the terrace of a hostel for disabled children and died. Its principal and the matron were not there when the incident occurred. In fact, they did not live on the premises at all. The boys father filed a petition for damages of Rs 5 lakh. The authorities opposed the claim, stating that it had already taken the necessary steps to avert such incidents in the future. The Kerala High Court, however, held that the absence of the authorities on the campus indicated that the children were left to look after themselves. As the institution had failed to discharge its constitutional responsibility of guaranteeing a fundamental right (Right to Life), the court felt that the award of a compensation of Rs 5 lakh was totally justified. (P.V. Anthony vs   State of Kerala)             Family check 
    A Family Court ordered a DNA test to determine the parentage of a child. But there were charges of incompetence against the authorities conducting the test. The vigilance commission was also investigating the matter and ordered a second DNA test. The husband wanted the test to be carried out at a laboratory of his choice in New Delhi. The Madhya Pradesh High Court held that a party could not choose where a DNA test would be carried out. The court ordered that the test be done at Chandigarh with its state-of-the-art forensic facilities.

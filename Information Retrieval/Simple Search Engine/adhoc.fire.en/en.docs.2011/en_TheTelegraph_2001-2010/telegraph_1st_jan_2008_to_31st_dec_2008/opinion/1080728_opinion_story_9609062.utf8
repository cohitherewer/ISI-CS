	If Indian city-dwellers have to start looking at bicycles, lunchboxes and blue plastic bags with fear and suspicion, then the engineers of the serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad have been successful in the saddest sense of the word. With more than twenty bombs going off in two cities in two days, leaving almost fifty dead, it is difficult to persuade people not to panic. But remarkably, Bangalore  where the intensity of the blasts and the number of casualties have been relatively low  has willed itself to regain its normal tempo of life in a day. Ahmedabad is a battered city with a darker history of sectarian unrest, and to be a city whose hospitals are not spared is grim indeed. The pattern of blasts in each of the two cities seems to have been adapted to its local configurations. In Bangalore, the old, communally mixed parts of the city have been spared, and the more recently developed areas, associated with the software companies and a more cosmopolitan demography, were targeted. In Ahmedabad, the opposite: with more crowded public areas that are politically symbolic (the chief ministers and state home ministers constituencies) or communally sensitive (Muslim-dominated areas of the Old City) were targeted. The Jaipur blast in May this year seemed to have in mind the citys popularity with tourists. Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat are all states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. So patterns emerge, as do differences, but all this is necessarily belated, and lead to multiple and confusing interpretations, for the lack of anything definite to go by.        
	Since the Mumbai blasts in 1993, serial explosions have killed almost 800 people in eight Indian cities so far. But all probes and inquiries have come to a dead end, apart from a few stray leads and connection that have also not meant anything much. The police, intelligence officials and government bodies like the national bomb data centre do nothing more than gathering data and making perfectly obvious statements. Political parties, state governments and the Central ministries also do little more than blame one another for relaxing terror laws and slack intelligence. An odd mixture of helplessness, stoicism and a kind of unthinking robustness is all that the ordinary Indian citizen can summon up in the face of such a scenario.

	Out in the cold
         
	Sir  The Board of Control for Cricket in India appears to have been influenced by Steve Bucknors standards of judgment. How else can the board justify the bizarre team-selection for the one-day international tri-series against Australia, starting from February 3? On what reasoning have the selectors left out two of the most experienced players from the squad? Sourav Ganguly has been in excellent form of late and Rahul Dravid need not prove himself to be Mr Dependable yet again. In Melbourne and in Sydney, the two umpires ruined Indias chances with their dubious decisions. It seems to be the BCCIs turn now to manipulate the destiny of Team India in whichever way it pleases. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The exclusion of Sourav Ganguly from the one-day tri-series in Australia reveals the extent to which the selection committee is blinded by partisan feelings [Dada, (belated) sorry: One-day old order changeth, unceremoniously, Jan 21]. Apparently Dilip Vengsarkar, the chairman of the selection committee, did not play an important role in selection, given his strained relationship with the board. It has been suggested by the media that Venkatapati Raju and Ranjit Biswal lend their support to M.S. Dhonis demand that Ganguly and Dravid be dropped. Every Indian cricket fan has the right to know what justification was used to arrive at this conclusion. Age and lack of fitness are the most implausible reasons and these have been used again and again to defend such absurd decisions. How is it that the players current forms have no effect on the decision-making? How long is this kind of nepotism going to continue? The board is run by self-interested people who are motivated only by greed and power. They understand the economics of cricket too well to attend to its sporting aspects. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sourav Ganguly must have become accustomed to being dropped unceremoniously from the team. This time the BCCI should have deferred the team selection till the completion of the Test series. After the glorious victory at Perth, India needs to sustain the team spirit in the ODIs as well. Unfortunately, the premature sacking of Ganguly and other senior cricketers is bound to have an adverse effect on the minds of some of the key players. This may prove detrimental to the entire team. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  Bengalis, no doubt, have been disheartened by the omission of Sourav Ganguly from the team. The sadness, however, is not related merely to Ganguly belonging to this part of the world. It is because Gangulys excellent form, since the comeback test series in South Africa in December 2006, has been overlooked. His exclusion is going to cost the team dearly. Two other senior players, Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, have also not made it to the ODI team. Given that both Dravid and Laxman have impressive records against Australia, there is a strong reason to feel disappointed by their exclusion. What is sadder is that Bengalis, who claim to be great cricket aficionados, have not uttered a word of dismay at the exclusion of Dravid or Laxman. Our outrage has been provoked solely by Ganguly being left out of the team. 
     
	The new team shows that the selectors have decided to experiment with youth for the forthcoming World Cup in 2011. This is an idea worth a try. Certainly, players like Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma or Piyush Chawla deserve a chance to prove their mettle. The advantage of youth was there for all of us to see when Dhonis brigade brought home the ICC Twenty20 World Cup last September. The presence of youth will also raise the fielding standard of the Indian team. In this sense, the selectors have taken an excellent decision and need to be commended. However, the removal of the senior players could have been handled more sensitively. Certainly they deserved better treatment from the BCCI, having played the game with distinction. But then, the board has never been known for such courtesies. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The move to remove Sourav Ganguly from the ODI team defies any cricketing logic. Not only has Ganguly been in excellent form, his partnership with Sachin Tendulkar has been one of the most successful in the history of the game. He had a stellar role to play in all the three ODIs that India won in England, as also the couple that we managed against the Aussies at home last year. One hopes that he is able to take this disappointment in his stride. After all, going by his past record, another sterling comeback to the ODI squad cannot be ruled out. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The selection of the ODI team for the forthcoming triangular series in Australia seems to have been motivated by petty politics. One feels particularly for Sourav Ganguly, who, in spite of making one of the biggest comebacks in the history of cricket, has been treated unfairly. What is more appalling is the timing of the announcement  on the eve of the fourth test. It seems that the BCCI authorities do not have any consideration for the players morale or for the way such disappointments could affect their performance on field.
     
	Yours faithfully,

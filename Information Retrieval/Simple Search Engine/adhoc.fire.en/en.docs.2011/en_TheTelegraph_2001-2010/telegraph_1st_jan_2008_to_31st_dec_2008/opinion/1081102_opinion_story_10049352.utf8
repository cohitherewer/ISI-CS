                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UNWILLINGLY TO SCHOOL                                                          
	The Constitution directed the State to secure the right to education for all back in 1950, and there was an optimistic idea that the goal would be met in 10 years. A few decades lapsed, till that directive principle was turned into a fundamental right through an amendment in 2002. Since then, the right to education bill, in successive drafts, has incited debates and drama, much to-ing and fro-ing between committees and commissions, till it has been beaten into a shape that the cabinet likes. The bill is yet to be introduced in parliament, while private schools keep digging their heels in at the provision that 25 per cent of their seats must go to poor students, and the states throw up their hands at the finances they will have to allocate because the Centre has decided that all children between six and fourteen have the right to free and compulsory education. And so it goes on. Would it not have been easier to have always tried to educate all children from 1950 onwards? At least, with so many more parents literate by today, there would have been much less work.        
	But that is to assume that the governing classes are serious about education for all. That no government till date has moved even close to the goal, and that the situation is getting more unmanageable as the target date gets serially pushed back, prove that there never has been either political will or accountability. Putting education into the concurrent list has encouraged a dilution of responsibility. But the states cannot pass the buck as far as implementation of principles and schemes is concerned. Most recently, the much-touted Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme showed shockingly unequal results. How is an extra piece of legislation about the right to education going to change things?        
	India has numerous laws that make no dent in peoples lives. The law against child labour, for example, or that against minor marriage, or against dowry, has made no difference to a vast majority. Yet the problems these laws point to are some of the main reasons for children not going to school. The new law ignores these realities, even though it makes the State and not parents responsible for the childrens schooling. There is a peculiar lack of imagination in the framing of laws and policies. To give one example, if private schools are compelled to keep 25 per cent of their seats for underprivileged children, will it ensure an immediate breakdown of class divisions or will it traumatize vulnerable children further? This kind of absurdity comes from trying to squeeze a job that has to be done step by step over years into one giant leap. Education is not a joke, and it is the growth of childrens minds that is at stake here. The new bill may be affirmative in principle, but it will remain another piece of paper until all governments, down to the local level, are committed to education for all. Short of that, nothing will do.

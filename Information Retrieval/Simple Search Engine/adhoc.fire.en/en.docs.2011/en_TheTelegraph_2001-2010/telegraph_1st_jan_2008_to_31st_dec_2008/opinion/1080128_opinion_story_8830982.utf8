	It is natural to assume that municipalities and governments are busy governing the country. But when one hears of something as banal as a tax for pet animals being debated and processed, then one wonders at the nature of this busyness. Do civic officials, bureaucrats and legislators sometimes desperately need to create work out of the banalities of life in order to give themselves something to do? Creating provisions for levying a hiked tax on pets that had existed for a while, but was forgotten about, involved four years of work by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the ministry of home affairs and the Delhi government. The Delhi cabinet has now approved the proposed amendments to the relevant bill, which will now be sent to the Delhi assembly. This is supposed to be a structural amendment, but the question of whether the MCD or the government should decide about this is already being disputed.        
	Institutions of State should think several times before spending their time and resources on matters that trivialize the very notion of governance. Municipalities, in particular, should think creatively about raising funds, and not rake up obsolete taxes in order to do so. To identify pets and their owners, and then charge the latter, would be within the realms of the possible in, say, a country like Britain. But to attempt to do so in India is quite inexpressibly ridiculous. Even more absurd is the governments rhetoric that the tax would force people to be more responsible towards animals. And the animal-rights activists think otherwise: the tax would deter people from being kind to animals  from taking stray dogs home, for instance. Public debate of all kinds should certainly be allowed to thrive in a modern democracy. But the States role in regulating relations between the citizen and an animal is hardly the sort of discussion that is likely to enrich the Indian democracy, intellectually or economically. The MCD and the Delhi government should find better things to keep themselves busy.

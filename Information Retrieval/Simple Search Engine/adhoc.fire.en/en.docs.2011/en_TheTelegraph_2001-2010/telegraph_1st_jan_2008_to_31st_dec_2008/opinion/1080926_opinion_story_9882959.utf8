                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TAKE A DEEP BREATH                                  BONAFIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	As the confused saga of the serial bombing that rocked Delhi goes on and on with fresh discoveries of how and where the police officer who succumbed to his injuries was shot, and as the various political dispensations hurl obscene and baseless allegations at one another hoping to polarize their traditional vote-banks, the people of this city get ready to exercise their franchise to bring in a government of their choice. It is in their hands to ensure either a solid government with a majority backing or a fractured mandate that will permit all the political opportunists who stalk our land to fulfil their personal and parochial agendas at the cost of the State, something they have become extremely adept at. The time has come for a party like the Congress, that professes to be liberal, democratic and representative of the diversity and plurality of India, as different from the extreme Left and Right, to take a deep breath and make a pledge to step aside from the present posturing that has diluted the original essence of the country. The Congress has to take a calculated risk, keeping in mind the larger interest of India, even if this results in electoral losses and compels the members to sit in the opposition for a few years. The Congress owes this sacrifice to India because India had returned the Congress to power over and over again.        
	Intelligent, honest, coalition politics built on a commitment to this country and its future growth and development could have resulted in a truly democratic, productive and energized dispensation that would have generated good governance and ensured the bare minimum required to protect and enhance civil society. However, the coming together of various parties with conflicting ideologies and agendas, where political deals are struck only to be in power, for the sake of the endless avenues for aggrandizement that come with high office, has abused and debased the positive definition of coalition. Over the last decade, such faulty coalition politics has revealed a national leadership and governance that leave much to be desired.                
	Changed narrative        
	Religions have been misused and brutalized. The purity of the Hindu way of life, the faith in living that embraced all that came its way, have been forced to ebb away as caste and its negative ramifications in a modern age of equality and fraternity have been elevated to the heights of faith and religion. But this is nothing but bad faith. Fighting for votes on the basis of caste groups and communities is divisive and this has corroded India. The Congress is probably the only national party in a position to fight this terrible virus that has been injected into the body politic. It continues to have the largest vote bank that encompasses all of India and her communities and therefore must take the initiative to start the healing process.        
	The old guards of the Congress  the pseudo-intellectual pundits who walk the corridors of 24 Akbar Road, back- biting each other in an effort to curry favour, and who will bow, bend and prostrate themselves in front of those they believe are the rulers and then abuse them behind their backs minutes later  need to be whipped or ousted from the party. If that lot joins other parties, it will only help those parties lose elections against the Congress! Cleansing always guarantees a new lease of life.        
	The election campaign for the renewal of the Congress and of India is based on some simple truths  a promise to stop discrimination based on gender, religion, creed and caste; put an end to vote bank politics; reach out to and embrace all Indians as equals; promise and ensure inclusive growth by transparency in governance; appeal to citizens to join local forums that demand clean administration, backed by the party machinery; make a plea for social kar seva; change the narrative and win.

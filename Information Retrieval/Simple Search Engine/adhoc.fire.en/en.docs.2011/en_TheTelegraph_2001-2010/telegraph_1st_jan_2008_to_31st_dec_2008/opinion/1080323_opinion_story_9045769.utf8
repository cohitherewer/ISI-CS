                                                                                                               DIARY
                  
	 Negotiating a Rajya Sabha nomination is high art. For Priya Ranjan Das Munshi  who found himself stumped by the high commands decision to back an Urdu journalist while he was busy trying to push through a Trinamul candidate as agreed upon with Didi  the truth must only be sinking in. But for a pro like Jayanthi Natarajan, it was a ritual that had to be executed perfectly. Knowing there was stiff competition for the seat, Jayanthi is supposed to have worked overtime to create enough support for herself within both the Congress and the DMK. If her proximity with no less than the president saw her through the first, it was her friendship with Kanimozhi which helped her clear the DMK hurdle. It was only after she had done the groundwork that she finally met the Congress president to convince Madam of her victory. And only after Sonia was reasonably sure of Jayanthis standing did she send the AICC media chairperson, Veerappa Moily, to meet the DMK chief to proceed with matters. Perhaps Das Munshi should be just as thorough with his homework!          
	 Seems like Suresh Pachouri, so long Union minister of state for personnel, pension and parliamentary affairs, is the lone fall guy in the Congress camp. The other ministers of state like Prithviraj Chauhan and Subbirami Reddy have made it to the Rajya Sabha while retaining their seat in the council of ministers. Pachouri now has a different calling. As Madhya Pradesh Congress president, he is now expected to bide his time in the state till the assembly polls in November. He has been given Z-plus security like Uma Bharti and CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan so that he continues to feel important. But that alone may not make Pachouri feel terribly happy with himself or the party.                            
	 Rajya Sabha MPs are as go-getting as their counterparts gracing the lower house. They want their TV channel to be as popular as that telecasting Lok Sabha proceedings. They already have a website enlisting, apart from matters involving the business of the house, the birthdays of members and the names of MPs admitted to hospitals. There is also the Shabdkosh English-Hindi dictionary, which, given the entries in March, shows an overwhelming concern for women (the additions include words like nymphomaniac and stilettos). There are also plans to include a thesaurus and legal and medical terminologies in the site, together with bookings for the rooms and halls inside Parliament House.                             
	 Mayavati and Sonia Gandhi, after all, have something in common. Both dislike filmy tributes being paid to them. Since last years victory, Maya memsaab has had over half a dozen film projects being dedicated to her, but she has resisted them all. In fact, she was much angered and agitated when one Iqbal Attarwala announced a film on her and claimed to have her permission. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister is supposed to have personally called up the TV channel airing the information to deny the claim. Two other scripts have been written since then  Maya the Great and Bahenji  the Great Sister, but Mayavati will have none of it. There is another thing the two ladies seemingly share  their dislike for one particular film family.                            
	 The BJP may be known as an anti-minorities party the country over, but in Kashmir, it is an Islamic party. That was what two journos found out recently on their trip to Pahalgam. On their way to town, they found BJP flags lining the way to Ashmukam and realized that a meeting was taking place. It was a provincial-level meeting, addressed by Mohammad Yosuf Sofi, who was giving a fiery speech about how the Congress-led government was obstructing the BJP from opening a madarsa. Slogans came pouring out next, Narae Taqbeer, Islam Zindabad, BJP Zindabad, Congress Murdabad.            
	Footnote                
	 For Ambika Soni, the past is never too distant. At a recent retrospective held of Raghu Rais works, Soni was presented an enlarged photograph of herself during the Emergency. The caption ran, Here she is seen introducing Mrs Gandhi to her son, Sanjay, at a function... Soni took the picture with grace, giving no indication that she had noticed the caption.           
	 It is not that the hills have been terribly cold. Some other reason seems to be bothering the former Himachal Pradesh chief minister, Virbhadra Singh, who hasnt been home to Shimla since losing the assembly polls last year. Singh says that he has had other engagements. He was first on a month-long ayurvedic massage therapy in Kerala, and then in Delhi. Meanwhile, the Congress unit in his state has been waiting for his return to start afresh. There were problems electing a new Congress legislature party leader since the previous one had resigned, and there is also the unfinished report to the AICC that cannot be compiled without Singhs presence. But Virbhadra has been apparently wondering why his partymen are making such a fuss about his return. Had not his party colleague and former CM of Punjab, Amarinder Singh, stayed out for months after his defeat? Amarinder even had corruption allegations against him, but that did not stop him from travelling abroad.

	It would be simplistic to condemn the violence in South Africa as sheer xenophobia. There is much more to the anti-foreigner riots than what meets the eye. What began in Alexandra on May 11 as a backlash to the menace of illegal immigration has now spread to seven out of the nine provinces. So far, an estimated 50 people have been killed  the latest casualty includes a Bangladeshi shop-owner  and 20,000 displaced. Yet it is not just ethnic cleansing that has fostered what many consider to be the deadliest uprising since the end of apartheid. The locals have been enraged as much by the influx of settlers from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Nigeria, as by the governments perversely non-interventionist policy on immigration. Out of a population of 49 million people, South Africa has 3-5 million illegal migrants fleeing oppressive regimes at home. Their adopted country, however, is already struggling with an unemployment rate of 30 per cent, forcing legal residents to endure inhuman circumstances: no running water or electricity, squalid living quarters and acute food shortage.        
	The foreigners, who had once helped build up the South African economy, have now become a major threat to it. Yet, President Thabo Mbeki has persisted with his open-border policy, choosing high-mindedness over practicality. A number of leaders in his government were given refuge by other African nations during the apartheid. Mr Mbekis (misplaced) generosity towards the immigrants reflects this historical indebtedness. More sinisterly, he has refused to acknowledge the atrocities perpetrated by Robert Mugabe that are responsible for bringing three million Zimbabweans into South Africa. (Mr Mbekis loyalty to Mr Mugabe is built on their shared opposition of Western imperialism.) The present violence is an index of the peoples discontent with Mr Mbeki, who took over from Nelson Mandela in 1999, and has achieved little in his decade-long career. The black middle class is considerably well-off, but his reforms have left trade unions and the poor high and dry. It is time he made way for his rival, the more charismatic and popular Jacob Zuma.

	Gabriel Garca Mrquez wrote in 1967 that A character is a kind of a collage, is a mixture of different people you know. In this sense, the exhibition of photographs on Garca Mrquezs life, entitled Gabo  the Writer (Rabindranath Tagore Centre, Oct 20-26), organized by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations in collaboration with the Embassy of Colombia, could be viewed as a graphic novel in which the writer is one of the protagonists. The different people who make up the collage of his character are, among others, his grandmother who read secret signs in the fragranced bread, Virginia Woolf whom he admired, and friends such as the musician, Rafael Escalona, who did nothing more than to produce songs full of familiar characters. Much like Escalonas songs, each photograph from Garca Mrquezs life tells a quirky tale.        
	Garca Mrquezs ancestral house in Aracataca, with its stained walls and general air of decay, would have fitted into any street of north Calcutta with as much ease as into the imaginary Macondo. There was also the unmistakable air of adda in the photographs of the author with his friends from New Mexican cinema. The image that perhaps best captured the comic absurdity of Garca Mrquezs oeuvre was the one that showed him stroking the leg of a stone nymph, while Pablo Neruda, his characteristic cigar and tweed cap in place, seemed about to embrace her.

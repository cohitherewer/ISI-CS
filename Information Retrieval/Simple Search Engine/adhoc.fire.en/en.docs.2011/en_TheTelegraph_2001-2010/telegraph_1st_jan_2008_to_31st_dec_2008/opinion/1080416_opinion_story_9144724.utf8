The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Online crimes, offline laws
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ONLINE CRIMES, OFFLINE LAWS                              Are our cyber laws equipped to face the challenges of the growing   rate of cyber crimes in India, asks Saheli Mitra                                                    
	Ratan Khasnabish, a business management professor at the University of Calcutta, fell a victim to a cyber crime recently. He was in for a rude shock when one of his friends who was a businessman informed him that he had sent the professor $2,500 through the electronic money transfer system. But when? Of course, after receiving an email request from Khasnabish when he was in Nigeria. Khasnabish, however, was not in Nigeria but in Calcutta. To top it, he had sent no such mail to his friend. Evidently, it was a hacker at work.         
	A few months earlier, a number of people were duped online. They were told that they had won several lakh rupees in a lottery and would have to pay a clearance charge in order to receive the money.         
	Not just fraud, even murders that result from online activity are not an exception today. Not long ago, a youngster in Mumbai was murdered by online friends who had posed as a girl to lure him.         
	With so much happening, its perhaps time to ask the big question: are our cyber laws equipped to face the challenges of the growing rate of cyber crimes in India? We can no longer ignore such crimes by saying that they are more frequent in the West than in India. The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, needs to be made more precise and strict, says Siladitya Sanyal, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court.         
	Sanyal has a point. The Indian government enacted the IT Act in 2000. The Evidence Act was subsequently updated to include digital documentation to help tackle cyber crimes. But a closer look at the Act reveals that the legal framework for investigating computer crimes in India is somewhat vague and is always read along with the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).         
	The IT Act and CrPC rules often clash. Cyber crimes very often become a part of general crime, though such crimes are of a completely different nature, involving hi-tech criminals and special investigation. Hence, there should be precise laws to handle IT crimes and these should be made a completely separate chapter of the Indian law. If cyber crimes are read along with other crimes, the focus and tackling of such a crime becomes volatile, that is, there arises a conflict between the two sets of law.        
	Even the penal provisions under Section 67 of the IT Act are often unclear, adds Sanyal.         
	Undoubtedly, combating this new area where crimes can be highly sophisticated is quite challenging in India. Adding to the problem is the inadequacy of the investigating infrastructure. For example, Indias IT hub, Gurgaon, has a cyber cell with just two cops  one head constable and one sub-inspector. The usual practice is to not take up cases of cyber crime on a priority basis. Cases of murder, rape, dacoity are inevitably given more importance, says Ronit Ray, who was shown the door when he went to lodge a first information report at the local police station about an online bank fraud case. Thus most cyber cases go unattended or delayed, giving criminals time to delete traces of their crime.         
	Senior lawyer at the Calcutta High Court, Subrata Mukherjee, draws attention to Section 78 of the IT Act. Offences can be investigated only by a police officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police. This is restricted to investigations only but any police officer in charge has the power to make arrests. Here lies the dilemma. Are all police officers in India, whatever their rank, professionally equipped to cope and investigate such crimes? Perhaps not.         
	Only a very small percentage of police investigators are capable of dealing with cyber crimes. Though we have a cyber cell to deal with such cases, the cyber crime lab is yet to come up and we still have to depend on experts of forensic science laboratories, says Rajeev Kumar, special inspector general, CID, West Bengal.         
	IT expert Raman Krishnamoorthy, who is general manager, IT, at Vesuvius India, feels the urgent need to have a separate intelligence network and trained professionals to investigate computer crimes. In the US, the local and state administrations hire computer forensic specialists who have the expertise to comprehend how the criminal has committed a crime, for example in a bank fraud, and then track the person.         
	Another important challenge to cyber laws in India is the problem of jurisdiction and lack of international co-operation. There are many cases where the crime is committed in the US, but Indian nationals are duped in the process. Indian laws, however, do not apply to such cases due to jurisdiction problems.         
	The central issue in all cyber crimes is jurisdiction. Often, offenders knowingly take advantage of this loophole. The Internet has further given an international colour to computer crimes. Hence our judiciary needs to look into the existence of a bilateral or multilateral legal instrument that will help evidence gathering, says lawyer Abhijit Auddy, who often fights cyber law cases.         
	The best way to tackle such crimes is for the Indian legal system and investigating agencies to work in close proximity with international agencies. India should have written agreements with various countries and their investigating departments so that cyber crimes committed in India having an international angle can be tackled.        
	Unfortunately, India hardly has any such treaties as highlighted in the European convention on cyber crime of 2001. India doesnt even have a mechanism of online surveillance. Indian cyber laws consider surveillance an infringement of cyber privacy. But several cases in the recent past make it clear that cyber space has failed to regulate itself. So separate laws and an independent body should be set up immediately to address the issue, adds Sanyal.         
	Even Section 80 of the IT Act, empowering the deputy superintendent of police to barge into any public place and search and arrest without a warrant, is not flawless. The procedure for search and seizure follows the CrPC. As per the procedural criminal law, when a search without a warrant is conducted it has to be a specific search and that too on reasonable grounds. Again, the seizure of such matter may lead to an infringement of the right to privacy.         
	What is more, the areas that need to be looked into at once are many. A separate procedure for search and seizure of computer data should be laid down because of the ambiguity surrounding computer related evidence and the volatility of computer files, points out Auddy. Using CrPC procedures for the investigation of computer crimes is not of much help.         
	Indian cyber laws do not have any provision to regulate the issue of anonymity in cyber space, a gift thats often misused in India. There have been cases where, after a long investigation, the criminal has been traced by his or her identity on the Internet, but the site was later found to be non-existent, leaving the authorities clueless, says Krishnamoorthy.         
	The only positive move that India has made in the recent past is the facility to file online FIRs. This will undoubtedly help in early detection of such crimes, concludes Mukherjee.

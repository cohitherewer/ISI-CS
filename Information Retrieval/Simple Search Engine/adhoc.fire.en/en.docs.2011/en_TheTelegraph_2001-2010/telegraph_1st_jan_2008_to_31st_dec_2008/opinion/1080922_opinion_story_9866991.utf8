	The nicest thing about school is that it is not home. So, if a child is growing up as a practising, temple-going Hindu, then it is perhaps important for it to encounter a refreshingly different ethos in school that enriches as well as mixes up the childs religious sensibility. It is even possible that the child may choose literature, or music, or politics, or knitting, or gardening, or all these things at once to make up its identity, and religion may not figure in that scheme of things at all. Londons first voluntary-aided, state-sector Hindu school has opened in Londons Edgware with its first batch of 30 children. Although there are equivalents of such a school for the Church of England, the Catholic church, the Jewish, Christian and Sikh communities in Britain, some British Hindus are proud of this school as the first of its kind. They feel that Hindus have integrated too quietly in Britain, and such a school would make them more visible and audible.        
	Although Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have both ambivalently used faith schools to promote their own brands of multiculturalism, British civil society remains full of unresolved misgivings about faith schools. First, how would such schools avoid being discriminatory in their admission and employment policies? Second, should the State be funding these schools with taxpayers money? Third, would it not foster the wrong sort of segregation, and limit the entire process of identity-formation to religion? In the case of the Krishna-Avanti Primary School, invoking Hindu pluralism and then reducing Hindu piety to the loving service to Lord Krishna, that too through the mediation of Iskcon UK, might strike both conservative and liberal Hindus as somewhat questionable. Besides, given the global vogue for wellness, why should the schools promotion of a mix of vegetarianism, yoga, meditation and environment-friendliness be regarded as quintessentially Hindu?

	Hope with despair                  
	Sir  A steep fall in the Sensex comes as a setback for salaried individuals as well as for other middle-class investors (American influenza, Jan 22). Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India should devise a mechanism to prevent the stock market from becoming a gambling arena. Indias current fiscal policy is increasing the number of billionaires in the country but is not doing enough to accelerate the rate of development. This, in turn, has widened the income gap between the rich and the poor. But the worst affected is the always the middle-income group. Instead of disinvesting public-sector undertakings, a new fiscal policy is needed to ensure that PSUs issue safe bonds with higher returns. These would provide small players with safe investment opportunities, thereby ensuring that they do not invest in the volatile stock markets. Such a change in the fiscal policy is also necessary since India does not provide insurance to the unemployed, and also because interest rates in government securities continue to fall.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As elections approach, political parties tend to exaggerate the implications of any significant event (Investor shield, Jan 24). The Congresss demand of protection for small investors from disasters like Black Monday is a classic example of this phenomenon. One wonders what the party means by protection. As the prime minister has emphasized, swings are natural in any stock market. Whoever invests in stocks does so in full knowledge of the risks involved. Those investing in the stock market are not exactly angels.They are there to make money, and always at someone elses expense. The recent fall did not hit all and sundry, but only those who are greedy to earn more . Protecting such investors would indirectly punish the prudent people, who have invested their lifes savings in government securities. Such a step would only encourage speculative trading, thereby harming the economy. Who knows, some day the Congress will even demand to subsidize Indians travelling to America to gamble at casinos.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  When the Sensex skyrockets, financial analysts and the media scream that it is a sign that our economy is in good shape. However, when the market crashes, everybody blames the spectre of recession in the US and not the weakness in our own economy. Shouldnt the Indian market rise and fall because of its own strengths and weakness? Why is the US blamed every time the Sensex falls?           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The recent crash in the Sensex demonstrated the pros and cons of globalization. Significantly, markets in Asia were the most affected, while those in Europe and the US remained relatively stable. The Indian economy and the Sensex were nowhere as big and as high respectively before globalization. It is equally true though that since our economy is now linked with other global markets (including the US market), the mere hint of a US recession was enough to send stocks in the Indian market crashing. What has just happened is a classic demonstration of economic theory in practice  rise together, fall together.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.M. Lahiri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  January 21 was indeed a black day for the Indian stock market. Investors have now lost over Rs 11,85,285 crore. Being a small investor myself, I would advise others not to panic whenever the market crashes. Like many others, I too lost a lot of money over the last few days. But I firmly believe that the market needed a correction, which is now in place after the crash. Even if it does not recover immediately, I am confident that it will bounce back to 21K in less than half a year.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  I was shocked by the use of the word, broking, in The Telegraphs reports on the stock-market meltdown. The term, broker, is both a noun and a verb. Alternatively, the verb-form may be brokering. It is unlikely that many firms have broking wings as they would all go broke if they did not know the correct use of words. Simply adding ing does not make a word a verb (or gerund). The Telegraph has continued to use people from Karvy Broking as its source and it wouldnt be a bad idea to bring this little matter to their notice as well. Wouldnt it be sensible for the firm to change its name to Karvy Brokerage? I would seriously doubt the business acumen of people who have got their own firms name wrong, especially when the business world is full of small prints, fine texts and subtexts,which need to be interpreted accurately. I am peeved because The Telegraph is expected to use English correctly.           
	Yours faithfully,

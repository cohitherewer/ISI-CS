	Nobody, in this day and age, will grudge the fact that bureaucrats should earn more and live better. After all, they should also enjoy some of the benefits emanating from a growing economy. The exact arithmetic regarding which tier of the bureaucracy gets how much is a matter of arcane debate best understood by the bureaucrats themselves. What is important, however, is that members of Indias sprawling bureaucracy cannot claim to enjoy higher earnings without shouldering any of the responsibilities that are normally tied into higher salaries. The great historian, Edward Gibbon, noted that his Oxford tutor remembered he had a salary to collect, but forgot that he had a duty to perform. That damning comment could be used without any modifications for the typical Indian bureaucrat. The principal complaint about the recommendations made by the Srikrishna commission relate to its failure to link higher salaries and promotions to performance. Government service is seen as a sinecure since there is no danger of a government servant losing his job for not carrying out his responsibilities. Accountability is not a word that exists in the bureaucrats lexicon. This is an anomaly in a government that sees itself as being reformist.        
	Reforms have not touched the bureaucracy even though government servants are eager to enjoy the benefits accruing from the reforms. One of the chief aims of the reform process is to reduce the size of the government and of government expenditure. India today has 3.3 million civil servants, a staggering number even for its size and population. There are no proposals from within the bureaucracy to downsize itself. Professionals in every sphere are adjusting to the new conditions created by liberalization and globalization, but bureaucrats remain cocooned from the process. This not only makes their claims to be beneficiaries of the reform process sound hollow, it also raises questions about their ability to administer a fast-changing India. It is an undeniable fact that the bureaucracy is an obstacle to change and not a facilitator. This is where issues of accountability and work standards are absolutely critical. The questions of higher pays and perks cannot be seen to be separate from the above issues. The government, when it deliberates the recommendations of the Srikrishna commission, must devise ways of making civil servants more accountable and fewer in number.

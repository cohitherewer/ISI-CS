The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To play with fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TO PLAY WITH FIRE                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The Gujjars are up in arms and in revolt again. They have been promised an election sop, one that the state government cannot deliver on its own because it comes under the jurisdiction of the Centre. The issue has unravelled and is clearly out of control. The inability to think out alternative solutions, address the contradictions, and move towards the true appeasement of a community that believes it has been neglected, has spiralled into a national problem with very serious implications.        
	No longer a play of opposing political forces trying to fight for brownie points with the electorate, this issue has now attracted extraneous elements who are advising a militant approach, much like the demands of the Naxal movement in other parts of the country. It is not an ideological assertion anymore, but more like a demand of people who have suffered at the hands of a malfunctioning and exploitative administration and a near-deaf political class that has not dealt with such problems for decades. The blame rests squarely on various political dispensations and their ineffectual administrations.        
	The narrative of Indian politics has changed. The archaic talking points and temporary solutions that deflected the problem are all old hat and of no consequence any longer. Connectivity and communication, a sharing of ideas and events happening across nations and cultures, have together influenced human protest in countries that have hitherto been silent about the exploitation of their poverty, their non-accessibility and grief. Today, rhetoric alone is not valid, action is imperative for political survival.                
	Joint effort        
	To address the stark realities that stem from the failures of diverse governments, the mechanism for dialogue too will have to be creatively reinvented. Arrogance and imperious talking down at those who do not necessarily share the same views and positions will not work. Equality and fraternity, important tenets of any democracy, need to be invoked. The political fraternity, cutting across parties and ideology, needs to have an emergency meeting with representatives speaking on behalf of partners and face the protesters together. To exploit this particular reality for political gain is unwarranted and unacceptable.        
	The prime minister should extend his hand, lead the delegation with the chief minister of Rajasthan, a representative of the National Democratic Alliance, the Left leaders, a lawyer of international eminence, and a social scientist, in order to work towards a solution. There is no point playing with fire, a fire that will come to haunt all political parties, not merely the ruling party in the state. There has to be some dignity, magnanimity and seriousness in the handling of explosive national upheavals caused by those who have not been empowered so far. Leaders must concern themselves with the changing reality on the ground and not allow social fragmentation and the disintegration of basic norms of life. They should keep in mind the possibility of a public backlash to the faulty policies and the misgovernance of earlier regimes.        
	The fallout of this failed governance has resulted in the criminal anarchy we are suffocated by in our cities and towns. Loot, murder, rape, extortion, faulty enforcement of the law by civil authorities, bribery, corruption, strong-arm underworld tactics have come to destroy this great civilization as it struggles to enter a new phase of prosperity and growth. The lack of honest governance, integrity and commitment to the betterment of society at large and the disjointed mechanisms of government that dominate ordinary lives are reducing India into being an inhuman banana republic with zero accountability. This truth confronts us all and has become the common denominator across class and caste.

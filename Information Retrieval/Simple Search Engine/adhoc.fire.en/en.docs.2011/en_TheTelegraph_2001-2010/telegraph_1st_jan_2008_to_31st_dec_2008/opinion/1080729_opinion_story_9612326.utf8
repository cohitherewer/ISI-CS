	What is the best way of dealing with criminals and extortionists? Unionize them and make them part of the system. Such resourcefulness draws on two important elements in the real world. First, the usefulness of these criminals to ordinary people. Second, the muscular advantage to be gained by forming new unions for political parties already in power. This bizarre model of reducing the sum of criminality in the state has been applied to the innumerable touts who hang around the public vehicles department in the city selling driving licences or fitness certificates for vehicles at extraordinary prices. This union calls itself the All Bengal Motor Vehicles Representatives Union, and its members (more than 400 in number) will all be issued identity cards by Citu, the labour arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The system sounds perfectly symbiotic. The rights of these touts will be protected, and they will serve the people, in turn, by mediating between the public and the PVD, facilitating the processes by which licences can be acquired, especially when the applicants do not meet any of the criteria for getting them. The mechanism for getting a driving licence when you do not know how to drive a car, or when you are not old enough to get one, will become smoother. Also, when you kill people on the road because you cannot tell the brake from the accelerator, then you will at least have a licence to make things easier for your conscience, and have it from someone who will represent the party in power.        
	This is wonderful news for all kinds of people. And it will also work wonders for road safety, air pollution control, and generally for law and order in the state. It will also promote newer forms of collective effort, and criminality will be a much less lonely and much more empowering activity  the empowerment benefiting both the criminal and his protectors. Eventually it might even render the police quite redundant. (Perhaps those policemen who stay up all night taking bribes from buses and lorries can get together and form their own union too.) If, one by one, all illegal activities  from adulterated fuel being sold to autorickshaws to teachers in government colleges running private tutorial homes  are effortlessly converted to lawful forms of public service by unionizing, then Bengal under Left Front rule will live happily ever after.

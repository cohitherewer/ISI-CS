	The ivory tower of academia is the natural habitat of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. But he cannot afford that seclusion, having chosen the ordinary garb of the political bazaar to the academic gown. One of the main weaknesses of Mr Singhs prime ministership has been his failure to initiate any kind of meaningful dialogue on important issues with leaders of opposition parties. He has remained closeted in his own office with his own group of advisers. There is nothing wrong with this, but it has to be complemented by meetings with others with a different perspective or point of view on issues. It is critical to do this not only because in a democracy difference needs to be respected, but also because often the cooperation of the Opposition becomes essential in handling problems that affect the entire nation. Thus it is heartening to read reports that Mr Singh has been talking to the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, L.K. Advani, on the Amarnath agitation in Jammu and on the looming threat of terrorism. Reports also say that the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, has spoken to her counterpart in the BJP, Rajnath Singh, about containing the violence in Jammu. Such dialogue and appeals to end violence may come to nought, but the gestures are important in themselves.        
	There has been the suggestion that having unburdened himself of Left luggage, Mr Singh is now free to push through the various reforms that are pending. To these reforms he could add a new one: to be more forthcoming in meeting leaders of the Opposition in order to seek their cooperation and explain to them the governments problems and point of view. It is true that this has not been the style of the previous prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee being something of an exception in this regard. The most important pragmatic argument in favour of coming out is that Mr Singh has nothing to lose, he has everything to gain. If his offer of dialogue is rejected, the Opposition will stand exposed for having been petty, and if they accept, Mr Singh might actually solve a problem or two. Mr Singh is the master of reforms: so far only the economy and parts of governance have felt the benefit of his masterly touch. He should now turn his special gift of reform to the relationship between the prime minister and the leaders of the Opposition.

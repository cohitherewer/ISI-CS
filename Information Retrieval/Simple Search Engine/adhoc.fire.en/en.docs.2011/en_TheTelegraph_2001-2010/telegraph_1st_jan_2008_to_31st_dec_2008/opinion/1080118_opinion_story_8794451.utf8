	A goodwill visit by a prime minister should be seen as such, and nothing more. Manmohan Singhs visit to China was not expected to be a diplomatic triumph. India and China have not exactly been at daggers drawn after 1962, but neither have they been the best of friends. The ice has thawed: trade has resumed, Indian leaders visit China, the latter reciprocates, and occasionally the two countries speak in one voice at international fora. All this, however, creates an illusion that India and China can one day in the foreseeable future become allies. The illusion hides certain fundamental contradictions that determine Sino-Indian relations. India and China are competitors for the same turf. Both are growing economic powers, with India chasing the dragons tail. Both want to be recognized as the most important power in Asia. Both have the size and the muscle to back such a claim. These are facts that cannot be wished away by any goodwill visit. Those that walk the corridors of power in the Middle Kingdom and on Raisina Hill know and recognize these realities. Witness the conspi- cuous absence of euphoria over Mr Singhs trip to Beijing.
    
	There is one other very significant factor to bear in mind when trying to understand Indias relations with China. It is undeniable that India is encircled by China. There may or may not be any hostile intent in this encirclement, but the fact is that from Myanmar to Pakistan, in a northern arc, India is encircled either by Chinese-controlled territory or by allies of the Chinese. It is also incontrovertible that China has used one of these allies  Pakistan  to constantly needle India. Daggers may not have been openly drawn, yet daggers have been covertly used. Indias policymakers admit that, on the foreign policy chessboard vis--vis China, India is not too favourably placed. Thus New Delhi would prefer to smoothen the edges of the relationship by opening up trade and by continuing dialogue, knowing very well that the fundamental contradictions remain irresolvable. Both countries seem to have agreed to put the boundary dispute on the back-burner, and there is a general acceptance that the dragon will neither breathe fire nor huff and puff. Like still waters, still relations between countries also run deep. In the case of India and China, the depth lies in what the Great Helmsman would call the principal contradictions.

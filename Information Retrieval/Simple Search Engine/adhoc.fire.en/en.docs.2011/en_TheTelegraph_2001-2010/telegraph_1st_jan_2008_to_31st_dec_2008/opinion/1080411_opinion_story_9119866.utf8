	Gang Leader for a day By Sudhir Venkatesh, 
  Penguin pound;4.99  
	Sudhir Venkatesh is not the typical, self-effacing academic. This Columbia University professor calls himself a rogue sociologist. Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the critically acclaimed Freakonomics, credits Venkatesh with two abnormalities: an overdeveloped curiosity and an underdeveloped sense of fear. Venkatesh even strikes the perfect pose for the book cover  a pose that answers to all these descriptions.  
	Yet there is nothing patently vain in his self-fashioning. Gang Leader for a Day, as the name suggests, is about an outsiders privileged access to a forbidden world. The outsider, in this case a trained sociologist, goes into this area of strangeness to understand the dynamics that govern it. He goes down there on a visit, to collect data and do some fieldwork, but his life is fundamentally transformed.         
	As a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, Venkatesh spent a decade working with the notorious Black Kings gang, which ran a thriving cocaine business in Chicago until the late Nineties. He started visiting the Robert Taylor Homes project on the South Side, and befriended the gang leader, John Henry Torrance (aka JT). Initially terrorized by the gang members, he painstakingly earned the trust and friendship of the Black ghetto. Having grown up in sunny California, in a middle-class, respectable neighbourhood, this is a trying experience for Venkatesh, and often laced with unpleasant surprises. As nave curiosity turns into knowledge, he becomes privy to the working principles of the gangsta world  violence, abuse, addiction, exploitation and an expertly regulated underground economy. One person leads to another, worlds open out within worlds: single mothers, crack dealers, madams, abusive men and welfare workers, come together in a dizzyingly complicated human web.        
	It is easy to become completely fascinated by the human stories that Venkatesh gathers to be able to take the full measure of his achievement. By hanging out with the Black Kings gang, that too in a ghetto, he risked harassment from the police or beatings from rival gangs. Most alarmingly, if subpoenaed under federal law, he was obligated to testify against the Black Kings and share his confidential findings with the police.        
	Venkatesh becomes a repository of knowledge that is too precious to allow him to remain a disinterested party. The gang trusts him because they think he is with them, while the residents of Robert Taylor consider him one of their own. Ms Bailey, the shrewd building president, puts it best: Were all hustlers. The sociologist hustles to get access to his field, while his subjects do the same, hoping to be redeemed by him. For the residents of Robert Taylor, and for the Black Kings, Venkatesh becomes the means to better, more equitable living conditions.        
	This is the ethical crux of the book. As a young researcher, Venkatesh had been cynical of quantitative analysis and statistical techniques. Motivated by his supervisor and renowned social scientist, William Julius Wilson, he had moved towards ethnography. He was quick to realize that ethnography, like the charts and tables, had its own limitations. As a research methodology, ethnography is structured by certain exigencies. The researchers inner hustler is forever required to be on the prowl. The truth is, and will remain, difficult. The rogue sociologist knows well what sets him apart from his subjects: I had the choice in ending my time in the projects; they did not.

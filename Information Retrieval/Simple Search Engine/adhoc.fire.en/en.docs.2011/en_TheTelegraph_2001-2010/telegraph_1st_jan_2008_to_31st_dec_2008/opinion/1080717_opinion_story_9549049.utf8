The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Letters to Editor
                
	Poison in the air                  
	Sir  The failure of the democratic process in India is proved, among other things, by the fact that the media have become ineffective here. The Telegraph has spent countless reams of newsprint on vehicular pollution in Calcutta, but things have not improved despite the continuous coverage. The state transport minister prefers to remain deaf and blind and will not force the autorickshaws plying in the city to switch to alternative fuel. He has thus made it clear that he would rather let the citizens choke on poisonous air than lessen the earnings of Citu, the transport union under his patronage.           
	But The Telegraph should not give up hope. It should keep up its campaign to save the Calcuttans. It would help if billboards with graphics of the kind that appeared with the report, Cancer cocktail on roads: 50% kerosene and naphtha in auto oil (July 14), are put up in different parts of the city. If such billboards are installed near the airport, they will send a strong message to the foreign delegates who come to Calcutta. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee might just sit up and take notice then.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Anagh Pal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Although the adulterated oil being used by autorickshaws is dangerous, the claims about the health risks it causes need to be supported with more scientific statistics than were there in the report. For instance, what statistical survey is there at the basis of the claims that at least 10,000 people die in the city every year because of pollution, mainly caused by vehicles and that Calcutta tops the list of lung cancer victims among Indian cities? There should have been citations to prove the validity of these claims.           
	The chief scientist of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Dipak Chakrabarty, is reported to have said, It has been scientifically established that an increase of 10 micrograms RPM per cubic metre of air causes a one per cent increase in mortality. This is a general statement and probably refers to every city across the world that may even have air pollution levels lower than that of Calcutta. Besides, while it is true that the level of air pollution in Calcutta is very high, only motor vehicles or autorickshaws cannot be taken to be the culprits in this regard. Lung cancer is caused by a number of factors, pollution being one of them. If some cases of lung cancer might have been caused by the pollution spread by autorickshaws, several others might have resulted from smoking, exposure to arsenic in drinking water, or because of hereditary factors.           
	The way The Telegraph is striving for a better public health of Calcutta is indeed appreciable. But a report, especially of the investigative kind, must be based on proven facts. If the health hazards caused by katatel are magnified, people will become paranoid about stepping out on the street or about travelling by autos. Sensational claims may help increase the sale of newspapers. But in the long run, such reports are damaging because they spread unnecessary panic among people.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Telegraph has become the Calcuttans voice of protest. All of us endure the tyranny of autowallahs silently because we are powerless against them. We hope that something will now be done to prevent the autorickshaws from spreading pollution and death, now that The Telegraph has exposed them.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rocky, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The use of katatel is not confined to Calcutta alone. When I was a student in Bangalore in the Eighties, I found that a similar concoction of kerosene and petrol was used there as well. There were occasional protests against the users  not because of environmental concerns (those were the days before people had become ecologically conscious), but because the public found that the fare was being calculated on the basis of the price of petrol when the autos were using kerosene. I read then that any auto engine that gets used to this katatel will no longer work on petrol.           
	The government might consider changing the two-stroke engines fitted to autos to four-stroke ones. The latter is more fuel efficient and also causes less pollution. The auto drivers will benefit from this change as well since they will be able to run more than 30 km per litre with four- stroke engines in place of the 20-22 km per litre that is usual with two- stroke engines. I think that this will be the cheapest and the most viable solution to the problem. Of course, LPG can be used in place of petrol but there are several complex issues related to this proposed transition. It is not enough to say that Calcutta should start using LPG simply because Delhi uses it. I know of a thesis being prepared in a university in Calcutta that will show that even LPG produces a lot of benzene vapour and related pollutants that are carcinogenic. Many visitors to Delhi nowadays say that they can detect a peculiar smell everywhere. This, I believe, is caused by the compounds released in the air by the LPG burners.           
	Yours faithfully,      
P.K. Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is shocking to see auto drivers carrying on with their nefarious business right under the noses of the WBPCB. Traffic policemen would fine a private car for spreading pollution. Yet, they will let autorickshaws pass by without a word, although the latter might be belching smoke like a steam engine. The cops should realize that they are the greatest victims of pollution as they stand exposed to poisonous emissions all day long. During the recent road safety week, children were deployed on busy street crossings to manage traffic disregarding the fact that they too were being exposed to noxious fumes.

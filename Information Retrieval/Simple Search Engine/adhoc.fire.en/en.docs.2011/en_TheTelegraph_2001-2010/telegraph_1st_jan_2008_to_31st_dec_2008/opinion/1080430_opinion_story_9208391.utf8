	Missing in action
    In a case relating to dowry death and cruelty to wife, the husband was acquitted as he was not present in the village at the time of the womans death, but his parents were convicted. The Rajasthan High Court, while upholding the charge of dowry demand, acquitted them under Section 304 B (relating to unnatural death during the first seven years of marriage) on the ground that the state did not appeal against the husbands acquittal. Setting aside the high court order, the Supreme Court held that merely because the state did not appeal against the mans acquittal does not mean that the prosecution failed to prove charges under Section 304 B and 201 of the IPC (State of Rajasthan vs Jaggu Ram).                           
	A long wait        
	The Orissa High Court directed the Orissa government to pay pension and gratuity to a retired executive engineer, which was withheld due to the pendency of a criminal case against the man for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to his income. The case was filed following a vigilance raid conducted two months after his retirement. Referring to relevant rules, the Orissa High Court held that pension and gratuity can be withheld only if proceedings are pending against a person during the period of service. As proceedings were started after retirement, the court held that there was no justification in withholding payment, more so when the proceedings have been pending for 14 years (Brajasundar Pattanaik vs Government of Orissa).                             
	Head over wheels        
	According to provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, all two-wheeler riders must wear helmets and not wearing one will be held to be a punishable offence. The Two-wheeler Riders Association contended that the choice should be left to the discretion of the parties concerned and treating people as criminals merely for not using helmets is unjustified. It also contended that the provisions were introduced to help helmet manufacturers. Rejecting the contention, the Madras High Court held that while it is the individual who is affected, the state has a duty to protect its citizens and minimise the possibility of accidents (Accident Victims Association vs State of Tamil Nadu).

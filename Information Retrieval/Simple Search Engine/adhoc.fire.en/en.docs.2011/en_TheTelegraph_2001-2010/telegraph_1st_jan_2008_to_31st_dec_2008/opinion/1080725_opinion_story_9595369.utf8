	In spite of alternating between gestures of high-flown moral disgust and hurt betrayal, the Bharatiya Janata Party looks a little sad. The United Progressive Alliance is still in government, while the BJP has had to lose nine of its members of parliament. The party expelled them in an access of fury because six of them cross-voted, one abstained and two were absent in the confidence motion. That is, these nine MPs ignored the party whip. So did a number of MPs from other parties, including the Samajwadi Party. Quite a number of them have been expelled or suspended from their respective parties for this. In India, a three-line party whip means a directive to its MPs to be not only present in the legislature during a debate or voting, but also to vote according to the party line. A violation of this can mean the MPs expulsion, unless MPs comprising one-third of the partys strength in the house goes against the party line together. Numbers mean legitimacy. The use of a whip implies that voting according to conscience is unacceptable if the MPs violating party instructions are negligible in number. But if there are enough MPs who go against the party line, their vote is no longer considered a conscience  or a rebellious  vote, but legitimate dissent.        
	It does not need a recounting of this odd form of logic to underline that the use of the party whip to ensure voting according to party lines is anachronistic. In Indias context, it is also both hypocritical and dictatorial. The whip in this function had relevance when it was evolved in the British parliament in its struggle against the king. The position of whip is now important for its contribution to orderliness, discipline and fair distribution of speeches in parliament, concepts that mean very little in the present Indian context. To make the party whip effective only when a party line has to be followed in voting is to use an anachronism as an instrument of control. The freedom to choose is a basic right in a democracy, and that should hold as true for a member of parliament, whichever his party, as for his voters. An MP can decide for himself whether loyalty to his party, his belief in the partys position, or his belief in the opposite view on the issue under debate is important. A party whip is a mark of a partys insecurity and a form of disrespect towards its MPs judgment. The BJP  and the other parties  could have saved themselves the indignity of having to expel MPs had they not been so anxious to exercise control.

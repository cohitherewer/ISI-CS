	It is mandatory, but who is to check? The West Bengal government has at last caught up with the repeatedly pronounced direction of the Supreme Court that registration of marriages be made compulsory. The cut-off date is February 4, but people getting married earlier should also feel the urge to be registered. There is a slightly cooing, conciliatory note in the passing of the rule, for it may not please minority communities. West Bengal is not alone in being nervous  presumably about treading on personal laws  all the other states that have passed similar rules are a little wary too. The wariness is reflected in the terms of the law: the cost of registration is Rs 420 and the fine for not registering is Rs 25. West Bengal is offering a discount of 50 per cent on the registration fee for people below the poverty line. It may still be asked whether young people unable to eat their fill would be interested in putting in Rs 210 to get married the proper way, or risk a Rs 25 fine in the unlikely possibility of their getting caught. But the state government has tried to tone down the absurdity of the fine by saying that it is a token amount. That seems to be part of the suddenly gentle touch  the fine will remind youngsters of the importance of having their marriages registered.
    
	It is useful when a law is acknowledged by a government as being in force. But that is no guarantee of its presence being anything more than symbolic. That may turn out to be the case with this one. Why must young people be nudged by the bogey of a Rs 25 fine into registering their marriages now? The arguments for and against marriage registration have been the same for years. It is the States record of a personal relationship, and it can, if used properly, act as safeguard against bigamy, child marriage, desertion, property deprivation, evasion of maintenance and other evils in a patriarchal system. The State has never had the wherewithal  or the political will  to check on every single marriage. It is much worse that there are numerous children without birth certificates in this country. For the law to be meaningful, the government must employ not just more marriage registrars but also a workforce to spread awareness in the states remotest corners and monitor every marriage. Or maybe it will content itself with the fines.
    
	The argument against registration of marriages is not that put forth by proponents of personal laws; it is, rather, a question of the presence of the State in the private lives of its citizens. A couple may choose not to inform the State whether the partners are living together in married or unmarried bliss. It should be a question of choice, not compulsion. Would the State be willing to register the marriage of same-sex partners? And surely child-marriage can be prevented without the marriage registration law? Actually, it suits governments to keep things a little fluid. They would find it inconvenient to make a point, either this way or that.

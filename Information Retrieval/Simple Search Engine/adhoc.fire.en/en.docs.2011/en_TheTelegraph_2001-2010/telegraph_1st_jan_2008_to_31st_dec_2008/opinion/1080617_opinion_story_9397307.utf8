	Minor worries                  
	Sir  In its last lap, before the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, the United Progressive Alliance government is trying out novel ways of implementing its unique brand of secularism. Its latest theory is that Muslim students are scared of non-Muslim teachers, and this explains why their percentage is poor in higher education. The human resource development ministrys directive confirms this fear: The alarmingly low access of Muslim students in higher education could be improved with the positioning of teachers belonging to that community wherever feasible (Drive for Muslim teachers, July 9). If the UPAs idea is that the Muslims will feel more secure in the company of people from their community then it should issue directives to post Muslim civil, administrative, police and judicial service officials in districts where the community is in majority. They will not only then feel safe but also flourish and catch up with the majority community sooner. By the same logic, for the forthcoming general elections, the UPA may consider providing separate constituencies to Muslims in areas dominated by them. Muslim MLAs and MPs would then look after the interests of their community more sincerely than those from the majority community, who have failed in their duties all these years, as the Sachar committee report suggests.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is difficult to understand the logic behind Centres advice to all universities to increase the number of Muslim teachers in colleges located in areas with a high concentration of people from the community. It will be enlightening to know what inspired the Centre to believe that appointing more Muslim teachers could encourage more students from the community to join higher education institutions in Muslim-dominated areas. Unless the subject is Islamic theology, what difference does it make whether a teacher is a Jain or a Muslim? Are not we widening the already existing gap between the communities by this botched up thinking? These decisions, coupled with the Benaras Hindu Universitys gameplan of transferring Muslim lecturers from colleges in mixed areas to towns where the population of students from the community is high will only create more ghettos. In the process, Muslims would be more and more alienated from the mainstream.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Electric shock          
	Sir  On the one hand, there is no respite from power cuts, and on the other, there is the menace of ghost electricity bills. Consumers of Greater Calcutta and its suburbs are at their wits end on how to solve these twin problems created by the RPG-run CESC. The fact that there are over 40,000 cases filed against the CESC in the Consumers Forum proves the extent of the peoples disgruntlement. I could suggest an alternative. Instead of having the entire operations run by RPG, the CESC could be split into two parts, one to be entrusted to RPG, and the other to a specialized power company (such as Tata Power of Reliance Energy).           
	I visited Delhi and Mumbai recently. In Mumbai, I found that the power generation and distribution were managed by Tata Power and Reliance, while in Delhi, Reliance and Delhi Vidyut Nigam did the job. Needless to say, the problems with power in these two cities are handled far more professionally than in Calcutta. The middle class consumers of Calcutta would be happy if the judiciary were to direct the CESC to adopt a similar method.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Naren Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There is an acute shortage of electricity throughout the country. The situation is particularly bad in summer because of our tropical weather conditions. What we need is a way to save power. For a month of Indian summer, we watched cricket matches being played under floodlights, consuming a humongous amount of power. All cricket matches, particularly in summer, as well as weddings, must take place during the day. The best way to ensure this is to pass a set of laws to stop people from wasting power in India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

      
	Sir  Perhaps the chief minister of West Bengal does not realize how dismal the power scenario in his state is, because his home and office have uninterrupted power supply. Had he faced load-shedding as we have been doing, he would not have made the gaffe of saying that the power situation in the state is good. Of course, West Bengal is better off compared to many of the states. But should we gloat simply because we are marginally ahead of Bihar?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Department of honour          
	Sir  The department of physics, Presidency College, Calcutta, notes with regret the omission of the name of this department from the list of the best known departments published in Careergraph (June 5). The department hardly needs any introduction, given its glorious achievements dating from the distant past to the recent times. The results of the university examination as well as the performances of our students in prestigious research institutes, including the IITs, will provide ample proof of the truth of this statement. The exclusion of the name of our department from the list will, we apprehend, create a wrong impression about it among the general readers, not to speak of the young students aspiring to gain admission to the college.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tarasankar Nag, Head (acting), Department of Physics, Presidency College, Calcutta

                 Fifth Column - Gwynne Dyer
               
	Lets not raise our expectations too high. We are talking about weak leaders on both sides, leaders who can barely stand on their own two feet....It seems fair to say that no great miracle will happen here. So wrote Israeli journalist Yoel Marcus in Haaretz on the eve of President George W. Bushs visit to Israel. The two weak leaders were Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, but it applies equally to Bush himself. 
    
	The most positive thing that can be said about Bushs whirlwind seven-day tour of west Asia is that it probably wont make matters worse. On the other hand, thats mainly because they are so bad already that it would take real creativity to make them worse. 
    
	The spin machines are spinning and optimistic forecasts are being made for the outcome of this Bush administration initiative, which seeks to create a legacy of success in the form of an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement after failure on almost every other front. (Please dont mention Camp David, Bill Clintons similar failed bid for a legacy in the last year of his eight-year tenancy at the White House. It annoys them.) But Clinton was operating in a far more promising environment than Bush is, for reasons that are not entirely Bushs fault. 
    
	Back in the Clinton era, there was still reason to hope that there might actually be a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords of 1993 had drawn up a plan intended to lead to such a goal through phased negotiations and concessions, and hardline opponents of a compromise peace on both sides worried that the deal might actually be made. But thanks in large part to their obstructionism, it never happened. 
    
	The change of government in Israel in mid-1999 created a slim chance of reviving the Oslo plan, although Palestinian disillusionment with the project was already pretty deep. The Clinton administration held the Camp David talks in July, 2000, in the desperate hope that last-minute success could be snatched from the jaws of failure, but it didnt happen. By 2001, when George W. Bush took office, the second Palestinian intifada was well under way. 
        
	End of the road
    
	Since then things have gone from bad to worse. Israelis have despaired of a negotiated peace and shifted towards unilateral measures like the wall that wends its way through the West Bank. For many Palestinians, the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004 drained the last credibility from the two-state solution, and the star of the hardliners has risen there too. It culminated, last summer, in Hamass armed seizure of control in the Gaza Strip, which effectively divided the Palestinian Authority in two. 
    
	Little of this is Bushs fault. But he has done great damage further East with his invasion of Iraq, and the Arab world will be dealing with the Islamist radicals whose cause he has so greatly empowered for a long time to come; but the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was already a train wreck before Bush set foot in the White House. 
    
	The Jerusalem Post correctly judged the prospects of the current initiative when it wrote: Once again Israelis who oppose territorial concessions can rest quiet in the knowledge that Arab leaders look set to doom the peace process to failure by waiting for someone else to move it forward. 
    
	An Arab newspaper might write with equal justice that Palestinians who oppose territorial concessions can rest quiet in the knowledge that the Israeli government would promptly collapse if Olmert proposed any steps radical enough to revive Palestinian faith in the possibility of a negotiated peace. It is over, and the local leaders are just acting out their allotted roles in the charade to keep Washington happy. President Bush will have to seek his legacy elsewhere.

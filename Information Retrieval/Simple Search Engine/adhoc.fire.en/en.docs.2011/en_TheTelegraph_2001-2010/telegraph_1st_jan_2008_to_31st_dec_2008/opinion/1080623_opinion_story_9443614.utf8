	It is now three months since inflation began to rise; still, its crossing of 10 per cent is a shock. It has not been so high since 1995; that reminds us of another era  one when inflation was endemic. There was the famine of 1965, when the then prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, ordered all restaurants to close on Mondays. There was the oil crisis of 1975, when workers took to the streets in protest against inflation and Indira Gandhi locked up all who protested. Those were the days of which todays fathers and grandfathers tell tales; it looks as if the present generation may soon have some tales to tell its grandchildren. Inflation is no stranger to this country  not, at any rate, to independent India. It was believed to have been banished by the great reforms unleashed by Manmohan Singh in 1991. Industrial licensing was abolished and industry freed to grow. Import licensing was abolished and imports allowed in freely. The idea was that when excessive demand reared its head, more production and imports would cool down its impact on prices.        
	And so it seemed to have worked. Prices go up most of the time in this country; but there has been no period of chronic inflation for 13 years. The new burst robs the prime minister of some lustre as the great inflation-slayer. No one who has been in public life for as long as Mr Singh can have a record entirely unsullied; so all this does not affect the respect he generally commands. But the inflationary episode threatens not so much his status as a great prime minister but his reputation as economist. It is true that P. Chidambaram is the finance minister and hence directly in charge of inflation control. But he has exhibited a fatal combination of hyperactivity and ineffectiveness. He has taken a host of miscellaneous steps to keep down prices, such as reducing duties and banning exports. He has also spoken too much. Since his numerous reassurances that inflation will come down have come to nought, he would seem to have shot his bolt.        
	The present juncture must remind Mr Singh of 1994-95, when the Congress lost five state elections and he was blamed for it because he had failed to curb inflation. Now he has Mr Chidambaram to blame, but if the Congress loses the general election, it is he who will go down as the loser prime minister. So he and his economists had better put their shoulders to the wheel. What matters is not so much who is in charge but what policies to follow. The general inflation India faces requires a reduction in total demand. No one but the Reserve Bank of India thinks that monetary policy can achieve this; what is needed for early effect is a reduction in total demand  either a reduction in government expenditure or a rise in taxes.

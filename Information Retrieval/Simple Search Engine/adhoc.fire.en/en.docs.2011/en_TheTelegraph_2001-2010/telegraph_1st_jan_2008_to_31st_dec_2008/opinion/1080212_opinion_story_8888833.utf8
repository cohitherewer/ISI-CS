	There is nowadays a certain self-consciousness attached to the term multicultural. The aura is of Western import, and the multiculturalism of Britain  rather ironically, from the point of view of India  is a much-discussed subject. India has been multicultural since anyone can remember; the diversity of cultures, religions, languages and ethnicities is so much a part of its identity that it could not have been self-conscious even if it had tried. So its evolution into a modern secular democratic republic has meant unspoken adjustments as well as unresolved contradictions, often resulting in violence  when civil law clashes with religious or personal law, for example. There is often a sense of muddling along, a kind of ad hocism in response to events, when such contradictions come to the surface. India may have missed out on the advantages of self-consciousness, of which the Archbishop of Canterburys recent speech in London on civil and religious law can be counted as a philosophical and provocative manifestation.        
	The archbishop has not been screaming for the incorporation of Islamic Sharia law into British jurisprudence, whatever British tabloids may suggest. Rather, his was a complex and nuanced argument presented in the general context of the contradictions within a vibrant multicultural society. His specific context was the need for a better understanding and accommodation of Muslim practice for the sake of cultural cohesion as well as human rights. Sharia was included as the most striking example among any number of personal laws that exist in Britain now. This attempt to understand what the role of civil law should be in a culturally, religiously and ethnically diverse society, where identities are formed through multiple affiliations, led the archbishop to bring out the broader issues around the rights of religious groups within a secular state. He evoked the almost paradoxical concept of an accommodation by which not only may civil law take into account religious springs of action, but the state too may leave a space for jurisdiction by the less oppressive aspects of the religious law, should the citizen choose it.        
	In a way, this is what happens through the ad hocism in India, although without the self-consciousness that demands formulation. There is an unevenness of application because of this lack. But it is because the shifting spaces of law and different springs of identity suggested by the archbishops speech are acknowledged that the multicultural democracy has lasted so far. The interactive pluralism that the archbishop refers to is a difficult ideal, and there may be no tidy route to it. Yet, for the newly conscious multicultural societies in the West, it may be the only, if rather circuitous, route to cohesion.

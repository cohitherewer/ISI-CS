                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATE UNRULED                                                    
	Singur has rendered the government spastic. It can neither move nor think. The spectre of Mamata Banerjee renewing her agitation and the Tatas pulling out of their small-car project in Singur has appeared before Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as the apocalypse. As a result, he believes that he and his government have nothing else to do. Sit back and let matters drift has become the governments new motto, a far cry from those days of false excitement that followed the chief ministers slogan, Do it now. Mr Bhattacharjee seems to have forgotten that there is an administration to be run and a state to be governed. The Tatas may stay or leave, political agitations, given the propensity of Bengalis, will continue and the pujas will halt everything for four days with painstaking regularity every year, but all these cannot give to the chief minister an alibi for not doing anything. He cannot adopt the attitude, which seems to be his present one, of I tried, but what can I do other forces stopped me. There is governance after Singur, and maybe even industrialization. But to make this possible, the chief minister will have to be more active and less despondent.        
	The problem, however, does not lie in despair and inactivity. To be honest, the government has shown some activity, but on completely worthless issues. One report says that the chief secretary of the state has written a letter to the defence ministry expressing a desire to hold the Calcutta Book Fair, 2009 on the Maidan. Nobody will be able to quite fathom why the state government is involved in the holding of the book fair, and why it should at all be on the chief secretarys list of priorities. The government obviously has nothing better to do. In another decision, parts of Calcuttas main thoroughfares are being cordoned off so that pedestrians can walk there. This is necessary because the state administration is unwilling/unable to remove hawkers who occupy the pavements. The two incidents cited here suggest a contrast. The government is active in a matter  the book fair  which should be of no concern to any government. And where it should be active, it is a complete failure. Both are symptoms of the same malady: a complete inability to comprehend the tasks and issues of governance. Thus West Bengal has a seat of governance with no government; and a leadership incapable of galvanizing itself after it has been completely stumped on one of its dream projects.

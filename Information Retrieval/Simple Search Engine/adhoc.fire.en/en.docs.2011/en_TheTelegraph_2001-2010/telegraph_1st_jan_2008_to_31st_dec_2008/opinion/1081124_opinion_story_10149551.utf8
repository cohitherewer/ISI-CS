	What made Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Begum Khaleda Zia say sweet nothings to each other after two decades? The last time these former prime ministers of Bangladesh sat together was in 1990, when they offered a united resistance to H.M. Ershads military rule. If that meeting was impelled by a common purpose, this time, too, it is tempting to speculate a similar reason behind their historic making-up. Adversity provokes hardened enemies to seek each other out, but it would be imprudent to read much into their veneer of cordiality. True, after being put behind bars on corruption charges by the army-backed interim government, both ladies probably have common woes to discuss. But it is unlikely that they were motivated to break the ice by the goodness of their heart. It is interesting that they chose a public event  the Armed Forces Day parade  for their tte--tte. The role of the army in the caretaker government has raised many eyebrows. So Ms Wajed and Ms Zia would want to set up a united front, at least provisionally, before the forthcoming general elections next month.        
	There is, however, much sorting out to be done before the elections. Although Ms Wajeds Awami League is ready for the polls, confident even of securing the mandate, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party is acting difficult. Ms Zias BNP wanted the elections to be delayed by a month. The election commission compromised, pushing it back by a few days from the earlier date of December 18. Both leaders have accused the government of putting impediments in their way. Since they were released on bail, the army continued to restrict their movements, sometimes defying all logic. As Iajuddin Ahmed, the president, grew from strength to strength, his special powers to appoint supreme court judges in defiance of the recommendations of the supreme judicial commission was annulled. Thus, the problem in Bangladesh is about getting an impartial watchdog that can ensure free and fair elections. The caretaker government was supposed to fulfil that duty. But now this responsibility has been taken up by the United Nations, which is going to send a team to monitor the polls.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FOR A FEW INCHES OF RATTAN                                                                  
	In Prasanna gurumashais pathshala in Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyays Pather Panchali, the cane made up for the absence of most other teaching aids, and parents had as much faith in it as the tutor himself. Short of maiming and blinding, any other injury caused by caning was permissible.         
	For all the disregard shown to tradition in modern Indian society, this hallowed custom has been carried into the 21st century in much the same spirit. In September 2004, Kanti Biswas, then West Bengals school education minister, said, Corporal punishment like caning...goes against the very tenets of the philosophy of education. Like most ministerial words, these too have been proved hollow by the sheer lack of will in establishing the tenets of the philosophy of education.        
	Corporal punishment is one of the many things that separate urban from rural India. What produces shock, incredulity, debates and seminars in the cities is a perfectly acceptable, even necessary, tool in the villages. This, however, does not imply that inculcating discipline through physical abuse is an idea that has currency in rural schools alone. Studies over the last two decades show that between 60 and 90 per cent children receive corporal punishment in schools, with almost similar figures in cities and villages.        
	Only seven of Indias states and Union territories have banned corporal punishment in schools. At one level, this is an index of faith in beating as a means of producing good boys. At another level, the reality in the states where the ban is in place  and this includes Bengal  shows that a ban on paper is worth nothing in the classroom. A young teacher from a zilla school claimed that a less absurd student-teacher ratio could have reduced the need for physically damaging punishment by teachers.        
	Sometimes, the composition of the class is a problem. In a city school, Sambit Sarkar (name changed) used to teach two Sections of Class XI: one had the good boys and the other had the rogue elements. Sarkars hands did less work on the former than on the latter. And then the two sections were merged. A few days later, a student from the erstwhile good Section told him, Sir, aapnar ekta notun roop dekhte pachhi (we are witnessing a new side to you).         
	The zilla school teacher feels that if the incidence of corporal punishment is higher in village schools, it is not because students here are more unruly or disobedient than those in the cities. He insists that students in city schools think up novel ways of getting on the nerves of their teachers that village boys cannot even begin to imagine. It is fear of the consequences that often prevents city teachers from using harsh penalties. Sarkar says he hits the delinquents in his class only on their forearms, hands or shins; cheeks and heads are strictly out of bounds. This fear is largely absent in the rural academic environment, where caning and beating are a bigger certainty than the midday-meal.         
	A teacher in a South 24 Parganas school, who does not like using her hand or other implements to discipline students, says she still manages to inspire fear. Beating is so normal and expected that the students feel more unsettled by tough talking. But few have had similar success. In Sarkars school, students, given the choice between beating and the summoning of guardians, always choose the former. On a few occasions when they werent given the choice, weve even had to contend with fake parents, he says grimly.        
	A 2007 news report about punishment canes doing good business around the country suddenly appears more than an interesting piece of trivia.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

	Singur is a chronicle of a disaster foretold. This might appear to be an exaggerated conclusion in the midst of news that a solution to the impasse is being sought at the initiative of the governor of West Bengal, Gopalkrishna Gandhi. But the facts suggest such a conclusion. The Tatas have expressed their unwillingness to be part of this negotiating process and the companys sources have said that machinery will be pulled out of the Singur plant. It is worth recalling that the Tatas came to West Bengal with the Nano project at the invitation of the government of the state. The Tatas wanted a certain amount of land, which was given to them by the government, and they accepted in good faith the land that was offered. Now the government is in a soup regarding the land, and work in the factory is being obstructed by an irresponsible leader of the Opposition. The Tatas are not responsible for this mess, and they cannot be expected to be part of a negotiating process that is nothing if not political. The Tatas came to West Bengal to do business, and if they are not allowed to do this to their satisfaction they will leave. They cannot be asked to play at politics or be engaged in the quest for some kind of middle ground that from the Tatas point of view is non-existent.        
	Mr Gandhi has taken upon himself the onerous and thankless task of locating such a middle ground. Apart from the unedifying prospect of a governor being embroiled in a political negotiation, Mr Gandhi may find that his first steps are actually taking him further away from his goal. It might transpire that in the course of the talks Mr Gandhi will find himself in need of legal help. But he could easily have got that help in private. He has chosen to appoint a legal adviser, which somewhat prejudges the matter even before it has been put on the table. The concerned legal adviser has not helped Mr Gandhi by declaring that land could easily be returned if the government so wanted. This prima facie sounds like a special plea for Mamata Banerjee. The governor will have to work over time and use the skills he learnt as a diplomat to bring to the negotiating table a veneer of fairness. Whatever the outcome, it will perhaps be too late to salvage the small car project in West Bengal. The relic of Singur, like the ruins of Mohenjo-daro and Harrappa, will remain to mystify future historians.

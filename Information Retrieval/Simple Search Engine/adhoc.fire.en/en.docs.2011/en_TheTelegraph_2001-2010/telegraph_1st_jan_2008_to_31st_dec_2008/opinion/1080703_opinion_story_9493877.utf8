The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lights, camera, and no action?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LIGHTS, CAMERA, AND NO ACTION?                                                                  
	The multiplexes are alive with the sights and sounds of the Darjeeling hills, with Anjan Duttas Chalo...Lets Go and Arindam Nandys Via Darjeeling doing brisk business. But the sun isnt shining too brightly on the Kanchenjungha right now. Blame it on Bimal Gurung, or, from the other side of the divide, on the media-created impression of the disruptiveness of the movement he heads.        
	Walt Disney Pictures have called off their plans to shoot Zokkomon in north Bengal, and shifted the location to Himachal Pradesh, informed Suddhabrata Deb, the location consultant to Walt Disney Pictures for the film. Had they stuck to their original plan, the hills would have had the honour of hosting the first live-action full-length film that the company known for its animation films is producing in India.         
	When Bengal went to Cannes this year to woo international filmmakers, its main weapons of mass temptation were the high Himalayas and virgin forests and rolling tea gardens of north Bengal. Darjeeling and Kalimpong are the jewels nestled against the backdrop of the gorgeous eastern Himalayas. Before the campaign could begin to reap its fruits comes the news of Disneys withdrawal.         
	Apprehensions often have a tenuous basis in reality. The cast and crew of Chalo...Lets Go shot in Darjeeling for days when the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha agitation was gathering steam around the end of last year. Parambrata Chatterjee remembers their local guide testifying to the popularity of Gurung. The production manager of the film, Sugata Chowdhury, had no problem shooting on one side of the Mall while the Morcha leaders held a meeting on the other.         
	Chowdhury has worked on Anjan Duttas new film, Chowrasta: Crossroads of Love in the Mall only a couple of months back. This was when the media were full of reports of tourists being harassed by agitating Morcha supporters. Not for once was their work held up because of protests, maintains Chowdhury, although once, on a bandh day, the unit had to opt for indoor shooting, when even the bus used by the crew was politely taken away by the Morcha leaders.         
	It is also a fact, however, that Anjan Dutta and his crew are frequent visitors to the hills, as are most Tollywood directors and actors. What happens when a team comes to shoot from Mumbai or the US  without the local knowledge that Dutta and Chowdhury have at their fingertips? Several big-banner filmmakers, including Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Vishal Bhardwaj, had located their new films in the hills. Rumours have it that many shoots have either been postponed or shifted elsewhere. This is unfortunate, since Bollywood films had only just begun to cosy up to Darjeeling after staying away during the Gorkhaland movement of the Eighties.         
	At one level, it is about pure economics. It may not be a big deal for a Bollywood or international film to change location, but for a modest-budget Bengali film or telefilm, it is. According to Chowdhurys estimate, to transfer a seven-day shoot to Ooty or Kodaikanal makes a Bengali films budget go up by at least Rs 8-10 lakh. The local economy, on the other hand, stands to lose anything between Rs 8 and 11 lakh (for a Bombay film, double the amount).        
	The Bengali film and TV fraternity is living in the hope that the Morcha will work out the economics soon. Without disclosing names, Raj Basu, a consultant, confirms that none of the three Bengali and two Bollywood big-banner films that we are handling has cancelled its plans as a knee-jerk reaction to the hill turmoil. Prosenjit, the reigning star of Tollywood, says, If there is no strike in the hills from July 6, we will go ahead with our shooting. If the Darjeeling schedule of his film (July 13-30), under Swapan Sahas direction, goes off without any interruptions, hope, and the sound of music, may yet be alive in the hills.

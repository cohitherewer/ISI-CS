	The results of some kinds of research can cast more illumination on an issue than the premises demand. A study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health has concluded that mothers and children who are subject to domestic violence are likely to be anaemic and underweight. This work was investigating whether malnutrition and poor health could be linked to domestic violence. Among specific results, the researchers found that a woman who reported more than one episode of domestic abuse in the year previous to the interview was 11 per cent more likely to have anaemia and 21 per cent more likely to be underweight than a woman without such a history. Once pointed out, the link seems to be obvious. An abusive household is most likely to prevent the victimized woman from eating, or eating enough, sometimes directly by withholding food or forcing her to eat leftovers, and sometimes by creating a situation where it is impossible for her to eat. The last may include beating her up or locking her up, or wounding her so deeply with words and behaviour that she cannot eat. These methods are very familiar in Indian culture, as are methods by which a young mother, victimized herself, is unable to get adequate food, or even the right kind of food, for her children, especially girls. In any case, a nervous, anaemic woman would not be able to nurse her child properly.        
	While the results establish beyond doubt what many may have suspected, in principle they can be taken further. Whether the home is obviously abusive or not, anaemia and malnutrition of women and children should be considered the result of violence. That India shows some of the poorest scores in the nutrition and health of women and children is a fact that cannot be divorced from cultural realities, or the traditional structure of the Indian family. The distribution of food in a perfectly peaceable household is a good way to gauge the presence or absence of gender-bias there. This bias is a silent manifestation of the underlying power structure. Similarly, the comparative attention given to the health  or illness  of the different members of a family is another indicator of the power hierarchy. The focus on the needs and desires of the men, feeding their passion for control, is a far more sinister form of violence. Not only is it traditional, and therefore taken for granted, but it is also invisible. Unlike open abuse, it cannot be fought or punished.

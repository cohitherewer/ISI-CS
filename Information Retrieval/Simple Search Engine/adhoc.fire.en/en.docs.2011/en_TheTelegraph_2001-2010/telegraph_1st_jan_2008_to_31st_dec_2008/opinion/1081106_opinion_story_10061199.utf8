	Farewell to a legend                  
	Sir  Only the timing of Anil Kumbles retirement the last day of the Delhi Test  came as a surprise (Kumble calls it quits at Kotla, Nov 3). That Indias leading leg-spinner would retire soon had been evident for a while. A few days back, the former chief selector, Dilip Vengsarkar, reportedly urged Kumble to quit, and with good reason. For the last few months, Kumble had not been bowling well. He was also suffering from in juries that forced him to miss the game at Mohali. Like a true cricketer and a gentleman, Kumble decided to quit as he did not want to become a burden on the team. He quit on his own terms, rather than waiting for the selectors to show him the door.           
	It has been a long journey for Jumbo. He started off against England 18 years ago and ended the game with over 600 wickets, going on to become the third highest wicket-taker in Test history. Apart from being a useful tailender, Kumble is also the only bowler after Jim Laker to have taken 10 wickets in an innings. Above all, Kumble was a gritty player. Who can forget the manner in which he bowled with a broken jaw in Antigua against the West Indies? Sachin Tendulkar has said that it will be difficult to find Kumbles replacement, As always, it is difficult to disagree with the Little Master.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Anil Kumble, without doubt, has been Indias best bowler in all forms of the game. He has given his best on the field on each and every occasion: be it bowling with a broken jaw or a split webbing, or leading an embattled team calmly in a hostile, foreign land. Sadly, the selectors made him Test captain only at the fag end of his career although he deserved the baton earlier. With Kumbles retirement, it is clear that the Board of Control for Cricket in India had served some sort of ultimatum to the senior players before the series against Australia. It certainly was the right thing to do as the present lot was unwilling to hang up their boots at the right time. Unfortunately, the Tendulkars and Dravids are different from Sunil Gavaskar who retired when he was on top of the game.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Rahul Dutt, Gurgaon 

                
	Sir  Anil Kumbles sudden decision to retire from Test cricket brings to a close a glorious chapter in Indias cricketing history. It is a pity that Kumble will not turn out for India again. His momentous feat of claiming 10 wickets against arch rivals Pakistan in a single innings has confirmed his place in the pantheon of world cricket. Kumble should not be judged by the number wickets he has taken. He was a champion bowler with a large heart who played the game in the right spirit. Kumble leaves behind him a rich legacy for younger cricketers. Indian cricket will miss the man who always put the team before himself.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Narayan B. Iyer, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  After a remarkable career, Anil Kumble has called it a day. Having injured his finger, there was no way he could play the final Test in this series. Hence, Kumble rightly decided to retire in the middle of a series in which he was far from his best. His performance had not been upto the mark for a while now, and his retirement is welcome news. On the other hand, Sourav Ganguly, it seems, is being forced to end his career on account of his strained ties with the board. India doesnt need its old warhorses now: a bunch of talented youngsters are ready to take their places. Perhaps, the remaining three, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and V.V.S. Laxman, should also contemplate retirement now. Some of them have said  quite arrogantly  that they would like to retire when they think is right, and should not be forced into the decision. The three remaining seniors should think of quitting before people start asking when rather than why.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Anil Kumble decided to bid adieu to international cricket during the drawn Test in Delhi, winding up a glorious career as a player, and later as captain. However, a bowler of Kumbles calibre deserved a better farewell. His showing against Australia has been pretty poor. With Kumble out of the picture, the team management and the board could have proposed Sourav Gangulys name as captain for the Nagpur Test. That would have been a fitting tribute to the man who was Indias best captain ever. But Ganguly isnt exactly popular with the board these days. So we have to miss out on what could have been a historic moment.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sankar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It seems that Anil Kumble is not only physically injured, but also mentally hurt at the way he has been treated in the recent past (Injured or hurt? Kumble retires, Nov 3). The barbs he had been facing for his ordinary showing must have tormented him. Frankly, Kumble should have retired before the series against Australia. That way, he would have been spared his pain and his fans the horror of his toiling for wickets.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Anil Kumble was undoubtedly hurt by Dilip Vengsarkars criticism a day before his retirement. After all, he had dedicated a good part of his life to playing and achieving wondrous feats for his country. It is time Messrs Vengsarkar and More exercised a little restraint in their observations. Vengsarkar was a good cricketer in his time, but has no right to decide when the senior players of India are going to retire. If former cricketers want publicity, they should do meaningful things rather than destroy the morales of our cricketing icons.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Dark forebodings                  
	Sir  The first phase of panchayat polls in West Bengal will not be remembered for the percentage of votes polled or the customary rigging by the party in power. The highlight this time is undoubtedly the verbal duel, captured on camera by local news channels, between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) member of parliament, Lakshman Seth, and the Central Reserve Police Force DIG, Alok Raj (Caught barking, May 12). It has been reported that Seth commanded Raj to remain within his camp and not patrol the troubled areas in Nandigram on election day. There is hope yet for democracy, in that the DIG refused to comply and continued to carry out his responsibilities. The credibility of the CPI(M) has reached rock bottom. This is proved by the fact that CPI(M) workers lodged a false FIR against Alok Raj, claiming he had molested a woman while on duty. The sole reason for this was the partys fear that its regime of terror would be exposed by the DIG. Having worked within the administration, I can say that this will not be the last time that a communist leader will have bullied officers and abiders of the law, or people who set examples of good governance. The tirade of Left Front politicians against the governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, is a glaring example of this. With the United Progressive Alliances total dependence on the Left Front for survival, more such strong-arm tactics are expected from the leftists.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  How could an officer-in-charge of a region as sensitive as Nandigram be such a CPI(M) yes-man? The Election Commission has also failed to hold panchayat elections in a free and fair manner. Incidents of violence, booth-jamming and looting of ballot papers marred the elections in several areas. Lakshman Seths orders to the CRPF DIG made a mockery of democracy. There was no need to bear the great financial burden of calling the Central forces to Nandigram if they are to be made passive onlookers to the violence there. Alok Raj neither interfered in the electoral process nor did he overreach his brief. Maligning him falsely only makes the ruling party look bad. A CBI inquiry, if called for, will undoubtedly clear the DIG of all charges and expose the corruption of the peoples representatives.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  Truth has become the first casualty in Nandigram where only might is right at present. Nandigram is a colossal human tragedy. Civil societys protest against the atrocities, brought to the fore by the intellectual elite campaigning for justice, is being dismissed by dishonest politicians.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Suprabhat Biswas, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is quite impossible to believe that an officer of such high rank and commitment as Alok Raj, who has been fted twice within two years for outstanding service by the CRPF director-general, would even consider molesting anyone, and that too in broad daylight (Officer who wont stoop, May 12). Lakshman Seths orders to the DIG were ridiculous. Why would the CRPF come to Nandigram at all, if its job was to remain confined within camps while the area continued to be a theatre of war. It seems that Seth believes his unquestioned rule in Haldia would extend elsewhere in the state too. No one can deny Seths role in the development and prosperity of the Haldia region, but his aggressive, whimsical and defiant attitude negates all his efforts at good governance. He is taking undue advantage of the larger-than-life public image that he has carefully created for himself. CPI(M) leaders should be wary of the likes of Seth, who consider themselves to be above the interests of the party. The CPI(M)s unity is well-known: even a senior leader like Jyoti Basu cannot always freely express his views on important issues. Seths highhanded and brash threats to Alok Raj will send wrong signals about the party.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Under no circumstance should elections have taken place in strife-torn Nandigram. The CPI(M) cadre, in collusion with the police, have been running riot, beating up and threatening villagers. The CRPF deployed there have been trying its best to keep order in the area, but it turns out that even this force has been hindered in its duties by the police. The DIG of the CRPF, Alok Raj, has gone to the extent of saying that he can bring peace in Nandigram in a short time if given a free hand. For his dedication and fearlessness, he has been rewarded with a false charge of molestation. Over the past few months, social activists like Medha Patkar, forums for democratic rights, high court judges and even the governor have been made the target of coarse verbal attacks by Alimuddin Street. Has the party lost its brains, or does it only want to run on the brawn of its unruly cadre?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  The spat between Haldia strongman, Lakshman Seth, and CRPF DIG, Alok Raj, over the panchayat elections in Nandigram came as no surprise in terms of election-day activity in West Bengal. Nobody in the state administration and police dares to defy the commands of party satraps like Seth.           
	Government officials mostly execute their duties following the instructions of the ruling party. Only this time, Seth appears to have barked up the wrong tree. The CRPF is answerable to the Centre, and thus its DIG was not going to be at Seths beck and call. However, it is possible that the ruling party bosses will seek the help of their colleagues in Delhi to pressurize the Centre to take action against Raj. Local communist leaders act like old zamindars and keep their subjects (read electorate) terrorized. This game plan has been working wonderfully in Bengal for years now and will continue to do so, thanks to the weak and corrupt Opposition parties.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tamal Basu, Hooghly

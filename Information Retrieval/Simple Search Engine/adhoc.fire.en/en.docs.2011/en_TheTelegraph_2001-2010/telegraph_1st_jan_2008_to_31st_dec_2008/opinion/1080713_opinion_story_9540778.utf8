	 Let bygones be bygones, Congressmen seem to be telling Amar Singh these days. After the comrades pulled the rug from under the Congress-led governments feet, Singh and his Samajwadi Party came to its rescue, promising to extend support during the trust vote on July 22. Since then, Congress leaders, big and small, have not stopped gushing over Singh, a man they loved to hate even a few days back. Union minister Kamal Nath joined the crowing the other day, and reminisced about their Calcutta connections, particularly about Singhs many good deeds. Apparently, in 2002, Nath, then AICC gen-sec in charge of poll-bound Gujarat, had sent a missive to the GPCC chief, Amar Singh Chowdhary, only to find that his staff had sent it to the SP man instead. Singh, in his customary humour, responded that the Congress leadership willing, he would be quite happy to organize a rally for Sonia Gandhi, as Nath had suggested in the letter. Six years later, Singh has answered the Congresss prayers again. Nath and Co. must be wishing that there were such a creature as permanent friend in politics.                 
	 The heat generated by the Lefts withdrawal of support to the UPA government has left Sitaram Yechury rather cold. While the Congress and the Opposition get busy with calculators and other counting-gadgets in anticipation of the trust vote, Yechury has been away from the action. In fact, he has been quite far  in London, on a British government invite. It is learnt that he was so upset with the developments that he took off for the foreign shores as soon as he sensed that Prakash Karat and other party hardliners were going to pull the plug. Which was all very well, perhaps, since Karat, the prime opposer to the nuke deal, got to deliver the final salvo. Meanwhile, Yechury has just got back to the capital.                            
	 In the capital, the Congress is scouting for possible allies before the floor test. Strangely though, no one quite knows who the mysterious troubleshooter is  the Congressman who has been given the task of sending private feelers to other party leaders. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has been taken ill. Digvijay Singh spends more time serving tea to scribes at the party headquarters than in politicking. Parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi is considered inexperienced for so tricky a task, while his deputies, Pawan Bansal and V Narayanswamy, are lightweights who cut no ice with political heavyweights. In fact, former PM HD Deve Gowda is said to have once declined to meet Bansal and demanded to meet the Congress president directly. All that is known now is that the secret parleys between the Congress and the smaller parties have shifted out of 24 Akbar Road to a fancy hotel in Connaught Circus. If the government fails to win the trust vote, all the money spent in footing the hotel bill would have gone down the drain.                            
	 In politics, does the heart matter or the head? Dont ask the Akali Dal leaders, for they too are searching for the answer before the trust vote. The hearts of the eight Akali Dal MPs, one hears, lie with Manmohan Singh, and they are unwilling to let a Sikh brother down. They also know that they stand to gain by supporting the deal because nuclear power could solve Punjabs power crisis. But the trouble is that they have tied the knot already with the NDA. Shouldnt someone dash from 24 Akbar Road to tell the Akali brothers that it is the heart that should rule the head?                            
	 Actors prefer double roles, but politicians probably dont. Not Shakeel Ahmad, at least. The minister of state for home affairs is said to be unhappy with his additional role of the party mouthpiece. Every Friday, after the weekly inflation figures have been published, it is Shakeels turn to face the scribes and their scathing questions. A devout man, Shakeel addresses the media after performing his Friday namaaz, and is heard promising that the inflation figures will drop shortly. Insiders say that the god-fearing man is having trouble offering false assurances after prayers each week.                            
	 Believe it or not, LK Advani is on YouTube, and no, he is not singing a bhajan to Lord Ram. The BJP has created a full-fledged interactive video site that charts Advanis political career and put it on YouTube. But getting wired is not always the best way of getting votes in this country. Has the BJP forgotten what happened to Chandrababu Naidu, Andhras Cyber-CM, in the last elections?        
	Footnote      
	 The only thing permanent in politics, they say, is change. Look at the UNPA. This ragtag coalition changes its leaders at the drop of a hat. First, the AIADMK chief, J Jayalalithaa, was appointed chairperson, but by the time the Third Front held its second meeting, Amma had made way for Mulayam Singh Yadav. Before you could say Jack Robinson, Mulayam had cosied up to the Congress after the Left left it high and dry. Naturally, he couldnt retain his UNPA post. Enter Om Prakash Chautala. Now, the new leader of the pack has the reputation of being an astute weathercock, and there are murmurs already that he might turn rightwards. That will put TDPs Chandrababu Naidu without a challenger and he can then take charge of the UNPA flock. But Naidu need not rejoice. The roost might not be his to rule for too long, if the coalitions history is anything to go by.

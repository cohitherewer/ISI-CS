	Plug the gap                  
	Sir  Neo-baseball, anyone? (May 26) by Ashok Mitra is yet another example of this Marxist writers anti-American mindset. In his article, Mitra describes George Bush as illiterate. To call someone who holds a business degree from Harvard uneducated reveals Mitras own bias. Mitra also writes that very little money that has been spent on cricket has percolated down to the domestic economic system. This is true of cricket in India as well as for any other sport played across the world. For instance, the money China is spending for organizing the Olympics is unlikely to trickle down and boost that nations domestic economy. While alluding to Indias deteriorating economic situation, Mitra says that inflation in India has reached the highest level since the beginning of the new century. This may well be true, but Mitra seems to have forgotten that even communist countries have been adversely affected by inflation. Chinas inflation rate is now 8.7 per cent, which is even higher than Indias. As far as Mitras contention that jobs are hard to come by in India is concerned, I would like to point out that Chinas unemployment rate has soared too, according to the data provided by the Beijing-based Development Research Centre.           
	Cricket or any other sport would continue to be played irrespective of the global economic situation. After all, man does not live by bread alone.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras brilliant article on the changing nature of cricket aptly describes the lopsided nature of development in India. On the one hand, malls and swanky eateries are being built in our cities. On the other, rural India is witnessing farmer suicides and starvation deaths. Worse, children continue to be undernourished for the want of a balanced diet. One agrees with Mitra when he writes that such skewed economic growth could result in large scale social turmoil. To avoid that, the government must ensure that economic development is inclusive, so that weaker sections of society prosper as well.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra seems to be unhappy about the fact that globalization in India has led to uneven growth, and that the revenues generated in the service-sector are being siphoned off by foreign agencies. Perhaps Mitra doesnt know that the rich are not supposed to be philanthropists who sacrifice their profits for the sake of holistic development. In fact, protecting the domestic economy and the under-privileged is entirely the responsibility of the State. The privileged class may earn a lot of money but the government also taxes it heavily so that the revenue generated could be spent on the uplift of the downtrodden. Unfortunately, owing to corruption and a rigid bureaucracy, only a meagre percentage of the revenues is spent on developing rural areas and on improving infrastructure. Who is to be blamed for this uneven growth, then? The proponents of Americanism or the inept Central and state governments?

	Sir  I fully agree with Ashok Mitra when he says that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow due to faulty planning and ineffective policies .The poor in India have remarkable resilience. Otherwise, they would not have been able to survive their hardship. The Twenty20 tamasha is a clever creation to divert the peoples attention from the inequities that plague the country.

	Then and now           
	Sir  Cricket, to use an old adage, is a religion in India. However, when a senior citizen like me and a non-resident Bengali at that, rushes from Faridabad to Calcutta to watch Oliver Kahn bid farewell to football, then one has to admit that contrary to popular perception, football isnt dead yet in India. I consider myself lucky to have watched Mohun Bagan play against Cosmos in 1977, as well as against Bayern match. The legendary Pele was the cynosure of all eyes in that game, as was Kahn in the recent match at Salt Lake. Cosmos, despite their star-studded line-up, were held to a draw by their less-fancied rivals. The German champions humbled Mohun Bagan by a 3-0 margin, but it must be remembered that Mohun Bagan were playing without their senior players. The juniors in the side played beyond expectations and even managed to win praise from the German coach.           
	I have fond memories of the earlier game: Shivaji Banerjee, the Mohun Bagan custodian, denying Pele a certain goal by diving and picking the ball up from the Brazilians feet. Pele jumped over the diving Banerjee so as not to hurt him, showing how the game ought to be played. But the two red cards, one each against Mohun Bagan and Bayern Munich, during the game marred the festive spirit somewhat.           
	The match also did not rise to great heights.Only Ze Robertos goal must have given the crowd  a full house at Salt Lake  some solace. The lack of security on the ground that resulted in a pitch invasion after the game showed how poorly organized football is in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

	As George W. Bush, the cowboy of the Western world, prepares to take his final bow, Barack Obama is set to become the new messiah. Mr Obama is, as he admitted himself, not the likeliest candidate for the presidency of the United States of America, but the mass euphoria at the Denver convention last Thursday told a different story. More than 80,000 people gathered to witness a historic occasion: the first-ever Black American man being nominated for the most important job in the world. Mr Obamas acceptance speech was a feat of self-control, calculated to understate the sense of a grand beginning looming over him. What the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me, he told his supporters, Its been about you. His shift of emphasis from me to you was more than a rhetorical generosity. Forty-five years ago, Martin Luther King Jr delivered his famous I have a dream speech before a similarly huge gathering. He too had addressed the African-American community, at whom Mr Obama directed his words. Mr Obamas words thus resonated with a special sense of occasion as the ghost of the past hovered between the desire and the destiny of his people.        
	Hysterical celebrations apart, Mr Obama is being held up by his Democratic party as a true hope for a post-racial politics in the US. So far, there has not been enough evidence to ratify this claim. Mr Obama, if he makes it to the White House after the November elections, would inherit a hugely messed-up legacy from his predecessor. He would first have to deal with the Republican middle-class (especially the whites), which has been pampered by the Bush administration. Then there is the aggrieved pro-Hillary Clinton brigade among the Democrats. Mr Obama has already made messianic overtures to keep everyone smiling. He has promised surreal tax-cuts for all, jobs for the poor and reduction of wasteful expenditure. With Iraq yet to get off President Bushs axis of evil, Afghanistan in a shambles, a volatile Pakistan, and an ever belligerent Russia, Mr Obama would be thrown into the deep end of things from the very first day of his new job. In 2008, the US defence budget is a staggering $647 billion, with more than $1 trillion already spent on the war on terror. Given the state of the economy, it would be imprudent to expect a miracle until Mr Obama comes up with a more specific agenda.

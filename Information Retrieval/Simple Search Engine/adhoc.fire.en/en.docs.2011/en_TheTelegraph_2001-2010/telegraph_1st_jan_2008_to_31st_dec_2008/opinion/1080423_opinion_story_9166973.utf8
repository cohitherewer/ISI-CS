                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FORGIVE AND FORGET                               FIFTH COLUMN - SUDIPTA BHATTACHARJEE                               
	Following the Oklahoma bombings on April 19, 1995, Diane Leonard, testifying in the trial of the accused, Timothy McVeigh, said: I feel like I died too. My heart looks like that building. It has a huge hole that can never be mended.        
	Exactly thirteen Aprils later, the media is abuzz with another such meeting between a victim of violence, Priyanka Vadra, and one of the offenders, Nalini (Sriharan) Murugan, the only surviving member of a five-member squad that orchestrated the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.         
	Given her lineage and the timing (countdown to the polls), it is convenient to attribute political motives to Priyankas visit to Vellore jail, although she stressed that it was purely personal, prompted by the need to make peace with violence in my life.         
	Howard Zehr, who directed the first victim-offender conferencing programme in the United States of America, says, Given the chance, many (but certainly not all) victims would value a chance to meet, or at least communicate with, their offender. Their motivations vary. Sometimes it is to get answers to questions or to tell them the impact of the wrong on their lives. Sometimes it is to see what kind of person the offender is. Often it is because it gives them a sense of involvement or power. Some seek vindication from the offender  an apology or restitution, while some do so in order to forgive. Nalinis claim that the meeting was a defining moment in her life because she felt cleansed of her sins without accepting responsibility for her action has triggered a sense of unease in Zehr.                 
	Restorative justice        
	Although new in the Indian context, restorative justice is an effort to help victims meet their needs and help the offenders understand what they have done and take responsibility for it. In the parlance of restorative justice, victims have four specific needs. First, a need for answers to questions about the offence  why it happened and what has occurred since. Second, they need to transcend their experience by recounting the trauma, especially to those who have caused harm and have them understand the impact of their actions.         
	Third, the need to restore a sense of empowerment, since victims feel they have lost control over their lives. And, finally, restitution, when an offender makes an effort to negate the harm, even if slightly, by taking responsibility and apologizing.         
	All these fit into the pattern of the Nalini-Priyanka interview. Had an application under the Right to Information Act seeking information on this meeting not been filed, we would have not have known what transpired at the jail on March 19. But now that the details are known, the questions from a grieving daughter come as no surprise to practitioners of restorative justice. Neither is it an isolated example.        
	Like Priyanka, poet Margot Van Sluytman of Alberta, Canada went to meet her fathers imprisoned killer, braving the disapproval of her relatives. For me, it is my heart and soul that had to see the eyes of the man who saw my Dad last. I wanted to know everything of that moment; and I wanted to know that he knew what he did was horrible, and that he was not only sorry, but in a sense authentic, capable of living with paradox.        
	To be able to face intense personal pain without going insane, one needs to remember and forgive. There is, in every one of us, the need to construct a sense of identity and meaning, embedding and preserving our memories in a narrative structure. Those having to confront violence find this meaning shattered. Transcending the trauma resulting from violence requires a re-creation of such meaning through very powerful metaphors. Those are perhaps what Priyanka was seeking.

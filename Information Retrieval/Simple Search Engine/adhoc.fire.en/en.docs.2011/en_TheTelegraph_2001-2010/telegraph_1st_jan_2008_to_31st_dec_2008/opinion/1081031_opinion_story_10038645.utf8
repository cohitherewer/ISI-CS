	On October 24, the Catholic Bishops Conference of India did something unusual and crass: it chose to make a public spectacle of the monstrous rape and humiliation of Sister Meena Lalita Barwa from Divyajyoti Pastoral Centre in Orissas Kandhamal district on August 25. The nun was a victim of the retributive violence that was triggered by the brutal murder of Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati and three other Hindu monks on the night of Janmashtami. Flanked by professional activists, some of whom have made a living out of painting India in hideous colours, the hapless nun was made to relive her ordeal before the media.        
	For weeks after the assault, the church had taken the nun into its safekeeping and prevented her from deposing before the Orissa police. Despite the arrests of those suspected of the crime, the church was adamant that Sister Meena would only speak to the Central Bureau of Investigation and to none of Orissas law enforcement agencies. Led by a politically combative Archbishop of Cuttack, the church mounted a forceful public campaign to bolster its petition to the Supreme Court demanding the CBI assume charge of criminal investigations. In the backdrop of Western indignation over the sectarian attacks in Kandhamal  the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, had termed it a massacre the church wanted to use the rape to corner the Naveen Patnaik government and provide ammunition to the Congress in the run-up to the assembly election next year. The politicization of the issue was apparent during the Supreme Court hearing when the counsel for the church equated the attackers with the Ku Klux Klan. It is a different matter that the white supremacists of the KKK swore by a variant of Christianity and used a burning cross as its frightening symbol.              
	Unfortunately for the church, the apex court turned down the plea for a CBI inquiry because there was compelling evidence to show that the Orissa government had gone out of its way to apprehend the alleged culprits and guarantee the sensitive handling of the case. The state government even went to the extent of stating its readiness to record the nuns testimony and complete other formalities anywhere in India. Yet, the church chose to follow a pre-rehearsed script and didnt baulk at using the unfortunate rape victim as a pawn in a larger political game. Consequently, Sister Meena was dragged before the cameras and made to demand a CBI investigation that had already been rejected by the highest court. The activists sought to present her as a symbol of Christian persecution. It was, to put it mildly, in colossal bad taste.        
	It is my view that the Catholic Churchs grandstanding over the rape of Sister Meena was not an isolated philistine act. Over the past decade, thanks in no small measure to the generous funding from overseas, the nature of Christianity in India has undergone a significant shift. It has become hostage to fringe elements with political agendas who are increasingly willing to assume confrontational positions, particularly in relation to the majority Hindu community. The main bone of contention is, of course, religious conversions  something that has agitated the country since the early 19th century. However, the conflict has been exacerbated by the internal tensions of Christian denominations.        
	Confronting indigenous faiths and traditions has always been a feature of Christian evangelism in India. Prior to the 1857 uprising (which was, in many ways, also an anti-Christian revolt) foreign missionaries were uninhibited in their denunciation of paganism, idolatry and superstition, which they associated with the Hindu faiths. Although the compulsions of statecraft compelled missionaries to make their activities somewhat less confrontational, Indians from Raja Rammohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda to Mahatma Gandhi were quite forthright in seeing Christian evangelism as offensive, politically inspired and culturally repugnant. Swami Vivekanandas claim in 1899 that every man going out of the Hindu pale is not only a man less, but an enemy the more may have been characteristically robust but Gandhi expressed exactly similar views in 1931: Every nation considers its own faith to be as good as any other. Certainly the great faiths held by the people of India are adequate for her people. India stands in no need of conversion from one faith to another.        
	Hindu objections to conversions were not theological but centred on national identity. Christianity was perceived as an instrument of Westernization and, by implication, the perpetuation of British rule. Yet, ironically, Hindu society accorded greater respect to those upper-caste Hindus who abandoned their ancestral faith for another civilization than they did to those who were dubbed rice Christians. Indeed, for many 19th-century Bengalis who followed Alexander Duff and Krishnamohan Banerji into the church, Christianity was the entry point into European civilization  at least until Hindu society became more accommodating. The most enduring Christian contributions to India, particularly in the field of education, have been made by those institutions that never shied away from linking Christianity with Europe. Particular mention must be made of the English-style public schools that were nominally associated with the Church of England an institution whose simple expression of faith was confined to the singing of wonderful hymns and viewing god as a good chap.        
	The belief that Christianity is rooted in European civilization was by no means an imperialist fantasy. It has powerful contemporary backers. Pope Benedict XVI, for example, is unbudging in his view that both Christianity and the Catholic Church are load-bearing pillars of Western civilization. In an article written when he was still Cardinal Ratzinger, the Pope lamented the Wests self-loathing: The West revealsa hatred of itself, which is strange and can only be considered pathological; in its own history, it now sees only what is deplorable and destructive, while it is no longer able to perceive what is great and pure. He repeated this point in his controversial Regensburg lecture two years ago, which attracted attention for its apparently disparaging comments on Islam. Likewise, Reverend Nazir Ali, the Bishop of Rochester, has flayed the Church of Englands growing detachment from indigenous English culture in its search for multiculturalism.              
	The great respect Christianity commands in the Hindu-dominated Indian establishment owes almost entirely to the post-Independence phase when the church shook off the tag of being a colonial lackey and assumed the role of an extension counter of Western civilization. The upper crust of Hindu India enthusiastically embraced Christian education minus the conversion agenda. Today, in its bid to nativize themselves, various Christian denominations have replaced Christian education with education for Christians. An inward-looking, denominational agenda has overwhelmed the legacy of C.F. Andrews, S.K. Rudra and Jesuit scholarship.        
	In giving prominence to the shrill champions of various forms of liberation theology and intervening vigorously in political life, Indian Christianity has perforce also become hostage to the benevolence of US-based evangelists who combine fanaticism with intolerance. The attack on churches in Mangalore, for example, was triggered by a 19th-century-style publication that launched a vile attack on Hindu deities. One of Octobers suggested prayers of the Southern Baptist Convention was particularly appalling: Pray that those celebrating (Diwali, Dussehra and Navaratri) this year will find little satisfaction, little value in the Gods they worship.        
	Unbridled activism, expedient political alliances and global networking have created new problems for Indias Christians, the bulk of whom are devout, law-abiding and patriotic citizens. The activists are forcing a minority mindset and forcing an agenda of confrontation on a community whose influence and goodwill far exceeded its numerical clout. It is time sensible theologians ousted the dangerous politicians in cassock.

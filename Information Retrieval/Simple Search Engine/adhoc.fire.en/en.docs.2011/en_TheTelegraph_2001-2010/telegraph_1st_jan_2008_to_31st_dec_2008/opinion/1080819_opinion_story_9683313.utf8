	Bad analogy                  
	Sir  Reading the report, Himalayan Singur, minus Mamata (Aug 11), one would be led to believe that the road to the elusive El Dorado has been found, thanks to the Tatas. It would seem that the Tatas, and the Tatas alone, have the key to the door that opens to the land of milk and honey. The report says that 5,000 acres of extremely fertile land, which have traditionally produced paddy, sugarcane, wheat and soya, were taken over by State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Ltd in 2002, out of which 975 acres were handed over to the Tatas for setting up their mini-truck factory. The Tatas invested, and lo and behold, the landscape of Rudrapur was changed forever. Other investors, who, apparently, had been having psychological problems about investing in the area till then, were cured overnight and started pouring billions in Rudrapur.           
	Various state governments who have been striving, with limited success, to attract investment from industrial houses, might take the cue from this news story and hand over pieces of extremely fertile land to the Tatas. Once the Tatas have made the auspicious beginning, all psychological barriers of the potential investors will be broken automatically. The food crisis in the country will vanish. People will ride plush cars on empty stomachs and the Mamata Banerjees will go into exile.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Publishing the story of the economic boom in Rudrapur in Uttarakhand on the frontpage of The Telegraph amounts to a rather pathetic attempt at defending the Tata Motors factory in Singur. The report also seems to be aimed at tilting public opinion in favour of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee brand of industrialization in West Bengal. Except for the fact that the acquired territories both in Singur and Rudrapur were multi-crop, fertile land, nothing else is comparable between the two stories of acquisition. Since the land in Rudrapur belonged to an agricultural university, there was no question of farmers losing their livelihood. Moreover, the Tatas may flaunt the virtues of Nano as the peoples car, but the truth is that if the Nano hits the road, people will be more inconvenienced than benefited. We do no want our already crowded city streets to get more congested with cheap cars that almost anybody can afford. It is important to know that the people of West Bengal are not against industrialization per se, as the report makes them appear. They are against Bhattacharjees chosen means to that end  keeping people in the dark first and then taking away their land without their consent.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report comparing Rudrapur and Singur is unfair. The fact that Sidcul could acquire 5,000 acres of land from the G.B. Pant Agricultural University and give an alternative plot elsewhere, is a pointer to the land situation at a place that is over 400 km away from the state capital, Lucknow. Singur is much closer to Calcutta than Rudrapur is to Lucknow. The report is silent on the number of farmers and landowners affected by the giving away of 975 acres to the Tatas. The agricultural scene in Rudrapur is very different from that in Singur. There has been large-scale migration from Rudrapur in recent years, so it has hardly any household in which an adult male has not migrated for work to other cities. Farming is practised in Rudrapur more or less as a traditional hobby. It is not a life-supporting system there. If Singur were somewhere near, say, Shalboni in Midnapur, its comparison with Rudrapur would have been understandable. Since that is not the case, the parallel falls flat on its face.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Basu, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  The battle for Singur has reached such a stage that it is impossible to say which side is justified in its demands. Mamata Banerjee is leading a group of cheated farmers who claim that their land has been taken away from them forcibly. While the truth of this assertion can be debated, it is also true that the farmers who have given up their lands willingly, or against sufficient compensation, are unlikely to protest. The report, Himalayan Singur, minus Mamata, seems to exhort the people of West Bengal to look upon Rudrapur as Singur without the evil influence of Banerjee. But if the handover was relatively hassle-free in Rudrapur, this owes mainly to the mode of acquisition. Perhaps the government of N.D. Tiwari in Uttarakhand in 2002 was more capable in acquiring land than the one in West Bengal under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

	Fare demand          
	Sir  The railway minister, Lalu Prasad, boasts of keeping railway fares steady. But he has devised hidden ways to increase the revenue. My wife and I are frequent travellers to Delhi. We are both senior citizens, and are entitled to 50 per cent and 30 per cent discounts respectively on train fare. However, under the Tatkal scheme, in which we already pay Rs 300 extra for each ticket, no discount is provided. I fail to understand why: if a person is given special benefits for his old age, why should he be deprived of that while travelling with a Tatkal ticket? We do not buy Tatkal tickets when we get rich, but only when we have an emergency. Just because we are able to pay a high price for the ticket should not be taken to mean that we do not need the senior-citizen concessions.          
	Yours faithfully,

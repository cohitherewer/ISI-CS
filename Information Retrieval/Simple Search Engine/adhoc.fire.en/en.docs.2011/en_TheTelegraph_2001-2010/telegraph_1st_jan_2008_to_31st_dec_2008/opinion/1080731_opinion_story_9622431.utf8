                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WEAK IN THE FLESH                                                                  
	V.V.S. Laxman is just a few months ahead of me in age, but I am sure he feels much older, especially during those times when selectors sit down to choose the Indian cricket team.        
	Few other fields of activity are as obsessed with youth, or as scornful of age, as sports. The moment you enter the world of competitive sports, you have to grapple with the prospect of being called old at 35. This is no exaggeration, as Sourav Ganguly or Rahul Dravid will tell you. Mick Jagger can be an old-age pensioner and still perform Angie to sellout crowds, but sportsmen (including women) have no such luck. Martina Navratilova came closest, happily winning Wimbledon doubles titles at 46. But admit it, you too think she was a freakish exception.        
	For all her Grand Slams, Navratilova never really managed to become a youth icon in the way that her contemporary, Chris Evert, did. Martinas mannish ways and near-flawless tennis got her legions of fans but not the power to shape the taste and cultural preferences of an entire generation. In a similar way, Ian Botham was a youth icon, while Mike Brearley was not, Cristiano Ronaldo or David Beckham are youth icons, but Luis Figo or Gary Linekar were not. Rafael Nadal has a kind of influence over young tennis followers that Roger Federer has not. What I am trying to drive home is that it is easier to accept an ageing Federer or Linekar than an old Nadal or Cristiano Ronaldo.        
	There is another way of looking at the phenomenon of ageing in sports. For many sportsmen, growing old is a condition beyond their control, but growing up is optional. Take for instance, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg. Neither of them won a Grand Slam after they were 26, but McEnroe refused to move on from there. Borg had no problems making the transition. Which is why watching Borg in the VIP box at the French Open mens singles final is pleasanter than listening to McEnroes brash-juvenile commentary of the same match.         
	Sunil Gavaskar, unlike Big Mac, seems to have a calling in commentating and column-writing. He has aged better than Ravi Shastri, though maybe not as well as Kapil Dev, and consequently hasnt had a problem retaining acceptance with Indian cricket fans. The fact that he was never a brat has also helped. Imagine Yuvraj Singh or S. Sreesanth turning 35. Yes, it is rather difficult.         
	What can sportsmen do when the spirit is willing but the flesh  or the selection committee  is weak? The answer is obvious, though only a few care to face it. Given that a sportsmans career these days begins as early as in his teens, after leaving the game (or being politely or not-so-politely asked to do so), the first stop should be school. (Anil Kumble may be excused). Graduation over, life will be a whole new ball game.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

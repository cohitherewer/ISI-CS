	Every classical dance form comprises a rich technique and a strict format designed by great maestros. Yet, this does not rule out the prospect of innovation. The balance between the grammar and imagination of a dance form depends on rigorous training in the classical style. Mahisashur Mardini, a choreographic performance in Kathak at the Kalamandir on April 13, proved this point once again.         
	Presented by Surabhika, the dance-drama was choreographed by Pratap Pawar, whose daughter, Ashavari Pawar, did the research and the scripting. Ashavari, along with the 20 dancers of Kalaasish, Delhi, combined diverse creative styles with the classical style. The inaugural scene, Srishti, depicted the beauty and joy of creation through nature. The sequence, titled Indra Durbar, was also presented elegantly. Based on jhaptaal, the grandeur of Indrasabha was presented through the crisp footwork of the dancers. The entire production incorporated different beats, such as teentaal, dhamar and jhaptaal. The balance between rhythm and verse made the presentation striking. Ashavari, with her elegant stage presence and her powerful performance, proved her mettle. Viswa Prakashs music deserved high praise as well.

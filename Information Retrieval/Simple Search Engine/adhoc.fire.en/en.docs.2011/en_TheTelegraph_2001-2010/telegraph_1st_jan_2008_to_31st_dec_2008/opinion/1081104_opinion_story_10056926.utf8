	I wonder if anybody has written a history of the mike in India. The technology of amplifying sound, especially the human voice, must have a crucial relationship with the rise of a modern democracy. To sound larger and stronger than is naturally possible, and to be heard by huge numbers of people while actually being there among them, are forms of power that have become indispensable to politicians and performers alike. Not just elections, rallies and religious festivals, but every kind of art involving some form of listening has been transformed by the advent of the mike  the purest Hindustani classical, hybrid forms like Rabindrasangeet, as well as folk music and theatre.        
	The joy of going to stay in a village used to be in the quality of the silence. Birdsong, rain, crickets or a distant kirtan on a wintry night needed that preternatural quiet to become the stuff of magic. Yet, mikes and loudspeakers have lodged themselves with a vengeance in Indian villages. From flag-hoisting in the humblest village school to fairground entertainment, being able to afford sound is a mark of status. At fairs, people queue at karaoke stalls to hear their own voices amplified by an echo-mike; to be a sound technician is second only to being a mobile-phone repairer as a fantasy job among the rural youth. So, to be able to shatter, as loudly as possible, the silence so longed for by urban visitors is a matter of great pride to modern villagers.        
	A traditional farming village like Koronjoli in the South 24 Parganas still uses the old word, gajon  the acting out of the stories of Shiva in the month of Chaitra  to refer to the Kali Puja entertainments that take place all night on the bazaar grounds. But the mix of the old gajon, jatra, and Bolly/Tollywood superhit action that was put on all night by the regions most popular company, Adi Joy Ma Kali, also looked to me like a tribute to the mike. The makeshift stage was overhung by a complicated grid of about 20 mikes, the height of each adjustable by remote. This determined the positions that could be taken by the actors as they danced, sang and ranted through the night. So the ingeniousness of the action lay in being able to pack in as much sensation as possible within this confining grid.        
	The overture to the gajon was like a pure celebration of the technology of sound that became surreal under a high sliver of a moon. On the empty stage (that doubled as an immense stall selling vegetables during the day), for about a quarter of an hour, the overhanging welter of mikes took on a bizarre life of their own. They moved up and down at different times and in different speeds, yet perfectly and spookily coordinated with the accompanying music (remix disco with booming beats) and the flashing strobe lights. Suddenly, a dog jumped on to the stage, and started howling (inaudibly, because of the music) at the dancing mikes, leaping up from time to time to snap and paw at them. The thousands huddled around the stage clapped and cheered, but perfectly to the beat. Behind us, with her neons like brilliant wounds in the surrounding darkness, the wild goddess looked far from disapproving.       AVEEK SEN

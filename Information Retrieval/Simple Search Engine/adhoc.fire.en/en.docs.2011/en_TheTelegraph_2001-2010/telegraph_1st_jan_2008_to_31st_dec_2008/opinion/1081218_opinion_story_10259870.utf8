	Sound sleep                  
	Sir  It was good to know that the Supreme Court has acknowledged a citizens right to silence and sleep while banning musical soires at Mumbais Rang Bhavan (Right to sleep wins over right to swing, Dec 8). Such legal bindings are necessary, but in India, it is all too easy to get around laws. There is already a ban on playing loudspeakers between 10.30 pm and 6 am. However, everyone can see how the rulebook goes for a toss during the festive seasons. The authorities (the police, to be precise) suddenly become indulgent (on being paid bribes, of course) towards organizers of cultural programmes in residential areas. But the apex courts statement, referring to mans biological necessity of unperturbed sleep, has stood the legal check on noise pollution on firmer ground. The appeal to public conscience to not disturb the aged and the ill has hitherto remained unheeded. One hopes that the new emphasis on a biological necessity, not just of the sick and the old but of everyone, will make the restrictions on sound pollution more effective.          
	But while the menace is treated seriously in big metros, with courts giving verdicts against it and the police arresting delinquents for burning illegal crackers during Diwali, the small towns still seem to remain outside the purview of the regulations. Here, even the silence zones, around schools and hospitals, are not spared. Sometimes, the institutions falling in silence zones themselves flout the decibel limit. For instance, there is a college in the vicinity of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. Every year, the academic institution organizes cultural programmes that continue past midnight. Blaring horns of hundreds of motorcycles, and the boom of loudspeakers make life difficult for the patients admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital. Boards with messages like No horn or Please maintain silence are put up all around the place, but to little avail. Recklessly driven, honking cars on either side of the BMCH compound are common sights. If the municipalities of small towns are given the power and the responsibility to bring noise-makers to book, the Supreme Courts concern for the citizens right to peaceful sleep would hold some meaning.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The Supreme Courts observation that sleep, rest and silence are biological needs is a simple truth that many have failed to perceive. With the standard of living of the urban population on the rise, the sources of sound pollution have also multiplied in all major Indian cities. A number of eateries, nightclubs and shopping malls have sprung up in residential areas that remain open till late night. The noisy crowds visiting these places disturb the sick and the aged in the vicinity. Students, too, are distracted by the loud music played at these posh venues throughout the day. When will the Calcutta Municipal Corporation stop giving permission to set up such establishments in residential areas?          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	For the umpteenth time          
	Sir  The Indian Railways reservation enquiry helpline, 139, offers more inconvenience than help. But that is because the helpline tries to help in more ways than it is required to do or is technically able to handle. In the beginning is a long welcome message, followed by advertisements of Hindi films and TV programmes. All this is a test of patience for the caller, who is waiting with some urgent query. The instructions come next. But after the caller is made to hear the long list of buttons to press, and does as instructed, all he gets to hear most of the times is that the particular bit of information he asked for is not available.           
	Also, callers are given a choice at the beginning of communicating in English, Hindi or Bengali, but often, even after they have opted for Bengali or English, the interactive system gives them messages only in Hindi. It is also common for the call to get disconnected which means that caller has to start all over from the welcome message. Indian Railways should try to upgrade its technology to provide its customers with what they really ask for on the helpline.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  Owing to the ridiculous generosity of Indian Railways, a few trains were introduced about a year ago to facilitate transport between the Dum Dum Cantonment station and Dum Dum Airport. Now there are six trains plying everyday on this route, though with a handful of passengers. However, much to the inconvenience of commuters who travel by cars or buses, the frequent passing of trains at peak hours requires the level crossings to be blocked for ordinary vehicles. There are some schools and hospitals in the vicinity, and the blocked level crossings delay office-goers, patients and students. The railways authority should do away with the trains that are of use to only a small section of the people.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Big Brother bashing          
	Sir  K.P. Nayars article, An unusual wedding (Dec 10), on Venezuela does not give an objective analysis of the countrys political scenario. It is simply full of emotive statements against the United States of America. It does not mention that Venezuela spews venom at the US at the drop of a hat. Nayar is all praise for Venezuelas diplomacy because the country supplies cheap heating fuel to the American poor through Citgo, a government-owned company. There is no doubt that this is exemplary action on the part of the government of Venezuela, but Nayar should also have told his readers that Citgo supplies only 25 million gallons out of its total refining of 1.1 million barrels per day to the US, where it has 6 refineries manned by American experts to purge its sulphurous crude. Without this facility, Venezuelan oil would have had no value.           
	The author has bashed George W. Bush for his denunciation of Hugo Chvezs human rights record but forgotten to mention again that it was the Bush government which fed a lot of Venezuelans by providing almost a third of Venezuelas total food imports. Nayar has also, deliberately or otherwise, overlooked Chvezs failures in various spheres. Since 1999, the production of Venezuelas oil, its main export commodity, has dwindled from about 3 million to 1.5 million barrels per day.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Erratum          
	In Foibles of historians by Ashok V. Desai (Dec 16), it has been implied that Humayun was Aurangzebs father. The latter was the son of Shahjehan. The error is regretted.  The Editor

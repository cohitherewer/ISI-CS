The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Message From The HIlls
                                                                                                                 MESSAGE FROM THE HILLS                                  Anuradha Sharma                              
	You cannot fool all the people all the time. Lincolns utterance could not ring truer in Darjeeling at present. But Subash Ghisingh does not give two hoots for it. He would have, had he and the state government considered the people of Darjeeling little more than a flock of sheep. In fact, Ghisingh would then have spared himself the blatant ignominy of his fast-paced, dramatic downfall.         
	O... kichhu na! a senior minister of the state had brushed aside journalists questions on what the government thought of hill opposition after his party was forced to change the venue of its district conference from Darjeeling to Siliguri following the agitation in November last year. Elaborating on the herd mentality of the people he even said: It is like the story of jewellery shop owners  one of them names his shop Lakshmi Narayan Ka Sona Chandi Ki Dukan, it does well, and all others do the same.... It (hill opposition) is just a temporary phenomenon... Once the Sixth Schedule is in place, people will think of nothing else! ... Bimal Gurung, who?         
	The government went wrong on two counts. It is not surprising why it had relied on Ghisingh so much. It had trusted him to mind his people, a calculation that went wrong. Worse, it assumed the peoples quiet surrender to Ghisinghs whims as a reflection of their herd mentality.         
	True, the people in the past 20 years never questioned Ghisingh. He said dont vote and people locked themselves up in their rooms on election days. He said vote for the Congress at the nick of the hour, and his people put all their might in electing Dawa Narbula to parliament. Ghisingh declared, rather embarrassingly, that Darjeeling should be given to Bihar, if not Bangladesh, and the people nodded without question. They watched silently as the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and the panchayati system were rendered defunct. And they dared not question where the money from the government went. They put up with the water crisis, unemployment, and so on.                 
	Strength to strength        
	What developed later as a fear psychosis was initially unquestioning faith and a sense of gratitude for instilling the germs of nationalism among the hill people. It took no time for people to realise how horribly they had gone wrong. The sense of betrayal took time to sink in, and even after it did, it did not immediately translate into opposition because of the fear of Ghisinghs muscle power.         
	It is not a surprise that Bimal Gurung, with his Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, has succeeded in turning the tables on Ghisingh completely within just five months of its formation. Until six months back, this was an impossibility. Now, they have been able to stall the Sixth Schedule bill and face up to Ghisingh. It would be too simplistic to give the entire credit to Gurung and his party. While it is true that Gurung gave the clarion call, what is remarkable is that the people are out on the streets propelled by their own conscience; their own desire to bring about change. Having shattered the myth of Ghisinghs invincibility, Gurung  Ghisinghs trusted lieutenant once  has made people realize their strength. If they could do this to Ghisingh, they could do it to anyone!         
	Which is why the state government needs to introspect some more. It is not a mere coincidence that three separatist movements  in Kamtapur, Greater Cooch Behar and Gorkhaland  are going on in the same region. In Darjeeling, they have Ghisingh to take the blame; but what about the rest of north Bengal? Despite its secular claims, the government is openly biased against the minority. It may have hundred reasons for not allowing the formation of Gorkhaland, but what has it done in the last 20 years other than keeping the self-styled demigod Ghisingh in good humour?

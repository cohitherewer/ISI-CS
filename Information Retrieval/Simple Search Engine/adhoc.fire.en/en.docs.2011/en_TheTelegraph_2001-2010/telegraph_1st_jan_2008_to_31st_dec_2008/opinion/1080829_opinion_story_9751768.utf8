	Finishing line                  
	Sir  The Beijing Olympics will go down in history not only as the event that put China on the global stage, but also as Indias coming-of-age in world sports (China looks at life beyond Games, Aug 26). Abhinav Bindras gold has been a welcome change in a nation that has little regard for any other sport than cricket. Hopefully, Bindras performance will not only inspire other shooters like him but also pull out of obscurity players pursuing unpopular games. The most important lesson from this Olympics has been for the media. The media should realize that the question of national prestige does not begin and end with cricket. There are others, playing the so-called less glamorous games, who deserve attention and applause.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  Among other things, this Olympic Games gave viewers the unforgettable spectacle of the opening ceremony. But the march-past was riddled with oddities. First, it was difficult to comprehend the sequence in which the participating nations appeared. As per tradition, Greece, being the country where the Olympics began, appeared first, but what followed thereafter seemed quite arbitrary. Even more intriguing was the way in which the participants walked by holding digital cameras and speaking into their cell-phones as if they were tourists having a jolly time. Indians must have felt especially ashamed when Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who was our flag-bearer, continued chatting into his mobile phone even as he held the national flag in the other hand. As an armyman, he should have shown better discretion and not undermined the serious responsibility that had been bestowed on him.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The world had seldom witnessed an extravaganza as grand as the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics at the Birds Nest Stadium in Beijing. But, instead of acknowledging Chinas achievement, the Western press continued to harp on the countrys failures self-righteously. Had the United States of America hosted the Olympics, it is unlikely that a similar outcry over human-rights violations would have been raised. For obvious reasons, the West chooses to be in denial of its own drawbacks, while condemning atrocities perpetrated in other parts of the world.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Debesh Majumdar, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Although many heads of State participated in the inauguration of the Beijing Olympics, it is unfortunate that neither the president nor the prime minister of India could be present at the historic occasion, choosing to make way for the First Family of Indian politics instead.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

      
	Sir  If the sterling performances by Abhinav Bindra, Vijender Kumar and Sushil Kumar were the high points for India at the Beijing Olympics, then the sight of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore engrossed with his mobile phone at the opening ceremony was the real low. Representing a country of a billion people before the world with such disrespect to the national flag and undermining the gravity of the occasion should be treated as a serious offence.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dipak Datta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Abhinav Bindra has shattered the myth that Indians can never win gold medals at individual events in the Olympics. It is time that corporate houses show more interest towards needy sports persons and provide them with adequate training so that they too can bring glory to our nation. Given the murky politics of different government bodies looking after sports in India, we can only trust disinterested parties with the task of providing impartial and unconditional support to talented but underprivileged athletes. Not every sporting talent hails from a wealthy family like the Bindras.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Raj Bagri, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Abhinav Bindra made us proud not only because of his Olympic gold but also because he gave us a reason to celebrate a sporting feat that has nothing to do with cricket. The government is likely to forget Bindras achievement in a hurry and move on to whatever feats Dhoni and his men are up to very soon. Sports authorities would only have to look beyond cricket or football to discover the hidden talents that lie in every corner of the country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I was shocked to read about the fiasco over the two Chinese girls at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics (The girl with crooked teeth, Aug 21). Yang Peiyi, who sang the song, was barred from appearing as the authorities did not find her cute enough. One can only imagine the trauma the little girl underwent, however much the authorities may deny it. This revelation has blighted the splendour of the opening ceremony. There can be nothing grand about a nation that perpetuates discrimination to come across as flawless.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Paramita Mukherjee, Calcutta

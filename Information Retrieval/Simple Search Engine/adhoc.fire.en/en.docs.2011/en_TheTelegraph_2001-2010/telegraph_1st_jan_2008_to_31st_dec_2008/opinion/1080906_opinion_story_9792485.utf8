	The Old Masters, as W.H. Auden said wisely, were never wrong. Intelligent gallerists have their own ways of making sense of the Masters. They know that nothing would ever go wrong if they put themselves in their hands. Great names are the safest bet in this fiercely competitive market  especially when it comes to organizing exhibitions. A random selection of the works of some of the most distinguished modern Indian artists can be put into a room with no rhyme or reason  and yet viewers would be profoundly affected by their brilliance.         
	This is what I realized after visiting two exhibitions dedicated to the Masters. Confronting Masters at Gallery Kanishkas (June 27-July 30) featured works by artists from Bengal  with Ram Kumar and Amit Ambalal being two pleasant exceptions  while Masters of Bengal at Chitrakoot Art Gallery (July 25-August 8) focused on printmakers.        
	Kanishkas had chosen a rather audacious title for its pedestrian ensemble. There was hardly much to confront, other than a leaden dreariness, in such an unimaginative selection. Amit Ambalals portrait of three albino-like men doing a jig against a peach-red wall is startling, but falls pitifully short of a masterpiece. Ganesh Halois pastoral inscape is enchanting as ever, while the crawling, sombre colours on Ram Kumars acrylic are arresting. Rabin Mondals pen-and-ink drawing is highly influenced by Partha Pratim Deb, though not half as amusing. Paritosh Sens charcoal drawing of an urban beauty harks back to a phase in his career he has now outgrown  and would perhaps rather not revive. Ganesh Pynes sketches and scribbles appear as if on a page torn from his scrapbook. It is likely that this work  if it could be called one  was not intended as art worth putting on public display.         
	Kartick Pynes watercolour, depicting mysteriously hooded creatures carrying pitchers, is remarkable for its subtle modulation of gentle pastel shades (picture top), but his images of baby Krishna, in contrast, look amateurish. Shyamal Dutta Rays seascape appears studied, to the extent of being contrived.                  
	The elaborate, if somewhat cluttered, exhibition of prints at Chitrakoot was more discerning in its selection. However, there was a conspicuous absence of curating  not a single caption anywhere, never a word about the medium used, or about the date and dimensions of the compositions. For some strange reason, images by the same artist were not shown together. Somnath Hores figurative works  the smell of life and death mingling in the earthy red and mossy tints  were placed on far ends of the same room, with a few random samples from the Wounds series thrown in between.        
	Nandalal Boses floral motif (picture bottom) is exceptional for its tonal clarity and symmetrical beauty. But next to Sanat Kars inky blue intaglio, it looks quaintly pretty and somewhat clueless. Suhas Roys spectral bird against the setting sun comes out of the enchanted world of fairy tales  reminding us most vividly of byangama-byangami from the illustrations of Thakumar Jhuli. A geometric precision and perfect control of tone make Lalu Prasad Shaws prints more distinctive than his paintings. K.G. Subramanyans decadent couple enjoys a merry horse ride, while Durga and her lion seem to have been carved out of shadows. Dharamanarayan Dasguptas drunken man turning a somersault or a hideously green lady hiding her nakedness are in the humoresque tradition of the lascivious Kalighat patas.        
	Chittoprasad, Ramendra Nath Chakraborty, Jagadish Roy and Haren Das depict the pastoral beauty of rustic life in the context of rural festivals, poverty and ways of being. Given their emphasis on realism, all of them are forced to seek out complex colours  a challenge for any printmaker, who has access to a limited number of tones. Among this lot, Das teases out delicate shades from the most basic colours. The villagers gathered to watch a jatra are encapsulated in a green halo, a grocers shop is illuminated by a flickering light and the boatmen fading into the looming darkness  each of them stunning in its clarity and depth.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TO FLY WITHOUT WINGS                                   Fifth Column -Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	Suddenly, the days of scary flights have reappeared as if from nowhere. First, a fatigued flier of an Indian carrier had to be grounded, albeit temporarily. Soon, he was ready to resume his duties, his brazen manner intact. Why brazen, one might wonder? Well, this author, along with other passengers, was a witness to his brash conduct during a trip from Delhi to Jammu recently.         
	The flight was first delayed by the ground staff, and, subsequently, by the air traffic controllers in Delhis over-crowded airport. In between came the faux pas by the pilot in command.        
	Blissfully unaware that one passenger was officially supervising the loading of sensitive cargo meant for Indias northern-most state, the captain shut the door, made the cabin crew announce the dos and donts and ordered the engines to be revved up. All of a sudden, the mobile stair case was re-positioned, the front door unlocked and a small, frail man allowed to enter under the glare of shocked passengers.                
	Courage under fire        
	The pilot had allowed the security drill of the blue book to be broken without a care. All this after the other passengers were searched and made to stand in long queues and their movements monitored through high-tech gadgets. What would have happened had the late entrant been a gun-totting terrorist? After all, the flight was headed for Jammu.        
	Now lets move on to the incident in which an Air Mauritius airbus was bird hit in Delhi airport. While the avians cannot be faulted for intruding, surely the lack of concern for air-safety among the authorities boggles the mind. Passengers too are no different. What else can explain scores of air passengers talking on their cell phones and defying other cabin rules?        
	Contrastingly, a Qantas Boeing 747-400 took off from Hong Kong and made an emergency landing at Manila in a battered state, with a gaping hole in its fuselage in the cargo compartment, which was near the right wing and the third engine. A Boeing 747-400 could easily weigh between 360 and 400 tonnes in air. The aircrafts speed could go up from Mach .80 to Mach .85, and the flight level too could vary between 29,000-39,000 feet. It must have taken a lot of skill and cool courage on the part of the pilots to control and steer an aircraft with a badly damaged fuselage. They did a tremendous job and managed to rescue the passengers from certain death. Their exemplary conduct goes to show the true import of notions such as discipline, dedication, strength of character and professionalism.                
	Different times        
	There was a time when gentlemen pilots joined the profession out of their love for flying. Before the early Nineties, there were hardly any suitable employment avenues for pilots in the country as supply outstripped demand, thereby creating a pool of unemployed pilots in the market.         
	Today, the times have changed. One often finds youngsters taking to flying for the sake of the riches that this lucrative career offers. For these few young men, rules and regulations, flight safety and passenger security are of secondary, and not primary, importance.         
	Worse, these men have little respect for the instructors, inspectors and examiners of the director general of civil aviation. They seem to be of the view that these men can be shrugged off with the help of their audacious behaviour and disrespectful attitudes. Indian aviation cannot think of soaring to great heights, so long as its enfants terribles are left in charge of things in the sky. In aviation, there are no runners up, only the champions survive to fly another day. Perhaps the Qantas pilots showed us the right path.

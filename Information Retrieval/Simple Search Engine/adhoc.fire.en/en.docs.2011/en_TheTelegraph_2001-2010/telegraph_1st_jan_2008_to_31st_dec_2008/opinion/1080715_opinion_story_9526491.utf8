	Money matters                  
	Sir Ashok Mitra, in The loaded fiscal game (July 4), suggests that the government in New Delhi diligently follows the rules laid down by the Washington Consensus on monetary matters and that the recent hike in petroleum prices has only augmented the Central coffers. In saying this, Mitra has ignored the fact that the Central reserves had been rapidly diminishing because of the subsidy granted by the government on diesel and petrol. Since a considerable portion of the government revenue was being diverted to subsidies, it could not effectively be utilized in the development of the countrys infrastructure. The main culprit behind the policy of subsidies is the Left Front. Thanks to the continuous threats from the Left, the United Progressive Alliance government could not, following global trends, raise petroleum prices gradually over four years. The government was compelled to bring in the hike only last month when increasing market pressure left it with no other option. If instead of following the Washington line, the Centre had followed Prakash Karats line further on, the country would have been ruined.           
	The hike has in no way augmented the Union governments financial position, as Mitra hints. But it has done some justice to the neo-liberal system of governance. And as far as the plight of the poor is concerned, it is not the Centre that is to be blamed for this but the incapable state governments, especially the one in West Bengal that has ensured that the impoverished class remains so forever. Our despotic state government actually loots the poor of their dues to fatten its own pocket. The Centre is aware of these evils, but is unable to react because it is constantly held at ransom by the intricacies of coalition politics.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir Ashok Mitra brilliantly summarizes in his article the fiscal games being played by the government to rob the poor of the little they have. Although crores of rupees are sanctioned for projects intended for the welfare of the rural poor, none of it reaches the target group. The money is eaten up by rich political leaders and middle-men who get even richer while the poor continue to languish in the hell that is much of rural India. Nowadays one pays Rs 6,000 or more for a pair of shoes from shops in the glitzy malls. This unfortunately is the reality in a country the majority of whose people starve every other day. But perhaps one should stop being surprised. After all, it is a well-known fact that the government, whether at the Centre or in the state, is eager only to enlist the support of the nouveau riche. Hence it will heavily subsidize petrol and diesel for the handful of these people and turn a deaf ear to the cries of the poor.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir It is not true, as Ashok Mitra alleges, that the Central government is kowtowing to the United States of America sacrificing the interests of our country. If almost all the 185 members of the International Monetary Fund follow the free economy policy of the US, then there is no reason to doubt the merit of the American fiscal policy. Even the communist government of West Bengal is inviting multinational companies to invest in the state. This, and the lack of public-sector industries in West Bengal, prove that the communists too are now convinced of the efficacy of the American policy of free enterprise. This change was bound to happen, since the command economy favoured by the communists has proved to be an utter failure, as proved by the low rate of the gross domestic product in countries following that model. In this scenario, it is unfair to call India a stooge of the US simply because it has chosen to follow the economic policies of the latter. If India is so labelled, then all the members of the IMF  countries like Japan, Germany, France, England, Sweden  must be said to have mortgaged their freedom to the US.

	Unsafe deposit          
	Sir Recently, more than a hundred people in the Durgapur-Asansol area have been victims of a cyber-fraud that has caused them to lose considerable amounts of money. I am one of them. Having lodged an FIR with the police, I would like to share my experience so that others do not fall into the trap.           
	I have been holding an account with Axis Bank for the last two years. On June 1, I received a message from the bank requesting me to check my account through a given link. I made the mistake of clicking on that link. I found after four days that Rs 40, 000 has been debited from my account. I complained to the bank, which said that the loss was entirely my fault.           
	People who have accounts with Axis Bank know that here it takes two passwords for transferring funds  a login password and a transaction password. It is true that I had given away my login password unknowingly to the fraudster by signing into my account. But I have no idea how he got hold of my transaction password as well.           
	When I asked the bank manager about this, he said that both passwords are usually the same because the bank assigns the same digits for both. But after I had received a sealed envelope from the bank containing a letter that gave me the two passwords, I had changed my login password and had never touched the other. So how can they remain the same? If we look closely into the facts regarding this case, it would be evident that the hacker is an insider of the bank. Even if this is not true, isnt the bank expected to be more vigilant in protecting the interests of its clients?           
	Yours faithfully,      
R.K. Singh, Durgapur

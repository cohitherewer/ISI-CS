	Is a fragile truce better than no truce? Is the peace of the graveyard better than war? One may not have to wait too long for an answer. The agreement extraordinaire between a reformed Stalinist and an unreconstructed populist allows West Bengal seven days. Hitherto a week was assumed to be a long time in politics  even God took only six days to complete creation. Obviously, a chief minister who coined the slogan, Do it now, has time to spare. Or does he? It has not taken Mamata Banerjee the passage of even a night to return to her self. Back from Raj Bhavan at the site of the dharna, she pronounced majestically that 300 acres from the Tata land will be returned. The last has not been heard about the historic (mis)understanding between the state government and the Trinamul leader. But nobody should grudge the Bengalis their right to confuse between strategy and tactics. The truce has ensured that the Durgapur Expressway is now opened to traffic. One would be forgiven for assuming that the dharna was about opening a manufacturing plant  a not-too-common phenomenon considering the fact that this was perhaps only the fourth occasion in 60 years that more than Rs 1,000 crore has been invested in West Bengal. The Tatas have been polite in their expression of dissatisfaction. They need not have been. What West Bengal needs to hear is the stark truth. While the expressway has been cleared, the path for the Nano remains littered with revolutionary possibility. To begin: Ms Banerjee has merely postponed the agitation.She has not called it off. There is no guarantee that the four-member committee will come to a decision and in time. What happens if there is no consensus? Or if the committee thinks that the Tatas need to return an acre or two? Will the Tatas stay or accept in retrospect the rather amusing suggestion from the governor and downsize their operation? Never since the heady days of Mao Zedongs Great Leap Forward has so much rubbish been heaped upon enterprise.        
	If the truce has failed to address the main issue affecting Singur, it was successful in bringing to the fore other matters. It was extraordinary that on Sunday, the chief minister of the state and the principal opposition leader met for the first time. This is a sad comment on the plight of democracy in the state and on the predominance of emotions in West Bengal. In the state, demonstrations take precedence over discussions, decibels over debate. Thus while the dharna was on, no one suggested that an emergency session of the Vidhan Sabha be called to discuss the crisis. It took the initiative of the governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, to bring the Communist Party of India (Marxist), to negotiate with the Opposition that it had ridden roughshod over for more than three decades. This experience at the discussion table, however limited its success, should bring home to the CPI(M), the Opposition and to the people of West Bengal, the importance of cooperation and consensus, and the ultimate futility of muscle-power.        
	What is very sad, of course, is that it took a jolt from the Tatas to make everyone sit up and think of West Bengals future. Even then, what was saved were the faces of politicians, not that of West Bengal. There are many issues  education comes readily to mind  that the CPI(M) is not willing to even open up for discussion. This attitude has its counterpart in the Oppositions propensity to take to the streets to resolve differences. If this situation continues, West Bengal will remain in the penumbra of darkness, Singur or no Singur. Perhaps West Bengal deserves it.

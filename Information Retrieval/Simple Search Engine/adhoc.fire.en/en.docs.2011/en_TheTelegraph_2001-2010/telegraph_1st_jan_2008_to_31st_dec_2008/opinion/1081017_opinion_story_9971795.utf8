	A Most Wanted Man By John le Carr, 
  Hodder amp; Stoughton, Rs 275        
	When does a living writer become a classic? One would have to say that it is when his work becomes instantly recognizable; that is, when it reminds you of itself. John Le Carrs latest book, A Most Wanted Man, contains everything that has made its author one of the most important witnesses to our historical time. But it does so, unmistakably, in the literary mode of repetition, and in doing so, it establishes the authors classic status at the same time as it invites us to reflect on historys self-repetition as tragic farce.        
	Le Carrs novel is set in the German port city of Hamburg, where, as everyone now knows, Muhammad Atta and his confederates established the sleeper cell, which carried out the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Atta lived in Marienstrasse 54, a faceless, anonymous building that silently ignores its present notoriety. It is territory le Carr knows well; he had a diplomatic posting in Hamburg in the 1960s, and is reported to have actually been in the city on the day of the WTC assault. Though The Constant Gardener, without a spy in it and set all over the world, is probably his best book in recent years, Europe is what le Carr does best. If Smiley and his world, the world of Cold War Europe, are gone, they have been replaced by another, messier, hotter war, George Bushs War on Terror, a war that does not know who its enemies are but like terror itself  is prepared to make the whole world its victim.        
	Post-9/11, Hamburg and its immigrant communities are under the eye of the worlds intelligence networks, each more anxious than the other to make up for the lapses of the past, but uneasily conscious that the classic principles of espionage no longer apply. The rules of the game have changed or been abandoned. No one is more aware of this than the ferociously intelligent and resourceful Gnther Bachmann, representing the joint steering committee of German intelligence, recognizably a Smiley figure, though reduced and simplified. His attention is focused on Issa, a Muslim Chechen refugee who has arrived illegally in Hamburg after torture and imprisonment in successive jails in Russia and Turkey, apparently with the intention of claiming his inheritance. The keeper of this inheritance is a Scottish banker called Tommy Brue, whose bank, Brue Frres, has a number of secret accounts created during the Cold War for the purpose of laundering the ill-gotten gains of top KGB officers. One of them, Colonel Grigori Karpov, was Issas father. Issa, painfully thin, unwell, unbalanced by the experience of torture, philosophically precise and morally determined, decides to repudiate his father and his legacy, be a good Muslim, and train as a doctor. He is supported by a young, idealistic female lawyer, Annabel Richter, and by Brue who falls in love with her.        
	But others too, like Gnther Bachmann, are interested in Issa: most importantly, the British who recruited Brues father, and the Americans who see him as no more than a terrorist. Bachmann wants to use Issa to turn a moderate Muslim cleric who may be financing terror operations worldwide, but his rivals have other ideas. As the novel progresses towards inevitable disaster, in the mood of strong pessimism that is le Carrs most characteristic moral habit, we are invited to exercise our own ethical principles in hostile terrain. The symbolic centre of le Carrs meditation is the illegal immigrant Issa, victim of torture and state terror, a figure like Dostoyevskys Prince Mishkin in The Idiot and cousin to the Musselman in Primo Levis Survival in Auschwitz, at once holy and untouchable. Like Mishkin, he inspires love, le Carrs most recurrent fictional subject. Nave, impulsive, frank, he is at the same time reticent and mysterious. His lawyer, Annabel Richter, who loves him, fights for his legal rights, but rapidly learns to function as an agent managing a prize catch for her intelligence handler, Bachmann. Issas situation  stateless, homeless, without secure identity, yet heir to the riches of the earth serves to exemplify the impossibility of contemporary politics. Like Kristevas foreigner, stranger, refugee, he is the hidden face of our identity.         
	Polemical, insistently contemporary, very much a novel of its time, le Carrs book is nevertheless an intricate patchwork of the past  the classic past, rather than forgettable recent work like his Chechnya novel, Our Game (1995). Karpovs disobedient, tormented son parallels Karlas delinquent daughter in Smileys People (1980), the instrument of a classic espionage exercise where Smiley reels Karla in, drawn on an invisible thread of love. The denouement to that novel, where Smiley wins, but is left holding the bait as the fish is snatched away by a bigger predator, is repeated, we may recall, from the second novel in the Karla Trilogy, The Honourable Schoolboy (1977), where the Americans snatch Nelson Ko away from his brother and the agent who has handled his surrender, Jerry Westerby. And Jerry Westerby himself, together with countless others, is like the good-hearted, honourable Tommy Brue, a classic British failure at love, marriage, parenthood, yet possessed of an enormous capacity for loyalty and, indeed, love. Terrorism, too, has figured earlier in le Carrs fiction, in the complicated, perhaps over-long, study of dependence and betrayal in The Little Drummer Girl (1983), whose heroine, Charlie, is not unrelated to Annabel Richter.         
	These repetitions are neither accidental nor deliberate. They are connected to what constitutes the irreducible core of le Carrs fiction, those themes of goodness, betrayal and, above all, love that have made him a baroque, postmodern heir to Graham Greenes minimalist, modernist legacy. Greene said, borrowing a phrase from Browning, that his interest was in the dangerous edge of things  the honest thief, the tender murderer. Le Carrs world has toppled over entirely into a time populated by thieves and murderers, with no saving moral virtues. Ranged against them is a motley collection of code-bound professionals, slightly-worn idealists and impossible saints. The struggle between the two, worked out in labyrinthine plots employing an extensive repertoire of minor characters and a baffling but addictive linguistic code, has kept us engrossed since he burst on the literary scene with Call for the Dead (1961). But another, more important aspect of Greenes legacy is the sustained political commitment and passion of the writing. If Philbys shadow falls over the Cold War fiction of both writers (Le Carr has recently said that he was tempted to defect), America, as global bully, haunts and oppresses the imaginations of both. A Most Wanted Man brilliantly recaptures the complexity and urgency of le Carrs best work, even if we feel we have read it before.                    SUPRIYA CHAUDHURI

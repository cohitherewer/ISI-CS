	Broken temples and wise yogis                  
	Demolishing Myths or Mosques and Temples? Readings on History and Temple Desecration in Medieval India (Three Essays, Rs 225), edited by Sunil Kumar brings together the views of some of the best minds in the discipline of history on the complex and contemporary issue of temple desecration in India. The scholarly essays focus on the central theme  that of temple desecration  and seem to indicate that the historians craft is a double edged sword: it can illuminate the past but is also often subverted to meet disparaging goals. Through their impeccable research, the contributors have unearthed some disquieting facts: Richard H. Davis studies the pillaging of temples by Hindu Rajas, Romila Thapar examines the various accounts of the destruction of Somnath to show that its claim of being a pivotal religious centre is deeply flawed. The other two contributions, Richard Eaton and Finbarr B. Flood, together offer a nuanced understanding of this phenomenon by maintaining their distance from the simplistic causal model of random and fanatic Muslim iconoclasm. This book is of critical importance as it serves the purpose of debunking the mischievous ideas propagated by the Hindu Right in the stream of public consciousness.                        
	The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought (Aakar, Rs 225) by Cornel West reinterprets Marxism in a new light by showing that ethics were an integral aspect in the development of Marxs own thinking career. West also makes a revolutionary claim that this fact was obfuscated by the likes of Engels, Kautsky, Lukcs, among others, who limited Marxist thinking to indices such as positivism, economism and Hegelianism. No understanding of Marxist theory, West argues, is complete unless this body of work is seen in a holistic perspective that includes values such as democracy and individualism. Wests language may put off the not-too-academically minded but the manner in which he links his personal observations to the predicaments of a modern, capitalist society such as the one in the US is innovative and refreshing.                              
	he Mystic Eye: Vision of the beyond (Jaico, Rs 250) by Sadhguru traverses the hackneyed universe of a new- age mystic and his views on enlightenment, liberation, afterlife and energy forms such as the Dhyanalinga, among other esorteric things. The content has been organized in the form of a seemingly endless conversation between the seeker and the visionary yogi. All kinds of profound truths tumble out as a result of this dialogue, supposedly quenching the thirst for knowledge of his ever burgeoning flock.                                        
	A town called Dehra (Penguin, Rs 200) by Ruskin Bond has been aptly described as a celebration of a dearly loved town as well as an elegy for a way of life gone extinct. Ruskin Bond takes the readers back to his favourite terrain: a sleepy, charming locale filled with a fragile beauty, and full of quirky contraptions, such as the pony-drawn tongas, and eccentric, irrepressible characters. Bonds stories and poems are as much as for children and adults for while they are an ode to the joys of childhood, these tales also serve as a reminder that such innocence and happiness, much like the quaint charms of this town, seldom last forever: A garden towns become a city/ And the people faceless/ As they pass or rather rush/ Hell-bent/ From place of work/ To crowded tenement.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TREATING THEM RIGHT                              The Paramedical and Physiotherapy Central Councils Bill has many provisions that irk professionals in the field. V. Kumara Swamy finds out why                        Remedial rubdown: Tennis ace Roger Federer being treated by his physiotherapist				                                 
	When the government mooted the Paramedical and Physiotherapy Central Councils Bill late last year, many physiotherapists, occupational therapists (OTs) and others were upset that its wording seemed to make them subordinate to medical professionals.        
	In its report on the bill in October this year, the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare recommended that the offending phrase be removed. Practitioners in the field have taken exception to the way the bill defines physiotherapy  as a medically directed therapy through physical agents, including heat, cold, light, water, massage, electricity or manual exercises to persons with the aim of preventing or correcting any disability and includes occupational therapy.        
	The government may or may not accept the recommendation, but the bill, if passed into a law, does promise to clarify the occupational status of physiotherapists and others, and specify uniform standards of education in these disciplines.        
	The offending phrase, say physiotherapists, is medically directed. We would rather not have the law than have these two words in the definition of our professions, says Jayanta Kumar Biswas, professor of physiotherapy, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education amp; Research (SSKM Hospital), Calcutta. To tell us that we are subordinates of doctors is a humiliation and we will not accept it, he says.        
	Currently, many physiotherapists and OTs treat patients directly. We graduate after studying for four-and-a-half years  the same as any medical practitioner  and we demand the same respect. A doctor hardly knows anything about OT or physiotherapy. How can he refer patients to us, asks Dr Anil K. Srivastava, president, All India Occupational Therapists Association.        
	Doctors, on their part, feel that a big issue is being made of a trivial matter, and that patients are often referred to physiotherapists and others by medical practitioners. There is nothing wrong with a patient being referred to a qualified professional by a doctor. An OT or a physiotherapist cannot be the first contact person. They may not diagnose the problem correctly, says R.N. Haldar, professor and head, PMR Calcutta National Medical College, Calcutta.        
	In fact, medical professionals, led by organisations such as the Indian Medical Association, the Medical Council of India (MCI) and the Indian Association of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation have specifically asked for the retention of the words in the bill.        
	The dispute over the two words got so contentious that the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare that looked into the bill spent most of its time debating this point alone.         
	Finally, though, the standing committee decided to rule in favour of the physiotherapist lobby. We felt that this provision was siding with the doctors. There is enough evidence worldwide that physiotherapists and OTs work independently, says Prof. P.J. Kurien, MP, who was on the committee. After going through laws in countries like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US and Canada, where these fields are treated as independent professions, the committee asked the government to do away with the phrase medically directed.              
	The contentious phrase apart, there is much in the bill to benefit physiotherapists, OTs and others. States like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have laws to regulate fields like physiotherapy. However, these laws are not uniform and a person registered with a state council can only practise in that state.        
	But the proposed bill seeks to establish separate central councils to govern each of these professions. Practitioners will have to register themselves with these central councils, and clinical establishments will only be allowed to appoint those who are registered with the respective central council. This, experts feel, will not only allow them to practise anywhere in India but also enhance their professional status.        
	The councils will be empowered to lay down rules for each field. They will also set minimum educational standards, regulate and specify standards of professional conduct and take disciplinary action in case of any violation of standards.        
	Uniformity in educational standards is the biggest advantage of this law. All this time, the respective associations in these fields were responsible for laying down the standards, but the curricula was not uniform. This will not be the case any longer, says Srivastava.        
	But the government is not in favour of making these councils as powerful as the MCI, a statutory body that regulates medical colleges, decides on affiliations, new colleges, and doctors registrations.        
	For instance, Clause 3 (4) of the bill states that the councils would be nominated bodies and a majority of their members would be central government appointees. The MCI, on the other hand, has elections and most of its members are elected.        
	Though physiotherapists, OTs and others would much prefer to have councils on the lines of the MCI, the health ministry has told the parliamentary committee that the councils should lay down technical standards rather than becoming monopolies.        
	Naturally, professionals in these fields are not convinced with this line of argument. We want our councils to be as independent and powerful as the MCI. But obviously, the government is under pressure from medical professional organisations to limit the powers of councils governing our fields, says Sanjiv Kumar Jha, general secretary, Indian Association of Physiotherapists.        
	The parliamentary committee too seems to agree. We feel that the purpose of setting up these councils would be defeated if there is too much of governmental interference, says Kurien. The committee has asked the government to formulate rules for the councils similar to those that govern the MCI.        
	The committee has also recommended that the word paramedical be deleted from the name of the bill. Many physiotherapists, OTs and others, in fact, objected to being labelled as paramedics. Since the bill seeks to become an umbrella act and in course of time set standards for professionals like respiratory therapists, optometrists, dieticians, nutritionists and others, the standing committee suggested that the government rename the bill the Allied Health Professions Central Councils Act, 2007.        
	While the government mulls over these recommendations, professionals in the field are hoping that the bill will treat them on a par with medical practitioners. As Biswas declares, We are demanding respect for our professions and that is our right.

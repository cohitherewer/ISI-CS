	Black and dark                  
	Sir  It is amazing that youths belonging to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha had the temerity to physically assault taxi-drivers for not having Gorkhaland or GL number plates on their cars. This is nothing short of a criminal offence. GJM members are suggesting that drivers from the plains keep switching the number plates of their cars as and when they enter and leave what the GJM considers to be its own territory (Taxi worry in hill tourist season, Oct 11 and Plate swap for hills, Oct 13). It is shocking that all these specious orders are being handed out when the proposed Gorkhaland has not yet acquired statehood.           
	However, recruitments have already started for a state army, which might well become the official bullying force in future (Pen-and-book statehood army, June 23). The GJM also, quite startlingly, imposed a dress code for the hill people from October 7. Such arbitrary acts and autocratic decrees prove that the GJM is anything but peaceful in its campaigns, as it claims to be. However, peaceful or not, what authority do the GJM activists have to force people to dress in a certain way or to carry GL number plates on their cars? It is surprising that the West Bengal government is sleeping over the problem even as it is assuming threatening proportions.           
	Emboldened by the meekness of the Bengal government, the GJM might soon start calling all non-Gorkhas outsiders and issue separate identity cards to the Gorkhas. One would not surprised if Darjeeling becomes another Kashmir, where members of a particular community have been forced to flee from their own state and live as refugees in their own country. Strong action by the state government and by the Centre is urgently required if this ludicrous yet dangerous demand of a new state is to be crushed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  How can Morcha supporters apply black paint on the dresses and faces of some youths as a punishment for not wearing their traditional dress (Dress code Black Day in hills, Oct 15)? This is really outrageous. Even more stupefying was the declaration of the Morcha secretary, Roshan Giri, that the dress code was not a diktat, but an appeal to all communities to sport their traditional dresses during the festive season. How can people be penalized for violating an appeal? The demand is also preposterous. Now if a Scottish highlander comes to visit Darjeeling, he will be expected to wear a kilt.           
	The situation in Darjeeling reminds me of Sukumar Rays poem, Ekushe Ain, which is all about capricious and absurd laws. If the GJM keeps on issuing more such edicts, soon the real reasons behind the demand for a separate Gorkhaland will be lost in the fiasco. The state government should immediately implement the rule of law in the hill districts.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sumitra De, Agartala, Tripura 

                
	Sir  In West Bengal, after over thirty years of unhampered rule by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), democracy has acquired a new meaning. Here peoples fundamental rights are trampled upon with impunity, as happened in Singur and Nandigram. And now the GJM is imposing all kinds of illogical rules and expecting the people to follow them. The state governments tacit approval to the GJMs decrees is apparent from the way it chooses to remain silent over the issue.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Manabendra Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  If the Gorkhaland agitation is a peoples movement, as claimed by the GJM members, then how can supporters of the Morcha assault some youths for not sporting their traditional attire? Has the GJM become a Maoist organization? If the situation is allowed to worsen, the Gorkhaland movement might become yet another dangerous rebellion that will end up taking hundreds of lives. The GJM leader, Bimal Gurung, should take stern action against those party activists who blackened the faces of the men.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nayan Thapa, Kalimpong

                
	Sir  Although I support the Gorkhaland movement, I am wary of the shape it is taking. Wearing traditional dress during the festive season was not mandatory. Yet the GJM supporters blackened the faces of men who had dressed in jeans and T-shirts. Does this mean that the GJM considers the youths in casual clothes to be unfaithful to the cause of a new state? And what is use of condemning the deed after it has been done? If the GJM leaders really regret what a few party supporters have done, they should ask the latter to own up and apologize.           
	The leaders may claim that the dress code is aimed at unifying the Gorkhas, but incidents such as the blackening will rather serve to divide the people than unify them. Nobody wants to be insulted in the middle of a bustling market place. After being abused in public, I doubt whether the victims of the activists misplaced zeal will continue to lend their support to the Gorkhaland issue.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Nritya Rai, Darjeeling 

                
	Puja gloom          
	Sir  After four days of unadulterated fun, Durga Puja is over. This year, there was no load-shedding, no unruly crowds or unbearable traffic congestions during the Pujas. The credit for this goes to the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation and the Kolkata Police. It is surprising how these organizations, which are notorious for their reluctance to deliver the goods, went out of their way to serve the people.           
	However, even before Durga could begin her return journey, the CESC and the West Bengal State Electricity Board plunged huge areas of the state into darkness. After the four days of dazzle, it was really depressing to sit in total darkness again (Blackout scare after bright Puja, Oct 13).           
	The success of Mamata Banerjee in driving out Nano from Singur can provide us with a ray of hope. Now that the Tatas are safely lodged in Gujarat and Banerjee, presumably, has her hands empty for the time being, she might take up the cause of the Bengalis harassed by the electric supply corporations. She may sit in dharnas outside CESC and WBSEB offices until these institutions promise unhampered power supply. If Banerjee embarks on this project, Bengalis will remain ever-grateful to her.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta

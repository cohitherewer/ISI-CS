	This is not the time to shilly-shally. The terrorist attack on Mumbai brought to a head the cumulative discontent of the people against the myopia and shallowness of politicians. That some politicians displayed not just incompetence but an incredible insensitiveness in the face of a horror that affected the whole nation was bad enough. Three highly placed ministers had to go because of it. The other reason for the peoples disgust was the politicization of bloodshed and tragedy. Some of the most senior politicians in the country were crass enough to use a terror strike to score points against their rival parties. A.R. Antulay did not do so directly, but the suspicions he aired about the way the anti-terrorism squad chief, Hemant Karkare, died were in many ways more dangerous, both for the situation within India as well as for its presentation of the crisis abroad. At best, he was being irresponsible, at worst, he was trying to score a point with his constituency, being the Union minister of minority affairs after all. Neither impulse does a senior minister credit. If, as he has been insisting since, this is the way he honestly feels, he should have discussed his views and suspicions in private with his peers in government or within the party, not come out in public with distracting and confusing comments at such a sensitive time.        
	On the Congresss part, it is not enough to claim that Mr Antulays views are his own and not the partys. The party is falling into the very trap it should show itself to be dismantling. It is debating whether accepting Mr Antulays resignation  an offer from the minister that still remains in limbo  would send a wrong signal to the minority voters. On the other hand, holding on to him would alienate a large segment of opinion makers. This see-sawing between choices based on electoral calculations is exactly the sort of narrowness that the public resents. If three ministers have already been dismissed for showing lack of accountability or a lack of responsibility, the same principle should apply in Mr Antulays case. Those in charge need to show consistency and firmness. That alone will relieve the people of some of their resentment, while sending a strong message to disruptive and mischievous elements within political parties and outside them. It is high time the United Progressive Alliance found itself another minority affairs minister.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE GUEST IS AKIN TO GOD                                  ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA                              
	The sudden concern of the media for the Nepalis in India comes as a surprise. Allegedly, Nepalis face rampant discrimination, State indifference and lack of public awareness, notwithstanding the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship guaranteeing Nepalis in India the same economic and educational opportunities as enjoyed by Indian citizens.        
	Nepalis in India have always been perceived as a helpful, hard-working, peace-loving and god-fearing race. This is not to say that they are absolutely without faults but that they are as much a mixture of good and bad people as any other race or linguistic group belonging to India proper. I studied with over 20 Nepalis at Besant Theosophical School in Benaras. All of them conducted themselves with exemplary self-respect. In fact, such was their behaviour that one preferred to spend more time with them than with the Indian students.         
	It has been absurdly alleged in certain quarters that Nepalis are presumed to be criminals and are heavily exploited in India. They are said to be abused with names such as kancha, bahadur or Gorkhali. Taking the cue from the Aarushi murder case, in which the Nepali domestic help of the Talwars, Hemraj, was thought to be guilty before he too was found dead, the police are said to be biased against Nepali workers in India. It is claimed that the suspicion of the police inevitably comes to rest on the Nepalis whenever they are found to be connected, however tenuously, to any case of murder, theft or rape.                 
	Brothers-in-arms        
	If we are to examine the so-called names used sometimes in relation to the Nepalis, we would find that they are inoffensive in actuality. Kancha means young, bahadur means brave and Gorkhali denotes a Gorkha soldier. Surely, there is nothing humiliating in these adjectives. On the contrary, they acknowledge the charm, valour and trustworthiness of a homogeneous ethnic group. As regards the allegations against the police in the Aarushi case, it can be said for sure that Hemraj was suspected not because he was a Nepali but because certain evidence pointed towards him. As such, Hemraj could have been Bengali or Punjabi, Bihari or Marathi.        
	Nepalis must not nurture the absurd belief that they are being discriminated against and looked down upon. If such had been the case, there would not have been so many Nepalis in the Indian armed forces. The Nepali soldiers get the same pay, pension and perquisites as their Indian counterparts. It is admiration and respect all the way for the Nepalis in India, a few aberrations notwithstanding.         
	Although one is always lamenting nowadays about the destruction of Indian culture, a few traditions are so well-entrenched here that they can never be uprooted. Foremost among these is the love and honour accorded to the guest, who, as a Sanskrit proverb says, is akin to god. India is quite unique in this, as in no other country across the world are outsiders treated with as much reverence as they are in India. This is the reason why very few people leave India once they have got a taste of Indian hospitality. Bangladeshis and Pakistanis have always migrated to India in search of a better life. History tells us that since time immemorial, millions from outside have settled in India, mingled with local life and have become a part of this country. The same applies to the Nepalis who come to India. We think of them as an indispensable part of India and entrust them with the crucial responsibility of guarding the countrys borders. Had the Nepalis really been thought of as outsiders, surely they would not have been given the duty of protecting the country from enemies?

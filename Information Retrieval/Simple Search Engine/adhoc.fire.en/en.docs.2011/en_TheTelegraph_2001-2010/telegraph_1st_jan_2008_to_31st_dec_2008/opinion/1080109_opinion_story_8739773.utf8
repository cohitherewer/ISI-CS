	Tough call                  
	Sir  Dynastic rule has been a defining feature of subcontinental politics for centuries. This trend continues, even in this age of modern democracies. How else could one explain the sudden emergence of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as Benazir Bhuttos successor in the Pakistan Peoples Party? Clearly, the PPP wanted to perpetuate the illustrious Bhutto line, in accordance with their late leaders wishes. It was out of this desire that it projected an inexperienced, and somewhat unwilling, 19-year-old as its political heir (Bilawals Burden, Dec 31). In India, our very own Rahul Gandhi too was made a victim of such unfair demands and is expected to live up to his family name. It is a pity that even in modern times, when choosing a career is fast becoming entirely a matter of merit and aptitude, lineage continues to play a part in politics. It is time that political parties and their cadre realized that running a country is a job like any other, and that it should be given to someone because he has his heart in it, and not because his mother happened to be a charismatic leader.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  One fails to understand how Benazir Bhutto, who had promised democracy to the people of Pakistan, could name a newcomer like Bilawal as her political successor. What is equally galling is the fact that Bhutto chose to leave Bilawal under the tutelage of Asif Ali Zardari, her corrupt and unscrupulous husband. This makes it abundantly clear that Benazir used to treat her party as her personal fiefdom, so that she could be the sole arbiter of all the power equations within the party. This is nothing short of an insult to the people of Pakistan. Even Bilawals appointment as the heir of Benazirs legacy can only be described as a cheap trick to win over Pakistanis through sentimental blackmail. Come to think of it, the name, Bhutto, is not especially glorious either. Both Benazir and her assassinated father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, were accused of various misdeeds. One hopes that Bilawal Bhutto Zardari would be a more capable leader, who would restore democracy in Pakistan and help stop the rise of terror in the subcontinent.           
	Yours faithfully,      
G.C. Biswas, Barasat

                
	Sir  It is ironic that even as members of the PPP grieve the loss of their beloved leader, Benazir Bhuttos family members are meticulously planning how best to cash in on the tragedy. In order to keep the fire of discontent alive in the minds of the people, they have now announced Benazirs son, Bilawal, as the chairman of the party.           
	However, this turn of events is hardly surprising. Benazir was not a selfless politician herself. Her two stints as prime minister were hardly unblemished and her husband was imprisoned for quite a while on charges of corruption. She even had to flee the country to escape punishment. Benazirs return to Pakistan  after years of self-imposed exile  to serve the nation sounded unconvincing from the very beginning. Perhaps she was beginning to tire of her affluent lifestyle, and craved for political power once more. Benazir was not a martyr who fell to an assassins bullet for the sake of her country. On the contrary, she died while attempting to make the most for herself out of a crumbling political situation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  After Benazir Bhuttos death, the baton has now passed to the young Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Until Bilawal is ready to take over the reins of the party, his father, Asif Ali Zardari, would be the PPPs de facto ruler. There is no doubt that Bilawals appointment is a strategic decision on the part of the PPP. By nominating Bilawal, the party hopes to increase its chances of gaining public sympathy. But PPP leaders should have paused to think about the merit of such a step before announcing Bilawal as their chairman. After all, one must start by changing things at home first. In that case, the PPP should have outgrown its dynastic mentality and appointed someone else as the heir after the death of its leader.          
	Yours faithfully,       
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  It has been reported that Benazir Bhutto did not want to involve her children in politics. But, in spite of her reluctance, she named her son, Bilawal, as her successor in her will. Sonia Gandhi, too, tried to protect her son, Rahul, from the dangerous world of politics after the death of her husband. Eventually, she had to succumb to pressure from her party colleagues to project Rahul as the future leader of the Congress. A similar fate has befallen Bilawal. Benazir knew that a political future awaited her son, possibly because of the family name he carried. Bilawal, one hopes, will be gently groomed for the tough world of politics, just as Sonia and senior Congressmen have helped Rahul cope with the trials and tribulations of an early political career.           
	Yours faithfully,

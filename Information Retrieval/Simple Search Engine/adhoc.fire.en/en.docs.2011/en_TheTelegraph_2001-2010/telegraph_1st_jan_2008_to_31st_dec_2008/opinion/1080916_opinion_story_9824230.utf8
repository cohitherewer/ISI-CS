	The world is contingent: there is no absolutely true way of perceiving it. Replace world with India, and the statement remains as valid, keeping in mind, especially, the bewildering profusion of notions about that country in the last three hundred years or so, ever since it became a centre of global interchange and, occasionally, conflict. Often, visitors seem to be travelling through an India they have, in part, invented, at once intriguingly cocooned from and exposed to it, exacerbated by the abrasions of travel, but, in another way, entirely unaffected by them. That Western visitors invent India  in a manner quite different from the one suggested by Edward Said in Orientalism  came to me a few years ago when I was visited by an English photographer in Calcutta .We were discussing London, photography, India, literary journals, in the way we might have if wed met over a cup of coffee in Islington, when he suddenly told me he very much wanted to take pictures of Indians with flowers before he left. Indians love flowers, dont they? he said ingenuously. I let the odd remark pass, until he reiterated his desire when wed gone down for a walk in the lane I live in. Are there any gardens around here? he asked, looking around with controlled urgency. I asked him what exactly he had in mind. Indians have a thing for flowers, dont they? he said without insistence, as if still immersed in the imaginary. All those Moghul miniatures  the king standing in the garden, holding a rose.               
	Quite often, this discrepancy, and complicit relationship, between perception and reality in the context of India can descend into farce. Sometimes, in fiction  but relatively rarely  the farcical and the alienating are held in intriguing equipoise. I am thinking, here, especially of Antonio Tabucchis Italian novella, Indian Nocturne, in Tim Parkss brilliant translation, which I read, by happenstance, just as I was about to embark on the latters new novel, Dreams of Rivers and Seas. Tabucchis astonishing novella is about a man who arrives in Bombay from somewhere in the West, in search of a friend, Xavier, whos disappeared in India. A hypnotic pursuit ensues, directing the protagonist towards real and fictional locations. Parkss novel is, on many levels, a reworking  in its own middle-class, English way, a strikingly successful one  of Tabucchis Pessoa-inflected tale, with its doppelgngers and absent quarry. (A chain of translations and doublings: Tabucchi himself discovered Fernando Pessoas strange, deceptive, persona-haunted poetry in the Sixties, and began to translate him from Portuguese for the first time into Italian.) The missing person in Dreams of Rivers and Seas is the brilliant anthropologist, Albert James, who lived in Delhi with his wife, Helen, a doctor who works for the poor. James is dead; although a fascinating man, neither his life nor his academic achievements have amounted to much. At least two people arrive in Delhi on the day of his funeral or just before: the 24-year-old son, John James, a scientist, petulant and obdurately rational, almost childishly impulsive in love, at once repelled by and obsessed with his fathers disorganized and poetic approach to knowledge; and Paul Roberts, an American, a would-be biographer of James, convinced from having read Jamess early books that hes one of the key figures of the 20th century. Both are intent, for different reasons, on piecing together the elusive life and work.         
	The material that James has left behind is fragmentary: videos of people at their everyday tasks, marginalia, annotations scribbled on the pages of books. A great deal of the later work comprises suggestive, aphoristic sentences, which enrage Jamess son in their constant hinting at the ineffable, their Robert Frost-like desire to turn from language to the significance of gesture. All this infuriates John James, who determinedly inhabits the workaday language of the English middle classes, of work, girlfriends, foreign places, home; for John, the sentences are evidence of Albert Jamess failure to cohere as a social scientist, as an individual, and as a father. These aphorisms, in their context, are among the most vivid things in the book; often, they seem to refer to Tabucchis novella, to the story, the narrative, and the distinctive aesthetic that informed it. Here, for instance, is Helen James thinking of her husband: Its the shape survives when the thing has gone. Thats what form was for him, the shape of something gone.         
	The missing double, the double that wont materialize, haunts Parkss novel; often, people seem not to be alone, even when they think they are. Thus, Paul, the would-be biographer, as he chats up Elaine, Johns girlfriend, soon after shes come to Delhi looking for him: Because Paul had said all these things so many times to so many girls, he had the feeling as he spoke that he was simultaneously both present and not present, honest and dishonest. This returns us to Tabucchi: the quest for the other accompanied by an odd intuition of estrangement from oneself, the lack of a clear demarcation between invention and fact. Other echoes are deployed consciously. Tabucchi has some fun with the Theosophical Society, the Hindu-influenced band of psychics and spiritualists, fairly visible in the early 20th century, but, like so much else from that particular phase of the Orient, largely forgotten today. The Theosophists reappear in Parkss book; they are part, at once, of the farce that is India and the slightly scandalous mystery that was Albert James. Tabucchi also approaches his ancient setting with an idiosyncratic indifference to its monuments. This is shared by John Jones; his fathers final directive to him was that he should see the Taj Mahal; its a directive John is determined to ignore. Tabucchi, in the way of the Surrealists and writers of the nouveau roman, prefers fake monuments to historical ones: hotel after hotel (real, not imaginary, ones) eerily populate his brief fiction. There is no Taj Mahal in Indian Nocturne either, but there certainly are mordantly bewildered descriptions of the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay and the Taj Coromandel in Madras: In the boutique on the ground floor I bought a white shirt, Indian style, and a pair of smart trousers. John James and Parks, too, instead of taking us to Mumtaz Mahals tomb, bring us, toward the end, to the dining room of the India International Centre, in a scene of notable finesse and understated, if incongruous, beauty.               
	Of course, Parkss novel belongs to a more recognizable tradition than Tabucchis sui generis novella. The bourgeois (and, commonly, Western) self under duress, then gradually losing its integrity, in alien (commonly, non-Western) surroundings: an early exploration of this theme can be found in Kiplings delightful snippet, A Wayside Comedy; a particularly excoriating and gratuitous treatment in Paul Bowless The Sheltering Sky. But its not just the traffic between the West and non-West that forms the tradition; Tagores story, The Postmaster, examining what happens to the genteel self-image of a Bengali bhadralok, or bourgeois, when hes transferred to a village, was published in 1891. The English version of the tradition, however, is profligate in certain ways; everyone, in a narrow constellation of characters, is having sex with everyone else; the chaos of the non-West is kept out by closing ranks, but mirrored by the chaos of fitful, serial, often simultaneous, relationships. This is true of Parkss novel as well. And yet the prism of Tabucchi, and Parkss own gifts, open it up repeatedly to a series of startling intimations. In the tradition of British writing about India, this novel is a rich, unexpected variation, and a considerable addition.       amitchaudhurihotmail.com

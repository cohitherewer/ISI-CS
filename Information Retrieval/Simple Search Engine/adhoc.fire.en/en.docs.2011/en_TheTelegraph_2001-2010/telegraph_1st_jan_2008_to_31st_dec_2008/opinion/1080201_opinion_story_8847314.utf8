	Self-examination is not a simple task. To force it on another is definitely more complex. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council, set up in the Nineties under the aegis of the University Grants Commission, can verily attest to this truth. Its mission of assessing the educational standard of colleges and universities has been thwarted time and again by chauvinistic state governments, who have invariably seen NAAC exercises as devious attempts by the Central government to control education. The fact that a NAAC-grading is not mandatory, and that it does not guarantee priority access to UGC funds, has also gone against it. However, it is not so much NAACs irrelevance as the corruption in other supervisory bodies that seems to have prompted the human resource development ministry to try and streamline the monitoring of the institutions of higher education. In a bill about to finalized, the ministry seeks to extend the jurisdiction of NAAC to institutions teaching medicine, engineering, management and law, and to strengthen its hands by guaranteeing it more independence. In other words, the council is bound to have its hands full in the days to come.
    
	That raises an immediate problem. In all this time, NAAC has managed to assess only a small fraction of the existing colleges and universities, and that too on the basis of a grading system that has been rather inconsistent. The ministry hopes to gradually phase out other accreditation boards. But given the pending work before NAAC, and the steadily growing number of private institutions, that is unlikely to happen soon. Other loose ends remain. The ministry does not clarify if it has intentions of making NAAC accreditation compulsory. For engineering, medicine and legal studies, there are separate boards giving their accreditation, which are supposed to be mandatory for the institutions. And these boards, as apparent from the ministrys plans, will continue to exist simultaneously with NAAC till the debate over the need to have an independent regulatory authority for higher education is resolved. This means that instead of simplifying matters, centralized control, the efficacy and desirability of which is always suspect, could end up adding to the confusion. There is also no guarantee that state governments will take kindly to the diminution of their importance in institutions that will continue to remain dependent on their funding.

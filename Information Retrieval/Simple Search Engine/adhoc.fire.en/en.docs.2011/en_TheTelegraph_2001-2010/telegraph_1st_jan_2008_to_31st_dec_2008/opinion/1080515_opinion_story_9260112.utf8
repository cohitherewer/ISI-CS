The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stopping by woods on a rainy evening
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STOPPING BY WOODS ON A RAINY EVENING                                  EARTH SONG      The Rabhas and their sacred pachyderms                                                  
	Bong Basti, a village in the Chilapata forest in Jalpaiguri, is composed of about thirty homes. At first sight, it looks like any other tribal village. Houses constructed on stilts stand framed by drooping bamboo fronds. Pigs laze in the shade, a hen with her family of chicks scampers about, and the women make preparations for meal by grinding garlic in the mortar. But Bong Basti has a unique reputation. Although elephants descend on the village regularly, as they do in all the villages on the fringes of the forest, they have never been known to harm the houses or the inhabitants.         
	I enquired of Jabbar Rabha of Bong Basti, who works for the forest department, about the secret behind the privilege enjoyed by his village. Flaunting his bamboo stick, he announced triumphantly that elephants always spare those who are pure in mind and body. Since the inhabitants of his village live in harmony, do not drink in excess and rarely curse, elephants pass over his village even if they ransack the fields. Elephants never forgive those who shout invectives at them. So they need to be addressed politely and treated with respect, Jabbar confided. He, like his fellow villagers, believes that elephants act as the agents of the gods, sniffing out and punishing the corrupt. But god or not, when the tuskers attack, they have to be driven away. I asked Jabbar whether that could be done courteously. Everything depends on the attitude, he proclaimed with a smile of condescension, If you entreat the elephants to go away, as we do, they will leave you in peace after they have had their fill.         
	The elephant is worshipped as Mahakal in the villages of the forests. He takes on different avatars among different tribes, but is always venerated as the presiding deity of the woods. Among the Bodos and the Rabhas, the elephant is revered as Ganesh, while the Dhimans of Naxalbari venerate him as Hatisura. Tribal lore is replete with legends of the elephant. They are special terms to pacify the pachyderm  it is said that if an elephant is addressed as thakur, he will not damage the crops. There is also the tradition of a special song called buriya gaan, sung by the mahout to tame the elephants. Its tune supposedly causes even wild elephants to calm down instantly.        
	A Mahakal thaan or consecrated spot lay deep in the heart of the Chilapata forest. Several stone lingams, darkened with age and moss, stood at the foot of a tree. The intense red of the hibiscus flowers placed on the dark stones was matched by the vermilion with which the lingams were smeared. The place was eerily silent, the only sounds being the occasional plaintive call of the peacock coming from the distance and the buzzing of bees. The jungle seemed alive, the silence heightening the sense of life pulsating all around me. Standing in that uncanny place bathed in a green light, I was led to believe in the presence of the spirit of the forest. Suddenly Mahakal seemed as real as any flesh and blood person I have known. I realized in a flash why tribals have worshipped the forest for ages.        
	It started to rain when I was returning from the thaan and continued raining through the night. Huddled in bed, with the rain rattling the window-panes, I heard the echoing trumpets of the elephants in the hills. Had I been less of a sceptic, I would have crossed myself.        
	A.M.

	If Alice in Wonderland had its Queen of Hearts who shouted, Off with his head, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has a general secretary, Prakash Karat, who from time to time shouts, Expel him. His latest victim is Somnath Chatterjee, the speaker of the Lok Sabha, who has been expelled from the CPI(M). Mr Chatterjee was a member of the party for four decades, and was associated with it for even longer. The reason for this action was Mr Chatterjees refusal to obey the diktat of the party to resign as speaker and vote against the United Progressive Alliance government in the trust vote. Mr Karat went to the extent of including Mr Chatterjees name in the list he submitted to the president of the Left members of parliament who were withdrawing their support to the UPA government. Mr Karat completely overlooked the position that the speaker of the Lok Sabha stands above all political parties. As soon as an MP gets elected as speaker, his party affiliation is erased; the fact that he can reclaim that affiliation once he ceases to be speaker does not alter the fact that the speaker is above party loyalty. Mr Karat and his partys politburo has set a very dangerous precedent by directly implying that loyalty to the CPI(M), so far as a party member is concerned, prevails over all other loyalties.        
	By expelling Mr Chatterjee, the CPI(M) has made it clear that he was expected to serve his party and not the Constitution or the parliament. This raises very critical questions. What is the CPI(M)s attitude to the Constitution? How can the CPI(M) expel a person from its membership for remaining loyal to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and to the conventions of parliamentary procedure? The CPI(M) owes an explanation to the people of India. It cannot be part of a democratic polity and pretend to be some kind of closed society whose proceedings are not open to public scrutiny and explanation when they violate the basic principles of democracy. The CPI(M) cannot behave like an authoritarian Stalinist party and continue to function in a democracy. There was a time when communists used to feel disgraced when expelled by the party. Today, when communism stands utterly disgraced, Mr Chatterjee should embrace his expulsion as a hero who stood by his conscience and stood by the Constitution.

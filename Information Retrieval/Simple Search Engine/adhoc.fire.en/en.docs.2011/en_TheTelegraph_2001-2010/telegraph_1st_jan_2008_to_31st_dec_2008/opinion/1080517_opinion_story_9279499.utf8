The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Celebration of life through the language of dance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CELEBRATION OF LIFE THROUGH THE LANGUAGE OF DANCE                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      DANCE                                    In 1982, the International Theatre Institute observed an International Dance Day to commemorate the birthday of Jean-Georges Noverre, the creator of modern ballet. The International Dance Day aims to bring together different dance forms, and in doing so, tries to transcend political and cultural barriers, bringing people from diverse backgrounds together by forging a common bond of peace and friendship through the universal language of dance.				   
	Kolkata Sanved and the World Dance Alliance, West Bengal, organized Dance in Outreach, an evening featuring special children  some of them victims of violence or mentally-challenged  whose lives have been transformed through rhythm and movement. In this way, they tried to celebrate International Dance Day at Max Mueller Bhavan on April 29. No other exercise could have been more appropriate in proving the strength and power of dance.        
	With a full auditorium, the programme started off with a brief piece called Energy performed by the Kolkata Sanved artists. Music by Drums on Fire, the two-man band of James Asher and Shivamani, set the mood of the evening.         
	Anjika Centre for Manipuri Dance and Movement Therapy, under the guidance of the veteran Manipuri dancer Preeti Patel, followed up with another composition, This is my life. A group of dancers, dressed in simple but elegant costumes of yellow and white, created an incredibly synchronized pattern of movements. Despite their physical shortcomings the magical impact of dance had been established unmistakably.         
	Dressed in traditional Odissi costume, children from some of the slums of Calcutta offered a rhythmic number, Spring, based on the well-known song, Chhotisi asha, from the film Roja. Choreographed by Alokenanda Roy, under the aegies of Inspiration Foundation, this presentation was full of spontaneity and energy. Roy succeeded in tapping into the talent of these young performers. Dance seemed to have brought back joy into the lives of these innocent girls. Witnessing their graceful movements and lively expressions, one could hardly believe that these artists have been, in any way, kept away from a normal life.        
	Based on music by the Bengali band, Mohiner Ghoraguli, Bhalobashi was choreographed by Khateja Khatun. The participants of this composition from Apne Aap Women Worldwide demonstrated how dance can be turned into a healing force for all to access.         
	The most colourful and enjoyable number was bhangra, the folk dance of Punjab, by the members of the Oral School for the Deaf. Under the guidance of Suman Saraogi, a dedicated Manipuri dancer, these artists conveyed that the music of the heart and soul sets the real rhythms of life.         
	The performances by New Light and All Bengal Womens Union deserve mention. Their earnest and enthusiastic presence revealed that dance is an idiom where the human spirit can embrace an ultimate sense of freedom and attain a state of supreme bliss.         
	Keeping in mind the purpose behind the International Dance Day, it is a pity that dancers and dance troupes from Calcutta do not feel the urge to celebrate this day in any meaningful way.

	If the International Olympic Committee really expected a radical turnaround in Chinas human rights record in the seven years that have elapsed since the latter won the right to host the 2008 games, then such misplaced optimism has certainly broken new ground. In the hopeful Nineties, another beady-eyed spell of wishful thinking spurred the West on to even wilder conclusions: with the coming wave of economic progress, China would come of age as well. Unfortunately, China has consistently belied such neat formulations, as it continues to do in the wake of the 2008 Olympic games. A report released by Amnesty International in Hong Kong has revealed that instead of affecting its citizens in any palpably humane way, China continues its oppression of dissenters, undermining every law of the land and daring to become a law unto itself. The communist governments penchant for total control does not stop with imprisonment, torture, extradition and forced disappearance, but also extends into the realm of the intangible.         
	When China won the bid to host the Olympics in 2001, it promised to relax the regulation of internet access during the games. But foreign journalists are complaining already, as a large number of sites remain out of bounds. Apart from the usual suspects  Tibet, Falun Gong (the banned religious group), HIV-AIDS  the latest to get the axe is the Amnesty International report itself. The West has predictably responded to these revelations with righteous outrage. Instead of fuming at the degradation of the spirit of the Olympics, it would have made more sense had serious diplomatic pressure been put on China. China, unlike North Korea, is too self-sufficient to be won over by dangling a carrot. The Western wager with China, a brazen supporter of the regimes in Zimbabwe, Burma and Sudan, remains as inscrutable as Pascals wager with god  a leap in the dark.

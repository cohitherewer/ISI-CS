	Step back                  
	Sir  N.K. Singh is right in saying that the Maharashtra Navnirman Senas offensive against north Indian and Bihari immigrants has dashed Maharashtras chances of benefiting from inter-state migration (Cross borders of hope, May 27). The MNS was critical even of Amitabh Bachchan: Bachchan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, was accused by Raj Thackerays party of not contributing to the development of Maharashtra, the state that has helped him become what he is. It was not difficult for a celebrity like Bachchan to defend himself against the exaggerated accusations, but other immigrants in Maharashtra were not so lucky. Being ordinary citizens, they had to bear the brunt of the MNS violence.          
	The scope for unrestricted movement of people across regions and nations has widened in a globalized world. As a result, highly skilled workers from poor and developing countries, Singh writes, are now migrating to the developed world in search of better opportunities. The United States of America, until recently frowned on allowing too many expatriates in. It has now considerably eased the process of immigration. Surely this has not been done at the cost of its national interests. How can then an Indian state dare to bar its doors to migrants from other states belonging to the same nation? Raj Thackeray is reported to have targeted north Indian students in the university of Pune and argued that the influx of students from other states would harm the interests of those who are from Maharashtra. He further complained that the local students are discriminated against in favour of immigrants, and added that his party would not hesitate to take up cudgels against any incident of such bias.          
	Thackerays rants only show how ignorant he is. The figures provided by Singh proves that inter-state migration would be beneficial for any state. The intermingling of different racial and cultural communities ultimately strengthens the process of national integration in a country as diverse as India. Thackeray should be severely punished for stoking local sentiments. A man like him has no place in our democracy.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Political leaders who share Raj Thackerays ideology have fomented violence in other parts of the country in the recent past. The United Liberation Front of Asom came into existence with the objective of driving out Bangladeshi immigrants from the state and creating an independent Assam meant solely for the Assamese. The violence it unleashed affected thousands of Bengalis, apart from Bangladeshis, who were living in the state. Today ULFA survives as a militant outfit. It makes its presence felt from time to time by killing harmless people.           
	A narrow, provincial outlook can never lead to any good. It divides people, sets them against one another and destroys the unity of the nation. The MNSs backlash against non-Maharashtrians a few months back did nothing for the people of Maharashtra. It only revealed the bigoted mentality of Raj Thackeray whose party was responsible for the violence. N.K. Singh makes use of statistics to prove his contention that Migrants all over the world, and indeed in India, add value and create wealth for the sustenance of a competitive economic order. Thackeray would be well advised to read Singhs article. It might prevent him from making a fool of himself before the country in the near future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	In the dark          
	Sir  I recently went to Madhu tea estate in Hasimara and to Nangdala tea estate in the Birpara area of Jalpaiguri district. There I was shocked to find that the managers of the estates, the trade unions and the state electricity department are exploiting the illiterate labourers in the name of providing electricity to their quarters. In Madhu tea estate, there is no legal electricity connection in the labourers colony. The management, in connivance with the electricity department, has allowed labourers to hook the neighbourhood electricity connection. The trade union has given its approval to this illegal act. The labourers get electricity for a maximum duration of ten hours a day, and each of them can light three to four bulbs during this time. They are made to pay Rs 50 for each bulb per month. Most labourers have no more than one bulb lighting their quarters although they might have connections for two or three. They are made to pay Rs 200 to Rs 300 on the basis of the number of plug points. The management deducts the electricity charges from their wages. The electric wires dangling here and there pose a constant threat to both men and animals.          
	The labourers of Madhu tea estate have been demanding regular electricity for years. For this, they are required to obtain a no-objection certificate from the estate management. But the latter does not want to provide the required document because if electricity comes to the labourers quarters, then under existing rules, it will have to bear the cost of wiring. Besides, the present situation suits the management as it allows the owners to make some money by taking advantage of the workers. The district administration has full knowledge of this, but it has chosen to shut its eyes because the management and the trade unions are hand-in-glove with those who are in power. As it is, most tea workers in North Bengal are now unemployed as many of the gardens have closed down. If those still employed are exploited in this manner, how will they be able to survive?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Progressive Bombay, which once set the professional standards and work ethics for a new nation, a city that nurtured the arts, theatre, films and the post-Independence intellectual activity, has today, in its avatar of Mumbai, taken on the unwarranted veil of parochial conservatism that has been a huge dampener on creativity and has stifled freedom of expression. There was a time when Bombay represented the diversity of India  it was a place where dreams became realities, where a dynamic people worked hard to better their lives and where the constituents of this great and ancient civilization lived in harmony. It was a contemporary and modern city that was often likened to New York! It was the commercial and cultural capital of India, not just of Maharashtra.        
	Unfortunately, this position has been reversed now and the intolerant, non-democratic and anti constitutional stances that are voiced and then implemented in the public domain by regional political dispensations are becoming ugly and unwarranted. The ruling government in the state stands by and watches individuals being attacked for doing things that are within their constitutional right. It does not punish, refrains from putting an end to illegal and irregular activity on the streets and the personal assaults on the citizenry. Hindi, English, or any conceivable language can be spoken anywhere and everywhere in India. Surely the Maharashtra chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, knows that. Then why is he silent when Raj Thackeray and his party rose up in arms against Jaya Bachchans inadvertent comment that she preferred to speak in Hindi rather than in Marathi? Has Deshmukh joined the ranks of Raj Thackeray? Or is some other political game being played out there?

	To fracture and fragment India in this manner is against the law of the land. To condone the action is also against the law of this land, and the chief minister needs to be made accountable immediately. There has not been a stir from either the chief minister or general secretaries of the ruling Congress on this issue.         
	Their silence is ominous. It condones the wrongs. It allows intellectual morality to be held at ransom by the parochial interests of street gangs which are relentlessly destroying public property and demeaning individual citizens. The law and order machinery seems to be non-existent. This appalling breakdown of governance and the disappearance of compassion is going to alienate the people in the long run.        
	The time has come to impeach those who do not, consciously and deliberately, uphold the Constitution of India and all its tenets for a plural and diverse polity to live in harmony. Whenever and wherever such unlawful killing of people and the destruction of public property take place, and chief ministers indirectly endorse the horrors by merely constituting inquiries that die a natural death, the ministers need to be hauled over the coals publicly. Politicians and bureaucrats must be accountable to society and the public.        
	The closed club of politicians and administrators have forced India into functioning like a banana republic. The lack of learning, intellectual calibre and the unabated greed for power and money have diluted a once celebrated civil service into a corrupt tool that is rapaciously exploited by opportunist politicians to serve their insular, parochial, exclusive and often, personal ends. Our nation has been demeaned and insulted by this kind of inept governance. A corrective needs to be brought into play to empower the next generation to build an India that it can be proud of, an India that is fiercely protected and profoundly respected by Indians at home as well as by all the nations of the world.

	No hope for a rise                  
	Sir  Bhaskar Duttas article, At a stately pace (Oct 30), strikes a false note of optimism when there is nothing bright in the troubled state of the markets. Contrary to Duttas thesis, there is nothing positive about the unprecedented collapse of Indian economy, with a sharp fall of the rupee, to cap an untamed rate of inflation. His analysis is lucid, but it fails to address the core problems and avoids giving any concrete solution. He does not define what the real sectors of economy are  the ones that he thinks have actually suffered as a result of the fiscal breakdown. Nor does he clearly mention what the governments role should have been. On the one hand, he blames the private organizations for passively awaiting the Reserve Bank of Indias cut in the repo rate, and on the other hand, he feels that the government should supply adequate credit to private banks. The piece ends rather inconclusively, with the author asserting his faith in the resilience of the Indian economy supported by, what he, quite irrationally, calls a very healthy rate of growth.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Prabir Samanta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The role of the Sensex in Indian economy has been grossly trivialized in Bhaskar Duttas article. The percentage of Indians who invest in stocks and mutual funds may be meagre, but many of these investors put their hard-earned money in the stock market, not to mention the day-traders who earn their living by buying and selling shares everyday. Also, the Sensex, being the prime index for stocks of all financial, agricultural, industrial, pharmaceutical, technological and other types of companies in the country, reflects the financial fitness of India. In its rise and fall are hidden many stories of socio-economic changes in the country, which, sadly, have been ignored by Dutta.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Ajay Kanti Misra, Patna

                
	Sir  Bhaskar Dutta suggests some practicable measures for the government to protect the Indian market from bigger jolts than the one it is currently experiencing. But merely an increase in the supply of domestic money, flexibility in the credit market and increase in the procurement price of agricultural products by the government will be of little help to tame inflation or stabilize the index. It is the widespread ignorance of the gravity of the situation and lack of will among political leaders that have brought about this disaster. A fragmented and unstable Union government, unable to take major decisions unanimously, is pushing the country towards a deeper crisis. Duttas hope, that the Indian economy will still proceed at a stately pace with a bountiful harvest, will not be realized until the political instability is curbed.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Before naming a bountiful harvest as a possible solution to the fiscal debacle, Bhaskar Dutta should have remembered that agricultural products would have to be liquidated to make them financially usable. There is no guarantee that this money will be insulated from all kinds of economic challenges merely because it is generated from an alternative source. Also, in a globalized world, it is impossible for India to go back to agrarian economy, while other nations follow the technological path. Duttas suggestion, therefore, does not sound practicable enough.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kakali Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Bhaskar Dutta has dismissed the suggestion for increasing the supply of domestic money for stimulating foreign demand for Indian products. But he seems to have missed the logic behind the view. A stronger monetary support at home will certainly boost the morale of Indian industry, which suffers more from financial insecurities than anything else.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanti De Biswas, Calcutta

                
	Dark days          
	Sir  A few days of rain and stormy weather in the middle of October, coupled with irregular power supply, has made life difficult for the residents of Shillong. Room-heaters or geysers came to no use because of the power cuts. Some electricity poles and wires had been damaged by the rough weather. But the performance of the Meghalaya State Electricity Board has been unsatisfactory for long. Many parts of Shillong remained without electricity for four to five days even after the weather became normal. This coincided with Diwali, which was a dark day for the people of the state. The MeSEB, even after 33 years of its existence, remains in a dismal state. The average rainfall is high in the state, and as a result, the electricity supply system needs careful maintenance. The MeSEB must clean up its act immediately.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tenzin Tsewang, Shillong 

                
	Sir  The inadequate supply of coal across the country has already created an acute shortage of electricity. Coal India Limited is supplying coal from one states quota to another, though some of the state electricity boards have defaulted in payment. While CIL and the SEBs have to bear the brunt by making arrangements for equal distribution of electricity among the states, the state governments do not seem to play a proactive role. The governments, both in the states and at the Centre, should encourage the use of electricity derived from alternative resources.          
	Yours faithfully,

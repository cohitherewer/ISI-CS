	Marginal Europeans in Colonial India: 1860-1920 By Sarmistha De, Thema, Rs 450
    
	In the perception of colonized people, the Europeans represented a homogeneous class which was destined to rule. The Europeans themselves engendered this notion, and, as Ashis Nandy shows in The Intimate Enemy: The Loss and Recovery of Self under Colonial Rule, it pervaded the consciousness of the colonized. Obviously, this is an example of essentialism in its crudest form and is divorced from historical truth.  
	Sarmistha Des well-researched book seems to be motivated by two main purposes. The first is to refute the essentialist myth of European homogeneity. For this, she traces the history of the European settlement in India, and shows how it consisted of a sizeable section of the underclass that had in it vagrants, destitutes, convicts, prostitutes and lunatics. De selects only three categories  vagrants, prostitutes and convicts  for her study, because they were, as she explains in the Introduction, the real offenders in the eyes of colonial law. These marginalized sections caused administrative problems to colonial rulers and brought them moral embarrassment by challenging the widely circulated notion of their racial superiority that was solemnly upheld to justify their civilizing mission.        
	The second purpose of Des book is to examine the subtle ideological implications underlying the colonial methodology of dealing with the criminality of the underclass. She demonstrates how the colonial rulers treatment of this class, through their laws and other systematized disciplinary measures, was integral to the construction of a racialized bourgeois self in Indian society. She shows that the colonial way to discipline the rogue class was astutely connected to their process of empire-building and also that the colonial punitive measures were less stringent for this class than for similar elements among the native population. The European underclass, referred to as low Europeans or mean whites in contemporary official documents, can be roughly equated with what Gayatri Chakraborty Spivak calls the subaltern-elites. While they were veritable subalterns culturally and economically, they were elites from the racial point of view, and thus legally more privileged. The title of the chapter on white prisoners  Discipline and Pamper  is steeped in irony, and the subversive allusion to Michel Foucaults Discipline and Punish is difficult to miss.        
	Marginal Europeans covers a span of sixty years (1860-1920) of colonial rule in India, because it was around this time that the underclass became particulary visible in contemporary documentation. Calcutta and the Bombay Presidency are Des areas of study. The book contains five sections, each furnished with case studies and statistical records. The most interesting chapters are the two on white prostitutes and white prisoners. The colonial rulers bypassed the churches moral disapproval and the indictment by secular Indian journals of sending native prostitutes to the moving regiments of their soldiers. European prostitutes, on the other hand, were either deported or debarred from approaching the soldiers, to save them from disgrace. Similar disparity was observed in the kind of accommodation provided to European prisoners and to their Indian counterparts.         
	Des study throws light on aspects of colonial rule in India that had so far been in the shadows.                    ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

	Off the track                  
	Sir  As in the last three years, Lalu Prasad  one of the most dynamic railway ministers India has ever had  has remained faithful to the aam aadmi in his annual railway budget (Poll Prasad, Feb 27). More Garib Raths for the poor, free railway travel for girls up to graduation and for boys till class XII, 50 per cent discount to women senior citizens, besides the cuts in sleeper- and AC-class fares have been some of the high points of this budget. Even after bringing a smile to so many, including the licensed porters, Lalu Prasad managed to ensure a handsome turnover for his ministry.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kisholoy Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Why is it that people are so thrilled with the railway budget? Behind the faade of decreasing fares, the railway minister has increased cancellation charges, earning substantial revenue in the process. A large number of trains have been declared superfast. The Ahmedabad Express, which runs between Ahmedabad and Howrah and has around 60 stops, will now have to be referred to as superfast. This is one of the ways in which the railways has made people pay for every cut in fares.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjay Agarwal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  With each rail budget, Lalu Prasad proves his excellent managerial skills. His ability to generate income worth thousands of crores for the Indian Railways deserves accolades. A few ministers have accused him of giving unfair advantage to Biharis by conferring government employee status on the coolies. But none can doubt that the Indian Railways has reached an all-time high under Prasad. Along with the railways, he has changed the face of the Indian economy. Rail tickets have become cheaper, and technology is now used for an improved travelling experience. However, the filthy toilets and compartments, security concerns and train accidents indicate that a lot still needs to be done.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurabh Sharma, Liluah 

                
	Sir  In spite of affordable airlines, the common man still prefers to travel by train, and Lalu Prasads generous showering of privileges on them in the 2008 railways budget would be most welcome (Beaten track, Feb 27). But cutting down on fares would be meaningless if the quality of essential services on the trains is not improved. There should be uninterrupted water and electricity supply on the trains. The compartments and toilets should be clean. Security on long-distance trains should be hauled up and accidents minimized. To get these upgradations done, the government should sanction more funds for the railways.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

                
	Sir  Lalu Prasad has done it again. After the initial flutter over his rail budget, people are waking up to the reality. It seems that a lot of the promises made by the railways minister were empty words. Lalu Prasad has put in so many riders that the aam admis railway ride has not really got cheaper. The budget was, as usual, witty, but the humour was meant to cover his sleight of hand. He announced reduced fares, but sneaked in clauses. For the AC fare-cut, a passenger pays less only three months of the year. And even the reduced rates do not apply to many popular trains. For AC-3-tier and AC chair-cars, the reduced fares are applicable only for the newly designed coaches. No wonder management gurus have been singing paeans to Lalu Prasad, who has been a master at manipulating numbers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Once again, the demands of the people of Orissa have been overlooked by the railway minister. Although Orissa generates high originating freight tonnage, it continues to have the least route km per unit area in India. Several districts, including the poorest and the most backward district of Kandhmal, are yet to glimpse a train. On the one hand, Lalu Prasad is trying to take credit for generating record profits, on the other hand, railway projects in Orissa are languishing for want of funds. For instance, the much-hyped Khurda Road-Bolangir project has been on for the last 12 years, but so much work is still left to be completed.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Sir  Lalu Prasad has been magnanimous in his rail budget, but has tactfully sidetracked West Bengal. Out of the 53 new trains to be introduced, only the Kolkata-Murshidabad Hazarduari Express will be running through our state, but just once a week. The number of trains along the Krishnagar-Lalgola section, under the Sealdah division of Eastern Railway, is also less. Passengers in this route have to wait for about two hours if they miss a train during the peak hours. Moreover, the longstanding demand for doubling this 127-km long railway track was not met by the people-friendly budget. It is useless to bring down passenger fares when commuters suffer from the scarcity of trains.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

                
	Sir  There is little to rouse passions in this years rail budget. Some simple measures would have made more sense. One of them is the introduction of luggage trolleys like the ones used in airports. This would ease a major burden of passengers, besides saving them from being harassed by porters, who are ill-behaved and never accept government-approved rates. (Unfortunately, they are Lalu Prasads favourites.) One feels like asking the minister: isnt it inhuman to let people haul loads on their heads?           
	Also, Lalu Prasad could have banned eunuchs from boarding trains, at least on the grounds of ticketless travel. Lastly, he should have done something to make life easier for the sardine-class of suburban passengers. But then, our ministers are sold to regional and political sentiments.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kunal Lohar, Kalyani

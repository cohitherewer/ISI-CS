	British Airways has chosen to fly over Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees nest. Calcuttas Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport is not the favoured destination of most international airlines. Compared to Delhi, Mumbai or even Bangalore, the international airport in Calcutta has very few flights. BAs decision to withdraw its flights to London from March 2009 further reduces this number. It will be recalled that sometime back, Indias flagship carrier, Air India, also withdrew its Calcutta-London flight. Passengers from Calcutta intending to travel to London can no longer do so directly; they have to change in another airport either within India or abroad. This rather diminishes the importance of Calcutta, however unpleasant this truth may sound. At a time when the global economy is in a crisis, BA has good business reasons to curtail operations in sectors that do not fetch the company adequate returns. Therefore, from the point of view of the airline, the decision may be entirely justified. This, however, cannot sweeten the pill for Calcutta and those who travel abroad from the city.        
	The global economic condition may not be the sole cause that determined BAs decision to withdraw, and of the decision of other airlines not to touch down in Calcutta. In terms of business and opportunities, Calcutta has very little to offer to airlines. There was, a couple of years ago, a flicker of hope that Calcutta might emerge as a hub of business and become Indias gateway to southeast Asia. Not even an optimist will harbour such hopes any longer. The politics of street violence ensured the departure of the Nano project from the state. This project was supposed to showcase a new and industrialized West Bengal. When the curtain came down on the plant in Singur a very powerful message also went out to all potential investors. It was evident that investments were not as safe as had been promised. There were powerful political and societal forces within West Bengal that were opposed to industry, and the spectre of violence looms ominously over the state. This impression spells disaster for West Bengal. With such a vista before them, which airline would continue its operations out of Calcutta? The last flight of BA from the city will be a telling symbol. West Bengal is destined not to fly.

	Mind the sign                  
	Sir  Private cars and motorcycles plying the streets flaunting boards with words like police or advocate written on them have become a common sight nowadays. The boards are usually painted in bold letters and placed in the front as well as on the rear side of the vehicles. Observing the huge number of such vehicles on the streets, I wonder whether all these claims are genuine. I suspect that most riders use the signs either to show off or to dupe the traffic police into letting them get away with minor violations. Will the authorities look into the matter?

	Scary high          
	Sir  The fact that inflation has reached 7 per cent this year  highest in three years  is a telling comment on the abilities of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who boasts of being an eminent economist (Duty cut high on trade plan agenda, April 7). It proves that the measures taken by his government to curb inflation and stabilize the economy look good on paper but are ineffectual in reality. If the situation continues for long, Singh will be causing severe damage to the prospects of the Congress in the coming general elections. Will the people who have to buy essential commodities at inflationary rates vote for the Congress?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.V.S.N. Murthy, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  Everybody, except the common man, loves a good inflation. The political parties are the first to hog the benefits of inflation. It offers them, especially the Opposition parties, an excellent opportunity to display their lung-power. Government employees, who never stop complaining about the pittance they are offered at the end of each month, start clamouring for a hike in salaries. And women activists get a chance to turn away from worn-out subjects like sexual harassment to champion the cause of the homemaker and how she has to suffer endless hardships because of inflation.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar

                
	Sir  The Congress, as well as the Left, has failed miserably in containing inflation. The recent death of a potato-farmer in West Bengal after he had to make a distress sale of his crop proves that the Left is as incompetent as its coalition partner at the Centre in controlling prices. It is characteristic of the political muddle India is in that the Opposition blunders as much as the ruling government.           
	Yours faithfully,      
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The rise in the price of essential goods is the direct result of the misdirected economic and fiscal policies of the United Progressive Alliance government. It is also the result of illegal profiteering by retailers, who deliberately inflate price to increase their profit margins. To bring the situation under control, the government must fix the price of essential commodities.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The main cause of inflation is the unprecedented amount of black money floating in the market. Politicians do nothing about it because they benefit hugely from it. Politicians having unequal assets sometimes make news. Tax officials make a great show of visiting their homes to estimate their wealth. But nothing comes of such visits eventually.           
	The loan waiver for farmers announced recently by the finance minister has added to inflation. How can the treasury afford to part with so much money when prices are soaring? Neither the middle classes nor the farmers stand to benefit from this, but the Congress may still get another term.          
	Yours faithfully,

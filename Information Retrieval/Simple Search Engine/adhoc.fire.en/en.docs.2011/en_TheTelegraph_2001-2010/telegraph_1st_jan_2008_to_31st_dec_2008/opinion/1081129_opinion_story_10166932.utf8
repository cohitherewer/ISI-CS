	Masako Ono, a talented Japanese Odissi dancer, recently presented an innovative solo recital at the Terrace Gardens, Taj Bengal. Trained in Odissi, yoga and chhau at Nrityagram, founded by the late Protima Gouri Bedi, and further nurtured by Kelucharan Mahapatra, Ono began her recital with a small salsa piece. Although salsa is a partner-dance, danced in a handhold, Ono, with her flirtatious and sensuous movements, set the perfect mood. It was followed by Frozen Grace, an inventive number based on Haiku. Attired in a kaftan-like satin dress, Ono created a graphical illusion with her agile and unbelievably supple movements. Her precision was truly commendable.         
	The most striking presentation was Shakti, comprising three short segments. Inspired by an ancient Sanskrit hymn that invokes the blessings of Shakti in the form of kundalini, the mystical, dynamic force of the universe, Ono choreographed the piece with passion and experience. Though she looked different with her short hair and no ghungroo, her authentic performance revealed a firm foundation and rigorous training.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bright with an ancient joy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BRIGHT WITH AN ANCIENT JOY                                                                  
	Christmas comes here with lights, music, delicate paper decorations strung across, above and along the road, and shared joy around a beautiful little model of the miraculous birth. Around 150 households down and around Dr Suresh Sarkar Road, a stones throw away from Moulali, have been celebrating Christmas in this way for, I am told, at least 50 years. Sixty per cent of the homes close to the Entally Baptist Mission Church and the Carey High School are Christian, although not everyone is a member of the Baptist Mission. Not just Christmas, every occasion is made a memorable event. Just as the entire neighbourhood turns out together to enjoy Christmas in the para, everyone, Christians, Hindus and everybody else, joins in for an equally enthusiastic Saraswati Puja, says a member of the Entally Yuva Sangha, the club that is in charge of celebrations. Differences in religion dont mat- ter. The club primarily focusses on social work. Blood donation camps are convened on special occasions, as well as periodic health camps.         
	Christmas joy is funded chiefly by a local member, and partly by popular subscription. Young people prepare the model of the manger and decorate the area. They were busy putting the finishing touches to the huge blue and white paper star and bell while I talked to their peers on Christmas Eve.         
	The spirit of combined fun and worship is infectious; I have always felt caught up in it when passing through the road during Christmas. It is startling to see an everyday neighbourhood dressed up and glittering, as if suddenly bright in an ancient joy. Tucked by the outer wall of the church is a little marble shrine to Hindu deities at the foot of an old tree, as tenderly looked after as the transient model of Christ in the manger. A step away is the house where Girish Chandra Bose, the botanist who founded of Bangabasi College, used to live. He was passionate about education. He would have been happy that his neighbours now demonstrate in their togetherness what education truly means.

	Blame games
         
	Sir  For years now, Calcuttans have been putting up with the worst forms of noise and air pollution caused by the ramshackle vehicles that ply in the city. Political rallies, protest marches and demonstrations are regularly held on the Brigade Parade Grounds, littering the neighbourhood and causing incalculable harm to the environment. Given this insensitivity, the Calcutta high courts ruling against holding the Book Fair to check environment damage and traffic congestion is much welcome (Dont mess with our Calcutta, Jan 29). Coming as it did on the eve of the fair, the ruling has, quite expectedly, distressed book-lovers. Perhaps the book fair could have been allowed on condition that certain rules and regulations were followed, failing which the Publishers and Booksellers Guild would have to face heavy penalties. What strikes one as most irregular is the fact that organizers who have been arranging the book fair for several decades are yet to find a permanent venue for such a significant annual event.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad 

        
	Sir  Although initially disappointed by the high court verdict on the Book Fair, I now see the necessity of such a ruling. The Publishers and Booksellers Guild has refused to learn from the mishaps in the past, including the devastating fire of 1997. The fair is passed off as an international event, though it is supported by the most primitive infrastructure. The stalls are far from fire-proof, the public toilets are in a dismal condition and the visitors eat and make merry in gay abandon. The result is a squalid and ill-kept fairground. It seems that the guild is trying to take the easy way out of this fix by rousing public sentiment, while the government babus continue to pander to it.
     
	In Mumbai, one now-closed factory has become an exhibition centre. It provides a covered, air-conditioned space, carpeted floors, a food court along with a car park for around 500 cars. There are also special transport facilities available during exhibitions or fairs. Is it all that impossible to have a similar set-up in Calcutta?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ranendra Chrestien, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It is apparent that the Publishers and Booksellers Guild does not organize the Book Fair for the love of books. Otherwise it would not have mattered to the guild where the fair was being held as long as it was allowed to take place. There is a strange and absurd idea doing the rounds that holding the fair on the Maidan befits the spirit of a grand event like the Book Fair. The sooner the guild drops such juvenile demands and arranges the fair in a more responsible manner the better it would serve the interests of book-lovers who look forward to this event.
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Arunodoy Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The Telegraphs coverage of the debates around the Calcutta Book Fair has been mature and forthright. Not only has the Publishers and Booksellers Guild been behaving appallingly, members of the intelligentsia too seem to have lost their better sense. As for the chief minister, has he not had enough egg on his face for mishandling the Rizwanur Rahman case and Nandigram? Does it behove a public servant to speak out against the high court? The reactions of the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, too, has made little sense. And to think that he himself is a trained lawyer! 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The purpose of holding a book fair is not just to sell books but to bring readers and publishers together. Those who love books would travel any distance to attend a book fair. The guild alone cannot be held responsible for the controversy over its venue, the state government is equally complicit. Even without going into the legality of the issue, it is evident that the area around Park Circus is densely populated, housing several schools, colleges and hospitals. If an event like the Book Fair were held here it would have created serious traffic congestion and exposed numerous people, including children, to health hazards. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The high court verdict on the Calcutta Book Fair has been reassuring for Calcuttans, especially for those who live around Park Circus. The way the guild has been behaving makes us wonder if its members are educated citizens or rabble-rousers. The Book Fair could have been arranged, like last year, on the Yuva Bharati Krirangan. I live close to the area and know that the place is well-connected by an efficient transport system  several buses travel to Howrah, North Calcutta and South Calcutta from here. As a resident, it hurts me a lot to hear people arguing foolishly that the stadium is not suitable for holding the fair. At least this venue, unlike the one at Park Circus, will not make the lives of common people and schoolchildren miserable. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Arnab Pal, Calcutta

   
	Sir  If Park Circus Maidan is available for numerous fairs, circus and so on, then what is wrong with holding the Book Fair there? It all depends on how the traffic controllers of the city manage to handle the situation. After all, this department does manage to regulate the flow of traffic in the entire city during Durga Puja each year. Why then would it be unable to manage the traffic around the fairground for a few days? 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Subhankar Chowdhury, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The suitable site for the Book Fair is none other than the Maidan. It is spacious enough to accommodate a large crowd, and holding the fair there would minimize traffic disruption. Moreover, there is an easily available network of transport around the area. Why is it that political rallies can be held on the Maidan, but not the Book Fair? 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Gomathy Selvaraj, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  The guild and the government should not have expected the high court to allow the Book Fair to be held on Park Circus Maidan. Instead of investing in proper infrastructure, the guild is only interested in reaping maximum profit out of this event. There is no reason why a commercial organization like it should be exempted from paying the corporation for certain civic amenities, including the use of a public space. Why then should the visitors be required to pay an entry fee?
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Madhu Garodia, Calcutta

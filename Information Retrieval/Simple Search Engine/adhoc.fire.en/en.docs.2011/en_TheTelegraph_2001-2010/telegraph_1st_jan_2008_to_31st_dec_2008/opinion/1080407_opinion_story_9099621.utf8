	Party time                  
	Sir  The editorial comment on the holding of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s 19th party congress in Coimbatore is not exactly charitable (Red in the face, March 30). The dig at the limited communist influence in India is based on partial truths. To say that the CPI(M) has a role to play only in West Bengal and Kerala is to belittle Tripura, where the party has come to power for the sixth term recently. Perhaps The Telegraph does not like the fact that the anti-incumbency factor does not work in the CPI(M)-ruled states.           
	The CPI(M) may be a regional party with little power, but over the years it has come to have some say in national politics. In its present role as the supporter of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, the party has been providing the right checks and balances so that the government cannot toe the neo-liberal and pro-capitalistic line all the way. But where is the double standard in refusing to surrender to the capitalist-imperialist diktat of the United States of America? Communism may have suffered setbacks in Soviet Union and in other European countries, but that cannot be termed a collapse of the ideology. Both Russia and other former socialist countries are perforce resorting to different models of governance, but these are not necessarily antithetical to Marxist-communist ideals.           
	Much to the dismay of the prejudiced media in India, the communists continue to do well in states like West Bengal. No amount of effort has succeeded in destroying Left unity in the country. Editorial comments will not make a beginning in this respect.          
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Arlington, US

                
	Sir  At the CPI(M) party congress in Coimbatore, Prakash Karat praised China and Vietnam for making remarkable economic progress and improving the wellbeing of the people. Karat amp; Co. have the right to pat every communist government in the world. But calling the progress of China and Vietnam remarkable is a bit far-fetched. If Karats idea of remarkable progress is Chinas per capita income of $5,300 (in purchasing power parity terms) and Vietnams per capita income of $2,600, then one is at a loss for words. Compare these figures with South Koreas per capita income of $17,930 and Taiwans $ 29,800, and it will be clear why neither Vietnam nor China is an achiever.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Body blow          
	Sir  The five-year ban imposed by the Pakistan Cricket Board on the controversial pace bowler, Shoaib Akhtar, should not have surprised anyone (Shoaib banned for five years, April 2). The severity of the sanction may have shocked some, given that the ban amounts to a career-ending decision for the 32-year-old Akhtar. But it is also true that the Rawalpindi Express had done nothing to temper his lifestyle, knowing full well that he was a public figure. He has always dangerously trod the thin line between showmanship and utter disrespect for the establishment. His latest outburst against the PCB after being denied a central contract was the final straw for the board.           
	Akhtar is most likely to exercise his right of appeal, but he ought to acknowledge that the punishment could have been harsher. What he is ruing most perhaps is the decision of the Indian Premier League team of Calcutta to keep him out as long as the ban stays. The PCB may just have shown the way to the other cricket boards on handling truant players. And that may not be such a bad thing.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

                
	Sir  The decision taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India  to keep Shoaib Akhtar out of the IPL following the PCBs ban on him  is harsh, to say the least. After the players have been auctioned and booked by teams, it is unfair to debar Akhtar from playing, especially when the PCB had no objections to Akhtar playing in the IPL. His absence from the IPL would not only hurt the prospects of his team  the Kolkata Knight Riders  but would also have repercussions on spectator-interest, and, by extension, to the BCCIs profits.           
	What is the owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders, Shah Rukh Khan, to do now? Surely the BCCI does not expect him to spend another enormous sum in scouting for and buying a replacement for Akhtar? The bowler should have been given an opportunity to prove himself on the field, whatever he may done off it. It may be noted that Andrew Symondss employers did not resort to similar measures since he was a consistent performer. If he is truly innocent, though, it will be difficult to keep him down for long.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Pooja Agarwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As a supporter of the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the IPL, I must say that I am happy to see Shoaib Akhtar go. We dont need any rotten eggs in our team.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Suhani Raman, Calcutta

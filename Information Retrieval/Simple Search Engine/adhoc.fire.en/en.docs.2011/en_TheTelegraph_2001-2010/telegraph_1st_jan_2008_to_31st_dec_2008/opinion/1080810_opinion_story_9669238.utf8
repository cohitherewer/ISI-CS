                              Sharp talker      
	 The recent WTO sessions witnessed repartees between India and the US, with Union minister, Kamal Nath, coming up trumps in some of the exchanges. For instance, after the talks failed, Susan Schwab, the US representative, reportedly said, But you know Kamal I love you, only for Nath to retort, Clearly not enough, otherwise we would have had a deal. Nath was fighting to protect Indian farmers against a likely spike in food imports from rich countries. The US, on the other hand, was hell-bent on reducing subsidies for its own lot. In the ensuing war of words, the Americans too had their moments. The witty Nath was stumped when Schwab handed him an envelope containing a dollar. Apparently, in an earlier round of talks, Nath had insisted the US reduce subsidies by a dollar; one dollar deal, he had called it then. Poor Nath now knows what it means to be paid back in ones own coin.                
	 After helping the government sail through the trust vote, Amar Singh, one would have thought, would find it difficult to stop smiling these days. Far from it, the SP gen-sec has been keeping a rather long face, or so we hear. Singhs agony has to do with the fact that Sonia Gandhi chose to ignore Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav who sat close to her at Harkishen Singh Surjeets funeral. Worse, she looked in the other direction  towards arch-rival Mayavati, with whom Madam was seen chatting animatedly. The Congress president also waited for her before she left so that Behenji could see her off to her car. Since then, a stricken Singh has reportedly been pouring his heart out to Congress leaders over the phone, hoping that his frequent calls will make Madam look in his direction the next time.                            
	 Here is some news of Amar Singhs boss. Mulayam Singh Yadav was recently asked whether the SP had any plans of joining the government. Main to nahin join kar raha hoon (I am not joining), he quipped. On being pressed harder, he added, Abhi kuch theek nahin hain. Pehle wahan se koi proposal aye (Nothing has been decided yet. Let a proposal come from there first). His party colleagues were in denial too, including Mohan Singh, the Deoria MP, as well as Ram Gopal Yadav, party gen-sec and Mulayam Singhs nephew.       
	The grapevine tells us that the majority in the party are of the view that instead of joining the government before the Lok Sabha polls, the Samajwadis should act as a pressure group and lend outside support. Some are also saying that a lot will depend on the result of seat-sharing exercise between the SP and the Congress in Uttar Pradesh. Whatever may be the real reason, all this will not be music to the ears of Congressmen. For phrases such as outside support and pressure groups are likely to bring back painful memories of friends-turned-foes leftists.                            
	 The Communist Party of India (Marxist), it seems, has profited a lot from showing Somnath Chatterjee the door. And we are not speaking metaphorically here  the party, everyone knows, is famous for its intolerance of dissenters. But in Chatterjees case, the profit was quite literal. The day Chatterjee, the present Lok Sabha speaker, was expelled from the CPI(M), every single copy of the party constitution, it seems, was bought by journalists who wanted to know the partys exact position on Chatterjees expulsion. Each copy cost five rupees, and the brisk sales must have gladdened the Redhearts. The party coffers may now be full but are the people ready to buy the theory of expulsion that is being sold by the comrades?                            
	 Politicians in the sick bay often have plenty of visitors. Not Arjun Singh though. The poor man has not been well for a week or so but few in his party have managed to visit him, the prime minister being an exception. Other Congressmen are explaining their absence by saying that they are complying with the wishes of Singhs family which does not want the leader disturbed at this point of time. But Singhs supporters in his home state, MP, are far from pleased. The lack of attention, they fear, might make Singh sicker.                            
	 Kept away from the beaches because of security, Pranab Mukherjee spent his time reading Bengali novels after the Saarc meetings. And we thought that Pranabda had lost his taste for drama after witnessing the theatrics on July 22.                        
	 This raksha bandhan, dont be surprised if a gift reaches AK Gopalan Bhavan from Lucknow. Chances are that Prakash Karat will receive a rakhi from behen Mayavati on this auspicious day. After all, the BSP supremo had addressed Karat as brother, and not comrade, after Manmohan Singh triumphed in the trust vote the other day. Karat, though, has every reason to be wary of Mayavatis overtures. Other leaders in this country have been a victim of her sisterly concern in the past. Look at what happened to Uttar Pradesh BJP leader Lalji Tandon. After the BJP-BSP alliance came undone in that state, Mayavati twisted Tandons first name and made it sound like lalchi (greedy). Needless to say, that put an end to Tandons brotherly affection for this wily woman. Going by Mayavatis previous record, Karat may soon be pining for his former friends. But for now, he might as well pay attention to the knotty problem on his wrist.

	Going by the data of the last few weeks, headline inflation is not just rising, it is accelerating. Inflation worries are no longer domestic, they are global. Concerns about stagflation  slowing economic growth even as inflation and prices are rising rapidly  are becoming much more real for policy-makers. The causes are the now-familiar suspects: commodity, food and energy prices. According to the International Monetary Funds figures, global consumer price inflation currently runs at nearly 5.5 per cent, compared to 4 per cent in recent years. For policy-makers around the world, two questions are in the forefront. Is the increase in commodity and oil prices durable, and does it reflect long-term demand and supply trends?         
	Demand has been robust for energy and commodities in emerging market countries, including China and India  a consequence of strong growth performance. Their growth momentum, which is commodity- and energy-intensive, is unlikely to slow down much, so demand is also unlikely to moderate any time soon. To make matters worse, supply conditions have not changed much. The costs of new investment in exploration and capacity have gone up significantly. Experts suggest that exploration and development costs have doubled from $5 per barrel of oil produced in 2000 to $10 a barrel. And as refineries around the world are running at nearly full capacity  no new significantly large capacity has been added for several years now  any news of disruption of existing supplies drives the prices up higher.         
	Do any of the policies we currently have in place account for the price increases? The present governments decision to not pass through the impact of oil price increases  and they have been significantly high  falls into that category. That is why when oil prices are as high as they are, state-owned oil companies in India are losing money hand over fist. And in this misery, we are not alone. The IMF estimates that of 43 emerging market countries, less than half allowed a full pass-through of oil price increases in 2007, compared to three-quarters in 2006. The distortions from politically expedient subsidies  present and new  can only make it harder to readjust if continued in the long term. Similar policies are responsible for the acceleration in food prices. For years, experts in India have been bemoaning the lack of investment in agriculture, and the governments intrusion into the pricing, marketing and distribution of agricultural commodities, mainly grain. Across Asia, industrial productivity is three-and-a-half times higher than agricultural productivity, compared to two-and-a-half times for Latin America and one-and-a-half times for industrial countries. The challenges for policy-makers in balancing politically difficult policy decisions with unavoidable options are formidable. It is not a brave new world out there, it is a scary one.

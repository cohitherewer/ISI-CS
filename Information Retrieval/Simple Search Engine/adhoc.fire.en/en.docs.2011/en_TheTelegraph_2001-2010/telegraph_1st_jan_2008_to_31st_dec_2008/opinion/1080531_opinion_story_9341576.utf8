	In a short, unpublished piece on the elements of wonder and awe in art, Meera Mukherjee (1923-1998) had expressed her views on the abstract quality of art that is the result of self-realization. Art, as I understand it, is universal: that which pleases the eye, which embraces the heart, which purifies the essence of life, which helps you lift yourself, and open up gradually to understand the world and beyond. When she made a conscious effort to create art, I was surprised the things I did not like in me came out. The hidden thoughts in dark (sic) which were ugly and unwanted were on my brush and pen or in my colours.                          
	Those who visit the current exhibition at Galerie 88 (until June 7) are most likely to be struck by the effortless grace and timeless quality of Mukherjees art. Joy is the essence of her art. It animates the myriad forms she created and is perceptible in the intricate filigree of lines that ripple like rivers and their network of tributaries over her entire body of work.        
	This joy  it would not be far-fetched to say  is perceptible even in the tree-like form inspired by the Hiroshima explosion. Instead of depicting the horrors that the atom bomb left in its trail, the mushroom cloud turns into an all-consuming ball of fire with flickering tongues of flame that dance the dance of death. Viewers are left awestruck by the terrifying beauty of this great burst of destructive energy. The sculptor, Adip Dutta, writes in the catalogue published by Galerie 88 about Mukherjees life-long search for the spirit of Viswakarma, the maker of the universe. She herself had written about her quest among our traditional artisans in the book, Viswakarmar Sandhane (1993). She had improvised a technique that allowed her to use both the indigenous methods of metal casting as well as the European lost-wax process.

	Mukherjees works were, no doubt, inspired by the simple life of village folk  people who live by the sweat of their brow and the rhythm of everyday life. Her achievement was that in her works, this uncomplicated vision segued into the world of myths and dreams that gave her works a rich texture and an overlay of fantasy without her having to imitate the Western Modern Masters. To create this effect she used the most basic of devices, the sort not unknown to the women who stitched nakshi kantha at home. The world of dreams spilled over into real life and the forms of her sculptural pieces were given shape accordingly. She stretched her forms well beyond the strictures set by classical sculpture, as if forcing herself and the viewers to extend their imagination. The Kathak dancer with extended arms and swirling veil, the children playing hopscotch, Behula dancing before the gods with her dead husband at her feet, the crush of passengers inside a minibus, the poet in a brown study, the waters of the Ganga churning fiercely and the children lustily swimming in choppy waters seem to be so charged with kinetic energy that they spill out of their frames and exist in a flux. Even more intriguing are the threads of narrative Mukherjee depicted on the forms of bronze she created. Like tree rings, they reveal themselves only on scrutiny and communicate the ageless quality of her works. A motif that keeps recurring in her work is lines in Bengali script  usually poetry  embroidered, as it were, on her forms.         
	One may or may not share Mukherjees enthusiasm for the sentimental poetry of Sukanta Bhattacharjee, but she does manage to convey her sense of wonder. Ironically, her Balmiki looks quite prosaic by contrast. While a work like Aam para (bottom right), depicting children plucking mangoes from a tree, is almost as small and delicate as a figurine, the only work that is truly statuesque is Jagaran (bottom left). A figure with loose tresses sits in a position of great composure, eyes wide open. Undulating across its wide lap are countless fine lines like rivulets flowing across meadows and dales. On its torso is a cluster of figures standing ramrod straight. It is a study of heroic proportions. Yet its strength lies in its simplicity, a quality that became the hallmark of Mukherjees works.

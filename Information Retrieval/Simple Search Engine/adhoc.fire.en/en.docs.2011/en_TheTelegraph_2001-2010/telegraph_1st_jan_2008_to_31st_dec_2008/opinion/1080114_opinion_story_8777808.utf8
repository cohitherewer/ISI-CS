	Tightening the law may not reduce the crime rate. At the same time, the presence of a deterrent in the form of stricter penalties is often necessary, so as to leave no doubt about the significance of the principles violated by the crime in question. That would be symbolic of the way society views a particular action. From that point of view, the Centres desire to tighten the laws regarding molestation of women is to be welcomed. The Centre is thinking of making molestation a non-bailable offence and of looking for ways to prevent molesters from getting off with little or no punishment. Apparently this is not just a spot reaction to the growing incidents of molestation, particularly of women from overseas, that have been reported recently. A scheme of reviewing the laws meant for the safety of women was being considered for some time. It might be asked, though, why such a scheme should take so much time to be activated. Molestations of women, sexual and non-sexual, and eve-teasing  even the phrase is a way of trivializing the crime  have shown a striking increase over the past few years. Exhortations to the police to take these crimes seriously, appeals to law-makers to change definitions and penalties, have not been lacking either. It is only now, when visitors to the country are being subjected to the treatment women in India have grown accustomed to, that the scheme has surfaced.
    
	Certain changes have to be wrought in basic conceptions. As, for example, a law which says that outraging the modesty of a woman is a crime not only sounds antiquated, but is also dangerous in that it glosses over specifics. By its very phrasing, it confines women to a preconceived notion of feminine conduct and appearance, and also, by implication, introduces a loophole through which a woman can always be blamed for the assault on her. The cultural and social attitude here is exactly the same as that towards rape  good girls cannot be sexually assaulted. There is also, as was acutely felt in cases of rape till recent times, the issue of evidence. Without witnesses, a woman finds it hard to prove that she has been the victim of insult, molestation or sexual threats. While tightening the laws would be a step towards deterrence, even that first step has to be taken with care about the terms and definitions it introduces, in order to be meaningful. The change of mindset must begin with the law-makers.

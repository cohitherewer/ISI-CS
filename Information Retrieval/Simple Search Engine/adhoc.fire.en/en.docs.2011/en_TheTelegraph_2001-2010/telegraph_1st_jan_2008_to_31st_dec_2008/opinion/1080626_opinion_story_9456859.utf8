	While the world crude price has risen by 100 per cent in the past one year, our double digit annual inflation rate stands at the moment at 11.05 per cent and the price of petro-goods as a whole has not risen more than 15 per cent. The charge of economic mismanagement against the government therefore does not sound convincing, especially since the channels through which crude price hikes hit the price index in India are not too transparent.         
	What, however, is causing the world crude price to rise? Three distinct arguments have been proffered by oil pundits to explain the crude oil phenomenon.         
	According to the first, oil producers are supplying oil at a rate that falls short of the rate at which demand for crude is growing. And the extraordinary growth in demand is being attributed to a group of nations, India and China included, which joined the bandwagon of globalization and embarked upon mind-boggling growth paths. The price of any commodity must rise in free markets when demand exceeds supply, and it is no wonder, therefore, that the world is converging on to the Middle East, pleading with it to raise crude oil supply.         
	Whether the oil-deprived destitute of the world will succeed in converting the rulers of the oil kingdoms to everlasting philanthropy is yet to be seen. The hard fact remains, though, that oil is one of the most exhaustible of resources in the world and, to the best of our knowledge, the worlds fossil fuel reserves will be scarcer than fossilized dinosaurs by the middle of the century, unless mankind hits upon alternative large-scale energy sources in the near future. This inescapable fact suggests that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will not be eager to oblige for too long. Demand-supply arguments, or what is more fashionable these days to refer to as economic fundamentals, suggest therefore that crude prices will not stabilize, except for very brief intervals, unless demand slows down.              
	Let us move on then to the second reason that might explain the oil price rise. Although less obvious than the first, it is not too difficult to grasp either. The price of oil is quoted in American dollars and, given the United State of Americas massive trade deficits as well as its economys recent recessionary tendencies, the world price of dollars has been falling against several other currencies. This, too, is a manifestation of the forces of demand and supply. However, unlike oil, it is the supply of dollars against other currencies that has overtaken demand. As the dollar turns softer, oil-producing nations find it increasingly difficult to purchase necessities from the rest of the world to sustain their economies. The world depends on them for oil and they in turn depend on the rest of the world for almost all other commodities, since, apart from oil, nature in its fancy has endowed them with sand alone.         
	Organized labour force demands pay hikes when prices of essential commodities rise and, depending on its bargaining strength, it forces the employers to succumb in varying degrees. The OPEC too is one such organization, bargaining with oil-buying nations. The dollar price of the merchandise it purchases from the latter is rising with a fall in dollar value. To prevent decay in its purchasing ability, it needs to raise the price of the commodity it sells, just as workers insist on higher wages in the face of inflation. Whether the oil buyers will agree to pay the higher price will depend on two factors, the intensity of their demand and the appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. A desire to maintain the growth momentum could well be a reason underlying unfettered demand for oil, and currency appreciation might help to sustain the demand. So long as these factors operate, a continually rising crude oil price will be sustainable. If the dollar should begin to harden over time, the oil suppliers will have less reason to insist on price rises, the demanders too will be forced to lower demand. On account of both factors, the growth rate of crude oil price would presumably slow down.         
	Speculation is the third and last factor that many analysts hold responsible for raising the price of fuel. The arguments in this context centre on forward and futures trading. Even though the institutional details of the two forms of trading are somewhat different, these technicalities may be ignored for the present discussion. Forward trading is a financial instrument used to hedge against anticipated inflation. In the context of oil, it involves a contract between the buyer and the seller for a future transaction in oil at a pre-specified price. For example, a buyer may order a barrel of crude to be delivered three months hence at $100.00 from a willing seller. If, at the head of three months, the market price of crude is $ 110.00, the buyer gains and the seller loses. The reverse occurs if the price of crude happens to be $ 90.00.         
	The buyer could be an organization like the ONGC, which gains by reducing its cost of production below what it could have been in the face of a price rise. However, the buyer may not be a producer. He may simply be a speculator who invests money, as in a stock market, with the intention of reaping pure monetary gains. And, as is often the case, the transaction is carried out through a clearing house such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. The clearing house merely arranges to pay or charge traders their gains or losses, without delivery of a single drop of oil.        
	This means that forward trading rarely involves actual hoarding of oil by buyers with the intention of raising oil prices. The traders merely forecast possible movements in oil prices for reasons unrelated to speculation and invest accordingly. This is not to deny the existence of hoarders. However, hoarding helps to raise prices temporarily by causing a dent in the normal rate of supply. Unless demand for oil keeps rising at ever-increasing rates, the rise in price generated through speculation cannot be prolonged. Prices fall once the hoarded oil is dumped in the market, thereby causing supply to exceed normal levels.               
	Thus, speculation might generate transitory hikes in prices at best and should be ignored for all practical purposes as the ultimate explanation of price rise, not only for oil, but for any storable commodity, including foodgrains. Fundamentals alone explain price rises, as is evident from the fact that Chinas raising retail oil prices by 18 per cent has led the world to lower crude price in anticipation of a fall in demand.         
	Forward trading in oil, however, has an unsavoury implication for the Indian middle class in the short run. Foreign institutional investors have been diverting their funds from the Indian stock market to forward trading in oil to reap benefits of increasing crude price. As a result, the Indian stock market has nosedived. Moreover, with a simultaneous shortage of food and edible oil, speculators within the country are resorting to commodity hoarding, thereby causing essential commodity prices to rise and leading to double digit inflation. Thus, the price-rise-adjusted rate of return in mutual funds may soon turn negative.        
	Quite apart from sacrificing current consumption on account of higher prices, the middle class will lose in terms of the value of assets stored for the future. And the poor of course will be hurt anyway. With elections around the corner, the government cannot afford this development. Indias tight monetary policy will have little impact on world oil demand and price. But it will keep commodity hoarders in check by increasing the cost of credit for them. Hopefully, it will have a sobering impact on the Indian brand of inflation.

	Left out                  
	Sir  For the Left, the definition of national sovereignty consists in being anti-America and pro-China. Given this unprincipled stand of the comrades, the United Progressive Alliance government stands to gain the peoples respect if it does not dilly-dally with the nuclear deal any further (Bell the cat, June 20). By upholding its political integrity, the Congress would be able to draw the educated urban youth into its fold, whereas, these days, mostly hooligans and the good-for-nothings join hands with the communists. Prakash Karat and his cronies are needlessly sensationalizing the ambit of the Hyde Act. The act comes into play only if India tests a device which it certainly does not do daily. The gap between the last two tests was over two decades. By the time the next test is conducted, it is expected that indigenous thorium technology will come in, when Hyde Act, or any other act, would have little effect. In the interim, the big gain would be our access to nuclear energy for civilian use.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.P. Mitra, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  One feels reassured by Manmohan Singhs valiant defiance of the Left in trying to carry the civilian nuclear deal through. Diverse energy sources are necessary to thwart inflationary pressures. It is ironic that when European countries are contemplating expanding the number of nuclear power stations, the Left is taking a step back under the dubious excuse of national interest. The wider geopolitical picture should also not be ignored in understanding the seriousness of this deal. If the deal were to fail, it would torpedo Indias shift towards the West and leave us in a strategic limbo.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Aruni Mukherjee,

	Sir  In a developing India, a rational public consensus is certainly more convincing than the blinkered views of political parties marred by mutual rivalries. The people are aware of the pros and cons of the nuclear deal with the United States of America, and thanks to democracy, the power to choose the national leader still rests with them. Now that Manmohan Singh has decided to act responsibly, putting national interest ahead of political gain, Indians would show the respect due to him for this noble action. The Left should understand that the strikes called by them to protest the hike in oil prices are not helping the public cause at all.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vineeta Trivedi, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is strange that the communists fly into a passionate rage and threaten to pull the rug from under the governments feet every time there is talk of the latter going ahead with the civilian nuclear deal with the US. The comrades do not appear as belligerent when inflation hits the common man, oil prices rise alarmingly and the economy plummets.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ramani P. Easwaran, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The prime minister has honoured the trust the people of India vested in him when he took oath in 2004. While it is easy rhetoric calling India the next global superpower, it is quite another thing to translate that vision into reality. The communists may be trying to bring capital into India, but when it comes to principles of statesmanship, they remain as uncouth and unoriginal as ever.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Devesh Kumar Jha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Manmohan Singh and his backers in the media have some hard questions to answer before the euphoria surrounding the Indo-US nuclear deal waylays us all. Why is the US exerting so much pressure for the deal if it gains nothing from it? Given the alarming signals sent out by the USS Trenton/NS Jalashwa episode, are there any hidden protocols behind this deal? If the idea is to prop up India against China, is it ever likely that the US will take on China? Even if the US won, its own economy would be utterly destroyed. Perhaps the US is planning to use India as a proxy? And why should we sign a deal with a discredited US president and make ourselves willing allies of a man whom his own people hate? Both John McCain and Barack Obama are promising a new anti-Bush US.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

                
	Sir  The Congress is all out to sign the nuke deal, come what may. The Lefts opinion on the deal deserves to be ignored. Brazen self-seeking has been the trademark of leftist politics. Indians are tired of its threats of pulling out support from the UPA.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The triple punch of soaring inflation, threat of the withdrawal of Left support and then the Bahujan Samaj Partys pulling out of the UPA has darkened the horizon for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Even allies like Rashtriya Janata Dal, Nationalist Congress Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham, after extending unqualified support, have now started talking with a forked tongue. They are for the deal but they are also with the Left, such has been their ruse to satisfy both the sides. This has made the comrades go for the kill by accusing the government of carrying out a massive disinformation campaign on the virtues of the deal. They say the virtues of energy security have been grossly oversold. Clearly, the prime minister is being sucked into this political propaganda, in which the communists have an edge at this point. However, a man of Manmohan Singhs integrity cannot be easily double-crossed. His firm stand on the deal has even provoked Sonia Gandhi to break her usual silence and hold up his cause.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhur Mohanty, Bhubaneswar

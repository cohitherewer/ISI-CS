	It would not have been undemocratic of the Union labour minister to condemn the brutal murder of L.K. Chowdhury in Uttar Pradeshs Greater Noida on September 22. Compassion towards workers from managers was more or less the theme of the ministers public statement about Chowdhury being clobbered to death by a group of workers from the Indian subsidiary of a leading Italian company of which Chowdhury was the managing director. There is no reason to believe that the formation of workers representative bodies, or unions, could not be part of an industrially developing society in the 21st-century, where foreign investment and involvement were beginning to grow. But how union members choose to communicate their sense of entitlements  whether by lawful channels of redress or by descending upon the management in hordes to crack open skulls with iron rods  is what the minister is expected to have a firmer opinion on.        
	There are several factors behind the ministers refusal to condemn the violence unequivocally. First, the law-and-order infrastructure within which such a condemnation would have been possible is far from being in place. The police arrived on the scene several hours after the agitating workers started beating up the management, and quicker action could have saved Chowdhurys life. The Italian embassy had also been recommending police protection for the Greater Noida unit for a while, but to no avail. As everybody in West Bengal would recognize and understand, the tyranny of unions is directly proportional to ineffectual policing, both being deeply linked to inordinate politicization. Yet, the problem in Greater Noida, as elsewhere in UPs industrial zones, is not simply that of law and order. It would be wrong, in ones condemnation of the ministers lopsided priorities, to pay no attention at all to what he also said about the reform of labour laws, redressal mechanisms, and more specifically about the rights of contract workers. In a rapidly globalizing world, these structures have to be clearly reworked, and with fairness and workers rights naturally at the centre of things. But to fail to see, as a result, that murder is murder irrespective of context, is a dangerous form of political confusion that compromises the first principles of a civilized democracy.

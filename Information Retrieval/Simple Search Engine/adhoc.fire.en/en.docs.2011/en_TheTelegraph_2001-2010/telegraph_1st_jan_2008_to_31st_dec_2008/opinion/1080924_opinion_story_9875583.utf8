	When it is a question of winning votes, serious thinking about what is best for the people takes a backseat. The Rajinder Sachar committee report was embarrassing on many counts; all governments, whether at the Centre or in the states, are in a hurry to appear to be acting on it. The committee found that the percentage of Muslim undergraduates is shockingly low compared to the percentage of the Muslim population in the country. So the minority affairs ministry, supported by the human resource development ministry, has recommended to the Centre to include in its plan of new Central universities three minority universities. These would reserve 50 per cent of seats for students from the minority community, and enjoy enough autonomy to cater to the needs of the Muslim community in particular. Quotas on the basis of religion are unconstitutional, but the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004 permits reservations up to 50 per cent for the group for the benefit of which the institution is established. The three proposed universities, however, will not be established and administered privately; the Central government is taking over that role.        
	The Sachar committee report gives a far broader view than just the percentage of undergraduate students. If it is taken seriously, the changes it points to would require more meaningful policies. The driving principle of such policies should be the desire to erase the sense of being disadvantaged on account of faith. This cannot be done without addressing issues of poverty, the impediments to mainstream education and stealthy discrimination. What is needed, together with policies, are discussions with the communitys religious leaders as well as the articulation of the aspirations of the community. The percentage of undergraduate students depends on the spread and standard of school education. To create special spaces, as the phrase cater to the needs of the Muslim community in particular suggests, is to perpetuate differences, not dissolve them. Higher education is aimed at academic and professional excellence; the only differences there would be of merit, not of religion or caste. Support to the economically disadvantaged is understandable, and that would embrace all religions, castes and ethnicities. But special universities for different communities would only increase fragmentation; it is reservation at its worst.

                            Your relief or mine?      God helps those who help themselves. And Indias god-like politicians help those who cannot. The havoc caused by the Kosi floods is heart-rending. And the Union railways minister, Lalu Prasad, has naturally risen to the occasion. The railways ministry funds are being used to provide relief to the hapless people of Bihar and Lalu Prasad himself is leaving no stone unturned in publicizing his efforts. The problem is there is another minister who is showing equal concern for the people  the Union steel and fertilizer minister, Ram Vilas Paswan. The Loktantrik Janata Party leader is reported to have set up a huge control room in the SAIL headquarters at the Ispat Bhavan, and its operations are being manned by no less than 500 of the SAIL staff. Like his political rival in the state, Paswan is doling out relief in cash and kind from the profits of the public sector company under his ministry. And, like Lalu Prasad, he is making his good intentions known. None can doubt their sincerity or raise delicate questions about whether, ahem, it is alright to use the profits of the railways and SAIL, run on taxpayers money, for flood relief at their own sweet will. Its election time, you see!                          
	The appeal of a film star is difficult to resist. Even the Marxists are susceptible to it. In Andhra Pradesh, they are under intense pressure to dump N Chandrababu Naidu and join hands with Chiranjeevi. But keeping up with his image of anti-change, the CPI(M) gen-sec, Prakash Karat, has vetoed it. So has his compatriot in the CPI, although the state party unit, led by Sudhakar Reddy, has different ideas. There are rifts within the top CPI(M) leadership itself on the issue. Sitaram Yechury doesnt mind Chiranjeevi, but Karat obviously does. But then Yechury and Karat do not seem to be looking at the same things the same way. Take Jayalalithaa, who is now keen to hold hands again.                         
	 The house of the Union minister for information and broadcasting, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, is in complete disorder. His wife, Deepa, has revolted against him and faxed her resignation from her post as gen-sec of the state Congress committee to him. There have been others in the 107-member jumbo committee who have followed Deepa, now a leader in her own right. Apparently, Deepa has trained her sights on becoming the working president. Priyada needs to remember that what a man does, a woman does better.                             
	 If Didi comes, can her brothers be far behind? The band of brothers, from the militant Madan Mitra to the suave Derek OBrien, has been at Mamata Banerjees beck and call in Singur over the past week. While some were seen rushing to serve khichuri from baltis, others were running from pillar to post to replenish acrylic colours for Didi to paint kashphul. But one man is missing from the scene. Sougata Roy, who never fails to come up with a literary allusion or two even in the face of the most banal political debate, is nowhere to be seen, either in the vicinity of Singur or the Raj Bhavan. Where is he? Last heard, he was wailing somewhere near Jerusalem s wall.                            
	 Its showtime folks! Both the BJP and the Congress have duly kicked off their campaigns in Delhi, but the results are remarkably different. While Vijay Goels do at the Ramlila Maidan was a runaway success, the Congresss was a damp squib. But a section of the Congressmen wasnt complaining. The partys gathering was organized by Sajjan Kumar, the bte noire of Sheila Dixit. The CMs camp ensured that none of the top Congress leaders showed up. There were absentees at the BJP meet too, but mainly from the second-rung leadership. Interestingly, where Delhi is concerned, it is the BJP, and not the Congress, that is faced with a difficulty. With Arun Jaitley unwilling to be sidelined from central politics, there is practically no one with the right stature to take on Dixit. Time for some more chintan!                            
	 There is something called a parting gift. With his end as the Union home minister quite obvious, Shivraj Patil seems to be concentrating on giving his department what he still can. Thanks to his initiative, the home ministry canteen is about to get quality and wholesome foodstuff. An additional secretary-level officer has been entrusted with the task of improving the menu and the ambience. Patil, who had inspected the canteen soon after assuming office in 2004, wished to add elegance to it. Now that the babus pay packets are heavy, there is indeed some need for it.                           
	A rule is a rule is a rule  for ordinary prisoners that is. And the jail superintendent in Bhopal Central Jail will not bend it to accommodate the wishes of the women inmates. They are dying to see their former companion, the illustrious Monica Bedi, in Big Boss II, but the jail allows no cable channels to be shown on its televisions. Only Doordarshan is allowed, which, one long suspected, had become synonymous with torture. Anyway, when Monica got evicted from the Big Boss house, away from the eyes of the jail inmates, the whole of Bhopal came to a standstill as people stayed home to watch her go. Perhaps, together with the women prisoners, the people of Bhopal now hope to see her back in the Big Boss jail with its celebrity inmates. As for Monica herself, she must be quite relieved to get back to driving around in her own car in Mulund and its whereabouts, dreaming of making it big again.

	Faust in Copenhagen: The Struggle for the Soul Of Physics And The Birth Of the Nuclear Age 
  By Gino Segr egrave;, Pimlico, pound;8.50  
	This, as the author himself says, is a small book on a massive subject. What is more, of the seven scientists who are the main actors in this book, four  Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli  would, by any reckoning, rank among the greatest physicists of the world. A fifth character, Lise Meitner, was one of the most important experimentalists of the last century who never won in her lifetime the recognition she deserved. The other two are Max Delbruck (later to become the founding father of molecular biology) and Paul Ehrenfest, perhaps the greatest teacher of them all.  
	The year is 1932 and the place Copenhagen, the city where Bohr worked. Here a group of scientists gathered for a week-long conference to discuss the new work that had led to the emergence of quantum physics. The stars of the conference were the scientists mentioned here. The leading star was Bohr himself, about whom Heisenberg, not given to hyperbole, was to write, Bohrs influence on the physics and the physicists of our century was stronger than that of any one else, even that of Albert Einstein.        
	This book is about the human side of science and scientists, describing not only what the physicists did but how they did it and what they were like. As human beings, they were not too similar, but for the fact that among them were a disproportionate number of music lovers and mountain climbers. The other common trait is that the three  Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac  who were leaders in the field of quantum physics, were all born in the first three years of the 20th century.        
	Segr keeps the 1932 Copenhagen conference in the foreground, but puts it in the context of the titanic battle between classical mechanics and quantum theory. This enables him to take his readers through the history of early 20th century physics, beginning with Max Plancks discovery that radiation travelled in packets of energy, and Ernest Rutherfords discovery of the structure of the atom. This is followed by a description of the radical breakthroughs achieved by Bohr, Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac.        
	Copenhagen 1932 was, however, not all work. At play, Delbruck wrote a skit and had it performed. The skit was a parody of Goethes Faust with some of the leading scientists as characters  with Bohr (obviously) appearing as the Lord, and Pauli as Mephistopheles.        
	If Goethe captured the triumph of new knowledge through the Enlightenment, breaking the shackles of medieval obscurantism, this book captures, through the works of some eminent scientists, the drama concerning the birth of a new physics that transformed mans conception of the world, even if in a devastating way.

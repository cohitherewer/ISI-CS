The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Analysis of a Defeat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ANALYSIS OF A DEFEAT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	As the dust settles on the defeat of the Congress in Karnataka, and the party continues to live in denial, the bizarre yet true story of the return of S.M. Krishna has begun to unfold. When he was asked by the high command in Delhi to resign as the governor of Maharashtra and join the campaign for the elections in Karnataka, he had agreed quite readily. He was upbeat about a possible victory even though he was well aware that the battle would not be an easy one. Nevertheless, Krishna took on the challenge since he was familiar with the political terrain of Karnataka, having served as a former chief minister of the state.        
	Bangalore had become an international information technology destination under Krishnas regime. Then political change ensued, as it always does when local constituents, hungry for change, compel greater competition by voting for the opposition. The dispensation that replaced Krishnas failed to deliver on the new dreams of another generation. It failed to hold its ground as a competent, functioning coalition. Presidents rule followed and elections were declared.         
	Krishna was expected to deliver Karnataka but not fight an assembly seat himself! This is the kind of perverse politics that has engulfed the Congress, nearly choking it to death. Delhi felt that he would be distracted from the larger goal of a victory for the party if he were to fight a personal election. That one absurd decision, verging on an insult, taken in isolated and insular Delhi, diluted his authority and curbed his ability to lead effectively. Digvijay Singh, Prithviraj Chauhan and Ahmed Patel were the alien trimurti that interfered, ordered and succeeded in engineering the defeat by creating active lobbies, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes deliberately, in an effort to divide and rule.                 
	A new beginning        
	The archaic tactics of a failed party administration, out of sync with a changed political environment, sounded the death knell for the Congress in Karnataka. Krishna was dignified in his defeat, Chauhan seemed as though he would break into tears if he were asked another question and the rest have faded out of view like a mirage. Their stony silence establishes their insecurity, failure and the resultant guilt.        
	The Congress needs a lens implant to have its sight restored. It is becoming increasingly clear that, in contemporary India, constituents want to support individuals, not superimposed, impersonal puppets that party chieftains choose on the basis of their personal equations with the contenders, or because of self serving interests of all kinds. This kind of political baggage that the Congress insists on carrying has weighed down the rickety infrastructure. The party leaders continue to manipulate and prevent any competition, which effectively means anything that might be able to unseat the fossilized personages presently at the helm of the Congress.         
	This could well be a blessing in disguise  if one can call the intrigues disguised  for Rahul Gandhi and his generation. If the decrepit lot is crucified, the party could go through a metamorphosis, regroup and reinvent itself under a modern leader who is equipped to face the challenges of a changing world. Imagine the flow of fresh air and ideas, appropriate solutions to age- old conflicts into the arteries of 24 Akbar Road and then into the endless veins of the Congress that crisscross this sub-continent. The Congress has been written off in the past, has been resurrected several times by new leaders, and is bound to go through those contortions again and deliver another leader. Demolished in 1977, Indira Gandhi romped home to power months after that post-Emergency debacle. This could happen again if there is political will, shorn of intrigue and intellectual corruption.

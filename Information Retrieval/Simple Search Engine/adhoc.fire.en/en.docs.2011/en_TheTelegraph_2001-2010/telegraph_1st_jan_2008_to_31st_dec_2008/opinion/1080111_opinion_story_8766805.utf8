	Some traditions, like old habits, die hard. Whether they were mighty kings or some insignificant local chieftain, rulers always loved to confer honours and titles on their chosen ones. Their reasons were often brazenly patronizing or manipulative; sometimes they were simply amusing. Feudalism or monarchy may have been replaced by democracy. But the tradition of the ruler distributing patronage and honours has been kept alive by modern, democratic governments. In India, the system of the government conferring civilian honours is clearly a legacy of the raj. The problem with it is that it is liable to be misused for all kinds of reasons. There have been cases when British honours were known to have been bought. It is not always the fault of governments that confer such titles. The recipients are also not to blame in most cases. The real problem lies in a system that is fundamentally flawed. In India, successive governments choices for honours such as the Bharat Ratna have generated avoidable controversies. Even to the people who are supposed to know of the Indian musical traditions, the choice of Lata Mangeshkar or the late Ustad Bismillah Khan for the honour was at best contentious. 
    
	Lal Krishna Advanis plea that the Centre confer the Bharat Ratna on Atal Bihari Vajpayee this year raises other questions about the practice. Mr Vajpayees suitability or otherwise for the award is the least relevant of the questions. But the most troublesome question that some may ask is whether Mr Advani has a motive for making the suggestion. It is entirely possible that Mr Advani has no political or personal motive and has been guided solely by his own assessment of Mr Vajpayees many achievements in public life. Large sections of the people in India may actually share Mr Advanis admiration for the former prime minister. But recent happenings in the Bharatiya Janata Party, especially Mr Vajpayees endorsement of Mr Advani as the partys prime ministerial candidate in the next general elections, will prompt political rivals to attribute motives to the latters suggestion. If the government accepts the suggestion and confers the honour on Mr Vajpayee, it will be seen as a result of open lobbying. If it ignores the plea, unnecessary controversies may be caused. Neither decision can do much good to Mr Vajpayees honour or his image.

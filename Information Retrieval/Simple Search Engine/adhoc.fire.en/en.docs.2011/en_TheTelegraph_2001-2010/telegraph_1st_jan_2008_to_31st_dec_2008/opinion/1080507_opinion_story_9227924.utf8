	Loose talk                  
	Sir  It seems that the world has not heard the last of Bushisms. As the holder of the most important job in the world, George W. Bush should have been better advised before insinuating that Indians are responsible for the global food crisis (Bush points food finger at India, May 4). Perhaps President Bush ought to be reminded that it is the people of his own country, as well as those belonging to the developed world, who are habitually copious consumers. For years now, the prosperous countries have classified India as developing, and expressed their sympathy in the form of loans that have been doled out for the needy here. Now that India is stepping out of the shadow of poverty, the West has started getting apprehensive.           
	Bush considers Indias demand for better food and nutrition to be a possible reason for the looming global food crisis. Is he implying then that Indians have no right to lead a healthy life? What was also shocking was Bushs snide remark regarding the prosperity of Indias burgeoning middle classes. It appears that he is envious of this section of the populace because it is intelligent, educated and becoming wealthier. America would probably be delighted if India stands before it with a begging bowl once again. Instead of accusing India for being responsible for the food crisis, Bush should pay more attention to the recession in his own country. In any event, Bush should have no problems with an affluent India. The more India prospers, the more easy it would be for Bush to sell American goods in this country and rake in huge profits.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Given the drift of his comments, it is certain that George W. Bush seems to be angry with the Indian government for reasons that go beyond the food crisis. He was probably venting spleen for the delay in the signing of the Indo-US nuclear deal. In any case, Bushs comments, which followed similar remarks made by Condoleezza Rice earlier, deserve a severe reprimand from India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Political leaders generally blame others for their own failures. The American president has blamed India for the foodgrain crisis in his country, while the Congress at the Centre considers global inflation as the cause behind the price rise in India. Leaders in India and the United States of America are still engaged in formulating a nuclear deal. Their priority should also have been making food available for all at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, their focus, so far, has been on removing the hurdles in the path of the nuclear deal. Hence, it is not surprising that these two nations are now facing the consequences of the silent tsunami.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Ranchi

                
	Sir  Statistics show that Americans eat five times more than Indians. America is also the country with the largest incidence of obesity in the world. Food there is not eaten, but gorged and wasted in plenty. The Americans thus have no moral right to be critical of the food habits of the people of India and China.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayar interprets George W. Bushs tone as almost accusatory, and goes on to add that the American president thinks that Indians have no right to be prosperous and demand better things. Is it not possible that the presidents comments were more complimentary  pointing out that standards of life are improving in India  than disparaging in nature? The fiery reaction back home seems somewhat misplaced. After all, Bush did give a number of reasons for the food crisis and we need to read his comment on India in the wider context.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Controversial comments from George W. Bush make strange bedfellows of sworn enemies. Recently, Bush stated that Indias middle classes, larger than the entire population of the US, are now demanding better nutrition, and that this has led to a rise in global food prices. To my mind, the president simply stated a fact, and there is nothing objectionable about his statement. However, Indian politicians, forgetting their divisions, are now up in arms against Bush. D. Raja and Brinda Karat, the most loquacious of the Left politicos, have seized the opportunity to unleash yet another vitriolic attack on the US. The BJP too fielded V.K. Malhotra, who wondered if Bush wants Indians to die of hunger. Jairam Ramesh of the Congress pitched in as well, questioning Bushs academic credentials to speak on a subject as complicated as economics. It seems the biggest achievement of Bushs career lies in his success in uniting Indias warring political parties.

	Parting shot          
	Sir  As an ex-student of Presidency College, I am shocked to know that the college has decided to do away with admission tests for its undergraduate courses in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, Bengali, geology and sociology (Presidency to have board cut-offs, May 1). In spite of the efforts of the ruling party to lower the academic standards of this prestigious institution, Presidency College has maintained its position among the best. The admission test is a way of ensuring that only students with a certain aptitude get admitted to the college. With the test abolished, many undeserving students will get selected, thereby compromising the academic standards of the college.           
	Yours faithfully,

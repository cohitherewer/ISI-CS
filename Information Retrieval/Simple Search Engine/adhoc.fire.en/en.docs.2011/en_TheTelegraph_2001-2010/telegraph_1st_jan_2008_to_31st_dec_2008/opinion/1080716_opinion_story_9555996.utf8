	Too Personal              
	A case of cheating and criminal breach of trust was recently settled with both the parties filing a compromise petition before the court. The petition indicated that none of the involved individuals wished to proceed against each other any more. The state government opposed the compromise, pointing out that under Section 406 of Indian Penal Code (Punishment for Criminal Breach of trust) the offence was punishable, especially when the amount involved was above Rs 250. But the Supreme Court dismissed the application. It held that when disputes were purely personal, the court should ordinarily accept the terms of settlement and put an end to the dispute. The time thus saved could then be utilised for more effective and meaningful litigations. (Madan Mohan Abbot Vs State of Punjab)              
	Errant Substitute              
	A postmaster working as a substitute in a post office was dismissed recently. An enquiry under the Post and Telegraph Extra-Departmental Agents (conduct and service) revealed that he was responsible for financial irregularities in the Recurring Deposit Accounts of the post office. The substitute post master challenged the order of dismissal. One of the points raised by him was that since he was only working as a substitute for the permanent postmaster, the rules were not relevant in his case. The Madras High Court, however, disagreed. It held that even in the absence of any rule, the offender could be punished in compliance with the principles of natural justice. If he was capable of such an act as a substitute, he didnt deserve to be employed at all. (Superintendent of Post Offices Vs Panner Selvam)              
	Save A Life                    
	According to the provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, the approval of an Authorisation Committee is necessary for obtaining human organs from a donor. And the statute does not allow donation of human organs in exchange for money. The committee recently turned down a person suffering from renal failure, suspecting financial bonding between the donor and the patient rather than a close relationship, as the statute requires. The only ground for the committees suspicion, however, was that the two individuals had not known each other for long. The Madras High Court held that the decision did not disclose enough reasons for suspecting financial bonding. It also held that since the case involved saving a life  the patient was undergoing dialysis and required immediate transplantation  the authorities should reconsider it in a more humane manner instead of adopting a technical approach.

Samoon Vs Authorisation Committee)       SOLON

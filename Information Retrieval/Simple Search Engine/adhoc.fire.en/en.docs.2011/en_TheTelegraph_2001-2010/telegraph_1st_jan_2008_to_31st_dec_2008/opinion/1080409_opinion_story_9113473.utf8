                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lawyers   their best
				       Lawyers can now advertise their legal proficiency through websites.   Vishnupriya Sengupta reports on the implications                                                             At your fingertips: Need a lawyer? Check the Net		      
	Litigants brace yourselves. You will now be spoilt for choice. For lawyers have finally obtained the green signal from the Bar Council of India (BCI) to advertise their wares or rather services online. With that, legal advertising carries the long overdue stamp of legality.         
	The BCI  constituted under the Advocates Act of 1961 to regulate legal practice in India  and state bar councils passed a resolution on January 28 this year agreeing to amend the Rules of Professional Conduct and Ethics to enable lawyers to disseminate information on their qualifications, areas of specialisation, standing and skills only through websites. However, such information will have to be provided in a particular format prescribed by the BCI and the respective state bar councils so as to prevent deceptive claims.         
	Nearly two-and-a-half months have gone by since the amendment to the contentious Rule 36, which prohibited advocates from advertising their services. But lawyers are still to come to terms with its implications and get accustomed to the level-playing field that the amendment is meant to ensure.         
	While a majority of legal professionals laud this move, there are sceptics who contend that the BCIs ruling in favour of legal advertising has reduced the legal profession to a trade which may be solicited through advertisements. A litigant should approach the lawyer, but now it seems the tables have turned, they say. Moreover, they claim, advertising legal services even if it be online could affect the integrity of advocacy.         
	Such apprehensions are baseless, assures Geetanath Ganguly, executive chairman, State Legal Aid Services, West Bengal. The BCI being the highest authority would obviously ensure that there are no ethical constraints, he underlines, adding, I think this move was much needed to keep pace with global changes, the changing nature of legal services and the legal process outsourcing business. In todays context, global exposure is mandatory and if lawyers can advertise their legal proficiency through websites, their prospects will only be enhanced.         
	A system of advertising legal services through websites and brochures is in vogue in most countries in the West, facilitating transparency and accessibility. For instance in the US, free flow of commercial information and individual advertisements, though entirely commercial, is allowed in general public interest.         
	However, such attorney advertising does not go unregulated. Lawyers are allowed to advertise with certain restrictions: the advertisement must not contain inaccurate statements. Nor can it suggest that the attorney is affiliated to a government agency or that the attorneys firm is an extension of governments office. The guidelines for attorneys advertising also prohibits inaccurate and misleading claims about the nature of legal services, the quality of legal services and comparisons between providers of legal services as well as a statement guaranteeing the outcome of a case.         
	In India, since online legal advertising has just received a seal of approval from the BCI, the guidelines are a little more flexible and measures have to be adopted to plug the loopholes as and when they surface.         
	Says Prasun Mukherjee, practicing lawyer at the Calcutta High Court, While buying and selling services can increase awareness among people, be cost effective and enhance the quality of service, it can at the same time be misleading. A refined CV of a lawyer need not necessarily vouch for his acumen and competence in handling both civil and criminal suits. The ground reality may be far different from what is projected virtually.         
	However, some lawyers are upbeat about the fact that they will now be able to compete on a global platform. Litigants, too, on their part see it as a boon rather than a bane. If the credentials of the lawyer are available on the Internet along with his co-ordinates, it makes the task of zeroing in on an Indian lawyer much easier, says Nilesh Chaudhuri, a software engineer who has been living in Canada for the past eight years.         
	That perhaps accounts for the fact that over the past three years or so, the volume of traffic on legal sites has gone up by 20 per cent. It gives clients abroad a range of options to choose from and often saves them the trouble of coming down to India to settle matters pertaining to property or even marriage, says Anil Bhatt, an online marketing consultant who is in the business of promoting different kinds of websites.         
	Advocate S.K. Burman, who provides legal advice, support and assistance to his non-resident Indian clients in matters pertaining to real estate, civil, criminal and other laws, agrees. Although the Internet provides him with a supplementary clientele (his main income is generated through local clients), online legal advertising has helped him build a rapport with his NRI clients. There are some whom I havent ever met. It is only via e-mail or over the phone that we communicate. But still, there is an implicit bond of trust. Some of them have even become friends, he says.         
	But not all are convinced of the merits of allowing lawyers to advertise. In this profession, its practice which makes perfect and not ones networking or marketing skills, says lawyer R. Swaminathan. With this amendment, those with money and resources will be in a better position to market themselves and this will lead to unhealthy competition.         
	Nitin Goel, who practices at the Delhi High Court, offers a counter argument. A member of the Supreme Court Bar Association, he argues, It will now make lawyers far more accountable to their clients as they will remain in the public eye. Only those who are into this profession by way of inheritance are opposing it. It is they who would like to make a concerted effort to restrict the legal profession to a small clique and not allow anyone else to share the limelight or prosper on account of their competence. As of now, Goel merely had his name and address on the Internet. But now that the BCI has waived Rule 36, he plans to insert a more detailed CV.         
	Vandana Vaidya, who practises at the high court and district court in Bangalore and is also a registered patent attorney, highlights yet another aspect. Article 20 of the Constitution guarantees a citizen the right to appoint a counsel or a pleader of his / her choice to conduct a case. For this, the public will have to know what an advocate specialises in and his or her proficiency in the respective area. Only then will a litigant be able to entrust him or her with a case.         
	Point taken. And with young India turning Internet savvy, in the years to come lawyers perhaps will merrily argue their way to the bank.

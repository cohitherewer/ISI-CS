                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JUST NOT ENOUGH                                                    
	When a country, however large, experiences 44 bomb blasts in 140 days from mid-May to end-September, with count of the dead going up to 152 and the injured to 445, it is time to wonder whether it has an intelligence system at all. Most recently, blasts occurred in two states almost at the same time, in spots crowded with shoppers and worshippers breaking their Ramazan fast and gearing up for Eid. Malegaon in Maharashtra had experienced a terror attack two years ago. That crowds protested violently against the police when the latter claimed that the explosions were caused by a cylinder burst is an index of the sensitiveness of the local population. In Gujarat, a bag dropped from a passing motorcycle in a minority community-dominated area exploded in the hands of the man who picked it up, in an eerie replay of the explosion in Delhis Mehrauli on Saturday. And that was the second explosion in Delhi within the fortnight.        
	The frequency of the attacks, the echoes and replays leave no shred of doubt that whatever the government and administration are doing, it is simply not enough. While the bomb went off in Modasa, a large number of low-intensity bombs were discovered and defused in Ahmedabad, once again in an echo of the time when explosions took place in Ahmedabad and the police defused bombs in Surat. It is festival time in most of India, and it is easy to kill, destroy, terrify, and create confusion and conflict. It is now becoming impossible not to feel that the police and intelligence-gathering agencies are as confused as the people must be. When the statement from the Union home ministry asks the people to put their shoulder to the wheel and make sure that these things dont happen it is, perhaps, as unnerving as watching the number of attacks mount up. It would seem that it is the fabric of cultural and social life that is being chiefly targeted, which is the best way to assail political stability. Yet major political parties are behaving in a pitifully predictable way  deploring the deaths and blaming rivals either for bad management or poor laws or poorer law-keeping. With the Lok Sabha elections ahead, the terror attacks have become part of the parties hard-sell for the polls from differing viewpoints. Is it not as important for the political parties to act responsibly and unitedly against terror as it is for the people to keep peace?

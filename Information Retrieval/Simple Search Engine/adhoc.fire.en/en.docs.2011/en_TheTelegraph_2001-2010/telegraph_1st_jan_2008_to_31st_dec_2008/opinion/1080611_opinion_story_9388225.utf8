	Cost control                  
	Sir  The prime minister has appealed to his cabinet colleagues to exercise economy in public expenditure and has stressed the need for cutting down on travel costs, both for foreign as well as domestic travel, unless absolutely necessary (Cut costs, PM tells ministers, June 6). This appeal (or command) for the practice of austerity among ministers in order to set an example to the public is nothing new. It has been made sporadically since 1973, when the oil crisis first started. Government strictures on the curtailment of expenses by ministers are only honoured in the breach. It is unlikely that the misuse of cars and fuel will stop as soon as another set of circulars is issued by the cabinet secretariat. The only way to implement these unwritten rules is to order a scrutiny on the travel schedules of all ministers. A reduction in the perks offered to government officials is likely to cause uproar in their ranks. The president, prime minister, cabinet ministers and political leaders in general should shorten their cavalcades and cut down on their security cover to save on fuel and security expenses. Why doesnt the prime minister become the first to set an example? Cutting unnecessary government expenses will also arrest corruption and automatically pull up the economy. The United Progressive Alliance as well as the National Democratic Alliance have set poor precedents in such matters. The prime ministers appeal, however sincere it may be, will remain an example of good rhetoric, and not much else.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The prime minister has advised his colleagues to effect severe cuts in their air travel, particularly on foreign trips, asking them to go on such tours only when it is absolutely necessary. Does this imply that they have been going on unnecessary, private, unofficial jaunts on taxpayers money all this while? The finance ministry has also directed that government events held at five-star hotels will no longer be paid for. Thus, it is obvious that such events can be held just as well at lower cost. Why has this not been done all along, given that the money for such luxuries come from the public? It has been estimated that simple cuts in the expenses of government officials can save upto Rs 6,000 crore annually. This amount may be a tiny fraction of the oil bonds that the government plans to issue, but it is still enough to improve rural healthcare in the country. Moreover, why should a self-respecting government have such overheads as non-essential expenses? If the Left-run governments can cut sales taxes on petroleum products, then it must mean that the governments could make do without these taxes in the first place, without burdening unsuspecting people with them.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Easy tears          
	Sir  In the last two months, the Bharatiya Janata Partys prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, has twice shed tears before the media. His uncontrolled emotions in a television interview and at Assochams annual meet brought out the soft and sensitive side of his persona (Tears for film and verse, not a drop for riots, June 8). His hardened public face and his brand of belligerent Hindutva had hitherto overshadowed this side. An 81-year old leader getting teary-eyed and choking with emotions will undoubtedly sway the sympathies of viewers instinctively in his favour. Critics will, of course, trash it as a carefully calibrated move to win public support. But the fact remains that the BJP patriarch has been able to strike an emotional chord with legions of viewers.           
	One wonders who in the Congress can match Advanis gimmicks. It seems a little preposterous to imagine Rahul Gandhi, the presumed chosen one, would pull a stunt such as this. The senior members of the Congress are too busy concocting their own political schemes to use tears as a political weapon. The Congress must be worried, though, that Advani is shedding such frequent tears. The party must find a tearjerker from its own ranks so as not to let the BJP run away with all the sympathy votes. It certainly is a cost-effective method of garnering public sympathy.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Prafulla Moharathy, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  The film, Taare Zameen Par, caused L.K. Advani to weep copiously. One could indeed ask him if the massacre of real men, women and children in Gujarat in 2002 was not as worthy of his tears as the tribulations of a celluloid child. Is it that Advanis autobiography, My Country, My Life, has not sold enough copies? Is his newfound soft public persona an attempt to boost the books sales?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Phone frenzy          
	Sir  Ashok V. Desais The coming break (June 3) gives an accurate picture of the future of telecommunications in India. Indias high teledensity figures betray the ways in which mobile customers are being fooled by their service providers. New offers in the market regularly lure customers into subscribing. But these become unavailable at the whims of the companies. It is all a wicked ploy to beguile customers into parting with their hard-earned money. When it comes to providing efficient service, these companies show none of the zeal with which they hound customers into buying subscriptions.                     
	Yours faithfully,

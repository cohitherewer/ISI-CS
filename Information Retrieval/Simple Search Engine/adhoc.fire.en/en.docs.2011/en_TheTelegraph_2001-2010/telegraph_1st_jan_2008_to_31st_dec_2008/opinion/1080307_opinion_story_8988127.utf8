                                                                                                                 IN KEEPING                                                    
	In the contemporary world, it is impossible to stop the movement of artefacts and antiquities beyond the borders of the nation. And not all of this traffic amounts to smuggling. But the culture ministry is now proposing to relax the law so that national antiquities can be sent out on loan all over the world from their protected sites (museums or digs) to people and institutions interested in these objects for purposes of education and research. This amounts to taking the idea of globalized openness in a dangerously unwise direction. If an art historian in Santiniketan wants to write a learned article on the Mona Lisa and asks the Louvre to send it over to Kala Bhavan for him to sit with it day and night, he is likely to cut a rather absurd figure. However, it is expected that the museum, or the French government, would be able to arrange for funding for his research on the painting, help him get a French visa easily, provide him academic and curatorial help while he is working at the museum, and get him access to the relevant study materials and people. Art, art history and the two nations concerned would all be the richer for such facilities and assistance.        
	The Centre should ponder such a scenario before making hasty decisions about opening out national antiquities to the world. Every effort should be made to make these antiquities part of the republic of learning and culture that, quite rightly, extends beyond national boundaries. But this does not mean that the objects themselves should be physically moved around with impunity. Museums and other institutes that keep these antiquities should arrange for the proper academic, curatorial, archival and museological infrastructure enabling the study of such valuable objects. And the the Central and state governments should ensure that the bureaucracy around them be kept minimal so that local, national and international scholars can get to them, and work with them, without any hassle. The suspicious and unhelpful attitude that foreign scholars often have to put up with from the ministry of external affairs, for instance, when applying for academic visas should also be beaten out of the system. To build such an infrastructure around the national antiquities and treasures is to start a tradition of conservation, scholarship and museology that would be global and contemporary in the best way possible.

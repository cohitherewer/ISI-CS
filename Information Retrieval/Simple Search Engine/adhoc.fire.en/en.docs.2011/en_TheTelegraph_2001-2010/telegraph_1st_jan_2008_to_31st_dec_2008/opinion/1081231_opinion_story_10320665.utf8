The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Princess of darts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PRINCESS OF DARTS                              FIFTH COLUMN                         
	Princesses are not in fashion. Pema Tsedeun Yapshi Pheunkhang, Coo Coo La to intimates but formally styled Lacham Kusho, consort of the gods, who died in a Calcutta hospital recently, was doubly unfashionable. Her elegantly brocaded octogenarian person embodied the vanished worlds of royal Sikkim and theocratic Tibet. But she could be startlingly modern, especially in business matters. Money didnt make me, she boasted, I made money. Many believe it was her acumen that prompted the Sikkim royal family to refuse Indias offer of pensions and ask instead for open general licences and trading permits. She studied the Indian market and imported whatever was in most demand in those days of unsatisfied craze for phoren. The Gangtok durbar said Coo Coo La would be Sikkims first foreign minister when (not if) the kingdom became independent.        
	Her parents were the reclusive Tashi Namgyal, 11th Chogyal of Sikkim, and his consort who came from an exalted Tibetan family. Her husband, Gompo Tsering Yapshi Pheunkhang, member of the family of the 11th Dalai Lama and governor of Gyantse, came to India on a mission for the Dalai Lamas government and stayed on in Kalimpong. The polyandrous Pheunkhang clan wanted her to marry two brothers. A plucky 15, she refused, marrying only the elder son after travelling to Lhasa in 1941.         
	An amputated left hand, result of medical bungling, did not affect her vivacity. Heinrich Harrer, author of Seven Years in Tibet, called her one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. She possessed the indescribable charm of Asian women and the stamp of age-old oriental culture. At the same time she was clever, well-educated and thoroughly modern. ... In conversation she was the equal of the most intelligent women you would be likely to meet in a European salon. She was interested in politics, culture and all that was happening in the world.                
	No nonsense        
	That was her undoing. Her high-level friends in Whitehall, Washington and, until they retired, South Block aroused the suspicions of other Indian officials. Their mistrust was also cause and effect of the hostility of Indias man on the spot, the quasi-imperial Political Officer who called her Dragon Lady and actively worked to bring about the kingdoms end. Dark whispers linked her with foreign intelligence agencies. It was hinted that her shopping trips to Hongkong were really to contact mainland China.        
	Her flat in Calcutta was raided in her absence, every single cupboard and box ransacked and little red seals like Mao buttons affixed to each lock. When water, electricity and telephones were cut off at Sikkim House in Delhi, where she was staying at the time, and CRP jawans set up camp on the lawn outside her windows, Coo Coo La moved to the India International Centre where John Lall, a former dewan of Sikkim, was director. She was evicted from the government bungalow in Gangtok that she occupied as chairman of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee for Tibetan Refugees. She claimed to have escaped at least one assassination attempt.        
	But a woman used to riding along the bandit-infested Gangtok-Lhasa road, a rifle slung across her shoulder and a revolver in her pocket, was not daunted. Her style remained regal. Her place at table was laid with gilt cutlery, guests allocated no less elegant but silver implements. She had a well-stocked cellar and her heart in her mouth.         
	Nari Rustomji of the ICS records her vigorous opposition to legislative representation for Indians resident in the kingdom. Having worked her way up from what she called a cold-water one-room flat in Ganesh Chandra Avenue lent by her first cousin, Bhutans assassinated Jigmie Dorji, to her gracious south of Park Street abode and properties in Kalimpong and Gangtok, she knew what she was talking about. Sikkims interests would have been safe in her hands. Too safe perhaps.       SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY

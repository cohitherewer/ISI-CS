	Dark deed                  
	Sir  Young Tapasi Malik was raped and murdered in Singur simply because she had the guts to resist the land grabbers patronized by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The odious crime shocked the people and destroyed their faith in the party that has ruled West Bengal for more than three decades. Now that Suhrid Dutta, the Singur zonal committee secretary of the CPI(M), and Debu Malik, a party worker, have been convicted in the murder case, one can say at last that justice has been done (Spot the plot Nov 15). However, the outrage voiced by the CPI(M) immediately after the conviction makes us wary again. If the CPI(M) now appeals against the verdict, then the sentence of life imprisonment awarded by a fast-track court in Chandernagore against Dutta and Malik might end up getting lessened. That would be a pity because men like Dutta and Malik do deserve the harshest possible punishment for their dark deed. It is a fact that those who have money and power in this country can always manipulate the truth to their advantage. Moreover, in West Bengal, the police force works according to the dictates of the ruling party. Little wonder then that it had tried to mislead the people initially in the Tapasi Malik murder case. It is a relief that even in such a hostile situation the Central Bureau of Investigation has succeeded in unearthing the truth. People now repose their faith in the judiciary to uphold the sentence even in the face of the CPI(M)s mad outbursts against it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Before and after Singur and Nandigram happened, many people had endorsed the cause of an industrialized Bengal in the name of progress. They said that even if some families had to suffer in the process, the larger interests of the state should take precedence over theirs. These enthusiasts supposedly had only the future of West Bengal in mind when they wilfully turned a blind eye to the atrocities committed by the CPI(M) to acquire land in Singur.           
	Men like Suhrid Dutta and Debu Malik too must have had a passion for industrialization. In fact, Dutta had been the most visible face of the CPI(M) in Singur ever since the industrialization drive started there. He worked in close association with the district administration in acquiring the villagers consent for the Tata small-car project. He was considered the political guru of Debu Malik, who too did his bit for the realization of the CPI(M)s dream of a resurgent Bengal. As the self-appointed messiahs of a new Bengal, they obviously did not consider it immoral to rape and kill a young girl if she happened to stand in the path of development. That their stilted logic is shared by most members of the ruling party was proved by the CPI(M)s display of anger after the verdict on Dutta and Malik was delivered. The CPI(M)s virtuous outrage shows how far it has travelled from being the party that upheld peoples interest.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Moonstruck          
	Sir  The report, Dreamers catch the moon (Nov 16), made us feel proud of the Indian Space Research Organization that has enabled the country to complete its journey to the moon. The scientists at Isro, like Mylswamy Annadurai and R. Venkata Ramanan, who have helped India conquer outer space, should now undertake educational campaigns to dispel superstitions from the minds of the average Indian. If anything has stood in the way of Indias rise to the position of a leading nation, it is religious prejudice and superstition among the masses. Once the scientific spirit is awakened in every Indian, the country will take its rightful place among the foremost nations in no time.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Sir  History was made as the Moon Impact Probe broke free from the Chandrayaan-1 to land on the moon (High-speed suicide drop puts Indian signature on moon, Nov 15). India succeeded in its space mission despite all the doubts and reservations expressed by certain nations regarding the countrys technical skills.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
A.R.K. Pillai, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Other countries have explored the lunar surface and collected scientific data. Will Chandrayaan-1 be able to add something new to the information already available about the moon? Since the launch of Chandrayaan-1 has resulted in the spending of enormous amount of money, and that too at a time when inflation has reached an unbelievable level, the moon mission better achieve something unique if the expenses are to be justified.           
	Yours faithfully,

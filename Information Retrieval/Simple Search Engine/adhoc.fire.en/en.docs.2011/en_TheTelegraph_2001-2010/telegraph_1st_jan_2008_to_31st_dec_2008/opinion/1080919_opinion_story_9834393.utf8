	All play, no work                  
	Sir  It is unfair to blame trade unionism for the absence of a creditable work culture or professionalism in Bengal (When will Bengalis learn?, Sept 13). Work is inextricably related to accountability, and the two are present in daily life in tantalizing ways. The local milkman mixes water in the milk with impunity, not because he is protected by a trade union but because dishonesty of this kind is inherent to his profession. The editorial, however, justly rebukes state government employees for disrupting life with their ubiquitous strikes. Not only does the government encourage its employees to skip work and attend rallies but also pays them for doing this. The babus at the Writers Buildings are not denied a days wage for participating in bandhs. But the unorganized sector, to which belong the daily wage earners, lose a days earnings in the event of a strike.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore 

                
	Sir  Bengalis have traditionally been considered slothful, and with good reason. The bandhs that cripple life in West Bengal every other month have made Bengalis a laughing stock among other communities in India. Trade unionism has percolated deep into every sphere in this state. How else can one explain the fact that even doctors observe bandhs here?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Supriyo Joardar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  It is useless directing our rage at the chief minister of Bengal for the states non-existent work culture. The actual villain of the piece is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees predecessor, Jyoti Basu, who single-handedly destroyed every institution that Bengalis looked upon with pride. Had Bhattacharjee been the first Left Front chief minister, Bengal would have been a top-ranking state in India by now. The only remedy today lies with the workers  engaged in the private or public sectors  to usher in a radical change by the sheer effort of collective will.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Professionalism never took root in Bengal, thanks to the way in which the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has pampered the babus working in state government offices. Sermons from the chief minister or the finance minister are not going to help relieve the crisis. Seldom do the orders issued by the government get implemented at the Writers Buildings. Unless there is an impartial watchdog presiding over the functioning of the babus, the endless dharnas, addas, and lazing around would continue unabated.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The absent work culture in Bengal is a gift from its political bosses who revel in showing off their power by bringing the state to a grinding halt. The recent bandh affected even the IT hub in Salt Lake despite promises made to the contrary. The sudden surge of interest in the Left Front to industrialize the state is its way of creating new jobs for their cadre. Tall promises are bandied around to entice investors, but as the projects get going, disputes crop up over the number of party workers who would be given employment. The state government, working as the handmaid of the party, does not have an independent will. This has been proved by the chief minister who has had to eat his own words on this. Is it a wonder that the work ethos in Bengal is perpetually in a shambles?          
	Yours faithfully,      
P. Chattopadhyay, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Bengali babus have become notorious for putting up the most unshakeable resistance to change. As a result, this kind of lethargy is exploited to the hilt by various political outfits for their selfish motives. In Bengal, the fate of an entire people is decided by a few individuals who are keen to settle personal scores. Although there is still hope that the Tatas would stay on with the Nano project, Bengalis would have to bemoan their fate if anything untoward happens in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anjan Sen, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is not as if the various modes of protest, such as bandhs, rallies and dharnas have been invented by Bengalis. Different communities have resorted to these means of dissent throughout the country at various points in history. Why is it then that Bengalis have to always bear the brunt of the blame and be given a bad name? The recent editorial on this topic accuses the entire community of engaging in meaningless addas and enjoying bandhs. It should be remembered, however, that Calcutta today is a cosmopolitan city, with only a handful of Bengalis who have very little say in the running of the state.           
	If bandhs are a hit with Calcuttans, it is only because political parties makes sure that they succeed. Even walking around on a bandh day can invite trouble, as party workers threaten pedestrians and target cars. Finally, why only blame state government employees? From bankers to airport staff, various professionals have called strikes time and again in support of their demands.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

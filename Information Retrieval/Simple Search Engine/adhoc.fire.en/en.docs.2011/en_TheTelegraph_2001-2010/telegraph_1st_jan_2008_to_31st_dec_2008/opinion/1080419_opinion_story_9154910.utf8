The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Metamorphosis of a glass bulb
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       METAMORPHOSIS OF A GLASS BULB                                  Visual Arts -   Soumitra Das                                                  
	Debraj Goswami turns the incandescent light bulb into an arresting and ambivalent image in his exhibition titled Multiple Choice (until April 24, Akar Prakar). In these paintings on paper, inside the glass bulb is another image suggestive of violence, and even of human intelligence. The Thinker comes directly from Rodin, while the light bulb traced on a thumb is a quote from Guernica. Goswami once again quotes directly from Picassos classic in another work where scraps of Guernica dangle from a thread hanging on a mans back.         
	In the other paintings, the mushroom of a nuclear explosion blooms inside the glass dome, a hammer is about to get into action, and a table lamp spiked with nails seems to writhe in pain. The background of these works is either golden yellow or a dark khaki-and-grey that occasionally turns black, but the bulb itself radiates white, creating the impression of the release of great quantities of energy.         
	Goswami has the ability to create compact images of the glass bulb, which turns into a mini-theatre of war. The irony of it is that the glass dome is itself a vulnerable object that could shatter any moment. In yet another work, the bulb transforms into a feeding bottle, hanging like a saline drip. So, in keeping with Goswamis strategy that unfolds as one sees the other works, the light bulb transmogrifies from a lethal weapon to a symbol of nurture and cerebration, all very cleverly worked out. Too clever, at times. In another set of images, the straw in the soft drink bottle is actually a revolver. The divider is saddled with a similar firearm. Little wonder the show is called Multiple Choice.         
	The problem is, Goswami, at times, seems to be over- whelmed by allusions, and his own ideas are often outweighed by these references to classic works of art. In another work, a Vincent van Gogh with a bandaged head lurks behind a crash helmet with an ear exposed. In the large format painting of spectacles, a minuscule version of Goyas horrifying painting of the execution of the defenders of Madrid appears at two ends. Instead of enriching Goswamis works, these allusions can be minor irritants that are highly avoidable.         
	In yet another series of men and women either making speeches or giving vent to their anger, the artist himself makes an appearance. While the two other faces speak into a tube of toothpaste and a banana instead of a mike, Goswami, with a supercilious smile, has a milk bottle stuck before his gob.         
	Yet, Goswami is quite capable of creating powerful images without taking recourse to masterworks. The young man wearing a crash helmet that has grown teeth is truly nightmarish. He should have stuck to that.

	Christopher Taylors exhibition of black-and-white photographs organized by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts (December 26-January 6) was an experience in revisiting Calcuttas colonial past. But these photographs (from 20cmx30cm to 60cmx100cm) were taken between 2003 and 2006. Taylors secret in retrieving the citys character of yore is perhaps the sense of silence in his mostly unpeopled frames. 
    
	A human presence within the frame, Taylor believes, not only dates a photograph but also distracts attention to itself (although an artefact like Pedestrians uses only human subjects). The photographs of Calcutta and Bombay are an attempt to extricate the cities essentially colonial character. The camera, thus, searches for enduring symbols of the past. 
    
	For instance, Dead Letter Building is an early-morning shot taken in a deserted Dalhousie Square. Glow signs advertising mobile networks establish the contemporariness of the scene while dangling cables and damaged railings show the Calcutta shabbiness. But, in the frame, the turret of the subject building touches the arch of the iron pillars diagonally opposite, thereby keeping their antiquated design in view. This subtlety and the overwhelming silence make the old building an even better index of the past.
    
	Standard Chartered Bank (picture) is one of Taylors many shots of staircases. The rectangular frame creates the illusion of a pentagon. The staircase, winding its way up along the walls, almost bisects the frame horizontally. The final flight goes straight up, perpendicular to the base, splitting the frame into vertical halves. This juxtaposition, along the vertical and horizontal coordinates, generates the tension of the photograph. Since Taylor mostly shoots in available light, the aesthetics of his frames are perfected by the play of light and shade. The relative magnitude of the staircase gives it character and also makes it a synecdoche of the building, which, in turn, stands for a past preserved within the present. As in Coffee House, the emptiness hints at the other reality of activity and noise. 
    
	The 4 quot;x5 quot;and 6 quot;x6 quot; cameras preferred by Taylor help in capturing detail. But his dependence on available light alone requires very long exposures. Setting up his apparatus in a public place calls for a lot of patience and commitment. Unfortunately, the exhibition venue had too much of an antique ambience itself. Still, one may also argue that it helped evoke a sense of history as Taylor might have wished.

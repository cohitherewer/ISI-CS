	nAn 18-year-old boy who was convicted of raping a 10-year-old girl was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison (although the minimum prescribed limit is 10 years) by the Karnataka High Court because, the court held, the boy was young, illiterate and ignorant. Setting aside the order, the Supreme Court held that crimes of violence upon women have to be severely dealt with, and socio-economic state, creed or caste of the accused or the victim is irrelevant in such cases.The apex court ruled that awarding of punishment below the minimum prescribed limit is unjustified (State of Karnataka vs Raju).
             
	Inheritance of loss
    
	nThe Delhi High Court has held that while granting compensation to riot victims, laws of succession will not apply. Ex gratia compensation provided by the state is not under any personal law but under the secular laws of the state, governed by the Constitution. The question arose in a case where a man, his wife and their children had been killed in a riot and the mans parents demanded the entire compensation amount. The court held that the question of pain and hurt is equal in respect of parents of the man as well as the woman. The state provides compensation to assuage the hurt, financial as well as mental, of the surviving members of the family. The court directed that the amount be apportioned among the next of kin of the family (Srimati Ganny Kaur vs The State of Delhi).
             
	Half-baked idea
    
	nWhen the property of a man who made bakery items was about to be attached because of non-payment of loan, he invoked Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This Section excludes certain properties, for example, that are owned by farmers, from being attached. Section 60 also excludes the property of wage-earning daily labourers and domestic servants from being attached because of non-payment of loan. The Karnataka High Court, however, rejected the bakers contention that he was a daily labourer, pointing out that he did not earn wages but was self-employed and worked for profit. But the court permitted him to pay the money owed in monthly instalments (Thankavelu vs Ramesh Babu).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TOWARDS A BREAKDOWN                          - India has for long been served poorly by its home ministries        Commentarao      S.L. Rao                          Free run                                                    
	India is becoming increasingly ungovernable because of the unwillingness of political parties and governments at the Centre and in the states to clearly agree on what we must never permit if the nation is to progress, and on the issues on which we must take firm action when laws or judicial rulings are violated.         
	The secessionist movement in Jammu and Kashmir has been fought by stationing over 2,50,000 soldiers in the state, and by pouring huge sums of money into it. There has been no tangible result either as visible change in the infrastructure or in the attitude of the people to the Indian State. The recent agitations, violence and deaths in both Jammu and Kashmir were avoidable. Between the last and present governors, the chief minister and the clever and manipulative Mehbooba Mufti, a situation was created that led to the chaos in Kashmir. The last governors public statements after demitting his office make his unsuitability for governing a Muslim majority state very clear. Ghulam Nabi Azad as chief minister belied his past reputation as a master politician by getting trapped by a proposal made by Mehboobas own minister. She cleverly blamed the government for the proposal. The drama was obviously to strongly position her party for the coming elections. The new governor (and the Central government) did not anticipate the natural reactions in Jammu and then in Kashmir when earlier decisions on control over land for a few weeks each year by the Amarnath Shrine Board were withdrawn. Governments and governors have shown themselves to be insensitive and ineffective. Politicians like Mehbooba Mufti and the Bharatiya Janata Party are seen to look only at their political advantages.              
	The statements by the home minister after the serial blasts in Delhi were the same statements he made after the serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad. We will catch the guilty and punish them. Neither he nor his civil servants have organized intelligence inputs or shown the will to go after the criminals. Putting an internal security minister as MoS under him is not enough. Internal security must have a full-fledged cabinet minister.         
	The Naxalite/Maoist insurgents have, over the years, only brought more territory under their control. There is no national policy, no national police force and no intelligence inputs to counter them. The Maoists play on the legitimate grievances of tribals and their abysmal living conditions. Governments do not ensure that services and opportunities are delivered to them for improving their condition. Instead, governments pour money into more police and attack the Maoists, with no success.         
	Veerappan, the sandalwood smuggler, roamed scot-free despite the attempts of two state governments to catch or kill him. Instead, he was always well-informed, and able to repeatedly ambush and kill police teams before they could kill him. It is inconceivable that a semi-literate brigand could have, for so many years, hacked sandalwood trees, carried logs over 200 miles to the nearest port, and shipped them to markets in Japan, without the collusion of high officials in the state governments and in political parties. Veerappan has been an inspiration for many like him who understand that politicians and governments can be bought.         
	Millions of Bangladeshi nationals have crossed the border into India. They are now entrenched in many parts of India, with identity cards and ration cards. Some are said to be with terrorist Islamic outfits. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal and the Congress governments at the Centre and in Assam have shown, for over thirty years, no interest in stopping this influx of illegal Muslim immigrants that added to their vote banks.         
	Raj Thackeray is allowed to roam freely using violence and intemperate threats against non-Maharashtrians in Bombay. No innocent, less so an eminent, citizen should have to make the grovelling apology that Amitabh Bachchan made for the careless remarks of Jaya Bachchan, MP from Uttar Pradesh. Thackeray had destroyed hoardings displaying members of the Bachchan and ensured cancellation of a Bachchan film, legally approved for public screening. The Maharashtra chief minister made vague promises of action. The Central government said and did nothing. Thackeray and his followers were not arrested and will no doubt do more of the same. The BJP and the communists did not protest. All are slavering for the Marathi vote.        
	According to available information from Christian sources, Orissa, which has seen violence against Christians since the Staines murders, has had, in the last few months apparently 26 dead, eight Christians murdered, 41 churches destroyed, and 17 houses, four convents, five hostels and seven other Christian institutions damaged. This is enough reason to dismiss the Orissa government for the breakdown of law and order and put Orissa under presidents rule. Instead of banning the BJPs front organizations like the Bajrang Dal, which continue their rampage, tepid statements emanate from Delhi. For Indian politicians, tribal votes are unimportant and no party has protested.        
	The illegal blockade of a national highway at Singur was to protest against a legitimate Tata investment. Fertile land had been taken over, and adequate compensation not ensured. The West Bengal government did not forcibly stop the illegal blockades. Earlier, it had condoned the violence of the CPI(M) cadre in Nandigram. The governor showed courage in intervening. His advisors were inept in not involving the Tatas in the discussions. The government has diminished the prestige of the governor by insensitive land acquisitions, not involving the Tatas in negotiations and not enforcing the law and judicial orders.         
	India has for long been poorly served by its home ministries, both at the Centre and in the states. They have been weak. Party politics is placed above duty to the nation. At last, the government might clear the anti-terrorism acts passed by the legislatures of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (all with BJP governments), despite other states like Maharashtra (under the Congress) having similar acts. By not reorganizing intelligence services, the home minister has kept them ineffective. He has not implemented advice on reforming the police. His ministry, after claiming that the Students Islamic Movement of India was behind the terrorist acts, presented such a weak case before the high court that the ban was lifted. Fortunately, the Supreme Court restored it. Afzal Gurus death sentence for the attack on Parliament, upheld by the Supreme Court, was not carried out, perhaps because it might lose Muslim votes for the Congress.               
	The Bajrang Dal has not been banned despite its involvement in the Orissa killings of Christians and destruction of Christian properties. Shivraj Patil has not demanded action from his Congress government in Maharashtra against Raj Thackeray despite the violence against north Indians in Mumbai and the agitation against the Bachchans. The list of action not taken is endless.        
	Government maladministration, dithering and incompetence have resulted in the loss of respect for almost every governmental institution. The police have repeatedly shown that they can be bought in Noida, Ghaziabad and elsewhere. We cannot expect honest protection of the interests of common citizens by politicians, political parties and government administrations.         
	The media, sometimes the judiciary and the rare administrator or policeman might help. But ordinary citizens are ignorant on how to approach them. Nor can the media, with a profit orientation, attack every corrupt and shoddy police investigation. The two cases in Noida  of the forgotten Nithari murders and the continual television breaking news on the Arushi case show that the media will not persist if the complainant is poor.        
	We have the faade of governance, not the reality. If we are to attract investment for development, governments must govern without discrimination. If recent trends continue, honest citizens will employ private enforcers to get speedy justice. That will signal the final breakdown.

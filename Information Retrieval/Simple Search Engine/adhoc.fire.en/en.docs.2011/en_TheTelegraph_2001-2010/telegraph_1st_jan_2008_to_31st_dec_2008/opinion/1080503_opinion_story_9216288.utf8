	Chitpur exists in multiple avatars that reveal themselves as one ambles down this pathway that stretches from the Lalbazar police headquarters right up to the eponymous thana with the two temples of the goddess Chitteswari close to it. It is quite a long walk, most of which has been renamed Rabindra Sarani that extends to Baghbazar. Each neighbourhood has its distinctive architectural style, smell, street dcor, dominant religious and ethnic groups and professions and trades, which add to the fascination of this ancient thoroughfare that seems to remain unaffected by change.         
	From Lalbazar up to Mahatma Gandhi Road (Harrison Road of yore), the flavour is unmistakably Islamic. Marwari culture holds sway over the stretch up to Ganesh Talkies, followed by the Bengali stronghold. The most prominent features of Chitpur are its remarkable, tumbledown, grey buildings, exquisitely ornate and defiantly kitschy, that have, of late, caught the eye of foreigners. The enormously rich merchants and landlords who built these were trying hard to imitate their white overlords, imitation being the best form of flattery.         
	Till recently, the favourite destination of tourists from the West would be Mother House. Or else they would march purposefully to the red-light districts of Chitpur, such as Sonagachhi and Rambagan, to spread the word about safe sex.         
	Enthusiasm about Calcuttas heritage is something new. This new-found interest in the citys heritage, or at least its old, showy buildings, has resulted in the exhibition of photographs titled Calcutta: Chitpur Road and Neighbourhoods (April 16-May 3, CIMA Gallery) that has been organized by the Goethe-Institut, Max Mueller Bhavan. It bodes well for Calcuttas built heritage, for if they think it is worth preserving, local naysayers wouldnt mind dancing to their tune.                 
	These colour photographs were taken by a group of 21 students of Bremen University under the guidance of Peter Bialobrzeski with large format cameras in November 2006. Most of the prominent landmarks of Chitpur  such as the Ghariwalla Mullik house, the two Ghosh residences, Tagore Castle and Prasad opposite it in Pathuriaghat and the Butto Kristo Paul drugstore, including its never-seen-before terrace, (picture, right)  have been included in the exhibition.         
	Two generations of Harakuthir sit proudly on a sofa. The derelict Jorabagan police station is viewed in the warm glow of a sodium vapour street lamp. The photographers were actually allowed inside Marble Palace, which is a no-go zone for shutterbugs. We get a chance to see its tawdry charms along with the gimcrack once again. The photograph of a misty Abhay Mitra Street (not known to some former Baghbazar insiders) with its array of balconies is truly amazing. One wishes the Germans had not missed out on the staircase, seats and thresholds of Harakuthir and their quaint inscriptions saluting visitors.         
	While Nakhoda Masjid is there, what about the more ancient Gol Kothi, Sinduriapatti Masjid and the Marwari Relief Society building straight from Rajasthan? Muslims and Marwaris are not well represented. The wood engravers, blockmakers, brass-and-bell-metal utensil shops and the dyers from Rajasthan are nowhere in sight. It was an ambitious project that the Germans had taken up, for it is impossible to discover the richly-layered life of Chitpur even in a years time, let alone a month, with or without a cicerone.         
	Given the limited time span and constraints, such as crowds of rubbernecks, these students acquit themselves rather well. This is not to say that the exhibits are flawless. The focus is not equally sharp in all the prints. The face of the man inside the Butto Kristo Paul drugstore is somewhat blurred. These are manual prints and perhaps because they look a little dull, they have been digitally enhanced and brightened in the book published alongside the exhibition. A quick glance through the book revealed two wrong captions. How can the Howrah Bridge be confused with the Brabourne Road flyover? And the extension of C.R. Avenue, where Lalmandir stands, is known as Jatindra Mohan Sarani. But instead of nitpicking, one should be glad that foreigners are taking note of vanishing Chitpur.

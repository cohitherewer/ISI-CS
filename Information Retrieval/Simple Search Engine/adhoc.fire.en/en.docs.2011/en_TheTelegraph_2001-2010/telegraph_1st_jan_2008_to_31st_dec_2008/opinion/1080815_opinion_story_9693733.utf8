                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       OUT OF CONTROL                                                    
	For civilized human beings, absolute freedom is always problematic and almost impossible. But the internet probably comes closest today to being a human system that ends up eluding most attempts at limiting its free reign. The kinds of information it provides access to, together with the opportunities for communication it affords, are fast becoming limitless. From anxious parents to paranoid governments, to a whole range of people with stakes in the idea of control, cyberspace, with its boundless liberties, could often look like a nightmarishly uncontrollable version of the free market itself. Hence, it is understandable that the Supreme Court has issued notices to Microsoft, Google and Yahoo asking them to block their search engines from advertising sex-selection kits. Promoting these is, in any case, a punishable offence in India. Given the hideously prevalent forms that the killing of female foetuses and infants takes in India, it is not surprising that the apex court would put this offence on a par with something as culpable as child pornography.        
	Yet, the continuing existence of child pornography and paedophilia on a global scale is proof of the difficulty of sustaining such attempts at regulating cyberspace. Besides, would regulating only the Indian versions of the search engines prevent the promotion of these kits, given that the internet necessarily transcends geographical barriers? It is only a repressively totalitarian State like China, with its immense stakes in what people get to know, that has managed to evolve a more-or-less effective form of cyberpolicing  but at a very high price in terms of how it is perceived by the rest of the modern world. A democracy like India would have to think very hard about where and how to draw the line once it starts policing the internet. It might be simpler to enforce the existing laws against prenatal diagnostic techniques more strictly in the actual world than trying to do the same in the virtual one.

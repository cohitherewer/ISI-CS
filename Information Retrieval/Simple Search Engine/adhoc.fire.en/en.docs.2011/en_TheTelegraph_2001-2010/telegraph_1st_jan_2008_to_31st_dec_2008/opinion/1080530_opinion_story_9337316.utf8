	King Gyanendra may be saved from the wolf at the door by his financial interests in tea, tourism and tobacco, but he will still have to leave his palace within 15 days. The mint-fresh Constituent Assembly of Nepal, which declared Nepal a federal democratic republic on May 28, is firm on this score. His palace, which saw the massacre of his brothers family in 2001, will become a museum. There is a powerful symbolism in the inevitable drama surrounding the forced abdication of a king. It is important for a people which has suffered for years, placed between the king on the one side and determined Maoists on the other, to grasp fully the importance and consequences of their choice of governance. The latent symbolism in the kings exit from the palace would help to mark the new era that the people have ushered in.         
	The most remarkable feature of this historic change in Nepal is the path the Maoists have trod. Emerging into the light of the political mainstream after a decade-long series of bloody depredations, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) has actually helped the nation on towards a different history, making both the election of the Constituent Assembly and the partys own leadership of it possible. The royalist supporters are too attenuated a side to worry the newly elected lawmakers, although the blast outside the the International Convention Centre where the new assembly was having its first meeting was allegedly set off by a royalist group. The real problems lie elsewhere. There is, first and foremost, the tremendous, if apparently amorphous, task of meeting the expectations of an excited and happy people who are dreaming of peace, prosperity and justice. More specifically, working out the agenda of the Constituent assembly and the structure of the new republican government are the first steps. That these hit a snag is made clear by the fact that the first meeting was hours late because consensus over the respective powers of the president and the prime minister took a while in coming. There will be many more such snags, and far more difficult dilemmas to resolve. With so many parties working together, however positive their intentions, consensus will often take time. A little rockiness is par for the course, as long as the parties feel, as does a young erstwhile Maoist, that Nepals transformation into a republic is the greatest achievement of all.

	Unoriginal mix                
	A collection of works by contemporary artists from Bengal was presented by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts and Aryan Art Gallery, New Delhi (Visual Rhapsody, ended May 3). This was a preview of an exhibition meant to travel to Hong Kong. For this reason perhaps, the show appeared to have been put together somewhat hastily. A ragtag assembly of paintings by the Old Masters and their Younger Apprentices seemed to have been crammed into the gallery without much rhyme or reason. It is difficult to discern any thematic unity, stylistic continuity or even organic thinking behind this pot-pourri  apart from the obvious Bengal connection. There was not much that was striking, original or in any way redeeming.         
	Rajesh Debs woodcuts and acrylics are stilted phantoms of Old Bengal. These are executed with a dogged sincerity  the right mix of colour, texture and tone  but, unfortunately, the effect is dulled by a painful lack of delicacy. Paritosh Sens graceful dancers, a tribute to Jamini Roy, are vivacious. Jogen Chowdhury creates magic with dry pastel, while Partha Pratim Debs drawings are pleasing as ever. Manoj Duttas tempera and Debashish Mannas use of black pastel deserve mention.

	The man in his armchair        
	Even the smallest crack on the leather of that famous armchair is familiar by now. As are the lines on the famous mans forehead, or those around his eyes that would appear when his face broke into a smile. In order to catch the attention and fancy of the Calcutta audience, photographs of Satyajit Ray will either have to capture the subject in a rare mood or be exceptional specimens of the photographic art. The 11 photos on display as part of Asit Poddars exhibition, titled Portraits of a Director, at Gallery Kanishkas do not qualify on either count.        
	For one, it is a bits-and-pieces show. Six of the photographs are portraits taken during the shooting of Piku in 1981. In these, Poddar tries to create a depth of field by blurring the background and bringing his subject into sharp focus. The family portrait and the ones of the artist in his favourite armchair and at his organ are pictures that every Ray photographer has taken and every Ray fan has seen. They have no merit which can set them apart from similar photographs taken by other photographers. Two frames, according to their captions, are from the period when the director was making Agantuk (1991). But the blackness of Rays hair and the fullness of his face in these images betray an earlier and healthier phase of his life.

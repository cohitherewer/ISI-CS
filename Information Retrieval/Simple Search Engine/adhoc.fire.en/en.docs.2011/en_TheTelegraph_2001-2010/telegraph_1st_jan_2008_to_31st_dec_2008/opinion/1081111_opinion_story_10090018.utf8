                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BREACH OF TRUST                                                    
	There are better ways to register protest than cutting up roads and disconnecting electricity. Yet, what is happening in Lalgarh in West Midnapore cannot be judged purely on the disruptive form that the indigenous peoples anger against the police has taken. The failure to smell out and prevent an allegedly Maoist bomb attack, presumably aimed at the West Bengal chief minister, seems to have lit a fuse of belated activity among the police. The apparently indiscriminate arrests and aggressive badgering of residents of villages some distance from the explosion site, harassment from which women are not excluded, have infuriated the villagers. They have tried democratic means, including trying to submit a memorandum to authorities whose gates were closed against them. According to the protestors, the arrests of three schoolboys, together with others whose only offence appears to be that they belong to parties opposing the Communist Party of India (Marxist), can only be ameliorated by their unconditional release and an apology from police bosses.         
	The perception of political bias is strong. Allegedly, the police are going easy on the villages closest to the bomb-site  which the perpetrators must have used for their passage  because they are under CPI(M) rule. Villages further off are prey to administrative fury for they are not under such control. Maoist parties are not outlawed in the state, yet members of opposition parties, picked up on suspicion, are being treated like outlaws. The situation is building up on now tragically familiar lines, provoked, once again, by the reckless high-handedness of the administration. The CPI(M) also provoked the anger of the Opposition in the all-party meeting in Lalgarh, resulting in its break-up. Some distance from Lalgarh, Lakshman Seth, whose arrogance initially stoked the anger of protestors in Nandigram, threatened the Opposition in a public meeting that any protestor against the chemical hub in Nayachar will have his legs broken. Yet, there is no dispute in Nayachar, the land is the governments and it is not agricultural. The insulting aggression of the CPI(M) can bring forth resistance even when there is no cause. The Opposition and ordinary people alone cannot be held responsible for violence. The government, which is expected to be even-handed and just, has failed to retain the trust of its people. Suspicion and terror are not conducive to peace.

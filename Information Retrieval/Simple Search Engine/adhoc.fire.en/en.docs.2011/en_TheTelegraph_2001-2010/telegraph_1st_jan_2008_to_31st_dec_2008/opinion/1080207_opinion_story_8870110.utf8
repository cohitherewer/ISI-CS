The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Heir Cut
                                                                                                              HEIR CUT                                                    
	India has a yen for legacies. Such wealth is often metaphysical, measured in the richness  or usefulness  of ideologies, attitudes and, most strikingly in politics, of vote banks. There is something absurd in the cause of violence in Mumbai, because whether or not Amitabh Bachchan has done anything for Maharashtra compared to what he has done for Uttar Pradesh cannot be, in reasonable terms, a spur to antagonism of the South towards the North. But it was a good enough starting point for Raj Thackeray to base his claim to the chauvinistic legacy of his uncle, Bal Thackeray. Mr Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena never really got going with a cause of its own since he founded it after his disappointment with the senior Mr Thackerays decision to pass on the inheritance of his outfit to his son, Uddhav Thackeray. The seed of Mr Raj Thackerays confrontational politics was provided by Mr Bachchan, quite innocently it would appear, for it is difficult to imagine that opening a school in his daughter-in-laws name in UP could be reason for a hate campaign. But it was enough for Mr Raj Thackeray to dramatize his claim to Mr Bal Thackerays slogan of Maharashtra for Maharashtrians, setting MNS supporters violently against north-Indian residents of Mumbai specifically, and Maharashtra in principle  and against the Samajwadi Party.        
	Families are the most turbulent sites, and nothing demonstrates this better than the course many political parties take in India. Lakshmi Parvathi laid claim to the political legacy of N.T. Rama Rao in Andhra Pradesh, and was upstaged by N. Chandrababu Naidu, his wilier son-in-law. J. Jayalalithaa managed to do the same with M.G. Ramachandrans All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, although no one in the family considered her part of it. In the Congress, the predictability of heirloom politics received a jolt when Maneka Gandhi was disinherited by Indira Gandhi, who anointed Rajiv Gandhi as her successor. The line has remained unbroken since. The appeal of such heirloom politics is symbolic. In Mumbai, the originator of the legacy is still alive. Mr Raj Thackeray is fighting for an heirloom that is still, symbolically, in the hands of the person who created it. Hence the confrontation is an open challenge directed at capturing the vote bank traditional to the Shiv Sena.

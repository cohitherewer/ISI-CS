	When Britain in 1983 brought in a fat, gilt-looking coin to replace its tattered pound notes, it was swiftly labelled a thatcher. Like the then prime minister, said her enemies, the coin was thick, brassy, unpopular and thought it was a sovereign. Half-fair or not (half, at most: thick, Margaret Thatcher?), the nickname never caught on. A pity. English incorporates few personal names and could pleasingly add more.        
	Many surnames have come the other way: Farmer, Miller, Baker, Smith, Thatcher itself and more, just like Merchant, Contractor or Mumbais splendid Sodawaterwala in India, or the Schumacher and Zapatero of other cultures. But few names have reached the dictionary, except as isms such as Marxism or Gaullism, and associated words in -ist; or as adjectives like Napoleonic or Gandhian. And nearly all these still require a capital letter; platonic and homeric  except in their literal senses  are rare exceptions, as are the nouns philippic and caesarean.         
	Yet the thatcher had a precedent: Britains now-dead shilling, a bob, may owe that nickname to an 18th-century prime minister, Robert Walpole. And certainly Robert Peel, the politician who in 1829 gave London its first city-wide police force, is to be found in the bobbies (or peelers, as Victorians also knew them) who manned it.        
	Many items have been named after their inventors or users. The challenge here is to move from being a defining adjective (the Gladstone bag, Maxim gun or Phillips curve) to becoming a noun, sometimes a generic one: wellingtons (the footwear of the duke thereof), the bowler (the London hatter who devised it for some squires gamekeepers), diesel, macadam and the macintosh (their inventors) or the sandwich (brought to sustain the earl of that ilk at the gambling table).         
	Many of these words have died as the technology did: the hansom cab (its designer), the brougham and victoria carriages (Lord B and Queen V, their users), and no doubt others peculiar to trades unknown to me. But we still have hoover, levis (from Levi Strauss, a firm making them) and biro (the Hungarian inventor of the ballpoint pen); trademarks all, but usually spelt without a capital letter.         
	Hoover went on to become also a verb, like boycott (a harsh land agent in 19th-century Ireland  oddly, the victim, not author, of a boycott) and a few in -ize such as macadamize, bowdlerize (Thomas Bowdler in 1818 brought out an expurgated Shakespeare) and mesmerize (an Austrian doctor who did it).        
	Science has many units such as hertz, ohm, watt and gauss (hence the verb degauss, demagnetize); plus a few elements (eg, fermium) and many plants (eg, dahlia) that add latinate endings to surnames. Skaters cavort in an axel, lutz or salchow, named after their inventors. The cricketers googly was once a boss ball or bosie, from its originator, B.J.T. Bosanquet. Too bad theres no saqlain or murali.        
	We owe gamp  old slang for umbrella  to Dickens Sarah G, malapropism to Sheridans Mrs Malaprop, spoonerism to a real Dr Spooner. The Greek poets Sappho and Alcaeus gave us sapphics and alcaics, ancient verse-forms sometimes spelt without their originators capital letters. And the modern four-line clerihew? Well,         
	Among last-century British journalists very few        
	Could have invented the clerihew.        
	So may he rest gently,  
	E. (for Edmund) Clerihew Bentley.

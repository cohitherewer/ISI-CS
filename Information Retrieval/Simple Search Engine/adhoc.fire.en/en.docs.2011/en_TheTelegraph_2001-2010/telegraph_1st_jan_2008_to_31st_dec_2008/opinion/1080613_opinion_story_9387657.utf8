	Way to go                  
	Sir  The epic battle between senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama for the presidential candidacy has ended. The former first ladys dream of becoming the first woman president of the worlds greatest democracy was shattered on June 5 (The last lap, June 6). From Iowa in January through South Dakota in June, Obama has enjoyed one of the great rides in American political history, breaking precedents and setting records along the way. It has been an extraordinary journey, magnified by the gritty, resilient performance of his main rival. He has given Americans the gift of a new and hopeful chapter in their troubled racial history.           
	In defeating the once-favoured candidate, Obama displayed eloquence, a command of the issues at stake and adroit political skills. He was by far the most compelling speaker. He held out the message of hope and change brilliantly at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines last fall, and recycled that speech all the way to the end. Another factor that stood him in good stead was his fundraising and voter-turnout capacity. None of the establishment Democrats, not even Clinton, could match him in these.          
	As the editorial rightly says, Obamas achievement has stirred disbelief even in the United States of America. He faced challenges galore, but overcame them with rare aplomb. The immediate task before him is to carry forward the change in domestic and foreign policies if he gets elected finally. He has to engage in unifying his own party, more so because Clintons supporters are not likely to accept their candidates defeat in good grace. However, it augurs well that Clinton has decided to reconcile herself to the reality and promised to support her erstwhile rival.          
	Putting aside the partisan battle for the moment, Americans of all political hues should now pause to recognize that the country is moving beyond a painfully long history of racial discrimination towards inclusiveness. Even the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has greeted Obamas nomination with a sentiment charged with the memory of the atrocities faced by African-Americans in the US.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for the Democratic Partys nomination was so bitter and intense that it appeared as if they belonged to opposing parties. It is possible that fighting like sworn enemies will divide votes and hit poll prospects of their own party. To many in India, it might feel strange that a good five months were spent on deciding the candidate for a party, when the process could have been made shorter and more amicable by the party high command. There is a lesson for India in this long-drawn-out search for the presidential nominee. India should also carry out a rigorous scrutiny of potential candidates by soliciting the opinion of the people instead of letting political leaders decide who should contest from where.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obama, the first coloured nominee for the White House, has promised to give America a new direction if he wins the race for presidency. There is reason to hope that he will be able to fulfil this pledge. What sets Obama apart are his energetic personality, infectious optimism and a fresh approach to controversial issues. But having reached this far, he would now have to lay out his plans in more concrete terms.           
	He should be given credit for standing his ground despite the undercurrent of racism that greeted his candidacy. It was no mean task being pitted against the former first lady, who started off as a favourite. The prospect of an African-American president was also consistently scoffed at, even dismissed as a joke by some. But things have turned upside down now  and this only goes to show how deeply entrenched democratic values are in the US.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Politics over science          
	Sir  It was painful to read about the dismal state of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Ransack turmoil at Besu, June 9). More than half a century ago, I considered myself lucky to get admission to the college, which was then an altogether different institution in its ethos and mode of functioning, producing some of the best engineers of the country. It feels incredible to us, the alumni, how successive batches of students have ruined the reputation of this prestigious institution by unleashing terror and misrule on the campus.           
	It is the intelligent and the gifted who get a berth at Besu. But a lot of dissonant elements, for whom higher studies is just an excuse for political activities, sneak in. They should seek out colleges where studies can go hand-in-hand with hardcore politics. As matters stand now, the students of the outgoing batch are not likely to get good placements because a handful of miscreants have made reputed companies turn away from Besu. Let the political scientists flourish, but so should those who have not chosen that path.           
	Yours faithfully,

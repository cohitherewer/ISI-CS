                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       GOING DOWNHILL                                                    
	The worst fears are coming true in Jammu and Kashmir. At the time of the first all-party meeting on the issue, it was apprehended that unless the economic blockade in the valley ended soon, separatist forces would use it as an excuse to push open the trade route through Muzaffarabad to Pakistan, which would be a slap on Indias face. Also, if the stalemate in Jammu continued, the eventual communal flare-up could engulf the nation. The first apprehension proved right when protesters in the valley, under the able guidance of Hurriyat leaders, marched to Muzaffarabad on Monday, got fired at and bore back another martyr to the cause of azadi  Sheikh Abdul Aziz, a senior Hurriyat leader. The outpouring of grief and anger at his funeral has provided the valley one more occasion to show open defiance to the administration. It has invited a predictable response from the security forces in the form of firings. The unbroken pattern of responses from both sides  the State and its citizens  is sucking the valley into an inescapable vortex of violence. And thanks to the Amarnath Shrine Board, its principal backers in the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the partys much-trusted members like Praveen Togadia (intent on reclaiming the spotlight with his Ayodhya chalo-like programmes), there is now a chance that the conflagration may spread beyond the states borders.         
	What is needed at this critical juncture is a synchronized effort at fire-fighting. This is all the more important since it is street power that is determining the dialogue at the round table. Be it the Peoples Democratic Party (which now endorses the rabble-rousing of the Hurriyat) or the BJP (which has surrendered its volition to the shrine board), the play of passions on the streets dictates the grandstanding of parties. Under the circumstances, every kind of bungling  in the handling of traders grievances, the flow of traffic along the roads of the state, or mob violence  cannot but become an opportunity for hardliners to raise the pitch further. As the reports in The Telegraph have shown, the lack of a clear understanding of the situation and of coordination among policy-makers, law-enforcers and security forces is hindering efforts to control the violence and instil confidence in the people. A more concerted drive is required at both the macro and micro-levels to douse the fires.

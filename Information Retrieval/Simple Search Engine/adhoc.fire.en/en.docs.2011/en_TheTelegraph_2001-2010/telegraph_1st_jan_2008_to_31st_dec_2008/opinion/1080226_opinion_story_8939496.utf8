                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Leg before money                  
	Sir  So finally the million-dollar baby (or should it be billion?) of the Board of Control for Cricket in India has been launched (Feel at home, boys, Feb 21). The most interesting thing to watch would be whether national loyalties can be converted into city-based loyalties. Would the fans of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid or Mahendra Singh Dhoni support regional teams that do not have their idols? Surprisingly enough, Andrew Symonds, who was a villain to most Indians only a few weeks ago, is now the highest paid foreign cricketer in the Indian Premier League. Kapil Dev, in his interview to The Telegraph, has rightly pointed out that domestic cricket will be the biggest victim of the IPL.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurik Ginoria, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In the world of cricket, too many changes are taking place too fast. Most of them are beyond the comprehension of ordinary cricket-lovers. Ever since Kerry Packer introduced the pyjama version of cricket, the classical form of the game has got pushed to the sidelines. However, the IPL round of innovations could be more than the game can endure  cricketers being auctioned in the open market, their loyalty being transferred from their countries to private companies, high-profile businessmen and filmstars. The spectators would no longer be fluttering national flags. But the media, as is their wont, would hype the phenomenon to the high heavens by manufacturing innumerable spicy, half-true stories to glorify the IPL and rope in a gullible audience.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The IPL and the glamour it has brought into cricket can act as a double-edged sword. One the one hand, IPL promises to promote the game, while on the other, the Twenty20 format, that is tailor-made for a restless generation, can kill off Test cricket. We have also witnessed a humongous misuse of money, spent in purchasing overseas and Indian cricketers. It is time other sports played in India also got the same kind of promotion. The premier league in hockey has not been able to do much for Indias national game, but similar efforts to promote other sports should be encouraged. The government should invest at least one-tenth of the money that the BCCI is spending on cricket in other sports.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurabh Sharma, Liluah

                
	Sir  With its new-found money power, the Indian cricketing establishment is lording over the world. Whatever the BCCI may think, T20 games can only take cricket to the dogs. And no matter how much enthusiasm we see now, IPL games will never generate the same excitement as an India-Australia or India-Pakistan match. National pride, specially in India, is a different thing altogether.           
	As far as the auction is concerned, I suspect that the whole thing was carefully stage-managed. Can one believe that Yusuf Pathan, who has hit just one six in a T20 tournament, is valued more than Ricky Ponting, or Manoj Tiwari than Shane Warne? In the name of market forces, Indian considerations have prevailed. Domestic cricket in all countries will be dead. Will the investors get fat returns from IPL? Will the spectators flock to the ground for two months braving the Indian summer?           
	Last but not the least, one must congratulate Australias Michael Clarke and the English players for rejecting the IPL tamasha. It is good to know that some cricketers still have their priorities right.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is said that in sports and education, commercialization is a bane, not a boon. But this does not seem to hold true any longer. Today, every successful person comes with a price tag. With so much money being thrown around, sportsman spirit will soon be a thing of the past. Who will bother to walk when he knows that a big score can fetch him the big bucks? It is not as if only the players are in it for money. So is the board, which makes the players play even in the searing heat of summer for commercial reasons. It would, however, be quite wrong to think that the commercial success of cricket is helping the Indian economy. For, the country is losing man-hours as people are busy watching cricket. Students too are neglecting their studies doing the same. So one can imagine the future of the country, since all these youngsters will not take up cricket.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

                
	Sir  There can be no doubt that the business model of IPL is lucrative both for the game and for the players. Players, both active and retired, get to earn a handsome pay packet for six intense but short weeks of work. It leaves them the rest of the year to pursue other interests. Also, given the make-up of teams in IPL, it would give an alternative platform to local talents, who do not have to rely on a call to the national team. For the game, it is a chance to go global in a big way. The T20 format makes it possible for cricket boards to package games attractively, and to cater to non-Asian audiences which like games to be short, intense and result-oriented.           
	On the other hand, there are concerns about whether IPL would be able to sustain itself. True, there are big names involved, but wouldnt the interests of the game suffer because of them?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

                
	Sir  In a country where children do not have enough to eat and decent clothes to wear, it seems almost immoral that billions of dollars should be spent for a cricket tournament. My heart broke to see the IPL auction on television. I would rather have purchased happiness for India than an M.S. Dhoni or a Ricky Ponting.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Soham Gupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  T20 cricket is the in-thing now. But if we care to go a little deeper, we will see that the craze revolves around the cricketers and not the game. Truckloads of money are being spent on the cricketers, but hardly enough on the game. Could the BCCI spell out what percentage of its IPL earnings is going to be spent to help domestic cricket and cricketers?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

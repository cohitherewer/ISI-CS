	A sorry state                  
	Sir  The fuss kicked up by the self-styled custodian of all things Marathi, Raj Thackeray, proves that we live in a fragmented country ruled by parochial forces. Marathas are traditionally known for their valour, patriotism and culture, but Thackeray and his followers seem to have decided to write a new history of Maharashtra that shows it to be a separate land altogether outside the boundary of India.           
	Most Bengalis domiciled in other states have had the experience of being ridiculed or discriminated against. But in Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal, almost every third citizen is from outside the state. Thackeray could come and do a random survey among this group  maybe he should ask the Maharashtrians living in Calcutta  to find out if they feel threatened about losing their identity.           
	I have been noticing that of late, several celebrities appearing in reality shows on television are raising the slogan, Jai Maharashtra. It is possible that there are pressures on them to hail Maharashtra in public, or they could easily have said Jai Bharat Mata instead.           
	I find it shocking that this kind regionalist separatism is not being strongly handled by the law-enforcers of the land.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Why is it that a personality of the stature of Amitabh Bachchan has to issue a meek apology on behalf of his wife, Jaya, for a comment that was not offensive in the least (Better be sorry than lose Lear, Sept 11)? Perhaps the threat by Raj Thackeray and his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to stall the screening of all films starring the Bachchans had too many financial repercussions to be ignored. Thackeray has accepted the apology, and it seems that the movies starring the Bachchans are on safe ground. But it still rankles that the legendary actor, who had once set the screen on fire by portraying the angry young man who would risk his life to cure society of its ills, has to bow before political goons of the MNS. Bachchan has millions of Indians behind him, and he has no reason to cower before a rabble-rouser like Thackeray.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  India is at present threatened by terrorists who operate under cover. But there are also politicians like Raj Thackeray who terrorize people  and that too, icons like Amitabh Bachchan  openly and get away scot-free. Do we dare talk about freedom and justice after this?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Krishan, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Raj Thackerays picking a fight with the Bachchans was an act of political muscle-flexing. What was surprising was the silence of the chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, as the controversy played itself out, through comments-counter comments and violence. Thackerays anger was sparked by Jaya Bachchans crime of speaking in Hindi, and asking her Marathi brothers to forgive her. So what if Jaya Bachchan speaks in Hindi in Maharashtra, even Satya Sai Baba delivers his sermons in Telugu in the same state. Does Thackeray and his supporters have the guts to take on the the followers of the godman?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
B.K. Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is surprising how easy it is to make a mountain out of a molehill in India, with a little help from the media. There was no need to play the video of Dronas music release over and over again and incite Thackerays sena, which is always looking out for such opportunities. What India needs is the strict enforcement of a law like the one they have in Singapore, which orders anyone accused of vandalism or hooliganism to be taken into custody immediately. It was good to see Sonia Gandhi taking an interest in defusing the crisis. The media, of course, immediately spotted a hidden agenda behind the Congress presidents act.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Chaitali Tarafdar, Singapore

                
	Sir  When Jaya Bachchan said in Mumbai that she was from UP and would therefore speak in Hindi and Mumbaikars should forgive her for it, it was not a casual remark as her husband would have us believe. Every word uttered by her was pregnant with allusion. Raj Thackerays campaign against Amitabh Bachchan for choosing to be the brand ambassador of UP and not Maharashtra was certainly at the back of Jaya Bachchans mind. Thackeray was looking for a suitable controversy to rake up at the time, and Jaya Bachchan handed it to him on a platter.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Vivek Patnaik, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  What kind of people express their love for their state through acts of violence? But then, politics all over India is a study in contrasts. The irony is that the crusaders for regional languages send their own children to elite English-medium schools. Raj Thackeray would have to admit that much of Mumbais prosperity and renown is on account of the Hindi, and not Marathi, film industry. And if he has a problem with outsiders, how is it that businessmen and industrialists have escaped his wrath?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  Bal Thackeray and his estranged nephew, Raj Thackeray, have to bank heavily on popular filmstars for their survival. Attacking filmstars is a no-cost entertainment for the party cadre. A public interest lawsuit should be filed against those who practise the politics of hooliganism. Only the judiciary has the power to rid Indian society and politics of this deadly combination of opportunism and destructiveness.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswajit Parija, Bhubaneswar

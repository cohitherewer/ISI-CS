The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rebellious sepoys, with their zeal to destroy all things British
                                                                                                                 REBELLIOUS SEPOYS, WITH THEIR ZEAL TO DESTROY ALL THINGS BRITISH                                                              
	Dateline 1857: Revolt Against the Raj Text by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, Photo research and editing by Pramod Kapoor, Roli, Rs 595        
	This largish red book on 1857 might be late in catching the bus of the century-and-a-half celebrations of san sattavan, but it could turn out to be one of its most prized members on board. It brings together a solid, scholarly introduction to the tumultuous events of the period with a careful selection of photographs of the time, capturing the unfolding drama and the ultimate tragedy in the three theatres of the revolt - Delhi, Lucknow and Kanpur.        
	Rudrangshu Mukherjee, whose successive micro-studies of the revolt in Lucknow (Awadh in Revolt) and Kanpur (Spectre of Violence) have opened new dimensions in the study of the mass uprising, delves into the shape the movement took in the storm centres and the outer reaches. He uses this to analyse why and how the revolt can be read as the self-conscious political assertion of an apparently desultory collection of sepoys and peasants, and not so much that of their more celebrated overseers and overlords.        
	Mukherjee's study of the events, quite obviously, goes against the grain not only of the colonial historiography that saw the revolt and its suppression as a marker of English heroism and prowess, but also of the Indian rewriting of that history as the nation's first war of independence, which has provided the cause for its celebration on such a giant scale. As specific studies of the storm centres have shown, and not only those by Mukherjee, it was not an undifferentiated mass of Indians who rose against British authority. The impulse for an uprising - provided by the controversy over the use of the spiked Enfield rifle cartridge after the sustained onslaught of British policies that threatened established religion and social and economic ties - was seized by the disgruntled sepoys of the British army. Riding on the back of rumours and a collective fear of the unknown, it quickly spread among the peasantry from within whom the sepoys were drawn. It was only after the fire of rebellion had been lit and the mutinies had succeeded in throwing the British authorities off their guard that the landed chiefs came into the picture at the express wishes of their retainers and peasants to give the rebellion leadership. Bahadur Shah Zafar, Rani of Jhansi and even Nana Sahib were such "reluctant rebels", drawn into the pitfire by their circumstances.        
	As Mukherjee points out, this need for the inclusion of the "quondam rulers" grew out of the rebels' quest for "legitimacy", the desire to invoke a "public authority". Although the looking back, in fact harking back, to a "familiar" order proved costly to the rebels by denying them the strategic thrust or "war of movement", it took nothing away from their agency. The midnight meetings, planned attacks on the symbols of white authority - both life and property - the cutting of telegraph lines, the withholding of provisions from the advancing British army, and even the systematic banditry of the rebels point to a specific pattern of the assault. As Mukherjee points out, "The sepoys were the makers of their own rebellion: they did not challenge British rule in a fit of absent-mindedness."        
	For them, it was a war of religion, and one in which Hindus were as much a part as Muslims. "Brethren to each other", one had as much to lose or gain from the revolt as the other. The only Other in this war were the British, who were "alien, interfering and hostile". Mukherjee says it was perhaps this perception of the rebellion as a struggle to preserve the purity of caste and religion of both Hindus and Muslims that forestalled a sexual attack on white women, equally victims of the movement as their men. However, the absence of rape, Mukherjee relents, is bound to remain an enigma since the survivors could not be expected to own up to their dishonour and the dead women could not tell their tale.        
	The point that the exhaustive introduction to the book stresses constantly is the need to read the history of the revolt in its manifold layers and its finer nuances. This is especially important since the rebels have not left their account of the revolt. The text and images that remain of the movement are primarily obtained from the colonial sources which had their own agenda to promote. But if the reading of the events in this book is aided by the comprehensive introduction and the detailed dateline that are this book's unique feature, the notes with the photographs do not help this task. The captions, fairly detailed by usual standards, are vignettes taken from the main introduction that elaborate on an incident, be it a siege, a recapture or a reconstruction. Felice Beato's photograph of the interiors of Sikandarabagh after the massacre of 2,000 rebels in November 1857 informs dutifully that the deed was carried out by the 93rd Highlanders and the 4th Punjab Regiment, but not why Beato felt it necessary to dig out the bones and skulls for the photograph. What was the message that the photographs of the Nana Sahib of Bithur - there were apparently ten different Nana Sahibs in as many places, giving themselves up to the British authorities (picture, centre) - with chains around his ankles but the topi in place want to send out?         
	The story behind the stories that the pictures recollect is captivating. Clockwise from top left: Bibighur, in which the survivors of the Satichaura Ghat were confined and later massacred; a painting capturing the meeting of James Outram, Henry Havelock and Colin Campbell; ruins of the Residency, where Sir Henry Lawrence was killed; Sikandarabagh after the massacre; a wood engraving of Bahadur Shah Zafar and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson near Humayun's Tomb; and an Indian rebel being executed by canon.        
	As Shahid Amin has pointed out, the photography of the time, "thousands of takes of ruined remains, strung-up rebels, the dead stripped to skulls and bones", help up the Ghadar as an object lesson for all colonial times to come. But perhaps more interesting than the violent images of hangings and torture is what some of the pictures left unsaid. The emptiness of Bibighur tells a thousand horrific tales of brutal killings, while pictures of the bombed residencies with beguiling natives in front of them speak of the meaninglessness of the rebellion. The politics of photography deserved a few lines - from Pramod Kapoor, perhaps, since he has spent considerable effort in putting together this otherwise impressive collection.                          CHIROSREE BASU

	Only fairytale kings at the end of improbable comedies can force sworn enemies to embrace and be friends again. Zimbabwe is neither a fairytale nor a comedy. Protracted nightmare might be nearer the truth of this countrys descent into chaos and brutality under the escalating misrule of Robert Mugabe, president of the country for the last 28 years. All this is now set to change with the new deal brokered by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki. This African solution to an African problem attempts to bring together Mr Mugabe and his political opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of Zimbabwes Movement for Democratic Change, as co-rulers of this hapless nation. Upon this jointly ruled Zimbabwe the eyes of the non-African  and particularly the Western, some would even say the white  world will now be fixed. Only when it is sufficiently clear that Mr Tsvangirai  who has lived most of his recent political life in terror and mistrust of his enemy  is being able to turn the tide of his countrys affairs will the billion-pound aid start to flow in from Britain, the European Union and the United States of America. To intervene any more actively would be considered a regression to imperialism. So they must wait and watch.        
	Meanwhile, Mr Mugabe continues as the president and retains control of nothing less than the army, while Mr Tsvangirai is prime minister, controls the finances and has command over the police. It is important for the latter to control finances, for no Western aid-giver would give Mr Mugabe any money. And having the police under Mr Tsvangirais control is crucial if Zimbabwe, once its new constitution is framed, is to work towards free and fair elections. But there is no looking away from the fact that the deal allows Mr Mugabe and his generals to get away with crimes that add up to considerably more than murder. Somewhere behind the scenes, were there provisions made for a secret amnesty for Mr Mugabe and his men, many of whom, like Mr Mbeki, had been leaders in the struggle against white minority rule? But for Mr Tsvangirai and his men, sharing power with ones killers and torturers could be a bizarre way of moving towards democracy and the rule of law.

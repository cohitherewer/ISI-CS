	The fine art of pointing fingers                  
	Sir  A number of celebrities have raised their voices against the irresponsible and indifferent political leadership of India in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. My question is: how many of them will step forward and send their sons or close friends and relatives to the army, so that they may defend the country if a similar attack happens in future? The answer is a safe guess: none. This is the style of the typical Indian. He seems to know all the possible reasons behind everything that happens, but will do nothing to solve them. It is this attitude that needs to change.           
	Yours faithfully,         Partha Pratim Goswami, Durgapur 
        
	Star in town          
	Sir  The visit of Diego Maradona to Calcutta appears to have done little to improve the dwindling interest in football in the city. The exhibition match and felicitation programme at the Salt Lake stadium was horribly mismanaged. The behaviour of the fans must have shocked the great footballer. It was equally unfortunate that some eminent sportsmen of yesteryear did not get a chance to meet the star. And how is it that the biggest Bengali sportsman of all time, Sourav Ganguly, who is also a keen soccer enthusiast, was not seen at any of the events?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The city of joy often experiences joy bordering on frenzy  as it did during the felicitation of Diego Maradona at the Salt Lake stadium. Maradona had to leave the field midway (Maradona shocked amp; awed, Dec 7). Ever since the living legend made his appearance here, political leaders, securitymen and officials displayed a brazen disregard for protocol in a bid to hobnob with him. For once, the administration cannot blame the public. In the end, the organizers cut a rather sorry figure. With Calcutta representing India before the Argentinian star, the impressions of the country that Maradona took home was one of an unruly, diverse, sport-loving nation with a totally inefficient administration.           
	Yours faithfully       
Sambuddha Sinha, Berhampore 

                
	Sir  Diego Maradonas Calcutta trip had nothing to do with football. It was governed by political considerations, given that Maradona is a self-professed communist, who flaunts tattoos of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. No wonder Subhas Chakraborty flooded the Salt Lake stadium with the same people that he gets for the CPI(M)s Brigade rallies. Maradona too did his bit to please the Bengal comrades, calling George Bush an assassin. A star of his stature should not have used a sporting platform to air his political views.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  What could Diego Maradona have offered our state and the country that Rs 8 crore was spend to invite him to Calcutta? The fund could have been used for far more constructive purposes. It was in bad taste to celebrate so soon after the Mumbai terror attacks. Shouldnt the government have sought the peoples permission before frittering away public money like this?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajasree Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  When the whole of Calcutta was restless to see Diego Maradona, the state sports minister thought it wise to bring thousands of his cadre into the ground, thus depriving those who had bought tickets. The scenes at the stadium certainly left a bad taste in Maradonas mouth. Thankfully, things were handled better the next day at the Mohun Bagan tent, where I was finally able to get a glimpse of the man. It is sad that players and coaches, who would have benefited from Maradonas words, got less time with him than politicians and officials.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Entering a book launch is like stepping into a world of sweetness and light. The author is lionized, with the ladies swooning at his feet, and the fans looking as if they have just had a revelation. Since most of the guests would not have read the book, the questions they ask the author are remarkable for their triteness. And the special ones, invited to throw special light on the author and his creation, usually behave like the Dormouse at Alices tea party. The author, for his part, looks flustered and smug in turns  like a proud new mother. If the author is a woman, she wears an unsure expression that indicates that she is having trouble alternating between being glamorous (therefore dumb) and intelligent (therefore drab). Since womanly vanity urges the author to look her best at her very own party, she always runs the risk of turning up overdressed.        
	The banality of such events causes one to reflect on their significance. When there were no launch parties, did not readers get to know about books by their favourite authors? It is difficult to picturize a T.S Eliot or a Virginia Woolf introducing their books at garden parties or answering inane questions. One imagines with relish how Eliot, who had an impeccable habit of cutting people down, would have handled an obsequious and ignorant audience. Ten years after The Waste Land was published, he wrote in Thoughts after Lambeth (1931), that when I wrote a poem called The Waste Land some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed the disillusionment of a generation, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention. One shudders to imagine how a writer like Milton would have behaved if he had to launch Paradise Lost with a party. Described as an an acrimonious and surly Republican by Dr Johnson, Milton would probably have caused his audience to decamp as he, like his Satan in Hell, threw his baleful eyes around (more so because they were sightless by the time Paradise Lost was published).        
	Very few authors today would be allowed by their publishers to be as contemptuous of their general audience as Milton was. On the contrary, they would be persuaded to go out of their way to woo readers and critics with food and fizz during the launch of their books. But any serious reader would prefer a good review to a boozy launch if he wants to acquaint himself with a new book. So what purposes do launches serve? Are they a symptom of the globalized world, which thrives on exhibitionism? Propped up on stands, with light falling from above, books look disconcertingly like clothes or bags on display in shopping malls. And the writer, obliging photographers and giving predictable sermons, might well be a small screen actor hankering for publicity.         
	I remember having been to a launch in which blown-up images of the bookcover were pasted on the walls of the bookshop in which the party was held. The cover showed a mother and child walking into a ghastly pink sunset. Huddled in the corners, the PR girls looked lost, as if they had stepped out of that landscape and found themselves in a bookshop. Then a doddering old lady with false hair and in rustling silk, who introduced the author, announced gushingly that she would love to disappear into that scene. The author, to his credit, seemed to be wishing the same for her. Last seen, the author was nervously sipping water and freely perspiring in spite of the air conditioning, while this lady, and several of her clan, crowded upon him. I felt a wicked relish in leaving him to his fate. Walking away from this stuffy bookshop, I thought longingly of my little blue room in whose solitude I would soon retire to finish reading my book.

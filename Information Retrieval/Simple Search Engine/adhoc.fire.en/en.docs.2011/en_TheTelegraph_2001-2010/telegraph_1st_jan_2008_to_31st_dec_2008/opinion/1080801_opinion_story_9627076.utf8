	It used to be said once that Indian batsmen always play their second innings better. Jagmohan Dalmiyas critics and admirers  both are many  will hope that the same will hold true for him as he becomes the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal for another time. When he was in power, Mr Dalmiya ran the CAB like his own fief till he was removed after a bitterly-fought election. His performance this time will depend on what attitude he adopts. The CAB is a huge and a cash-rich organization over which predators hover with singular disregard for the game the association is supposed to serve. The best evidence of this is the state of cricket in West Bengal. On the cricket map of India, the state features nowhere; after Sourav Ganguly, no major talent has emerged from the state to play at the national level. Clubs are allowed to proliferate on the Maidan because they fetch votes for whoever is the ruling patron. The CAB has become a platform of politicking and electioneering, rather than the promotion of cricket which should be its only concern. In all fairness, it cannot be said that Mr Dalmiya, like his rivals, has been exactly free of the curse of politicking and manipulation. The need of the hour is the reform of the CAB. Mr Dalmiya has to decide whether he will take on this challenge or choose to remain popular and thus garner votes for the next round of electioneering.        
	Most sports associations and clubs, across the world, are run like companies with salaried professionals at the helm of affairs. Elected committee members do not actually run the associations, they meet at regular intervals, like the board of directors of a company, to review performance and approve policy or to lay down guidelines. The task is to reform the CAB and to bring it up to these international standards. At the moment, the CAB is run like any other Maidan club, only many times magnified. There is far too much interference in all matters from committee members, all of whom assume that they are experts on cricket, and most of whom run their separate cabals within the clubhouse. The critical question before Mr Dalmiya is: does he believe that the CAB needs reforms along the lines suggested above? If he does, will he stand by his convictions and act accordingly without fear of losing votes? The prime minister has set the example of leadership by standing by his beliefs. Will Mr Dalmiya follow suit or will the CAB remain the mofussil outfit that it is?

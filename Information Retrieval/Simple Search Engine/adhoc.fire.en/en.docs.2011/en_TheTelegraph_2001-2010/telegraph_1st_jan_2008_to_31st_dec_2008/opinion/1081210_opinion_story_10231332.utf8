	Degree matters        
	 Even after clearing a written test for the selection of the post of lecturer in textile design in a college, a woman was denied appointment. One of the grounds cited by the authorities was that her three-year BSc textile design course was obtained under a distance education programme whereas the four-year BTech degree course to be taught by her was a regular one. She filed a writ petition. The Punjab and Haryana High Court held that the degree course had been recognised by the University Grants Commission for appointment to all posts of the central government. Under the circumstances, it could not be suggested that such a degree was not acceptable merely because it was awarded under the distance education programme. The court felt that the other grounds cited for denying appointment were also unjustified and directed the issuance of an appointment letter to the petitioner.

	Jungle rule        
	 A forest guard was dismissed from service for felling trees illegally. The guard approached the High Court of Uttaranchal on grounds of improper enquiry and won the case. The state subsequently challenged the high courts judgement in the Supreme Court. Upholding the decision of the high court, the Supreme Court held that the enquiry officer who had conducted the investigation had himself heard the case and imposed the punishment. When an enquiry officer acts as investigator, prosecutor and judge, a violation of natural justice is bound to occur, the court added.

	Army sick        
	 A man who had joined the army in 1979 was invalidated from service in 1986 when he was found to be suffering from Sick Sinus Syndrome. The Medical Board acknowledged the fact that he had a disability. But he was denied pension as the ailment was not found to be attributable to military service. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court, however, directed the payment of the Disability Pension. It held that since the man was not found to be suffering from the ailment at the time of enrolment, it was to be attributed to the stress and strain of military service.

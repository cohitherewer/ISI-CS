                                                                                                                 IMAGES FROM THE PAST                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The National Gallery of Modern Art, housed in the old palatial home of the Jaipur royal family and built at the same time as Edwin Lutyenss Delhi, sits at the end of Rajpath, beyond India Gate, on a quadrangle where many erstwhile royal families were given land to build their residences. It is a building that has the stamp of the architectural design and structure of what Lutyens and his team of architects had conceived of and built for the imperial capital of India.         
	As I entered the gates to view the Raghu Rai retrospective at the NGMA in Delhi, I was rather appalled by the manner in which sculptures were virtually dumped on an unkempt lawn with pots of half-dead flowers arranged in concentric circles. A bored man in mufti was chatting away at the gate, which was kept ajar to prevent cars  except those flashing a red light  from entering the grand portals. One had gatecrashed into babudom, the babudom that has allowed our great heritage to sink into oblivion. A non-stylish board, painted black, had the timings of the exhibition writ upon it in white paint  10am to 5pm  sarkari time, thereby closing its doors to all working Indians. At the domed entrance there were two counters facing each other, making for a corridor, which would let creatures like us to pass through into the other rooms. One was the ticket counter manned by a sullen, bored face, expressionless and wholly disinterested, enough to put you off what was in store. The other was a sales counter selling postcards and prints, not of the photographs on display, but of modern art in general. It is at times like these that one wants to just scream not only for whatever its worth but also, most importantly, to vent ones deep frustration with the babu and his dom.                
	A culture betrayed        
	Controlling my need to spit venom, I looked to the floor and was transported into the finer world, the world of aesthetics and skill. Wonderful, bold geometric patterns in black and white stone that had somehow withstood the neglect, managed to bring some joy back. So did the rest of the architectural elements  the alcoves, pillars, domes, windows and doors, the cornices and more. From one corner window, up near the ceiling, I spied the Jaipur crest, which has been witness to the faded past and the rapid impersonalization of the stately home.        
	Raghu Rais exhibition, particularly his corpus of black and white photographs, jolted me into the other reality, of a fine and cultured India that lives, works and survives in spite of all. There were many curious and interested people wandering through the NGMA, but this monument dedicated to contemporary Indian art had no soul at all. Where are the creative giftshops with art reproductions, books, coasters, mugs and notebooks and a catalogue of the exhibition on view, in addition to catalogues of previous shows? Where is the lively coffee shop? Where is the music playing in the gardens? Where are the benches outside for people to sit on and chat about the better, more cerebral truths of Indian life? Walking through the NGMA felt much like walking through a morgue, looking at visions of a great culture but alas, a culture betrayed.        
	We need a fresh charter for the management of our museums and archives. We need to learn from those who set up the norms in the first place, the British, who have restructured their colonial mindset to deal with a changed cultural world. The Victoria and Albert Museum is proof that a smooth transition to a public-private partnership to administer such institutions is possible if only there is the political will to do so. What stops the government of India from rewriting the act for the conservation of museums and clearing it through the parliament, in a concerted effort to save and celebrate India?

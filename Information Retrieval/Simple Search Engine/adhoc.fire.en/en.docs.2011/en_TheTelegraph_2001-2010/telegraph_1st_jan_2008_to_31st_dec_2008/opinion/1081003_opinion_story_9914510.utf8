	Love bites                  
	Sir  Manmohan Singh and George W. Bush deserve to be congratulated for their successful bonding over the nuclear deal (Lovey-dovey parting gift, Sept 27). The close ties between the two men resulted in a historic shift in Indo-US diplomatic relations. Now the deal has even bagged the Senates approval, after the core conditions were accepted by its Committee on Foreign Relations. This will help India gain prestige among nuclear-energy users across the world, besides reducing its dependence on expensive alternatives such as petroleum.          
	However, the Congress and its allies are in no position to celebrate their achievement. The Opposition has now found new sticks to beat the government with: terror attacks, communal riots, spiralling inflation, unrest in Kashmir and so on. All these are likely to dent Singhs success story with the nuclear deal. Singhs first and foremost duty is to secure the nation against secessionist threats. This should be given a higher priority than other issues such as the nuclear deal. Otherwise, the benefits acquired as a result of the nuclear deal will be lost amidst mass discontent.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  Manmohan Singh got carried away while speaking of the people of Indias profound love for the US president. No one in his right mind can support George Bushs war against terror in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The Indian prime minister has always bent over backwards to please the president of the United States of America and comply with his demands. So much so that Singh ignored the wise counsel of an apprehensive Left and other parties and went ahead with the nuclear deal with America. Singhs comment that the people of India loves Bush deeply blatantly disregarded the sentiments of Indian citizens. It clearly shows how little Singh knows about his people and their feelings.                     
	Yours faithfully       
Rajat Kanti Biswas, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, All for love and nothing (Sept 28), has rightly pointed out that Manmohan Singhs declaration of the Indian peoples love for the US president has united his two political adversaries  the BJP and the Left. The BJP and the Left have seldom let go of an opportunity to heckle Singh and this incident was no exception. A lot has been said about Singhs comment, and whether the prime minister had the right to speak on behalf of all the people of his country. But what remains undeniable is that love in the world of politics is a fleeting affair. The Left and the Congress were affectionate partners at one point of time. Now, after its bitter separation from the Congress, the Left seems to be inching closer to the BJP. The Congress has also found a new soulmate in the Samajwadi Party. But then, in the choppy waters of politics, such fragile bonds seldom pass the test of time.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Kakali Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The prime minister thought that he could win Americas heart by pledging Indias love for George Bush. But it certainly wasnt a wise thing to do at this juncture. Bush is one of the most unpopular presidents in the history of the US, and he will be demitting office in a few months. Manmohan Singhs lofty praise for the president will certainly elicit adverse reactions from the US administration once Bushs tenure ends.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shibani Joardar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Recently, Manmohan Singh spoke effusively about the deep love Indians harboured for George Bush. The prime minister does not have the right to lie about the emotions of a democratic people. Singhs opponents are already bristling at him for making India sign the nuclear deal with the US and his thoughtless comment will stoke their anger further. If a poll were to be held to find out how many Indians love Bush, not even 10 per cent of the people are likely to uphold the prime ministers conviction. Singh should withdraw his statement at the earliest and apologize to his countrymen.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chaman Lal, New Delhi

                
	Sir  Has Manmohan Singh forgotten that the US president had once held Indians responsible for the global food crisis? The people of India dislike Bush. This was evident when thousands protested against him during his India visit. Singh may have profound love for George Bush but Indians in general detest the man.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa 

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayars assessment that Manmohan Singhs love for George W. Bush is a sign of his navet is entirely wrong (Deep declarations, Oct 1). Singh knows that a little flattery often fetches bountiful returns in international diplomacy. The Indo-US nuclear deal is definitely a feather on Singhs cap, but the prime ministers controversial statement is likely to take some shine off his success.          
	Yours faithfully,

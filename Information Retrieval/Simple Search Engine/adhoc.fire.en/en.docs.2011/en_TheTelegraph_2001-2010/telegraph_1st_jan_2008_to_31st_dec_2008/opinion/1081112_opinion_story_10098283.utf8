The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Trying to make a blast a thing of the past
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TRYING TO MAKE A BLAST A THING OF THE PAST                              Shabina Akhtar finds out why the proposed amendment to the Explosive Substances Act may help curb terrorist activities                        Terror struck: In the September 13 blasts in Delhi, ammonium nitrate was used as an explosive				                                 
	Remember the bomb blasts at Hyderabads Mecca Masjid on August, 2007, that killed nine people? Or the serial blasts in courts across Uttar Pradesh in November, 2007, that killed 15 and injured over 80? The two blasts opened a new chapter in the history of terrorism in India because the explosives were derived from an innocuous chemical like ammonium nitrate  a chemical that is widely used as a fertiliser.        
	Cut to the recent blasts in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Delhi. Investigations have revealed that here too, instead of the banned RDX, terrorists used a cocktail of explosive substances that included ammonium nitrate in large quantities.        
	The Union government seems to have finally woken up to the need to regulate the sale of ammonium nitrate which is increasingly being put to such deadly use. According to a Press Information Bureau release, following a proposal by the Union home ministry, the Cabinet has given its approval to an amendment to the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The amendment seeks to label ammonium nitrate an explosive substance in order to regulate its sale and its use in the making of bombs.        
	According to the Act, an explosive substance is deemed to include any material that is used for making explosives. Any person who unlawfully and maliciously uses such explosives to cause explosions that are likely to endanger life or to cause serious injury to property is liable to be punished with transportation for life or with imprisonment for a term that may extend to 10 years. There may also be an additional fine, says Calcutta High Court advocate Amjad Ali Sardar.        
	Ammonium nitrate is a water-soluble white crystalline substance that is widely used as a fertiliser in India. Of course, the substance does not have an inherently explosive character. Its only when it is laced with a fuel oil such as diesel does it become an explosive. Combining it with carbon carriers such as wood meal, oil or coal along with sensitisers such as nitroglycerine, tinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene also renders it an explosive. And packing it in tightly with splinters in metal containers increases its impact, explains Rajeev R. Singh, head of the explosives unit, Central Institute of Mining Fuel Research, Dhanbad.        
	However, in a country where the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture and therefore uses ammonium nitrate as a fertiliser, terming the substance an explosive might seriously complicate its legitimate use as well.        
	Says Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police, Calcutta, If the substance is termed an explosive, wholesalers of the chemical will have to keep an account of the buyers and the quantity of chemical purchased. Buyers too would need to produce proof of identity before they can buy ammonium nitrate. Without a detailed record, it would be difficult to investigate a crime if there is a terrorist incident.        
	Conscious of the dangers involved, many manufacturers have stopped dealing in ammonium nitrate altogether. Says H.R. Patel, assistant manager of Krishak Bharati Cooperative Ltd, Gujarat, A licence was always required to manufacture and sell ammonium nitrate. But the growing use of the chemical as an explosive has prompted many in Gujarat, including us, to stop manufacturing it altogether. The only company manufacturing the substance in the state now is the government-run Gujarat State Fertilisers and Chemicals Company Ltd. He adds that many village co-operatives in the state now keep a record of the amount of the substance coming into the village and of who is buying how much.        
	While most lawyers welcome the proposed amendment, all are sceptical about its implementation. Says Amitava Ganguly, special prosecutor, Government of India, I fear that it will be misused to harass poor peasants who will become unfortunate targets of the police.        
	However, advocate Santanu Dutta of the Alipore Court argues, The purpose of the amendment is to check the growing terrorist attacks. If the amendment makes it difficult for terrorists to procure the chemical, that purpose would be served.        
	Experts point out that the best way to keep terrorists at bay without disrupting the legitimate use of ammonium nitrate would be to take a cue from the Australian and US governments. In these countries the explosive character of the chemical is neutralised before making it available in the market. A law should be passed making it mandatory for manufacturers of ammonium nitrate to neutralise its explosive character before dispatching it as a fertiliser. That would definitely curb the menace, says Shamim.        
	The government is, in fact, considering approaching a US company that has a patent on the process of neutralising the explosive properties of ammonium nitrate. Home ministry sources say that once the permit is received, the government can order the mixing of a particular chemical with ammonium nitrate to turn it into a chemical that will pose no potential danger.         
	No doubt that would go some way in combating terrorism.

                 CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay
               
	Chinas new labour law came into effect just three weeks ago, on January 1, providing the kind of safeguards organized labour enjoys everywhere. But the consequences came into play a good two months earlier, targeting the very people the law was supposed to protect. Walmart fired 100 workers; as many as 7,000 resigned from Huawei, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, and other well-known firms such as LG Electronics and Spreadtrum Communications followed their examples. Various reasons were given for these mass dismissals: Walmart called it a global human resource strategy; LG said the move was aimed at getting a higher status in the industry, while Huawei, describing it as a human resource restructure, cited enhanced competitiveness as the reason. No one was fooled, and the papers drew the only parallel that could be drawn. 
    
	Known as the Labour Contract Law, the new legislation makes written labour contracts mandatory. An employee can now claim double the salary for the months worked without a written contract. As in India, almost no one working at the lower levels in the informal sector signs a contract here. 
    
	The new law also limits the short-term contracts most foreign companies offer their employees to two years. After that, if the firm values the employee, it must enter into an open-ended agreement with him or her. Those who have already put in 10 years in the same company are now automatically entitled to such agreements. Employed for life!, foreign firms have begun screaming in horror. Finally, the law shortens the notorious probationary period used to deny employees their rights, be it salary, leave or overtime. Working conditions in Chinese-owned small enterprises are generally so unbearable that most low-end employees leave before the probationary period is over, which suits the owner fine. 
        
	New deal
    
	Most importantly, the law allows individual employees to sue their employers, without having to take the long, and often fruitless, route they had had to till now: lodging a complaint with the official union, and hoping their rights wouldnt be compromised. Chinese and Taiwanese firms are said to be the most notorious when it comes to working conditions, but as the reflex actions of giants show, this new law has many big guns doing their best to avoid it. Foreign law firms working in China, which represent foreign companies, are busy helping their clients draw up contracts to save the latter from being sued. Many small foreign employers are terminating the services of those on probation or those whose contracts were coming to an end, complaining that they dont want to be burdened with unsatisfactory Chinese employees. However, lawyers are advising against this, saying its about time foreign employers in China became professional. 
    
	Before passing this new law, Chinese ministers went to the US with these proposals, and returned with dire warnings of flight of capital if they came into being. In China, the American Chamber of Commerce had issued similar threats. Just how serious the government is about the new provisions was evident in the Huawei case. Huawei gave 7,000 employees who had worked for more than eight years a golden handshake, offering fresh three year contracts to many of them, thus nullifying the law. Widespread criticism forced the official union to probe the mass resignations, and it reportedly persuaded Huawei to suspend its plan  after most of the 7,000 had already resigned and 6,000 had re-joined. That was the last heard on the issue; no more coverage on this, said Big Brother. 
    
	Nevertheless, lawyers are certain the new law wont remain as toothless as the old labour laws. It will be made effective by individuals going to court, especially against foreign firms, they prophesy.

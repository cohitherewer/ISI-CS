The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Neither humour nor horror
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NEITHER HUMOUR NOR HORROR                              Somak Ghoshal      Visual Arts                                                
	Inspired by Sukumar Rays Khichudi, Nidhi Jalans Abol Tabol (Akar Prakar, August 5-20) is a collection of extraordinary creatures modelled in clay. It would be too adventurous to call these figures supernatural, or even fantastic, since they simply fall short of such epithets. Rays bestiary grew out of an inspired jumble of animal forms brought to life in a topsy-turvy idiom  Byakaron mani na, as the narrator makes clear. Compared to Rays visual chaos, Jalans perfectly sculpted forms look rather tame and cosmetic.         
	Jalan is an installation artist trained in sculpture, papermaking and videography. Metamorphosis, decay, entropy and vanitas are the themes to which her art returns, ever since her startling works in clay in 2002. This early series is an unsentimental meditation on the body in pain, with forms gently undulating between the figurative and the abstract. There is the hint of an unspeakable menace looming over these contorted faces, the stitched-up torsos sprawled on wet floors  perhaps even something darkly futuristic (the horrors of Abu Ghraib were yet to be revealed). But Jalan seems to have moved away from this morbidly fascinating vision of humanity. The clay, wire, buckets and iron rods that keep appearing in her works between 2003 and 2005  like vague echoes of Tracey Emin  do not become wildly challenging art. Similarly, the technically accomplished figures in Abol Tabol, harking back to her own series, His Masters Voice, are too perfectly executed. It is this cloying prettiness that makes her menagerie of imagined creatures appear somewhat pedestrian.         
	Jalan has not faithfully imitated Rays unforgettable pantheon of bizarre creatures. It is in vain that we look out for Hansjaru, Hatimi or Bakachhap. The little that we get from Rays masterpiece of nonsense verse is in the way of weak, and rather indistinct, allusions. An unwieldy wire mesh, with Octopus-like tentacles, catches these figures in a monstrous embrace. It is this structure, reminiscent of the gigantic spiders by Louis Bourgeois, that lends a threatening edge to the show. But on their own, Jalans figures remain singularly anodyne, resembling sci-fi humanoids, rather than creatures carved out of mystery and imagination.         
	Despite the dimly-lit rooms, the use of canned sounds (like a disturbing mishmash of trance music and the soundtrack of an African Safari), Jalan is unable to make any lasting impression on the viewers. There is neither humour nor horror, only a feeble attempt at make-believe, quickly fizzling out to a feeling of listlessness. However, Jalan deserves credit for putting up a well-curated exhibition of installation art, which is hard to come by in Calcutta.

	A week before the last American presidential elections, I attempted to enter the United States of America via Canada. I had my reasons  I had just visited the University of British Columbia, and was on my way to speak at Oberlin College in Ohio. These reasons were not considered valid by the American visa officer at Toronto airport. (The fact that there is such an office, and officer, on Canadian soil must prove that Canada is the unacknowledged 51st state of the US.) He could not believe that an American university would pay an Indian to lecture on Indian history. When I insisted my visa was valid, a Bangladeshi in the queue behind me whispered, Whatever you do, dont argue with him. I disregarded the advice. An hour later I was on my way home to India.        
	Two weeks before this years presidential election, I sought to enter the US again. I had the same visa, and similar speaking invitations from American universities. This time, landing in Chicago, I was detained for an hour by the immigration authorities. I had expected this, not because of that experience in Toronto in 2004, but because earlier in 2008 I had visited Syria, a country deemed by the Bush administration to be part of their axis of evil. Wishing not to embarrass the universities that had invited me, and recalling also the Bangladeshis sage advice, I answered every question in an even tone of voice. Finally, the officer googled my name, found I was due to speak at the nearby town of Madison in two days time, and let me go.              
	In previous months, I had followed the presidential campaign erratically, but now, in the last stretch, and in the country itself, my interest grew more intense. Travelling through six states of the Union (Canada not one of them), I read reports and editorials in the newspapers, saw speeches and discussions on television, and spoke about the contest in conversations with students, professors, shopkeepers, airline passengers, and taxi-drivers. Through these talks and travels, I came to two major conclusions, which I outline below.        
	The first conclusion was that this was probably the most participatory election in the history of democracy. Normally, a politician announces that he will stand for office; some months later, the voters will vote for or against him. In between, the politician makes the odd speech, releases the odd television commercial and puts up the odd poster.         
	The American presidential election is an exception in that a candidate must first labour hard to get the party nomination, and then strive as hard to be elected president. Now, in both primary and final election, Barrack Obama worked harder than any candidate in the past. That is to say, he made more speeches, raised more money, released more television commercials and travelled more miles than any previous presidential nominee of either party.        
	At the same time, many more people worked for Obama than they had for any previous contender, and worked much harder too. This was, indeed, a triumph for campaigning in and from the grassroots. The Clintons had their big donors; the Republicans their well-funded interest groups and well-oiled party machine. To combat (and defeat) first one and then the other, Obamas men raised billions of dollars from millions of contributors. This money, in turn, was ploughed back into recruiting tens of thousands of volunteers, who made phone-calls and house-visits, and stood on street-corners, urging people of all ages and classes to go out and vote for their candidate.         
	I visited six cities on this trip  in each, I was stopped several times by Obama volunteers, who were less than satisfied by my answer that were I an American citizen, I would have voted for their candidate too. To this outsider, their energy and enthusiasm was palpable; to their fellow Americans, it must have been infectious. Many of my (middle-aged) friends took time off from their jobs as professors and editors to campaign for Obama in key, swing states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina. This was the first time they had done so, although it was the eighth or ninth election they would vote in.         
	My second conclusion was that while for many of his supporters and opponents, the colour of Obamas skin was highly relevant, he succeeded precisely because it seemed to be irrelevant to himself, and because in time he made it irrelevant to the vast majority of uncommitted voters. To be sure, for African-Americans and for white liberals (such as my own friends), Obamas victory would be a fulfilment of the hopes of the civil rights movement. If a black man did become president, then the dream dreamt by Martin Luther King would, to some significant degree, become reality.        
	Race mattered to Obamas opponents, too. There was a significant, if now largely forgotten, moment in the primaries when Hillary Clinton, speaking in Pennsylvania, remarked how happy she was to be in the midst of white, working-class people like herself. The same kind of point was made later, and more often, by Sarah Palin, when she suggested that as a black man educated in Harvard, Obama was doubly removed from the values, not to say the prejudices, of small-town Middle America.        
	To his credit, John McCain did not make any allusions to the colour of Obamas skin. He did make references to Obamas class, however. Sometimes he claimed that his opponent was a votary of class warfare who would rob the rich to give to the poor. At other times, he claimed instead that Obama was an elitist who did not understand the problems and concerns of the working people of the American heartland. Thus, in one of his last speeches, in Virginia, McCain suggested that his rival wanted to throw miners in the state out of work by succumbing to the pressures of his environmentalist friends in California, who hoped that coal-fired power plants would, under an Obama administration, make way for greener technologies. (Desperate times called for desperate measures  for Virginia, long considered a safe state for Republicans, was now veering in the direction of the Democrats.)              
	Obama was smart enough to stand above these sectarian divides of class and race. He did not make much of his blacknessin fact, to counteract it, at key moments he spoke about or visited his ailing white grandmother in Hawaii. Nor did he speak the language of the class warrior. He consistently said that he stood for the interests of middle class Americans, a phrase doubtless influenced by his reading of the academic literature on class. For unlike 19th-century Europe, or 20th-century Asia and Latin America for that matter, the poor in America are motivated less by hatred of the very wealthy than by the embarrassment of being poor. That is to say, what they want is upward mobility for themselves, rather than downward mobility for the rich. They aspire to be part of the middle class  even when by objective criteria of income and property, an American family does not qualify for inclusion in that category, it would still consider itself to be part of the middle class.        
	In winning the presidency, Barrack Obama was helped by the cumulative failures of the Bush administration. He was also helped by the more proximate failures of the American economy. That said, he ran a very smart campaign, the smartness of which lay precisely in his making so little of the colour of his skin. He won not because, nor even in spite, of the fact that he is an African-American. He won because he well understood the power of grassroots campaigning, and understood, even better, the sociology of the American electorate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | before the fall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BEFORE THE FALL                                                    
	Pakistans decline and fall in the hands of Pervez Musharraf seems to have put the fear of imperious presidents into the hearts of Bangladeshis. Almost as a preamble to the high drama over Mr Musharrafs impeachment that is about to unfold today, the judiciary in Bangladesh has responded with a sharp rap on the knuckles of its own president. On August 8, a Bangladeshi high court struck down the special power of the president to appoint supreme court judges by defying the recommendations of a supreme judicial commission. Recently, an ordinance had empowered the president to disregard the SJC while appointing judges to the higher judiciary. Such a provision could have turned into a recipe for disaster in a nation already trapped in a state of emergency since early last year. The caretaker government, which rules with the support of the army, has long outlived the three months usually stipulated for it before fresh elections are called.         
	The interim government, first tried out during the 1991 polls and then recognized by the 13th constitutional amendment in 1996, is a constitutional body expected to create an enabling environment for free and fair elections. The present government, in power since October 2006, has adopted aggressive measures to weed out corrupt politicians, slapping anti-graft proceedings on former prime ministers, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wajed. But overzealousness cannot undo the controversies that underlie its inception. Bangladeshis, having known the horrors of H.M. Ershads military rule, are still sceptical of the role of the army behind this government. The first chief advisor or head of State, Iajuddin Ahmed, had to step down after being in office for less than three months. When emergency was declared, Mr Ahmed became the president  the most powerful, and thus the most dangerous, authority under a caretaker government. Mr Musharraf once used the logic of necessity to undermine constitutional supremacy, but Bangladesh has chosen to be more prudent. Prevention is always better than cure.

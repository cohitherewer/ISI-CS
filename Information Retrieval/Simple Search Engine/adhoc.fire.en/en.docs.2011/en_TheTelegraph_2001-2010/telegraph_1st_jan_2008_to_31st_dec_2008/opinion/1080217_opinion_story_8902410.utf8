	End in sight?                  
	Sir  Not just tigers but rhinos too are being driven towards extinction by the poachers gun (Science establishes tiger truth, Feb 13). Stricter laws, such as issuing shoot-at-sight orders against poachers, are the only way these species could be saved. The government should also consider raising a special police force to tackle the problem of poaching, and expedite the cases against those who are guilty of ruthlessly killing endangered animals such as black bucks. Only then will tigers and rhinos live to see another day.           
	Yours faithfully,        A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 
                  
	Favourite tunes          
	Sir  Play it again and again Sam (Feb 12), by Rohini Chaki, made for delightful reading. The article brought back memories of a time that is long past, but not forgotten. The bars and restaurants on Park Street were the favourite haunts of most young men in Calcutta during the Sixties. Dressed in drainpipe trousers, their hair worn long, young men sporting sunglasses (sometimes even in the dark) crowded Blue Fox, Mags and Trincas to hear the likes of Pam Crain, Brenda and Faye Little and Toto Wallong and his boys respectively. For the not-so-musically inclined, there was Olympia, a watering-hole that was the bastion of Calcuttas intelligentsia. From early evening until closing time, amidst the haze of tobacco smoke and the smell of cheap alcohol, one could share a table with authors, journalists, artists and advertising professionals. Sadly, not much of this remains anymore, except perhaps the music of the Sixties.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Old hands of Calcutta ought to thank Rohini Chaki for her excellent piece which must have reminded them about the best time of their lives. Calcutta in the Sixties was the most happening city in India. Apart from talented musicians, there were other gifted people as well, such as Desmond Doig, the creator of Junior Statesman, which signalled the coming of age of Indias youth. Calcutta in those days also led the country in the spheres such as fashion, decor, music and advertising. Those with a long memory will surely recall those days. Heres wishing more of such articles in The Telegraph.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Mitra, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The Sixties were indeed heady days for Calcuttas music aficionados. The city then was full of magical crooners and musicians who created some unforgettable melodies. And Park Street was the centre of all the musical activity, making Calcutta truly the city of joy. However, the city and its music culture have changed with time. Rohini Chaki points this out in her piece when she writes The magic has altered immeasurably. The loss is entirely ours, I think.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Bengalis love to protest. In fact, they are always on the look out for a reason to start an agitation. Dharnas are staged and bandhs called at the drop of a hat: be it against the tragic killings in Nandigram or for the removal of signal posts near railway tracks (Protest drowns last cry for water, Feb 10). Rajen Hazra had been struck down by a signal post while travelling on a local train. Even as he lay on the tracks, pleading to be taken to hospital, a group of people started a demonstration, demanding the removal of signal posts. Hazras pleas fell on deaf ears, and he died later.Such protests seldom achieve anything, except the loss of lives and property. Hopefully, citizens would soon realize the futility of such protests and resolve to do something constructive instead.           
	Yours faithfully,

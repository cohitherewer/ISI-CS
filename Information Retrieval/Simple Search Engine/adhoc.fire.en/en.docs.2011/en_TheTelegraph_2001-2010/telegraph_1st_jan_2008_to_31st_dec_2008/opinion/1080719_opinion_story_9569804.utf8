	Gallery K2 celebrated its first anniversary by holding an exhibition titled, Art and Industry (June 23 to July 7). Since it was a celebratory occasion, it was not wrong to expect the exhibits to be of superlative quality. That was, however, not the case. Most works were of mediocre-to-poor quality, all of them having been created at a recent art camp in Jamshedpur. The participants were from Bihar, Orissa, Bengal and Jharkhand. Since the artists were mostly from regions outside Bengal, one expected them to show some characteristics of their places of origin. That was not the case. The works could have been painted anywhere. Two of the better works were by Calcutta-based artists. Partha Pratim Debs sunrise, in greys and blues, was the most innovative. Niranjan Pradhan had used scrap material instead of the usual bronze for his sculpture. Subrata Gangopadhyay did not participate in the camp but two of his paintings were on display. Drawing is Kamal Mitras strong suit. He neednt have coloured the arms of the young man in two different colours. Radhas by a certain senior artist sell like hot cakes. Bratin Khan had chosen to paint Jesus and Buddha in that tired style. There were only two artists whose works reflected their social milieu; Krishna Sharan Mahato and Chunaram Hembrom. Both had painted industrial workers and their homes, and even if their works were not of a high quality their content showed some signs of originality.

	What was most notable about Samarohas 13th Barsha Utsab (at Madhusudan Mancha on July 14 and 15) was that many of the artists repeated songs they had sung last year. And, as in the last edition, the audience got to hear only a fraction of Tagores rain-songs though 30-odd artists performed over the two evenings. The first evening featured a larger number of seniors, while the second had more newcomers. Subrata Sengupta, Rajyeshwar Bhattacharya, Achin Mukhopadhyay, Bibhash Chattopadhyay, Sanghamitra Gupta and Abhirup Guhathakurta justified their reputation, though the last two sounded a little under the weather. The new crop of singers was more disappointing than uplifting, with a few exceptions like Supratik Das, Debmalya Chattopadhyay and Suchhanda Ghosh. The likes of Irabati Basu, Apala Basu, Debarati Mitra and Sucharita Poddar have no business sullying the creations of Tagore on public stage.

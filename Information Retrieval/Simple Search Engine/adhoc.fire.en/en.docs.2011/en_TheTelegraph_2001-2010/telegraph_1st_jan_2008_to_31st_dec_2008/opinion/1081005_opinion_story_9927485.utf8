	 When Rahul Gandhi visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar last week, it was, as usual, a fabulous event for the media, but a deeply embarrassing one for the Congress leaders in Punjab. Not one of them  not even a youth Congress leader  had a clue that the prince who doesnt like to be called prince was coming to town. The grapevine has it that the AICC general secretary in charge of Punjab, Margaret Alva, was having her morning cup of tea, the Pradesh Congress chief was having his bath, and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, the former CM, had just woken up when the news channels announced that Rahul had already reached the Golden Temple. The said leaders, it is heard, are yet to recover from the shock of being kept completely in the dark about the trip. What could be worse, if you are in the Congress, than knowing that the scion of The Dynasty does not trust you?                
	 If Rahul Gandhi chooses not to take state leaders into confidence, Shivraj Patil forgets to pass on important information to his colleagues. Imagine the stunned expression on the faces of Union tourism minister Ambika Soni and the minister of state for home, Sriprakash Jaiswal, when they learnt for the first time their own governments decision from the Akali Dal CM of Punjab  that too when the latter announced it at a public function. There was a longstanding demand for changing the name of Nawansheher, the birthplace of Bhagat Singh, after the legendary martyr. But when the Centre finally took a call on it, and named it Bhagat Singh Nagar, Patil forgot to communicate it to his colleagues, including his own deputy, Jaiswal. But Soni and Jaiswal should not be too cross with Patil. Between bandhgalas and bomb scares, theres enough to keep his mind occupied.                            
	 How many registered political parties are there in India? About 900. And how many of them file their income tax returns? Believe it or not, only 21, going by the 2005-06 records. Among the non-filers are members of the UPA, including Laloo Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal. From the records of the those who do file their returns, it can be safely deduced that the fortunes of political outfits look up considerably once they come into power. A good example would be the Bahujan Samaj Party, whose leader, Mayavati, has already been under investigation in a disproportionate assets case. During this particular case, another clever ploy of our netas was unearthed. To keep the identities of big donating industrialists concealed, political parties are likely to break up a fat donation into hundreds of small ones. These are then attributed to as many donors, and neither the Election Commission, nor the IT authorities have the resources or the manpower to check up on individual donors. The few times that this was tried, it was found that the names came with no bodies attached, or, when there were people answering to the names, they were in need of donations themselves. Is there anything in this revelation that we had not suspected all along?                            
	 Think election, and you cant help thinking of political parties. But heres an election with a difference. The peaceful Parsis have been uncharacteristically charged over the campaign to elect trustees to the Bombay Parsi Panchayat. For the first time in the history of the community, every Parsi over the age of 18 has been given the right to choose seven trustees to their self-governing body. Pamphlets and posters are being showered like confetti, mobile phones are abuzz with poll-related messages, and the citys Gujarati papers are running full- or double-page advertisements with profiles of candidates. The two main groups in the fray are Adult Franchize for Progress and World Alliance for Parsi Irani Zarthosthis. The former wants to bring back vultures to the Towers of Silence. The latter simply wants to bring about socio-economic changes.                            
	 Whatever the gains of the Indo-US nuclear deal, it has resulted in one major loss  that of the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The US being allergic to this state, the PMO has all but abandoned the project, though it is heard that India will keep up a front of engaging Iran in negotiations. Is that what they call a pipedream?                            
	 Had Mamata Banerjee not gone to 10 Janpath bearing the gift of a sari for Sonia Gandhi, the power of the nine-yard garment to thaw ice would not have been discovered.           
	 Trivia first. Before playing Kabir Khan in Chak De! India, Shah Rukh Khan had never played a Muslim on screen. It is not known whether his young Muslim fans bore him a grudge on this count, but SRK has certainly endeared himself to them, and to the community elders, by keeping seven fasts and attending a few iftaars in the run-up to this Eid. He started the iftaar ritual in right earnest, but after attending a few, realized that he could not bend his schedule so much so that he could reach the iftaar venues within the prescribed time for the breaking of the fast. But one can always count on a determined and devout man like him to find ways to answer the call of faith. So, instead of iftaars, he started attending the sahri, the pre-dawn meal before the beginning of the day-long fast. All he had to do was stretch his usually long night a little more. But whats that compared to the love and blessings of the maulvis?

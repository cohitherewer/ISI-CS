	 SPECIOUS LOGIC
    Under the provisions of the Right to Information Act, a public authority is bound to provide facts and figures he has access to should anyone seek them. When some people sought information on the fee structure and the curriculum of an educational institution, the latter refused to disclose the data. The institution contended that since the government had reduced its financial aid from 95 per cent to 45 per cent, it had become a private body and so the Act was not applicable to it any more. The Punjab and Haryana High Court rejected the plea. It said the institution had earlier been granted special aid for building infrastructure and that reduction in grants did not mean that it was no longer a public authority. (D.A.V. College Trust amp; Management Society and others vs Director of Public Instruction and others)                           
	Bailed out        
	 A woman lodged a complaint against her mother-in-law for accepting dowry. The mother-in-law applied for anticipatory bail. The Punjab and Haryana High Court observed that while ordinarily such bail would be granted to her, in this particular instance it would not be as she was a retired police constable and hence was likely to influence the investigation. The court also directed the deputation of a senior police officer to monitor the investigation and recover the dowry articles. When the mother-in-law appealed to the Supreme Court, it held that since the appellant had retired 10 years back, it was improbable that she could influence investigation. The court also added that a direction to recover dowry articles could not be given in response to an application for bail. (Mohinder Kaur vs State of Punjab)                             
	Agreeable in-laws        
	 In a divorce case, a woman sought maintenance of Rs 8,000 per month from her husband. The Rajasthan High Court held that since the wife earned Rs 8,000 per month as a government employee, she was not entitled to the same amount as maintenance. In delivering the judgement, the court took into consideration the fact that the couple had been married in a simple ceremony in which there was no exchange of dowry and the wife was encouraged to pursue an LLB course by her husbands family after marriage.

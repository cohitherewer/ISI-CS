	There are cities that love their plumes. Calcutta is different. On two consecutive days, it displayed its worst colours  many would say, its true colours. On Sunday evening, when a very popular spectacle was on at the Eden Gardens, the lights went off, the scoreboard did not work and there was no water. It was a rare exhibition of mismanagement, incompetence and sheer callousness. It is difficult to accept that all the things that went on to spoil the event on Sunday were unavoidable. Rather, in Calcutta the coming together of bad management, ineptitude and indifference is inevitable. These have become the template for the state of West Bengal, however much Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may try to alter its image. The first Twenty20 match at Eden Gardens under the Indian Premier League presented a golden opportunity to showcase the city and the state. It was a chance to tell the rest of India and parts of the world that West Bengal can also produce the best. Exactly the opposite happened. Perhaps the chief minister stayed away from Eden gardens on Sunday evening because he apprehended a poor show, or maybe his penchant for high culture kept him away from a popular event meant to project the city of Calcutta.        
	If Sunday was bad, could Monday be far behind? The bandh yesterday demonstrated that the city has failed to overcome fear, and uses that as an alibi to stay away from work. It is pointless to debate whether yesterdays bandh was successful or not. It has become clear that whenever a bandh is called, does not matter by which political group, people choose to stay away from work. They make this choice because they are frightened of violence. It is precisely this fear that political parties take advantage of when they decide through bandhs to hold the state at ransom. An end to the culture of bandhs can come only from the people of West Bengal. They will have to break this stranglehold of fear and call the bluff of the political parties. If people decide to walk to work, there is very little that the political parties can do. Admittedly, overcoming fear is easier said than done, but it is the only way West Bengal can tell the world that the state is a place that supports enterprise and work. Unless this happens, mismanagement, incompetence and indifference will continue to thrive. Darkness descended on Eden Gardens for thirty minutes; it looms over the state, permanently.

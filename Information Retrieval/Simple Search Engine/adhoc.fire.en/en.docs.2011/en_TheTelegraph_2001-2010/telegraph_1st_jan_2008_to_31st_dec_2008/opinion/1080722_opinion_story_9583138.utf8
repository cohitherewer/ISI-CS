Desai                                                        
	Manmohan Singh met George W. Bush in New York three years ago. Bush, a genuine Texan backwoodsman, took an immediate liking to Manmohan Singh, a real Indian from the plains of Punjab. India had been expelled from the caste of well behaved nations after the Bharatiya Janata Party staged the nuclear ceremony in 1998. Bush offered to escort India to the nuclear Panchayat and get it readmitted. The purification ceremony would be conducted in two phases. First, American Congress would remove the sanctions it had imposed on India. Then the US would take India by the hand, introduce it to the members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and ask the Group to admit it. It would have to accept the disciplines imposed by the NSG and administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency; for example, once admitted to the NSG, it would no longer be able to do an A.Q. Khan. If it promised to behave well, it would be able to import nuclear power stations and fuel for them from members of the NSG, and send them spent fuel for safe storage.         
	While Bush wanted to remove Indias stigma of untouchability, India also had its Brahmins, the Communists, who considered the US untouchable. They did not mind the purification ceremony required to enter the caste of nuclear suppliers. But they did not think the purification would be pucca if an untouchable like the US escorted India to it. They wanted high-born, Brahmin nations like China to sponsor India. The US is not exactly friendly to China. Although China is now on a capitalist growing spree, the Communists consider it to be a comrade that has temporarily lost its way but which will, when it is rich enough, return to communism.               
	Besides, the Communists can no longer live on handouts from Russia and China. Their sights have risen. Now they own two cash cows in India  Kerala and West Bengal. Occupation of states gives them far more wherewithal than charity of their big brothers abroad ever would. And then they discovered a third cash cow in Manmohan Singh. If they befriended him, he would ask his government to pour billions into their captive states.        
	Thus, the Communists managed to extract a good price for support; and the Congress did not mind paying it since the alternative was to be out of power, in which case Congressmen might just as well have retired and gone home to enjoy their considerable wealth.        
	The pecuniary details of the compact were, of course, kept secret and never written down, even by mistake. But as a fig leaf, the two sides agreed on a Common Minimum Programme in 2004. It was a good enough document, but it lacked a critical element: it did not spell out how new subjects  those that were not in the CMP  would be dealt with. But it was clear how to deal with them: the two sides would sit down and agree on fresh additions to the CMP.        
	One such subject was readmission into the nuclear high caste. It was a sticking point because the untouchable US was Indias sponsor. That should have been clear to the Communists from the day Bush met Manmohan Singh. But the two sides were benefiting enormously from their deal: the Congress was in power, and the Communists got billions from the Centre. So Manmohan Singh went ahead with the purification ceremonies, and the Communists pretended as if they knew nothing about it.         
	Then, suddenly, the ceremonies loomed close ahead; the Congress-Communist consultation machinery was cranked up. It worked overtime. Pranab Mukherjee, that inimitable lubricator, was put in charge of it. But he could not bring the two sides together.        
	They never agreed on the nuclear ceremonies; why did they not break up before? Conversely, if they could pull on despite disagreements till now, why can they not now? One answer is that the deal has reached a point of decision: if the government jumps the next two hoops, it will be in the charmed circle of nuclear suppliers. It did not reach this point for all these years. That may have been accidental; but more likely, Manmohan Singh just delayed the ceremonies so that he could stay in power. He has now acted because not upsetting the Communists is no longer a sufficient condition for staying in power. The new condition is that the Congress has to win a general election  and work out alliances that would bring it back to power. Going through the nuclear ceremonies would have brought down the government; now, it will fall whether it goes through them or not. And it does not see an advantage in taking the Communists into the electoral alliance it has to forge. Suddenly, the Communists have become expendable.        
	And the Communists  why are they prepared to break on such a frivolous issue? As far I see, they are not against accepting IAEA safeguards. They are not against India joining the NSG. All they are against is the US sponsoring Indias application to the NSG. The Communists are not saying that India must be sponsored by China or Russia; any old member of NSG would do, as long as it was not the US.              
	The Communists may be devout and irrational, but Manmohan Singh is not. Why does he not find another member of the NSG to sponsor India? The answer is that the US has laid out its own ceremony in its 123 Act that countries have to go through before they are admitted to the nuclear high caste. Purification is a two-step ceremony. First a country has to be washed clean by the Brahmins of US Congress; only then would the NSG consider anointing them.        
	Why, then, does Manmohan Singh not leave it to the next government to go through all the ceremonies? There is at least an 80 per cent chance that the next government will be led by the Congress or the BJP, and will initiate the ceremonies. Is that not good enough? Not for Manmohan Singh, for he may not head the next government.         
	Why, then, did Manmohan Singh not take the BJP with him at every step in the nuclear ceremonies? Why did he not tell them the ceremonies were their idea? Because the Communists would not have liked it. They wanted to be the Congresss exclusive prop. A grand coalition was not an option because the Communists would not eat at the same table as the BJP.        
	And the chances are 100 per cent that the BJP will go through the ceremonies if it comes to power. Why, then, does it not support Manmohan Singh? Because this government is not headed by Advani; he wants to be the man who led India into the new nuclear world.         
	Those outside politics may see politicians as despicable creatures devoid of self-respect. But in fact they have enormous egos; it is their egos that have determined the tortuous course of the nuclear contretemps. That is why they surround themselves with armed guards and keep their own company; mingling with normal people may hurt their ego.

	The Fifties and Sixties were replete with news of food shortages in India. Following the Green Revolution, India became self-sufficient and the memories of shortages became history. The ongoing global food crisis is altogether a new development. The energy crisis, on the other hand, is not new and has remained a global issue since the Seventies. The commodity crisis is more a cyclical phenomenon and hence not entirely unfamiliar, while the banking crisis is self-inflicted. The man-made food crises in Africa are different and have been frequent, leading to misery and starvation deaths.         
	The global reaction to the price rise of energy, food and commodities such as metal and cement has been exacerbated by the sub prime crisis in the banking industry and the rise in inflation.         
	Given the history of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the longevity and impact of the energy crisis will continue to remain uncertain. Bio-fuels were considered to be an important renewable energy substitute and vast amounts of agricultural land have been diverted to bio-fuel production. Various tax incentives have been devised to encourage its use, partly to mitigate the price of crude oil. Although not solely, but to a significant extent, the diversion of agricultural land to bio-fuel production, especially in the United States of America, has been responsible for the current global food shortage.         
	Furthermore, in the developed countries, farmers have been given incentives and compensated so that they leave a part of their land fallow in order to manage food stocks and prices.               
	The rise in food production in countries like India and Mexico was triggered by the Green Revolution of hybrid seeds and a massive increase in the use of fertilizer and pesticides, and the spread of irrigation. Though absolute production went up and self-sufficiency was achieved in India, productivity did not improve significantly; also, there was a gradual deterioration of the soil owing to the excessive use of fertilizers and chemicals. While farming continues to be the only means of livelihood of the majority of people in India, farm incomes have remained sluggish and incentives to improve productivity have not been effective.         
	The first signs of an emerging food crisis were the protests in Mexico City in 2007 against the rising price of corn, the staple of the Mexican poor. The crisis, apparently, was triggered by corn being diverted, especially in North America, to the production of bio-fuel. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of acres were being deforested to grow sugar cane and produce bio-fuels, especially in Brazil.         
	Towards the end of 2007, widespread concern was triggered when food shortages and an unprecedented rise in food prices gradually started being felt across geographies. Simultaneously, global stocks of agricommodities began to shrink and several countries began to restrict the export of agri-products. To cap it all, Thailand has announced its intention to create an OPEC-like cartel, called OREC (or the Organization of Rice Exporting Countries), with members from the major rice-exporting countries of southeast Asia. To confuse issues further, President George W. Bush has made an unsustainable observation that current food shortages and high prices were caused by the changing eating habits of the growing middle classes in India and China.         
	Meanwhile, some other developments are taking place, some of which may be helpful and some not. It is now being more widely acknowledged that, while bio-fuel supplementation of fossil fuels does extend energy availability, its impact on global carbon emission and hence global warming is no less harmful, while taking up land which would otherwise be used for food production. Second, agricultural productivity in countries like India is significantly below the best in class standards. That the potential for raising farm productivity and incomes are indeed enormous, especially in India, has been known but very little has been done in this regard. Third, to quickly improve food availability, agricultural land being kept uncultivated in developed economies should be rapidly brought back into production. There are many short- and medium-term measures to overcome the shortage of food.         
	On the broader issue of global hunger, it must be clearly recognized that no amount of improvement in traditional agriculture production can indefinitely meet the rising demand for food without the help of genetically modified crops. There is no scientific evidence that GM crops pose any environmental or safety hazards, as is made out by certain activist groups without any shred of scientific evidence. The agricultural production of GM crops is now a commercial reality in North as well as South America and Europes objection to genetic crops arises from the moral dilemma of the memory of eugenics of World War II. As in the past, the problem of food shortage will be solved with the help of science.               
	The next Green Revolution for meeting global food demand, while reducing the use of fertilizers and chemicals, and conserving water, cannot be achieved without the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops. This is essential to raise production to meet demand, conserve soil, and reduce use of chemicals, fertilizers and water. In other words, the world must use technology to modernize and advance in order to fulfil the fundamental needs of human survival, in a way similar to what is happening in other fields, such as with genetics in medicine and the silicon chip in communication  the two great scientific revolutions of the 20th century.         
	But the challenge of sustainability will not be fully met until there are more concerted national and international efforts towards achieving an acceptable degree of population equilibrium. This is particularly critical for India. Economic growth does help achieve demographic equilibrium but the time cycles are unusually long. India cannot depend on economic growth alone to meet the challenge of population growth and the need to feed it. If India does not take urgent steps to popularize or publicize the message, and seek national consensus on achieving a degree of demographic equilibrium, we will be overwhelmed by problems of hyper-population which would make global warming pale into insignificance. While we seek advantage from our demographic dividend, India must avoid a demographic catastrophe.         
	Thus, while the present global food crisis is likely to be overcome in the foreseeable future, sustainable food security is made up of a far more complex set of issues and requires global collaboration rather than cartelization and off-the-cuff statements from politicians.

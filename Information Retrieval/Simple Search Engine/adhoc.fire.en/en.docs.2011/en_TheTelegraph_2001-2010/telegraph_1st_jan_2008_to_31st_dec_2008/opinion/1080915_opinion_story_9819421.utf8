	History repeated                  
	Sir  In Pursuit of industry (Sept 9), Ashok V. Desai has done an incisive analysis of the industrial scenario in West Bengal, tracing the history of the present problems. Desais satirical chronicle of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees bid to get industrial investments into the state, in order to cover up the stigma of the preceding years of Left rule, brings out the chief ministers pathetic helplessness. To give his party an image makeover, Bhattacharjee started a revolution on his own, without waiting for the nod from the smaller constituents of the Left Front that he had taken for granted. He virtually prostrated himself before the industrialists from outside Bengal, but hardly spared a thought for the revival of its ailing industries such as jute and engineering tools. Restarting the closed factories of West Bengal would have served Bhattacharjees purpose  of generating employment and creating industry  just as well. This would also have precluded the need for the acquisition of agricultural land, eliminating the possibility of political conflict.           
	The other mistake he made was to underrate the power of the Opposition. The landslide victory in the last assembly elections must have made him complacent. The Singur episode has hopefully given the right lessons to Bhattacharjee. He should be able to understand that decades of apathy and hostility to industry by his own party have spoilt Bengals appetite for it. In this situation, a giant leap forward is not possible, especially at the cost of Bengals agriculture. Bhattacharjee should start getting the dead industries of West Bengal going first to make Bengalis accustomed to industries, before inviting any more industrialists from outside.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  History seems to be repeating itself in Bengal, with investments and talent about to desert the state once again. The Lefts notorious history of resisting industrial growth is coming back to haunt it, this time from the Opposition. The communist governments plan of an industrial resurgence in Bengal lies in tatters at the moment. At this juncture, Ashok V. Desais mockery of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees initiative is unfair. He may have involuntarily played into the hands of the Opposition. Many leaders of Trinamul Congress and its allies are reportedly justifying their illogical opposition to the Singur project by pointing fingers at the Lefts anti-industry stand in the past. But passing the buck in this manner will only jeopardize the states future. It is time to look beyond rabble-rousing and fundamentalism.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait

                
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai feels that entrepreneurs should deal with villagers directly without the mediation of the government. But he also says that peasants here are lessees of the government and hence the latters intervention is imperative for industrial deals. But the real hurdle for direct industrial settlements with the peasants of Bengal is the manner in which they have been misled and bought over for decades by both the ruling and opposition parties. The actual political agenda of the leaders have always remained beyond the level of comprehension of the poor farmers. They have always been used by the leaders as pawns in a bigger electoral game. The Nandigram killings had started long before the villagers had even come in contact with either the government or the Salim group about the process of land acquisition. A free space for direct exchange between industrialists and the sellers of land could have avoided much harm in both Singur and Nandigram. Desai is right in saying that democracy gives too much power to rabble-rousers, leaving the underprivileged in the lurch. Before marching forward with grand industrial projects, the government should consider moving beyond partisanship to empower the entire rural population so that it can decide its own future without being exploited by opportunistic leaders.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhirup Sen, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok V. Desai is not only prejudiced against the Left Front government of West Bengal that is trying to initiate industrial development in the state, but is also derisive of the governors efforts to resolve the Singur impasse. His knowledge of Singur and Nandigram is clearly based on biased media reports. The only sensible point Desai makes is one that economists have been making repeatedly that industry is indispensable for raising the standard of life in rural Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S.R. Ganguli, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Neither the ruling party of Bengal nor the Opposition has been spared by Ashok V. Desai, but he never loses his sense of humour even when he is at his attacking best. For three decades the ruling Left has systematically destroyed all the institutions that Bengal was once proud of. Health and educational services have deteriorated appallingly. Beyond the urban limits, villagers still live in prehistoric conditions. Floods, famines and droughts are regular affairs in the state. But the government and the Opposition are too busy bickering about the acquisition of some acres for industry to pay any attention to far more pressing problems such as illiteracy, inequality and food shortage in rural Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhijit, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Travelling by air has become a costly affair but many travel agents and websites are putting only the nominal basic fare on display to tempt travellers. As a result, many inexperienced passengers have to shell out a hefty sum, only after they come to know about the taxes and airport maintenance charges, immediately before boarding the plane. It may so happen that a passenger does not have enough cash or even credit or debit cards to pay the charges at the last moment. The ministry of aviation must take steps to end this harassment and confusion of passengers by making it mandatory for all airlines to show aeroplane fares inclusive of all taxes and charges.           
	Yours faithfully,

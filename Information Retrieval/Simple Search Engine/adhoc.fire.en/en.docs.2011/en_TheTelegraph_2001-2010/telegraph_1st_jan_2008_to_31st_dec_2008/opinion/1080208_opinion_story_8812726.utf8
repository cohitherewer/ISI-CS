	The Age of Shiva By Manil Suri,
   Bloomsbury, Rs 495        
	It is not difficult to understand why Manil Suris second novel had a long gestation period. Coming seven years after the much-acclaimed The Death of Vishnu, The Age of Shiva has something for everyone. There is the Partition (which seems to provide a perennial fountain of inspiration to most Indian writers in English), there is Hindu-Muslim conflict in post-Independence India, there is an Indian woman supposedly fighting the Rule of the Father (with Indira Gandhi as her more famous counterpart), there is Indian mythology and there is a lot of (bad) sex. Not surprisingly perhaps, in this great turmoil of events there is nothing of the soul. But then, I guess, it is old-fashioned to expect that of successful Indian authors like Suri, who would rather serve their Western readers just those portions of India for which they have developed a taste than waste time on the inner life of characters.        
	The first few pages of the novel are a hymn to the joys of motherhood generally, and specifically to those of lactation. The protagonist, Meera, plays with her infant son, Ashvin, like a lover, teasing him by offering him her nipple and then withdrawing it. The next moment she dreams of the adult Ashvin making love to her and is disappointed to find on waking up that the man tugging at her breast is not her son but his father. This yearning and its frustration set the tone for the novel. For Meera, Ashvin is the hope and the fire, the absolution, the purifier, who will deliver her from the life she finds herself in. Poor Ashvin fails at this task, because the specific nature of his mothers misery remains unknown to him. It is an ignorance he shares with the reader, and probably with his author.        
	The reasons for Meeras disappointment with life are difficult to fathom. Given that as a woman in a patriarchal set-up she has limited life-choices, Meera does marry the man she thinks she loves. If her husbands home is very different from that of her fathers, well, she has chosen it. Moreover, she has no difficulty in falling into the rhythm of her in-laws home by adopting their ways of thinking. So the daughter of an atheist happily performs karva-chauth in her new home. She has her husbands love and lust, as well as those of her brother-in-law as bonus. All fine and well, when the author decides to intervene by bringing in the Partition. The story of Meeras sister-in-law, Sandhya, is a melodramatic tale of loss brought about by the partition of India. All that Sandhya gleans out of that suffering is the desire for a male child to be gifted to her husband as a sign of gratitude for delivering her from the Partitions peril. Meera imbibes the longing and cannot rest until she has conceived a son.        
	Meera gets pregnant soon but her father, Paji, forces her to abort it because he feels that Meera must complete her education before she encumbers her life with maternity. Deprived of her child, Meera thinks that the best way she can assert her will against Paji is by neglecting her studies. Meanwhile, her husband, who was a waster from the very beginning, goes from bad to worse but Meera does not seem to be overly worried about that. She spends her time having wet dreams about a boy who has the misfortune to stalk her, grieving occasionally for the lost child and waiting eagerly for another. She should have considered herself fulfilled when Ashvin comes but, unfortunately, Meeras wish to possess her son, body and soul, can give her no peace. Then her husband dies conveniently and Ashvin becomes the sole receptacle of her needs. He tries his best to perform for some time the role Meera wants him to play by clamber[ing] over [her] in uninhibited exploration, or by allowing her to swish his shamey. But the dawning consciousness of an adult self impels Ashvin to ultimately resist his mothers designs.        
	Suri brings in the myths of Shiva and Parvati to give meaning to Meeras story. When Shiva turns himself into an ascetic, Parvati creates Ganesh out of her body to while away the time. When Shiva returns, he is so enraged on observing the closeness between mother and son that he cuts off Ganeshs head in an act of symbolic castration. If Shiva had never returned, Meera wonders, would Parvati and her boy spend the rest of their yearsPlaying hide-and-seek in the forest, eating when they wanted to, sleeping where and when and how they wished? The myths fit into Meeras story but fail to lend it any depth. Being more bothered with the way Meeras love for Ashvin, or Parvatis for her son, found expression, Suri lets the myths stick out like an afterthought in the narrative. One cannot help feeling that Suri first decided on the title of his novel and then introduced the myths to justify it.        
	Besides this original use of mythology, there are certain exceptional phrases in the novel. Meera has an escapade of running away, and the slumbering Ashvin seems to be advertising sleep itself.        
	Suri fritters away the opportunity of producing what could have been an intense psychological exploration of an exceptional mother-son relationship by confining it entirely to the physical. He puts himself in Meeras body, but not in her mind. As a result, while we get the prurient details of Meeras sexual imaginings, we get to know nothing of the mental complexities that presumably would accompany so passionate an attachment of a mother to her son. And to believe that a woman finds her supreme fulfilment in giving birth to a son and by loving him to the exclusion of all else is to fall into the old patriarchal trap. Even while speaking in Meeras voice, it was not impossible for Suri to distance himself sufficiently from her to indicate the fallacy in her reasoning. He tries that in places, but then his absorption in his heroines fate, or rather, in her body, gets in the way. Suri has threatened to write a third novel that will have Brahma in its title and so will end the trilogy. After this ghastly novel, which is only the second in the triad, one shudders to imagine what the end will be like.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TROUBLE WITH THE TORCH                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Gwynne Dyer                              
	If I were the Chinese bureaucrat responsible for guarding the sacred Olympic flame, the place Id worry about most is Australia. It was there, just before the Melbourne Olympics in 1956, that a student pretending to be an Olympic athlete ran up to the mayor of Sydney and presented him with an Olympic torch consisting of burning underpants in a can nailed on top of a chair leg. He was gone before they realized it was not the real thing.        
	His intention was to mock this pathetic neo-pagan ceremony that was originally invented by the Nazis to spice up the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The Berlin Olympics was Nazi Germanys coming-out party, so Hitlers people arranged for 3,442 racially pure Aryan runners to do a relay race with an Olympic torch from the temple of Hera on Mount Olympus to the stadium in Berlin.        
	This years Olympics was supposed to be Communist Chinas coming-out party, and the route is even more ambitious: 21 countries on all six inhabited continents. But that includes Australia, and I really wouldnt send the torch there if I wanted to preserve Chinas dignity. As England is the spiritual homeland of irony, so is Australia the world capital of mockery, and by the time the torch gets there (if it ever does) the Australians are going to feel challenged.         
	The bar will have been set quite high by the time the torch reaches Canberra. After the propaganda triumphs for the Free Tibet movement in London, Paris and San Francisco the rain of humiliations for the Chinese regime may ease off for a while. But after Dar es Salaam, Muscat and Islamabad, where they dont care much about Tibet, comes New Delhi, where some people care a great deal.                
	Hard feelings        
	There will be a lot of Tibetans in New Delhi, so the run there, if it happens, may resemble a low-intensity war. Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta may be quiet, but then comes Canberra, where Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has already said that the blue track-suited Chinese thugs who have jogged alongside the torch-bearers to fend off protesters will not be allowed to operate.        
	It has become a nightmare for the Chinese bureaucrats who set this thing up: constant humiliations if they carry on with the planned route and utter humiliation if they cancel it. For the moment, they are brazening it out. The Olympic flame belongs to the people around the world, said Wang Hui, a spokesman for the Beijing Olympics organizing committee. So the behaviour of a few separatists would not gain sympathy from people..., he added.        
	Never mind the silly torch. Whats actually colliding here are two irreconcilable views of the world. For almost all Chinese, the turmoil in Tibet is a threat to national unity. Only in the past century have Tibet and the Turkish-speaking, Muslim province of Sinkiang come to be seen as a necessary part of that national unity. Chinese propaganda insists that the local people support that consensus, but it makes no difference if they dont. They have to stay, because national unity is at stake.        
	For almost everybody else, China and Tibets is obviously a colonial relationship, and its perfectly natural for the Tibetans to seek independence. They wont get it this time round, and they may never get it, but why would you be surprised that they try? Indeed, why wouldnt you support them?        
	Foreign governments will never support Tibets independence, because they depend on Chinas trade and they value stability in China above all else. Foreign individuals are under no such constraints, and the interminable, multi-national Tour of the Torch is giving them a lot of opportunities to show their feelings. It isnt anti-Chinese, just pro-Tibetan, but there will be much anger and many hurt feelings by the time this is done.

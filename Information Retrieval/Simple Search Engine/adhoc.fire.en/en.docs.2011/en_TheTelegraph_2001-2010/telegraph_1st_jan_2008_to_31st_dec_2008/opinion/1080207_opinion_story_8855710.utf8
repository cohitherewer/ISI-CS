The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In the cause of tolerance
                                                                                                              IN THE CAUSE OF TOLERANCE                                  Reading about Ayaan Hirsi Alis experiences in Holland reminds Ashok Ganguly of the growing power of lunatic fringes in India                          Trivial pursuits                                  
	I have just finished reading a book entitled Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali. It is about a young girl, Ayaan, the books author, who was born in Somalia. She was one of three children in a family and her doting father had two other wives and children by them. Infidel has been widely reviewed and acclaimed as a massive blow to political correctness in the developed world. The tolerance of isolation and oppression in immigrant ghettos across Europe is supposed to be the way advanced countries deal with such issues.         
	It was a coincidence that I read Alis account of her childhood  in Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Kenya, where she was being brought up in a strictly Islamic household, following customs which the Somali clans adhere to  at a time when the Taslima Nasreen episode was unfolding in India. Ali eventually escaped to Holland as a refugee, received higher education at the University of Liden, and a Dutch citizenship. Within 10 years of arriving in Holland, she was elected a member of parliament. During her years in Africa, while she was working as a translator for Dutch authorities in their interviews with Somali women refugees who had been maltreated in their homes, Ali became deeply affected by the widespread nature of the abuse of women by their husbands and families in the name of religion.         
	Holland has a fairly large population of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants. They came as guest workers after World War II to make up for shortages of menial labour, and were allowed, or at least not discouraged, to remain in their own ghettos. They are into their third generation now. This policy was based on the Dutch philosophy of accommodation and consensus.               
	This goes back 300 years when Dutch Protestants and Catholics, who were vehemently opposed to each other and fought for centuries, eventually found ways to co-exist and prosper, without compromising their beliefs. The Dutch believed that if the various ethnic immigrants were permitted to follow suit, eventually, they would be integrated into Dutch society without losing their uniqueness and beliefs.         
	Ali realized from personal experience that such a transition by the minority immigrant community was unlikely. On the contrary, Holland was sitting on a powder keg whose destructive energy the Dutch were either unaware of or had chosen to ignore. Holland had been the source of the largest deportation of Jews, compared to other European countries, during World War II. That memory created a sense of contriteness in Dutch politics which continued to ignore the rise of immigrant isolation, militancy and crime, while racism continued to simmer just below the surface of Dutch society.         
	Alis outspoken frankness in describing the state of affairs regarding immigrants as it prevailed in Holland in the Nineties eventually led her into Dutch politics and into being elected to the Dutch parliament. As a member of parliament, she became a vocal opponent of Dutch complacency regarding immigrants. While in parliament, Ali got together with the filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, and produced a documentary on the fate of women in the immigrant community in Holland.               
	Theo van Gogh was assassinated in broad daylight on a street in Amsterdam by an immigrant terrorist for producing the documentary along with Ali. This made the Dutch people aware of the real danger that Holland faced from the extremist elements among the immigrant community. There were widespread reprisals and riots in many parts of Holland. The event shook the whole of Europe. Ali naturally became a target of terrorist assassination. She was eventually forced to leave Dutch politics and to emigrate to the United States of America. She found that in a small country like Holland she could not be safe in spite of her numerous friends and admirers.         
	I was amazed at many of the similarities with the Taslima Nasreen episode being currently played out in India. Like the Dutch, we Indians believe that if we ignore or tolerate the tyrannies of a handful of rabble-rousers, it would be the best way to advance the cause of a tolerant civil society. Instead, there is a growing boldness amongst minority leaders in India to raise hell with even trivial issues and foment social unrest. The lunatic fringe in the majority community has resorted to similar methods and is gaining alarming legitimacy, socially and politically.         
	It is indeed amazing how Taslima Nasreen had to flee from Calcutta without the authorities facing up to the reality of the rise of minority militancy while citing law and order  or the absence of it  as the cause behind Taslimas fate.               
	Like the political correctness of the Dutch, our secularism too is in danger of skating on thin ice, which would have its own consequences. In the case of Holland, the experiences of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the assassination of Theo van Gogh exposed the uncompromising intolerance of religious bigotry. In the case of India, the travails of Taslima Nasreen should act as a wake-up call that would help declare limits to the tolerance of militancy, hooliganism and anti-social behaviour.

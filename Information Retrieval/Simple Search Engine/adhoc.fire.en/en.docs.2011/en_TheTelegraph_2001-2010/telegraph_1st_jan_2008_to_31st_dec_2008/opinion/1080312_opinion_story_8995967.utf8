	Top guns                  
	Sir  There is no denying that Team India has given a splendid performance Down Under. But amidst the bravura of young blood, we must not forget the sterling show of the seniors (Eulogy to Team Dhoni, elegy to the elders, Mar 7). It is too early to reject the gifted batsmanship of Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly. They can still provide solidity to the batting order, which has seemed brittle and vulnerable at times in the face of the Aussie bowling attack. Sachin Tendulkar hit the nail on the head when he reminded everyone of the consistent performances of the seniors, who first exposed the chinks in the Australian armour. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma may bring much needed energy into the team, but they are yet to master the technique needed to fend off a really good bowling side. Would India have won both the finals if Tendulkar did not shine?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sambuddha Sinha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Sir  The Indian one-day team under the leadership of M.S. Dhoni deserves all credit for the stunning performance in the Commonwealth Bank tri-series. Each member of the team fought with passion to vanquish the Australians in their den. But this is perhaps also the time to remind the players that they should not get complacent. The bottomline is consistency. For maintaining the current level of performance, Dhonis boys must scrutinize their shortcomings. If they can do that, Team India will be truly invincible.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapash Chatterjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The emphasis on youth in Indian cricket has been a bit over the top. In the tri-series in Australia, the young brigade did give a good account of itself on the field, but in the vital stages of the tournament, the Indian attack was spearheaded not by a young man, but by that old warhorse, Sachin Tendulkar. The Little Master played two of the finest innings of his one-day career and underlined the fact that experience is an important factor in the composition of any team.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Chatterjee , Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Given the way the spectators booed Harbhajan Singh at Sydney in the first final of the tri-series, the International Cricket Council should consider whether Sydney should be allowed to hold international cricket matches in the future. During the last tour of India by Australia, a number of venues, from Baroda to Bangalore to Mumbai, were singled out for criticism by the ICC regarding spectator behaviour. The Sydney crowd was no better than the worst of Indian spectators. So there is no reason for not taking any action against them. What is good for the goose should be good for the gander as well. Of course, Indias victory against Australia in the two finals on the trot could be seen as justice prevailing finally.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa 

      
	Sir  The tri-series in Australia must be ranked as one of the toughest tournaments in the game, alongside the World Cup and the Champions Trophy. Most keen observers of the game would agree that if the umpiring in the Test series had been up to the mark, India would have drawn the series at least. There can be no doubt that India are now on a par with the world champions, if not better than them. And the mastery has spread over all forms of the game, and across age-groups. The Twenty20 World Cup victory in South Africa last year, and the under-19 teams win in the junior world cup the same day as the senior teams tri-series win stand proof of this. Has India created a new world order in cricket? Or is this just a passing phase? Most important, can India win the 2011 World Cup?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  The wheel has turned a full circle for Indian cricket after last years disastrous performance in the World Cup. It is a matter of joy that M.S. Dhoni has come of age as captain, and registered his second major win. All the excitement had actually begun with the victory over England in 2007  the first time in 21 years that we beat them in a Test series in England  and culminated in the tri-series win in Brisbane. As a bonus, we also came up trumps in the under-19 world cup in Kuala Lumpur. The icing on the cake would be if Dhoni amp; Co. can bring home the World Cup in three years time.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  India has finally shed the chokers tag. The team which could not win major finals, has beaten the Aussies in not one but two consecutive finals. Let us hope that these young turks will take Indian cricket to a brave new heights.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashish Kumar Mohanty, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The tri-series victory of the Men in Blue in Australia has silenced many a critic. The talented but untested youngsters that M.S. Dhoni pitched for have not let him down. What more could a captain want? And Dhoni got support from the Little Master too, a kind of support that only Sachin Tendulkar can provide. Indias cricketing future, without doubt, is secure and bullish. Its pool of talent is brimming, it has got a rejuvenated pace attack with Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar, and its skipper, Dhoni, has, once and for all, shed the burden of being in the callow zone of captaincy.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshay, Secunderabad

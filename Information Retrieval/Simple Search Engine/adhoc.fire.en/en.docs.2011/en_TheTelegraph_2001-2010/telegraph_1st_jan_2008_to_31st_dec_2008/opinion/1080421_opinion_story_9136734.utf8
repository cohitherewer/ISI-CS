	On the right track                  
	Sir  Maitree Express has begun its much-awaited journey, providing a rail link between India and Bangladesh (Memory Express, April 15). There is no dispute that this is a well-meaning gesture, aimed at fostering a friendship with a neighbouring country. It is, however, too early to be optimistic about the desired results. There is widespread scepticism among Indians about the success of the train in improving relations with Bangladesh. Despite earnest efforts on the part of India, there has been little reciprocation by Bangladesh. On the contrary, Bangladesh has been allowed to become a safe haven for various insurgent groups operating in India. As trusted allies of the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, fundamentalist groups in Bangladesh have been spreading terror throughout India. The systematic infiltration of Bangladeshis into India is also another cause for worry. One thus cannot be sure of the outcome of the rail route.           
	Yours faithfully,         Srikanta Bhattacharjee,Calcutta              
	Sir  After 43 years, the Maitree Express has bridged the divide between the people of two nations. But it is doubtful if the amity will survive the growing terrorist activities along the border areas and within India. Though the historic occasion was marked by much exhilaration on both sides, it is disappointing that only a few passengers were on board. Perhaps this is an indication that the rail route is commercially unviable. However, this showpiece of successful international relations should continue to run and the recurring loss will have to be shouldered by both the governments.          
	A token attempt to promote tourism to some extent, Maitree poses a security threat. The government will be hard put to determine the number of people who do not return after entering India via this new rail route. Crores of refugees have already crossed over to India, particularly to West Bengal, and the process continues without any show of concern from the state government. India should take steps to tighten security on this train to prevent a terrorist attack such as the one on the Samjhauta Express, the bi-weekly train service between India and Pakistan, in 2007.           
	The external affairs ministry should take up with the Bangladesh government the issue of terrorist and Maoist infiltration through the porous border. Similarly, since the route to India has been made easier, the government should raise the barbed fencing along the border to prevent further infiltration.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee,Burdwan    
	Sir  With the Maitree Express on the right track, relationships will now be renewed spontaneously. However, the Indian government should conduct thorough checks on the profile of those crossing the border.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

                
	Epic hero          
	Sir  The obituary on Charlton Heston, the Oscar-winning actor, was a walk down memory lane for those of us who grew up watching his films (Charlton Heston dies, an epic journey ends, April 7). Hestons life changed forever when he caught the eye of the film director, Cecil DeMille, who cast him as the immortal Moses in his 1956 film, The Ten Commandments. Whether leading the Israelites through the wilderness, parting the Red Sea, or coming down from Mount Sinai with the Tablets of God in his hands, Heston was Moses personified. In fact, he became a Biblical speciality with lead roles in films such as Ben Hur and The Greatest Story Ever Told. The New Biographical Dictionary of Film says that Heston was the screen hero of the 1950s and 1960s, a proven stayer in epics and a pleasing combination of piercing blue eyes amp; tanned beefcake.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  With the death of Charlton Heston, the world has lost one of the most charismatic and accomplished actors. Though his performance in Ben Hur is regarded his best, Heston was undoubtedly superb in The Planet of the Apes. Indeed, his aquiline profile and well-proportioned physique made him one of the most handsome men in Hollywood in his time.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  In The other waiver (April 11), Ashok Mitra points out how crores in bank loans have been swallowed by rich and powerful borrowers who refuse to pay up. However, Mitra does not suggest ways to prevent the loot. He stops at exposing the politics of omission that makes the government dismiss huge defaults but refuse waivers for the poor. Mitra also does not mention the collusion of trade union leaders in these defaults. Not a single strike has been observed by the unions to demand recovery of money through wilful default or for debarring defaulters from further bank loans. Mitra thinks the retrenchment of thousands of junior-grade bank employees is the easiest way to comply with the Basel norms. This may not work out. Also, the reason behind the dip in the level of non-paying assets is improved efficiency in banks owing to the dilution of State ownership.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
G.C. Biswas, Barasat

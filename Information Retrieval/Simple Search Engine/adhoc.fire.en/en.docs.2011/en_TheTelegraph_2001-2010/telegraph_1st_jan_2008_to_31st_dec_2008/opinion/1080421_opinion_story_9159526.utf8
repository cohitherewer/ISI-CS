	There was a time not long ago when a developing country was a country perpetually short of foreign exchange. It would husband every penny of exchange earnings and release them in spoonfuls for essential purposes. This is how India lived till 1991. In the past decade, things have changed. Global reserves have reached the astonishing total of $7.4 trillion. China is the leading holder with $1,682 billion. Japan holds just over a trillion, the European Union and Russia over half a billion each. India held $311,885,000 on April 4. The countries accumulated their reserves almost absent-mindedly. Reserves were considered to be good insurance against payments crises, and more of them was thought to be better.         
	But not all currencies are worth holding. Most, including the rupee, are inconvertible, and so cannot be held by other countries. Of convertible currencies, only a handful was popular  primarily the US dollar, euro, pound sterling and yen. The countries issuing these currencies are among the worlds largest traders, and they are considered financially responsible: they would not follow policies that would lead to precipitate depreciation of their currencies. This assumption was proved wrong by the United States of America. It has run current-account deficits since 1992, but they increased rapidly in recent years, and have exceeded half a trillion dollars a year since 2003. The resulting excess of dollar supply exceeded other countries demand for dollars. As a result, the euro has appreciated from $0.83-$1.04 in 2000 to $1.45-$1.59 in 2008. US dollars constituted 63 per cent of world exchange reserves at the end of 2007; euros, 27 per cent. The countries that held dollars had good reason to envy those that held euros.         
	Once a country begins to calculate economic advantage, there is no stopping it. Now countries  and their gratuitous advisors  are asking why countries should not use reserves to buy shares and bonds in other countries, or even companies and factories. They are talking of countries setting up sovereign wealth funds to manage reserves in the same way as mutual funds manage investors savings. That sends shivers down the spines of governments that are afraid of foreign control of domestic assets. And that includes India. So it was either brave or disingenuous of the governor of the Reserve Bank of India to tell a Washington audience last Monday that India had no policy on sovereign wealth funds. He may have meant that Indias labyrinthine regulations concerning incoming funds were capable of taming any sovereign wealth fund that may attempt entry. Or he may have meant that they were capable of repelling any such fund. He talked of the need for transparency in sovereign wealth funds investments. Maybe he should practise that principle himself, and set up an open, transparent, independent management for Indias foreign exchange reserves.

	Show time                  
	Sir  The launch of Praja Rajyam, the political party of the Telugu megastar, Chiranjeevi, amidst fanfare will hardly have any impact on the present political scenario in Andhra Pradesh. (Fans pack punch into idols debut, Aug 27). The aspiring politician-cum-veteran filmstar should remember that acting is different from politics and one cannot contest against political stalwarts of established ruling parties by spouting rehearsed dialogues. Doing social service through fan clubs and NGOs is entirely different from attempting to do the same through politics. Hopefully Chiranjeevi is aware of the doomed fate of his Bollywood counterparts, such as Amitabh Bachchan or Vinod Khanna, who tried to capitalize on their popularity in the electoral arena. The legendary Tamil actor, Shivaji Ganesan, lost much of his hard-earned fortune by venturing into politics. We wish Chiranjeevi success, but he ought to be prepared for the worst.          
	Yours faithfully,        Ramakrishna Sekar, Visakhapatnam             
	Sir  It was an irony that Chiranjeevi, at the very beginning of his political career, quite bumptiously spoke of eradicating poverty along with other social maladies; but the extravagance of life-size cut-outs, booming loudspeakers and giant screens does little to help the poor of the state. Chiranjeevi is definitely following in the footsteps of his filmstar-turned-politician predecessors by showering money to reinforce his filmi popularity. But he would do well to remember that among the filmstar-turned-politicians, only those survived who looked beyond their popular image and worked for the people.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sanjeevani Pillai, New Delhi

                
	Sir  Chiranjeevi was at his melodramatic best, in keeping with the tradition of south Indian showmanship, during the launch of Praja Rajyam. He spoke about his impoverished origins, the struggles of his youth and made grand promises to free Andhra Pradesh from poverty and corruption. His image-makers had crafted a perfect script, detailing the disparities between the lives of the poor and the rich  a narrative formula used ad nauseam in films. We shall have to wait and see if the script is a success.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bibhash Mohanty, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  Chiranjeevis political journey has opened a new chapter in Andhra Pradesh. One was delighted to know that for Chiranjeevi, helping the poor is of utmost importance. One felt even more thrilled to know that Mahatma Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar and Mother Teresa were among the heros idols. However, Praja Rajyam has to grow beyond the personality-cult if it hopes to bring a meaningful socio-political change in Andhra Pradesh.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Narayan B. Iyer, Mumbai 

      
	Sir  There are already too many regional parties squabbling among themselves in every corner of India. This is becoming more of a hindrance than a help. These bickering political parties are busy making or breaking governments or jeopardizing major industrial projects. The recent turmoil over the Tata project at Singur in West Bengal created by the Trinamul Congress is a perfect example of this. If Chiranjeevi really wanted to serve the people and fight corruption, he could have worked from outside as well, without joining the sordid political race. India needs its existing politicians to fulfil their promises more than it needs new political parties.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Cynical members of several parties of Andhra Pradesh have criticized Chiranjeevis speech at the launch of his political party. They have accused him of not having a meaningful agenda. But why shouldnt an agenda of fighting corruption and welfare of the underprivileged not be good enough? Of course, his promises could well turn out to be exaggerated. But for now, the simplicity of his promises looks good.          
	Yours faithfully,       
V. Rajesh, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  The foray into politics of the Telugu film icon, Chiranjeevi, has been along entirely predictable lines. Filmstars veer towards politics as their screen career begins to wane. Politics and films are both popular media and require almost similar talents: grandiloquent speech delivery and emotional outbursts to win over the audience. Actors therefore find it easy to make the swift transition to politics; and like films, politics too has become a lucrative business in the hands of our corrupt politicians.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Apurba Saha, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  A part of Dum Dum Road, near Nagerbazar, is always occupied by parked cars, two-wheelers and rickshaws. This causes much inconvenience to those who wait to catch buses from here. There is also the bottleneck on the same road between the Hanuman temple and the Dum Dum station, created mainly by auto-rickshaws. But the worst parts are the sides of the rail bridge which are turned into a bazaar and also serve as a rickshaw stand. Is anybody thinking of the commuters?          
	Yours faithfully,      
M.K. Nandi, Calcutta

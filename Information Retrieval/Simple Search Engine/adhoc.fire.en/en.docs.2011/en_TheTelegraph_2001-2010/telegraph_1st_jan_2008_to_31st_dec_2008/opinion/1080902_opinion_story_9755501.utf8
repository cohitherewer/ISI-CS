	On fire                   
	Sir  As the situation in Orissa worsens, one hopes that the governments at the Centre and in the state will do something to protect the lives and property of the Christians there (Houses burn in rural pockets, Aug 29). One cannot be too hopeful, however, since other than expressing their anguish every time people are killed en masse, parliamentarians do nothing worth mentioning. The common people can do nothing but suffer silently when the elected leaders of a country fail to deliver the goods.           
	All Indians share a certain characteristic  they are always willing to hate anyone different from them, whether in religion, politics, caste or class. Politicians have never wasted an opportunity to take advantage of this and set one group against the other. We can resist their designs if we think deeply. There is really not much difference between a Hindu and a Christian, or between a Dalit and a Brahmin. If we look a little beyond the self, it is not difficult to end communal violence. We may recall the words of G.K. Chesterton in this context: The Bible tells us to love our neighbours, and also to love our enemies; probably because they are generally the same people.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Omar Luther King, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The communal clashes in Orissa between the Hindus and Christians is shameful. Barely a decade after the Australian missionary, Graham Staines, was burnt alive with his minor sons in Orissa, suspected activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad set fire to the hostel of a missionary school in Orissas Bargarh district, killing a woman who worked there (Lady burnt alive like Staines, Aug 26). Such incidents are the inevitable results of hate campaigns carried out by political parties, which, instead of working in the interests of the nation, stoke communal sentiments for the sake of votes. As the editorial, Love for hate, (Aug 27), says, governments have allowed the violence of a religious hate campaign to become routine in the heart of a secular republic. Any killing is condemnable, be it that of a Hindu swami, a Christian priest, an imam or of any other person. If one thinks that the only way to avenge a death is by causing more deaths, then one is certainly not in the right mind. Peace would not return to Orissa unless people realize that to use violence is to go against ones religion.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The unrest in Kandhamal district of Orissa owes its origin to, among other factors, the conversion of tribals into Christianity. Christian missionaries, by virtue of their social work in the tribal areas, enjoy enormous clout among them. Conversions have resulted in more problems than solutions. There have been reports of Maoists joining some converts and attacking people from the mainstream. The death of the religious leader, Laxmananda Saraswati, was the result of such an attack.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Pramod Gupta, Delhi 

                
	Sir  After the Orissa violence it seems that minorities are no longer safe in India. Unless the secular government at the Centre comes to the aid of the beleaguered Christians of Orissa fast, the faith of the minorities in the government would be shaken.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  The saffron brigade, which was losing its lustre of late, has got an unexpected boost with the death of Laxmananda Saraswati. No doubt it will try to reap as much electoral dividend out of the death. But the deteriorating condition in Kandhamal is showing Naveen Patnaiks government in a very poor light.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Vivek Patnaik, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  One wonders what the police are doing in Orissa when innocent people are being set on fire. In a state run by a right-wing coalition of the Biju Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the police dare not raise a finger against the VHP. But they would arrest Muslim youths at the drop of a hat, slapping some sham allegation or another on them. In the last few days, hundreds of houses have been burnt in Orissa and thousands of people have fled their villages. But the Central and the state governments continue to wait and watch. Such apathy causes one to despair over the future of India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Sarfraz Adil, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Laxmananda Saraswati was a respected figure in Orissa. The outrage over his death was not unexpected, although its scale was shocking. The Orissa chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, should have taken security measures after the communal violence in Kandhamal in December 2007. Patnaik is also to blame for affairs in Kandhamal getting out of hand.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Bichu Muttathara, Pune 

                
	Sir  The atmosphere in Orissas Kandhamal district has become extremely volatile after the death of Laxmananda Saraswati. The slightest provocation can now rekindle communal fires. Shoot-at-sight orders have been issued. The situation has so worsened there that Kandhamal is attracting the attention of countries all over the world. Vatican has condemned the killing of Christians, as have other countries. The image of India is bound to suffer yet another setback after this mishap.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Ziyaullah Khan, Pune 

                
	Sir  Naveen Patnaik, the author of A Second Paradise, should write another book and call it A Second Hell. The first hell of communal fire tore apart Kandhamal in December 2007, and now there is a second, involving the same characters, following the same pattern, with the same consequences. The state government just refuses to learn from the past.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Santosh Adhikary, Bhubaneswar

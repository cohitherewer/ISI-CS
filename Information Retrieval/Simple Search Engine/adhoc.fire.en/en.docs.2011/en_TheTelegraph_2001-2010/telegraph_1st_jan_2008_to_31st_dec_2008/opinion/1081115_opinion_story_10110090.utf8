	Bibhaban organized its Seventh Intimate Theatre Festival to mark the 75th birth anniversary of Jerzy Grotowski, the Polish guru of poor theatre, who propagated the theory and practice of performance stripped of all trappings  no stage, sets, props, costumes  which directly or indirectly influenced many across the world. Supriyo Samajdar, director of Bibhaban, has experimented with Grotowskian methods for many years and received the rare honour of an invitation to his centre in Poland recently. However, Bibhabans entry at the festival, Black Coffee, has nothing to do with Grotowski, but is a strong statement nonetheless. Written as a conventional dialogue-based play by Samajdar, it features a youth and a partisan debating the politics of industrialization in West Bengal, a subject on which few artists commit themselves in their works. Soven Ganguly and Sudipta Saha act the men convincingly, though the abrupt and ambivalent end could be more hard-hitting. Alternative Living Theatre, one of the Bengali groups who dare to speak out on this issue, contributed Abhagir Swapna to the programme, with a deliberate nod to Saratchandras tragic story. Probir Guhas team expresses the ironical heaven of the unfortunate in his patented style of minimal script and physical action set to loud drumming.

	Subtle shades        
	The baskets, lampshades and plates made of bamboo at the exhibition titled Bamboo, Paper amp; Ceramic Works by Japanese Artists (November 8-17), organized by Weavers Studio at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, inevitably reminded one of similar works by indigenous artisans from the hill states. It is unfortunate that these items, used for household and decorative purposes in India, neither enjoy the status of objet dart here, as they obviously do in Japan, nor do the artisans get to display their works in galleries like their Japanese counterparts. The charm of the ceramic cups, saucers and vases lay in their deceptively shabby look. But the most intriguing objects of the exhibition were the rectangular wall hangings made of paper that looked like gossamer. Coming in watery shades of blue, green or brown, their appeal lay in their subtle power of suggestion.

	Cultural Amnesia: Notes in the Margin of My Time By Clive James, Picador, 8.60        
	In 1819, the year he wrote his greatest poems and letters, Keats ran into Coleridge in London, while walking towards Highgate. They walked together for about two miles in the older poets stately pace, and in the course of the walk STC broached a thousand things  like nightingales, nightmares, metaphysics, monsters and mermaids. In a letter to his brother and sister-in-law, this is how Keats ends his hilarious account of the encounter: I heard his voice as he came towards me  I heard it as he moved away  I heard it all the interval  if it may be called so.         
	I was reminded of Keatss words after working through the 870-odd pages of Clive Jamess Cultural Amnesia. There are hundreds of voices in this book, James writes in the introduction to this attempt at rebuilding Western humanisms Tower of Babel. But the voice that one hears most insistently inside its echoing corridors, and then carries away as one stumbles out into the common day, is Jamess own. The relentlessness of it is somewhere between the formidably improving table-talk of great men (Dr Johnson, Coleridge, Isaiah Berlin) and the indomitably self-savouring verbal flow of sports commentary, television talk-shows and stand-up comedy  all of which James must have excelled in, in his astonishingly prolific and versatile career as writer and entertainer. So it is a bit of a shock to read, on the front cover, a blurb by the contemporary master of unsmiling reticence, J.M. Coetzee (although, on second thoughts, it must be the Australian connection).        
	Coetzee describes this book as a crash-course in civilization. It grew, for almost forty years, out of Jamess impressively multilingual life of reading, driven by an almost ferocious autodidacticism, in the same way as the great Essais grew out of Montaignes reading (the comparison is Jamess own). James would write into the margins and endpapers of his favourite books, and supplement this addiction to commentary by copying quotations into his commonplace books and weaving his own private reflections around them. Cultural Amnesia is the result of putting all these notes together and mulling over them for another three years. The books into which he wrote were the several volumes of Prousts In Search of Lost Time and the three volumes of the Cultural History of the Modern Age by the Viennese natural scientist, polymath and cabaret star, Egon Friedell, who jumped to death from his high window, calling a warning to passers-by (lest he hit them), as he saw Hitlers storm-troopers marching down the street on the day of the Anschluss in 1938. Proust and Friedell are the books chief ghosts, the Anschluss its landmark event (the beginning, as it were, of the long forgetting that James attempts to reverse), and Vienna the city in the cafs of which it all happened, and then unhappened.        
	James arranges his voices alphabetically, and the alphabet makes the strangest bedfellows. C is the most interesting mnage: Albert Camus, Dick Cavett, Paul Celan, Chamfort, Coco Chanel, Charles Chaplin, Nirad C. Chaudhuri, G.K. Chesterton, Jean Cocteau, Gianfranco Contini, Benedetto Croce, Tony Curtis, Ernst Robert Curtius. And so is W, with just Evelyn Waugh and Ludwig Wittgenstein in it. There are other bizarre couplings: Hitler and Heine, Kafka and Keats, Thomas Mann and Mao Zedong, Edward Said and Sainte-Beuve, Tacitus and Margaret Thatcher. There are many names you wouldnt have heard: Ricarda Huch, Alexandra Kollontai, Zinka Milanov, Grigory Ordzhonokidze, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Dubravka Ugresic, Isoroku Yamamoto. But that is the measure of your, or the civilized worlds, amnesia, and of the robustness of Jamess memory.         
	Each entry is prefaced by a little portrait followed by a more-or-less biographical headnote, which then turns into a short essay that flies off on the wings of a quotation or two forming its epigraph. The essays may elaborate on their subjects life and ideas, or may be idiosyncratic digressions meandering out on richly associative paths. So the Thomas Browne note takes off on the title of Urn Burial and becomes a free fantasia on book-titles; Coco Chanels invention of the Little Black Dress occasions a note on the dodgy politics of her sartorial humanism during the Occupation; or a homage to Evelyn Waughs prose style is built around a gleefully-come-upon grammatical error in one of his sentences.        
	There are two unifying threads running through this inventory. First, the story of the formation of Clive Jamess prose. Here, the heroes are Nirad C (for almost the whole of the twentieth century one of the great masters of English prose was an Indian), Louis Armstrong (for the way I thought prose should move I learned a lot from jazz), Hazlitt, Browne and Tacitus (the voice behind the voices) who taught James a way of talking about despotism and terror. The villains here, the monsters of obscurity, are, shockingly, Paul Celan and Walter Benjamin. And this, in spite of his other great theme: a trenchantly polemical critique of anti-Semitism, especially in the very forms of it that destroyed Celan and Benjamin. In the rule of decency that Jamess crash course attempts to rescue from oblivion, there is no room for difficulty, poetic or discursive, for anything that is not luminously accessible. But isnt this a kind of fascism too?

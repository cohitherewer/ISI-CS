                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FEAR OF FLYING                                                    
	One of the great boons of liberalization has been the gift of choice. Time was when weary airline travellers were forced to board old Indian Airlines aircraft, tolerate inordinate delays and accept indifferent service. The coming of private airlines transformed the nature of air travel in India. Even Indian Airlines was forced to spruce itself up because it stood in danger of losing even some of its loyal clientele. Competition resulted directly in improvements. But the curtain seems to be coming down on the luxury of choice that travellers have become accustomed to over the last few years. The irony is that those who have gained the most by the open skies policy pursued by the government of India ever since it began liberalizing the Indian economy are starting this process of limiting choice. This is clear from the announcement that Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines have struck a deal to share various facilities. The deal is obviously an outcome of a grim outlook in which both airlines are poised to make massive losses. It is worth noting that between them, the two airlines control nearly 60 per cent of the domestic market.        
	It cannot be denied that perhaps the alliance makes good business sense from the point of view of the two airlines. But the same cannot be said for those who are frequent users of Jet and Kingfisher. One possible consequence of the alliance is that the two airlines will try not to fly the same routes or at least not fly them around the same times. This will obviously, and inevitably, restrict the choices of air travellers. Another fallout could be a fall in standards of service. Most air travellers agree that Jet and Kingfisher offer the best services and facilities on the ground and on board. One factor behind this has been the fierce competition between the two airlines. If the competition disappears and yesterdays rivals become tomorrows allies, it is not unreasonable to assume, following very simple logic, that the services offered under the new deal will be a trifle below what was available when competition ruled the roost. The motto, the consumer is king, seems to be applicable only when the flying is good. Now that there is some amount of air turbulence, airlines are coming together to protect themselves. The chief victim of this will be the air traveller with his choice restricted, and the cloud of deteriorating services looming over him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | fatal delay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FATAL DELAY                                                    
	Emergencies require people to be quick, informed and humane  and to be all these things in a concerted manner. The accident that Saheli Roy, together with two colleagues and their driver, met with on Saturday might not have been fatal for her if all the people handling the emergency had treated her promptly. In this case, it was the police and a government hospital who were responsible, and one would have thought that this was the best possible combination. But such is the state of these services in Bengal, and when they are most urgently needed, that it proved to be the most unfortunate combination of helpers for Roy and her co-passengers. In spite of the police rule-book requiring them to take accident victims to the nearest available healthcare unit, the police delayed Roys treatment by insisting on taking her to a government hospital much further away from the nearest available unit. Once at this place, the usual bureaucracy took its own inhuman course, and the transfer to a better private hospital was held up by endless paperwork, and Roy did not survive this delay. The usual noises regarding inquiries have been made, of course, to placate the aggrieved.        
	Inefficiency is too mild a word to describe the kind of failure that led to the delay in Roy being treated properly. The mindset that looks for a state-run hospital in such a situation, and the one that insists on red tape later are both difficult to imagine for people who value other human lives. Humane efficiency has long been declared as too much to ask for from government hospitals. There is every indication that the highest authorities in the state government share this view. But the chief minister does often make noises about humanizing the police. Perhaps that process should start with the very basics. What came in the way of promptness on Saturday was something as rudimentary as not knowing the first things.

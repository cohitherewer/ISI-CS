	The Democrats in the United States of America are clearly confused about who they think should be their candidate for the top job in the US and, many would argue, in the world. Their preference is by no means clear even after Super Tuesday. At best, both the competing candidates  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  can claim a tie. At worst, each side can claim to have a slight edge over its rival. Mr Obama won in 14 of the 22 states where Democratic primaries were held. But Ms Clinton walked off with the big prizes like California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The absence of a clear victor is open to a number of interpretations. Out of the cauldron of American culture has emerged two Democratic presidential candidates, one of whom, if she wins, will be the first woman to be president, and the other, if he wins, will be the first Afro-American to lead and run the country. It is not an easy choice to make, and liberal America seems either undecided or split down the middle. For them, Ms Clinton represents experience, someone who knows the system and how to run it. She is known for her tenacity and competence. Mr Obama embodies change. He opposed the Iraq war; he advocates universal health care. This makes him different from George W. Bush and his way of running the US.        
	The ultimate choice the Democrats make may well be determined by certain factors affecting the entire country. The performance of the US economy may prove to be critical. It is obvious that the economy is suffering from the profligacy of Mr Bushs regime. If the downturn continues, the Democrat supporters may like to choose experience over the prophet of change. But even a slight sign of economic recovery could create an ambience of optimism, which might prompt Democrat voters to opt for change. This indecision has inevitably created a certain amount of discomfort within the Democrats since the Republicans seem to have already made up their minds. After the results of Super Tuesday, it will surprise everybody if John McCain did not become the Republican candidate for the race for presidency. Indecision among the Democrats could enable Mr McCain to walk away with their clothes. It would be a serious error to underestimate Mr McCain as a candidate. The race is open. Only after the candidates are announced can the populace make its own preference known.

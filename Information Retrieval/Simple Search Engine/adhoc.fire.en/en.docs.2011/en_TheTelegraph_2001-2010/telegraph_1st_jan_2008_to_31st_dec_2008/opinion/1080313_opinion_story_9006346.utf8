	How the other half lives                  
	Sir  March 8 is celebrated across the world as International Womens Day. But those women who are already in the limelight, such as politicians and artists, get some more attention on this day. I think that it is futile to have a special day for women if the media cannot focus on those who continue to suffer at the hands of men silently. Dowry deaths, female infanticide and foeticide, domestic violence and other forms of oppression are still very much a reality in India. It is only when women, irrespective of class and power, are treated with respect and allowed to step on to the streets without fear of harassment that Womens Day celebrations will be meaningful.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Leena Dey, Calcutta

                
	Sir  This year, International Womens Day became just another day  like Friendship Day or Valentines Day  invented by greeting-card companies. A radio channel, for instance, invited its male listeners to send messages to their girlfriends or wives to make them feel special. March 8 may soon end up becoming just another day of gift-giving and merry-making. After all, why bother about the history of sexual politics when all young boys and girls want to do is have some fun?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Mukul Dube, Delhi 

                
	Sir  Women and men are meant to complement each other. Now that women are as educated as men, they can take decisions of consequence not only at home but also in the workplace. I have concluded from experience that most of the correct decisions taken by men are the result of women prompting from behind their backs. This may not be true always, but it is certainly a fact that womens intuition and foresight are higher than mens. Men are reluctant to admit this because they do not want women to be at the helm of affairs. I feel that India is in safe hands today, with a woman president and another woman, Sonia Gandhi, as the virtual decision-maker. On Womens Day, every man should acknowledge the contribution of at least one woman in his life.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  March 8 has been turned into an event commemorating womens achievements, as though women have already reached the height of their accomplishment and need not go any further. It is time people realized the historical relevance of International Womens Day as the day on which women challenged government policies that discriminated against them. It should be a day for women all over the world to unite and protest against the atrocities that they have to combat daily.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Z. Khan, Pune 

                
	Sir  It is ironic that observations of International Womens Day in India exist alongside widespread gender discrimination. Women like Ratna Saha, who committed suicide after an informal court adjudged her a woman of loose morals (Neighbourhood watch, March 8), are victims of a society that does not practice what it preaches. Shalishi courts, as the one that was convened by the United Refugee Council in Manicktala to sit in judgement over Ratna, have no legal authority to pass decrees. They continue to exist because they come in handy for the leftist government of West Bengal to tackle the opposition. It is significant that the scope of justice as meted out by the kangaroo court did not cover the ruffian with whom Ratna allegedly eloped. He is reportedly a henchman whose muscle-flexing helps the red brigade stay in power in the state. What is the use of flaunting an educated and liberal politician like Brinda Karat when the Left allows illegal courts to hound a woman to death?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The girl child continues to be treated as a burden in most Indian homes because her family has to cough up huge sums as dowry to marry her off. This results in such evils as female foeticide. Unless the government comes forward to protect the girl child, International Womens Day remains irrelevant. There has been a remarkable rise in the registration of properties in womens name in Delhi after stamp-duty on such deals was subsidized. The Union government can contemplate measures such as the reduction of VAT on items registered in favour of women.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  That the women of today have to go an extra mile to prove themselves is no exaggeration (Lab warriors, with eye on field, March 9). The extraordinary lady scientists from the Defence Research and Development Organization, who have juggled the demands of home and work effortlessly, stand apart in a country where women have always been treated as second-class citizens. One should be thankful that these women have received the encouragement they deserve from society and their families. But they have more than compensated for the support they got by developing Indias warfare technology. There couldnt have been a better news report to remember Womens Day.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Credit matters          
	Sir  In Politics of the budget (Mar 10), S.L. Rao suggests that the stock markets have reacted negatively to the budget, partly on account of the farmers loan waiver. It appears to me, however, that the current downturn of the Indian stock market started well before the budget. I am in general agreement with most of the issues Rao raises except for the somewhat simplistic banking channel link he attempts to establish between the budget and current vicissitudes of the Sensex. The Sensex had sustained a massive fall well before February 29. The most we can say is that the budget could not arrest the downturn. It surely failed to play a positive role, but it seems unlikely that it actually intensified the crisis. The banks are least affected by the loan waiver, since the government has guaranteed to protect their balance-sheets. Whichever way the government offers protection, whether from tax revenues or through Reserve Bank borrowings (that is, through money-creation), there is no reason for the value of the banks stocks to sustain a blow. If their stocks have gone down, the event has to be viewed as a part of the general scenario prevailing in the stock market for more than a month. The recent fall in the Sensex, along with the steep rise in the price of food articles, calls for deeper analysis.           
	Yours faithfully,

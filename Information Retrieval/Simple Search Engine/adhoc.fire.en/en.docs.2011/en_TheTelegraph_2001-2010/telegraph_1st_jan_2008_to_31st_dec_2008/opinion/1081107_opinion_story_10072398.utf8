	A king who can be impeached by a two-thirds majority in the parliament may seem a paradox. Yet that is what Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk is, now that he has been crowned king of Bhutan after his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, abdicated absolute power in 2006. It is a further sign of the peculiar coexistence of tradition and modernity that although the young man had been acting more or less as the king for a long time, his coronation had to wait on the verdict of astrologers. The fact that Bhutan, a democracy since March 2008, should feel reassured at the coronation can be understood only with reference to its unusual history. The new kings father had slowly introduced reforms to nudge the country towards democracy. He wisely remained head of the new-fledged parliament; his subjects wanted him and not democracy. In the March elections, the royalist party won hands down. The people of Bhutan are anxious that the kings policies are realized; an overwhelming majority believes that their monarchs have led them to growing prosperity and enduring peace. The same hope is invested in the new king  he should follow in the footsteps of his father for the well-being of his subjects.        
	The old kings concept of gross national happiness has become an article of faith in the country. Being a measure of progress through sustainable development and equity of distribution, it has brought the people benefits, and is part of the philosophy of slow change. The fiercely traditional country has been opening up to the world over the years, although in matters like traditional dress it is still adamant. Even tourists allowed in are limited in number. So perhaps India should count it an honour that it was the only foreign country invited to the coronation. But the idyllic impression given by Bhutan is rather marred by the fact that the Hindus driven out across its borders are still in refugee camps. Perhaps the young king might suggest to his people that acts of exclusion ill befit a national philosophy of equity and happiness.

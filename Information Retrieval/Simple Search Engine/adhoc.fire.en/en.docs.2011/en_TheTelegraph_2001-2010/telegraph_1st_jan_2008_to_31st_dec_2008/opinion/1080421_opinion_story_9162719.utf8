	A telling index of the States savagery in West Bengal is how it treats its dead. (This is unfair to savages, since most of them pay ritual respect to their dead, even if the rituals are different from those of civilized societies.) It is difficult for those who can afford to avoid Bengals government hospitals to imagine the horror of a mother after being handed her dead firstborn, without warning a day after delivery, with the eyes and cheeks nibbled into by an animal, possibly a rodent. This happened day before yesterday in the Barasat district hospital. The dispute now is whether the nibbling happened before or after the baby died. Did it happen in the morgue? Or did it happen when the baby was left lying around somewhere in the ward after it was delivered? There are conflicting versions, and the hospital has allegedly persuaded the parents not to insist on a post-mortem since it claims that the baby died of natural causes. In February last year, another body kept in the morgue of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital was nibbled into in the same way. Not only the dead, but also the living (babies as well as adults) are regularly fed to the flourishing populations of ants, rodents, cats and dogs in many of the government hospitals in Bengals cities, suburbs and districts.        
	The conditions that prevail in these state-run houses of care take on their extreme form when it comes to the morgues. The one in Bangur Hospital, in the heart of the city, lets its dead rot beyond recognition at a temperature of 42 degrees Celsius, unattended and unregistered in concrete tanks. Handling the dead, during cremations in the corporation crematoriums or in police investigations of unnatural deaths, depends on people who are still referred to by their caste. Thus a whole range of medical, forensic and humane norms is undermined with impunity by the State, and the victims helpless poverty makes it easier.

	The latest statistics released by the Centre on womens higher education in India, distressing as they are, will shock nobody. They show that women are the victims of a double discrimination when it comes to going to college: not only do they lose out on being women, but they also lose out on account of caste and community. Fewer women than men go to college; and fewer Muslim women go to college than do Hindu, Sikh or Christian women. Also women from the scheduled castes and tribes and from other backward classes have poorer access to education than do upper-caste women. It is significant that the collation of these results has been sponsored by the University Grants Commission, and they have been released by the ministry of human resource development especially for the heads of Central universities and of the Indian institutes of technology and management. This is not to doubt the truth of these statistics (the truth of these numbers is everywhere around one), but how these figures are used by the ministry ought to be a matter of concern. Given its track record, it would not be surprising at all if the ministry uses these findings to push for further reservations in all these institutions. And that would be dangerous and counter-productive.        
	If these results prove anything, then it is that years of reservations based on gender, caste and community have made little positive difference to womens education. The problem here is with access to education, which is a different matter altogether from the availability of seats. Reservations would be, and have been, the quickest and most superficial of solutions to the problem of access, and, if anything, increases hostilities among communities and castes making it even more difficult for women to get to, and continue studying at, colleges and universities. Only a persistent inability to acknowledge and understand the specific and communally or regionally varied conditions in which women live, work (at home and outside), travel and educate themselves would result in the pushing for continued or enhanced reservations in higher education. Such a solution also absolves the government from thinking through and implementing more comprehensive and fundamental ways of addressing the reality of womens education within chronically disadvantaged communities. The point of these statistics is surely to make the State accountable in a different way.

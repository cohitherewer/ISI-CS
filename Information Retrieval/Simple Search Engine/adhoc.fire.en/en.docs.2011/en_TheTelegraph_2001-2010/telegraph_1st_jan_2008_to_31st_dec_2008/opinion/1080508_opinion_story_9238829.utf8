                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CALL OF A CRISIS                                                    
	A crisis, the wise say, is an opportunity. It offers a chance to clean up and to rectify past mistakes. It is undeniable that the cyclone in Myanmar has resulted in human suffering of inconceivable dimensions. The scale of the suffering is at the root of the crisis that now afflicts Myanmar and its ruling military junta. Relief and rehabilitation have to be offered to those affected; conditions must be created so that life can limp back to a semblance of normalcy. It has become evident that the military junta, which has kept Myanmar shrouded in a veil of secrecy, and has, in fact, insulated Myanmar from external pressures and developments, is incapable, on its own, to meet the task that confronts it in terms of disaster management. It does not possess the resources and is ill-equipped administratively to deal with the situation. The military junta has admitted that the cyclone left in its trail 22,000 dead and 41,000 missing. In the delta of the Irrawaddy, where more than half of the countrys population lives, everything is under water and most places without any form of communication. Very little relief has reached the affected people even five days after the cyclone. Food is scarce and prices are sky-rocketing. One reason for the dearth of food and essential supplies is the closed and secret nature of the ruling regime: very few international agencies are allowed to work in Myanmar.        
	The junta is reluctant to accept outside help. This is the context of the appeal made by George W. Bush, the president of the United States of America, to accept help for the sake of the people of Myanmar. The prevailing situation offers a double-edged opportunity. The military junta can emerge out of its self-defined insularity and become a part of a world that not only has greater resources, but is also more humane and better prepared to cope with disasters. Countries like the US  and even India, which has maintained good relations with the military regime in Myanmar  can exert pressure on the junta to open up and be less secretive. Neither side can ignore this opportunity presented by a crisis precipitated by a natural calamity. The immediate benefit would be better relief touching the lives of more people, but the long-term impact could spell development of Myanmar, and even perhaps the end of military rule. The latter possibility should not hold back the junta: the country should have priority over vested interests.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NOW, AND AGAIN                                                    
	On the face of it, pure logistics seem to have determined the timing of the Jammu and Kashmir elections. The Election Commission has declared that the willingness of several states to spare Urdu-speaking government employees for the polls there and the willingness of political parties in the state to contest the elections ultimately effected the change of mind. But the fact that the commission continues to see the decision as a risk shows how difficult the choice has been. The EC cannot afford to overlook the dangers it exposes its manpower to in a state which has only just witnessed severe turmoil, and where powerful sections continue to thwart efforts by the administration to establish the rule of law. The unprecedented decision to stagger the elections over seven phases is an effort to manage any adverse fallout that the electoral process may have. In taking this calculated risk, the EC would also have considered the enormity of the choice of not having the elections before governors rule expires in January next year. It could be a bleaker season in the state post-winter, with intensified infiltration, with the huge paramilitary staff (stationed to manage the Amarnath crisis) sent elsewhere for the conduct of the general elections and the political temperature raised by allegations against an unrepresentative administration.         
	Jammu and Kashmir is yet to witness the best of times to hold elections. The exercise of franchise has never been undertaken there in entirely peaceful circumstances. Even the 1996 and 2002 elections, regarded as successes, had violent moments. If the assembly elections were not to be held in November, there would be less reason to hope next year would produce conditions conducive to the staging of the general elections in the state. The opposition from the Hurriyat parties and the Peoples Democratic Party to the announcement is predictable. The former, united by the steely resolve of a resurrected Syed Ali Shah Geelani, is already contemplating ways to create an Islamic nizamiat in Kashmir, with support from across the border. And the PDP, facing political rout, cannot be enthused with the poll. Both are bound to create difficulties for the EC, as also the other parties which are looking to reap the benefits of their politics during the Amarnath crusade. But even in the fraught atmosphere, it would be better to give democracy a chance than to have the extremists bury it under the snow.

	Two political elders have been hovering benignly over the landscape of Indian politics since the last decade of the 20th century. Their influence is still felt in subtle ways, although their presence is now fast fading from the public domain. The political beliefs and philosophy of Jyoti Basu and Atal Bihari Vajpayee are like chalk and cheese. Nevertheless, they have had a bearing on Indias politics in not so very dissimilar ways.        
	When Vajpayee was heading the National Democratic Alliance government, his silences were of greater import than his oratory. His unhappiness over the Godhra pogrom in Gujarat was discernible from his silence rather than from his speeches. In 1996, when there was a proposal for Basu to take up the post of prime minister, he was prevented from accepting the job by the party politburo, principally by Prakash Karat and Co. When Basu was asked for his reaction on the matter, he famously said that it was a historic blunder. There are other similarities between these two iconic figures. In coalition politics, as practised in democracies, compromises and disappointments are normal and frequent. Both Vajpayee and Basu were masters in the management of diverse interests and conflicts. During their time in power, there was rarely a public show of dissent or unseemly recriminations among coalition partners as is evident these days.        
	In the past few weeks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has risen above the din and led his government to a win in the trust vote. Prior to the vote, the country was witness to unscrupulous conduct on the part of some politicians culminating in the expulsion of the hugely respected speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) after the event. The role played by comrade Karat makes one wonder whether his party has committed a second historic blunder.         
	The question that has to be answered is whether Chatterjee was acting on his own, or did his actions represent the growing disillusionment within a larger, wiser section of his party? Chatterjees stand is unimpeachable, and his action was in response to a call to prioritize national interests over parochial preoccupations.                
	Voices of reason        
	Similarly, one wonders what the reaction of the saner elements in the Bharatiya Janata Party may have been regarding the two unsuccessful attempts that were reportedly made by several senior party leaders to topple the United Progressive Alliance government. This also brings to mind Brajesh Mishras endorsement of the Indo-US nuclear deal. A former civil servant and Vajpayees right-hand man in the NDA, could Mishra have made the announcement of supporting the deal publicly entirely on his own? The voices of sanity, no matter howsoever feeble, seem to have played a role in moderating the unreasoned Opposition to the nuclear deal.        
	This leads us to the final episode: that of a number of parliamentarians either abstaining during the vote of confidence or defying party whips. It would be easy to explain away their action by alleging that these members of parliament had been bought over with promises and other enticements. Here again, there must have been bigger and more principled forces at play, influencing the MPs to make a commitment for the sake of national interest than people are ready to admit.        
	What is reassuring regarding the events connected with Chatterjee, Mishra and the whip-defying MPs is that in Indian democracy there are still strands of wisdom that persuade people to rise above narrow interests when the occasion demands. The future is difficult to predict, but the recent developments have shown that there still exists a strain of decency in the realm of Indian politics that is the critical force which drives Indian democracy forward.

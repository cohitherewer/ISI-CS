	An Indian warship sank a pirate ship in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday: this incident is more significant than what the summary of it makes it out to be. It would be simplistic to see this action by the Indian navy as part of the navys task to preserve law and order in the high seas and to protect Indian ships that sail on those waters. It is, of course, that. The more important question is that of timing: why has the Indian navy waited so long to act when piracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia has been a hazard for vessels sailing on that route for a long time? The Indian navy has been restrained from acting because of the overarching directive to exercise caution and discretion. The guiding principle of Indian policy on such matters has been to avoid showing unnecessary aggression. In operational terms, this principle has meant inactivity. The only exception was nine years ago when the Indian navy seized a Japanese-owned freighter from Indonesian pirates. By and large, the Indian navy has refrained from troubleshooting in the high seas.        
	The attack on the pirate ship in the Gulf of Aden makes a statement. It announces that India is no longer willing to sit back and watch while pirates rule the waves. There may not be an announced shift of policy; there seldom is in matters like this. But it is unlikely that INS Tabar fired its guns on international waters without prior clearance from the naval headquarters, which in their turn must have got the green signal from policy-makers in the ministry of external affairs. The statement is about Indias self-confidence. The attack on the pirate ship declares that India has the arms and the ability, and is willing to use both with telling effect to secure its own aims and interests. Such decisive use of arms to quell violence may not remain confined to the Gulf of Aden: it might become more visible in other seas and even on land. Indian foreign policy has seldom used the armed option except when the army of a neighbour has threatened Indias borders. Defence rather than offence has been Indias watchword. There are times, though, when offence becomes the best mode of defence. This realization seems to have dawned on Indian policy-makers. If Indian ships are venturing beyond its territorial waters to protect Indian interests, Indian soldiers may not be sitting idle for too long and watch Indias security being threatened by terrorists across the border.

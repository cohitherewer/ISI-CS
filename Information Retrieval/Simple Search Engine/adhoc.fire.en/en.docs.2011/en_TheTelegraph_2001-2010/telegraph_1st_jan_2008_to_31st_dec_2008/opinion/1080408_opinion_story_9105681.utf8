                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BACK TO SQUARE ONE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The reshuffle of the cabinet was disappointing, to say the least, because it made no definitive statement at all despite reports in the daily newspapers claiming that the dropped ministers were not performing, had failed the test of governance and were therefore excluded. The two young turks, Jitin Prasada and Jyotiraditya Scindia, should have been inducted to the ministry at least a year ago to have been allowed the opportunity to deliver over the two years leading up to the general election. They merely have a few months now to get acquainted with the job before they will be hauled across their states in campaign gear to fight an almost losing battle. This is just not fair. Heaven alone knows what the purpose of this gimmick is, except perhaps to give the threatened octogenarians an opportunity to damn the young for failing to perform in the short span of time given to them.        
	Added to this is the continuing status quo in the dull and tired ministries of home, human resource development, law and external affairs. The mindset of the home ministry needs a radical overhaul. It needs a fresh, sensible and contemporary approach to the hitherto unknown and unpredictable areas and events it has to deal with. To refer to the growing Maoist movement across one third of the Indian countryside as being merely a law and order problem, speaks volumes about the intellectual inadequacy of governance. In the education ministry, one is confronted with a fossilized attitude, an attitude so predictable that without even a word uttered we know what the positions are. The cabinet restructuring offered an opportunity for the young, deprived nation eager to join the world of nations to take up the exciting challenge of competition on all fronts. But we have been reduced to having to deal with failed ideologies of the past that repress the mind and robotize the young men and women in a society that is lively and energetic, waiting to be released from this archaic bondage.                
	Living in hope        
	The recent statements relating to external policies of the government have been embarrassing. The attitude of crawling on knees to keep China happy is unacceptable. Small wonder that the Chinese treat us as weaklings and use their clout to pressurize the Indian government into supporting its attitude towards Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The compromise made by the Indian government on the Tibet issue is bound to affect it adversely. It is shameful how the government has managed to destroy, in one unthinking gesture, the privileged position India had secured in the world as result of having allowed a government-in-exile to live here with respect and security. Is it a fear about Arunachal Pradesh, which China threatens to forfeit from time to time, that compels this kind of foreign policy? If so, surely the ministry has members who can think beyond the obvious confines and be creative in their initiatives? Why are we demeaning ourselves? Is this being done simply to appease the Left, whose allegiance to China is well-known, even at the cost of compromising Indias intellectual freedom?        
	Sachin Pilot has been miraculously saved from being only a nine-month-old junior minister by being refused a berth. He can now devote all his energies, much like Rahul Gandhi, to party work and on building a political future for himself that could eventually make him a player of consequence.         
	Once again, the analysis of the shuffle on television left much to be desired. There were silly insinuations about why Pilot was left out or about why T. Subbirami Reddy was dropped. The way the electronic media are fabricating stories, the Congress will have to contend against lies of every kind as well as project a fresh image if it wants to resurrect itself.

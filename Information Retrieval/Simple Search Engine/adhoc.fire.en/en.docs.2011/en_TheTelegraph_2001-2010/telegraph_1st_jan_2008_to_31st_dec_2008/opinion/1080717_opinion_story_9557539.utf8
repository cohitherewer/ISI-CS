	This is the season for constitutional improprieties. Take for one the inclusion of the name of the speaker of the Lok Sabha in the list of Left members of parliament submitted to the president, and then the request to him from Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that he should resign as speaker. The other one was equally serious, if more blatant, but unfortunately not noticed and commented upon. This concerns the visit made to the president, Pratibha Patil, last week, by Leftist leaders, led by Mr Karat, carrying with them a list of MPs who would withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government. The problem with this is that Mr Karat is not a member of the Lok Sabha, nor are the three other leaders who accompanied him. As someone who is not an elected representative of the people, he has, in fact, no locus standi to speak to the president on behalf of persons who have been elected through a popular mandate. In fact, for the purposes of parliamentary politics  and in a democracy that is all that matters  only the parliamentary wing of a political party is relevant and has official recognition. In terms of pure form, the leader of the Left MPs in the Lok Sabha should have gone to the president to convey their collective decision. If it pleases the president, she is free to meet Mr Karat or anyone else, but she cannot, in all propriety, accept him as a spokesman of persons who have been elected by the people.        
	Ms Patil is new to her high office, but there are enough advisors in and around Rashtrapati Bhavan to remind her of the dignity of the office she holds. That dignity is more important than courtesy and personal relationships. No matter what happens, she has to be correct and be seen to be correct at all times. Her office does not permit her to accept a list of MPs and a statement of their intentions from someone who holds no elected or constitutional office. Mr Karat may be all-powerful within the CPI(M), but outside his party, he is nothing more or nothing less than an ordinary citizen of India. It is no coincidence that in both the cases of constitutional impropriety cited here, the common factor is the name of Mr Karat. Is Mr Karat ignorant of constitutional proprieties or is he contemptuous of them? If the answer is yes to either question, he should state his position on the Constitution in very clear terms.

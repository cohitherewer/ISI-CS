                    Importance of being a friend              
	 Your enemys enemy is your friend. The Congress is constantly reminded of this dictum as it sees the speaker hectored and pilloried in Parliament by his erstwhile comrades. There is also tremendous gratitude for the man who, by staying put in his chair, helped the UPA survive the trust vote. One recent incident would suffice to explain. Santosh Mohan Deb, Union minister for heavy industries, had requisitioned a helicopter from the PMO to travel to Bolpur (the speakers constituency) for a new hospital project his ministry was providing for, along with Somnath Chatterjees MPLAD funds. Weeks went by, but there was no response from the PMO. After all, aircraft are few, and demand high. Some more time later, Deb is learnt to have called up Prithviraj Chauhan, minister in the PMO, and told him that the helicopter was for the speaker. The PMO got back in a couple of hours to confirm the booking.                           
	 The Union minister of state for external affairs, Anand Sharma, is a happy man. He is happy with the smooth passage of the N-deal. And he is happy with the temporary charge he has got of the information and broadcasting ministry following the illness of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. To share his happiness, Sharma is apparently hosting pre-Diwali meals and telling everyone who is willing to lend an ear how well the I amp;B ministry can project the good work done by the UPA regime. But his party is disappointed. There are many who feel Sharma should have shown more discretion on his new portfolio when Priyada was still in the hospital.                             
	 Ajit Jogi is back, and with a bang. He is now keen to contest the assembly polls from Marwahi, Chhattisgarh. But other bigwigs are vehemently opposed to it. They think that if Jogi contests, he is bound to be projected as the chief minister, and that would leave them nowhere. The Congress president is puzzled with the opposition. Why shouldnt a popular leader seek peoples vote? For an answer she should look at Madhya Pradesh, where almost all those who aspire to become CM, are unwilling to contest. In that case, her support for Jogi might pull the house down in Chhattisgarh and elsewhere.                             
	 A friend in need is not always a friend indeed. Heres how. Some time back, Sonia Gandhi received communication from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board that Maulana Nadwi, concerned over the anxiety in the minority community after the Jamia Nagar encounter, had urged her to ensure that innocent Muslims were not victimized in the battle against terror. Since Nadwi is from Rae Bareli, Sonias emissary placed a request for a meeting with him. Getting wind of the developments, the Samajwadi Party called on Nadwi and promised to address his concerns. Obviously, the Congress isnt too happy with Mulayam Singh Yadavs eagerness to lessen the burden on Madam.                            
	 George Fernandes is a spent force in politics. That is how some would like him to be, though. An ugly fight has broken out between the BJP and the Janata Dal (U) over his replacement as convener of the NDA. Nitish Kumar is supposed to have indicated that he wants Sharad Yadav to take Fernandes chair. But the BJP is unwilling to let that happen. An indisposed Fernandes suits them better, just as AB Vajpayee had suited them once. Vajpayee had not stepped into Parliament for years except for the trust vote. The BJP has no problems with replacing Fernandes, but not with someone from the JD(U).                             
	 Uma Bharti continues to be a problem child for the BJP although she is no longer in the family. Now there is worry over her probable alliance with the Samajwadi Party, which is trying to use her Lodh vote bank to stir up trouble in Madhya Pradesh. The party is said to have sought help from the RSS to stop her from upsetting their cart. But for how long?                            
	 The best-dressed minister in the country is waiting to be invited to help his party in the poll-bound states of Jammu amp; Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. But sadly for Shivraj Patil, his oratory and his track record arent half as lovely as his starched suits. Seems like hell have to bring out the moth-balls.                        
	 It is not saffronites alone who should worry about Uma Bharti and her proclivities. A recent example shows that the firebrand sanyasin is unlikely to mend her ways when it comes to public conduct. She continues to disregard administrative rules and norms with the same passion that she was once famous for. The Chennai-bound Tamil Nadu Express had an unscheduled halt when someone pulled the chain at the Vidisha railway station in Madhya Pradesh. Hundreds of passengers spotted Uma getting off the train with scores of her securitymen. Her supporters claim that it was a mere coincidence that the incident happened at a place which is only two hours away from where Uma was supposed to hold a rally. The coincidence, incidentally, saved the leader from travelling another forty kilometres to Bhopal and then going back to Vidisha by road. Lets say it is one of the many divine interventions in the life of the sanyasin.

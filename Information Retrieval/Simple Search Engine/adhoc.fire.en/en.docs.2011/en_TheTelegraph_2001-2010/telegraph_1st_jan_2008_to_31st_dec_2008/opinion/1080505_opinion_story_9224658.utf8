	If premonitions are anything to go by, this one should have warned Gordon Brown of the ominous times that lay ahead. Last week, before its humiliating defeat to the Tories in the local elections, Britains ruling Labour government suffered another sharp reversal of fate. In a landmark ruling, the House of Lords declared that the State had been wrong in its discrimination against doctors with overseas qualifications seeking employment in the United Kingdom. This was the culmination of a protracted legal battle that began in 2006 between the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (also representing doctors from Pakistan and Nigeria) and the Labour government. Bapio contested an order from the department of health requiring hospital trusts to employ doctors from outside the European Union only if no suitable candidate from the EU were available. This was followed by a change in immigration laws to make it compulsory for non-EU doctors to obtain a work permit to train with the National Health Service. However, to secure this permit, employers had to establish that no other candidate from the EU would be able to fill the vacancy. It was a no-win situation.        
	These regulations left non-EU doctors, particularly those from the subcontinent, deeply shaken. Doctors from these parts often make the difficult journey abroad at huge personal and financial cost. They are lured by the better pay, improved working conditions and, most of all, by the equal opportunities that underlie the working principles of liberal Western democracies. Under Tony Blair, the Labours indifference to these non-EU sensibilities left thousands of international medical graduates frustrated, and even drove a jobless young Pakistani doctor, stranded in the UK with large debts back home, to suicide. Bapio estimates that 7,000-8,000 doctors would benefit from this legal victory. It is all the more reason that this triumph be now followed by a renewed professionalism in the beneficiaries.

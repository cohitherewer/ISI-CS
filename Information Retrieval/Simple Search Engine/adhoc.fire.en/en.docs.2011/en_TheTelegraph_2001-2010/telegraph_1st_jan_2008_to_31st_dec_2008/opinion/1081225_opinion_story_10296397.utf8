The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Keep the fruit cakes in the family
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       KEEP THE FRUIT CAKES IN THE FAMILY                                  The spirit of Christmas could vary from old-world doggedness and infectious fun to natural gloom                                            
	The only photograph on the walls of Nahoums is of Solomon Nahoum with the workers of the bakery. The framed picture hangs just above the red refrigerator that stores the Black Forest cakes, fruit juices and bottled water. It reminded me of a photo I had seen of Muktibahini soldiers in the Bangladesh War. Instead of steely-jawed men in battle fatigues and helmets that you would expect, these men, steely-jawed all right, were clad in lungis and vests, standing in the middle of a paddy field. Utter the word pastry chef today, and out pops Caucasian-looking men in starched white shirts, aprons and chefs caps. A far cry from the ones in the Nahoums photo: in lungis and spotless white vests, with aprons tied around their waists, some proudly holding trays of baked goodies as they gathered like family around Solomon Nahoum.        
	The Calcuttaness, even Bengaliness, of the image is so strong that it would not have looked out of place at all in an old Bengali press. Curiously enough, the picture belongs to a time when Christmas was an elite festival in the city, when Anglophile Bengali patriarchs would drive down to Nahoums in their Chryslers and Buicks to pick up fruit cakes, brownies and macaroons. As Christmas widened its social base in Calcutta, the festivities also became compartmentalized in terms of the market. The upwardly mobile middle classes that look forward to Dhanteras and Christmas with equal eagerness have no special place in their hearts and dining tables for Nahoums, particularly when flashier confectioners are coming up every other day around every other corner. Even Flurys, another old-timer, has given itself an anti-ageing treatment. That may have upset a few loyalists, but the shop has got itself a bunch of young clients in the bargain. It has also gone ahead and opened a few franchisee outlets in south Calcutta.         
	Such ideas are far from the thinking of David Nahoum, the third generation running the shop and younger brother of the Solomon in the picture. But his stand is entirely in keeping with the ethos of a shop that uses its 80-year-old wooden cash-till to this day. Even the wooden-framed glass cases holding the fish pantras, cheese samosas and rum balls come from another time, when the proof of the pudding was not in its packaging. Nahoums is one of the few businesses around that prefer to cater to a niche market even at a time when refusing to expand and diversify is taken to be a sign of foolhardiness rather than a conscious business strategy. Nahoum Israel Mordecai had started this shop with the modest aim of serving households in and around New Market, and his grandson has not found a good enough reason yet to make other plans. The fact that M.X. DGamas, a neighbour, had to fold up some years ago does not worry him. The Nahoums are Jewish, and yet synonymous with Christmas in Calcutta. I read somewhere that they had contemplated leaving, but I didnt have the heart to ask if such thoughts were back after the attacks on Mumbai.        
	A few paces away from Hogg Market, Free School Street is decked with stalls selling Christmas decorations, though these days, most of the trinkets come with a Made in China tag. On this stretch, stands the blink-and-you-miss-it shop for cold cuts, Kalmans. It was opened by Kalman Kohary, a Hungarian who had come to the city with a travelling circus. The shop is now owned and run by Bishnupada Dhar, who learnt the tricks of the meat-processing trade from Kalman himself. Kalmans, with its cramped interiors, crude methods, newspaper packaging and shabbily turned-out attendants, seems to prove clearly that quality and profit have little or no connection with glitzy packaging.         
	As I stand in the middle of Nahoums Christmas crowd, waiting for my plum cakes to arrive in their simple white boxes with Nahoums written in blue, I notice a middle-aged Bengali gentleman walking into the shop. A first-timer, I say to myself. Elbowing his way through, he surveys what is on offer and comes out with his specification: Amay halka mishtir kichhu dekhan (Show me something thats not too sweet). He seems reasonably pleased with what he gets. Maybe he will come back soon, even if there is no thread of nostalgia tying him to Nahoums.                          SREYASHI DASTIDAR

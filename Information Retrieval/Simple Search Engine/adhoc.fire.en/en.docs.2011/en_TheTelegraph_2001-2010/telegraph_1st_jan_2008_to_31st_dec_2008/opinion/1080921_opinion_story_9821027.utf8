	When words do not heal                  
	Sir  The report, Church to tender Darwin apology (Sept 15), has baffled me. What is the value of an apology expressed more than a hundred years after Charles Darwin died? I have never been able to appreciate the worth of belated apologies. The Canadian prime minister apologized to Indians for the Komagata Maru incident of 1914. Elizabeth II was asked to apologize for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. But do public statements of regret lessen the grief of those affected? If apologies could heal, any crime would be justified in the long run. America may continue with its atrocities in Iraq now and get away by saying sorry later.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Uniform anger          
	Sir  It is outrageous for the Lepchas of the Darjeeling hills to be asked to wear traditional attire during the festive season starting from October 7 (Gurung bid to clear dress code air, Sept 11). The president of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Bimal Gurung, has said that members of the Sherpa, Lepcha, Yolmo and Tamang communities should... sport the daura sural. The daura sural is the traditional dress of the Gorkhas and not of the other communities mentioned by Gurung. As such, they cannot be made to wear a costume that is not a part of their culture.           
	Whatever the GJM leaders might say, the Lepchas are the original inhabitants of the Darjeeling hills. It is they who have accommodated and assimilated the Gorkhas into their culture rather than things being the other way round. It is sad for the Lepchas to know that their guests have now become so powerful as to force the hosts to wear the Gorkha dress. Making all the hill tribes wear similar costumes is an ethnocentric move by Gurung, who clearly wants to dominate the indigenous people. This is nothing but cultural annexation  an unwarranted attempt at control that should not be tolerated.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Charisma K. Lepcha, Shillong

      
	Sir  There can be no argument on the fact that the original natives of the Darjeeling hills and Sikkim are the Lepchas. This can be proved, among other things, by the names of the places, rivers or valleys in the region. Unfortunately, the Lepchas have lived as underdogs in their own land for a long time. Things have come to such a pass now that they are being ordered by Bimal Gurung to dress like the Gorkhas while Bengalis or Marwaris are allowed to wear their own attires. Gurung owes the Lepchas an apology for issuing this outrageous diktat.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Romong Lepcha, San Francisco, US 

                
	Sir  GJM members have threatened those who do not want to accept Bimal Gurungs dress code with unpleasant consequences. This has created an atmosphere of fear in the hills. Many are resentful but are scared to speak up. Perhaps not surprisingly, Gorkhas are almost as annoyed with the command as those from the other hill communities. This is because the majority of the hill people lead a hand-to-mouth existence. They can ill afford a set of traditional dresses. Gurungs command is especially burdensome because of the time of the year when it has been imposed. The period of Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali  popularly known as dasai and tauhar in the hills and Dooars  is a time of extra expenses on gifts and new clothes for family and friends.           
	Gurungs tyranny ironically reminds one of Subash Ghisingh, the leader of the Gorkha National Liberation Front whom Gurung ousted. Ghisingh had also suppressed the voice of the people by formulating autocratic rules. This finally brought about his downfall. If Gurung does not want to go the Ghisingh way, he and his party should be careful not to hurt the sentiments of the people.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FIDDLING ON THE ROOF                                  Malvika Singh                              
	A farcical political play, a theatre of the absurd, is being forced upon us the wide-eyed and curious spectators  as the chair of the chief minister of Rajasthan remains empty despite the fact that Ashok Gehlot had led the Congress to a kind of victory. The Congress did not win decisively but managed to draw some others to join them so that the magic number could be crossed! Many questions arise from this kind of careless confusion. Why is Girija Vyas being considered out of the blue? How long will the decision-makers of the Congress fiddle about, looking for individuals who practise caste-based politics to lead the state instead of choosing a person who is competent and dynamic, able to govern the state with skill and innovation? Why do the incumbent party leaders fight against every change, particularly against the need to deviate from caste-based vote bank politics? Why can they not see that the political landscape has begun to shift and that they are out of sync? Why do they play this charade that humiliates both the individual and the party? This drama that the Delhi-centric Congress leaders are putting us through is becoming ridiculous.        
	Clearly, the people of India aspire to live a dignified life. They have had enough of political exploitation through rhetorical promises and divisive actions, which the intellectually lazy leaders have defined as affirmative action. The new generation of voters will not accept or tolerate this play of politics much longer. Leaders have misused the fact that illiteracy has stalked our land for a long time. They have forgotten that in recent times, television has brought the big bad world out there right into the bastis of the voters and now the latter want a share of the growing, multi-ingredient pie. The people are finally beginning to assert themselves. The large mass of the Indian population, whose cultural and philosophical roots are very strong, has been taken for granted for over sixty years even as the privileged among us grew fatter and richer.                
	New basis        
	Politics based on faith divided Indians. Politics based on caste divided Indians. Politics based on class has divided Indians. The leaders of these frightful divisions have been from different political dispensations. Indians have had enough of this selfish play of politics. The revolution has begun and like most who sit in police-protected ivory towers, living off their failed models and theories of political action, forcing them down our parched throats without our permission, our present-day political leaders are oblivious to the shifts happening under their noses. The phrase, fiddling on the roof, accurately describes what these leaders are doing.        
	Heres a thought: the Congress could restructure itself on a war footing to become once again what it had set out to be  a party that encompasses all the diverse strands of this extraordinary land and pluralistic civilization, has a sane, clear and inclusive agenda for India. Everyone knows what is wrong and what needs desperate correction. Certain things will take a longer time to mend than others but an immediate start is imperative if we are committed to keep our federal polity as an undivided whole. Imagine the May election being fought on a fresh ism, one that speaks the language of the people. Campaigning could start now. An alternative agenda such as unity in diversity  an oft-repeated clich but a truth  could well be the basis of a new Congress.        
	Intellectual discourse celebrates coalition politics. It claims that such conglomerates are here to stay. However, experience proves that political immaturity and greed have been the hallmark of many coalition governments, and corrupt partners have destroyed good governance. Careless governance, endless points of reference and zero accountability have made India vulnerable. We need a change.

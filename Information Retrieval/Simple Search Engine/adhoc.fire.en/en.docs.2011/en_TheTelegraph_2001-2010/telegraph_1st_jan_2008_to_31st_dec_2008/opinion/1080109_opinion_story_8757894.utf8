                                                                                                              PLAY THE GAME                                                    
	The problem lies in the way the game of cricket is perceived. Even though it is a physical sport, most of its ardent admirers and advocates see it as something bigger and much more significant than a mere game. It is often seen as a way of life that was almost effortlessly moved from the village greens of England to the huge grounds, say, in Eden Gardens in Calcutta or the Sydney Cricket Ground. Such is the power of this idea that cricket is more than a sport that not playing cricket has become synonymous with anything that is unsporting, underhand or infra dig. Cricket, this view holds, is more than a tad superior to other physical sports. The fact of the matter, unfortunately, is that this deification of the game of cricket is untrue. It may have been valid once upon a time, but today, in the way it is played, in the mass following that it commands and in the money that it rakes in, cricket is no different from any other physical sport like, say, soccer. Cricketers, cricket administrators and even spectators need to abandon the notions of the past and accept the realities that exist on the ground.        
	In a game like football, abusing opponents in the vilest possible language is considered par for the course. Sometimes abuse results in flashes of temper and even the occasional head butt. Otherwise, every one takes it in his stride, including the referee. In cricket, there was a time when no one sledged. When the Aussies began it in a very big way and others retaliated in kind, there was a hue and cry that the spirit of cricket was being violated. Where psychological pressure (always an accepted part of the game of cricket) crossed the boundary and became sledging and then abuse was never very clear. The entire controversy around Harbhajan Singh is located in this confusion. People who run the game of cricket should learn to accept that this kind of exchange of words is nothing uncommon in other physical sports, and there are no valid grounds to expect that matters in cricket will be very different.        
	The abiding myth about cricket is that it is a gentlemans game. No doubt some gentlemen played the game in the past, and some continue to do so. But the vast majority of players, especially today and since the end of World War II, sees cricket as a career. They thus play the game in a spirit of fierce competition with very little give and take. Such a game cannot be regulated by a mindset that harks back to some mythical golden age of cricket. The playing field is not a test of etiquette and charming manners. It is an arena to prove oneself or the worth of the team. The distinction between gentlemen and players was removed a long time ago. It is time to get rid of the attitude that says cricket is played by players who are governed by the code of gentlemen. Such an anomaly has no place in the world of modern sports.

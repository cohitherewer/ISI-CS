	Escape on number eleven            
	WOLF TOTEM (Hamish Hamilton 5.99) by Jiang Rong is based on the authors experience of living in the remote region of north-central Inner Mongolia in the late Sixties. Responding to Chairman Maos behest to urban citizens  to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside  Rong made the difficult journey to the vast, empty grasslands on the Ujimchin Banner in 1969. He spent a decade there, living and working among the nomadic shepherds, becoming privy to strange folklore and stranger ways of being. The most fascinating twist in this perceived idyll is the abiding presence of the wolves  at once the predator and the prey  lurking in the midst of rustic simplicity. These age-old dynamics between the beast and the men get radically subverted at the onset of the Cultural Revolution, as the threat of industrialization looms over the pristine wilderness. Beautifully translated by Howard Goldblatt, the novel won the first Man Asian literary prize last year.                        
	KHALLAAS: AN A TO Z GUIDE TO THE UNDERWORLD (Jaico, Rs 275) by J. Dey promises a glimpse into the world of dons, gangsters and cops. Although there is no narrative as such, a riveting story does emerge from the alphabetically arranged glossary on names and secret codes. Dey, a journalist with a long experience in the crime beat, gathers together words and phrases frequently used in the Mumbai underworld as well as in police parlance. Even as he elucidates the meaning of enigmatic terms like Artist (shooter) or Eleven Number Bus Route (escape from the spot on foot, eleven being the abbreviation for the two legs), Dey goes back to the etymology whenever possible  as in who first used it in what context. So the next time you hear words like Bakri (goat), Chidiya (bird) or Camera, or a phrase like Andar Sabun Mat Lagana on Mumbai streets, you might as well pause awhile.                         
	A HOUSE IN THE OLD STYLE (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Ananda Mukerji revolves around the endearing figure of the octogenarian Youngest-Uncle, who is a repository of enchanting stories. Living in a grand colonial mansion in Allahabad with his extended family going down to three generations, he spends his time recounting the fascinating days of his youth. His stories are interspersed with anecdotes from the rich archive of family lore, embellished with humorous tit-bits and told with impeccable comic timing. Everybody seems to have a great time, until Swapan, his corporate son from a late, second marriage arrives for the Durga Puja and decides to take his father away to his own family. Written with sparkling wit, this is an engaging experiment in narrative, fusing lost time and forgotten spaces with modern, urban anxieties.                                  
	BETWEEN ETERNITIES: Ideas on life and the cosmos (Penguin, Rs 250) by Ashvin Desai harks back to the Big Questions that underscore the conflict between faith and reason: is it more rational to accept the scientific explanations behind the origin of the universe? Was the universe willed by an omnipotent created? Between these two extreme positions, there are philosophical debates grappling with these ideas in more esoteric ways. Desai lucidly explains the various strands of thinking on these lines, which makes this a comprehensive laymans guide to a rather mind-boggling subject.                        
	Indo-anglian literature: Past to present (Books Way, Rs 295) edited by Ketaki Datta is a dismal pot-pourrie of essays spattered with obtuse jargon. The range of names  from Nissim Ezekiel to Debjani Chatterjee  and genres attest merely to the diversity, not the quality of the volume.

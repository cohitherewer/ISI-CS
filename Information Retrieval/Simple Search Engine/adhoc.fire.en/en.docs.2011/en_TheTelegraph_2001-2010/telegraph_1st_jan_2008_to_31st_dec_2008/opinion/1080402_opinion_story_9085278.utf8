                                                                                                                 STREET  LEGAL                      Inheritance of loss      A man who mortgaged his property died before he could pay back the loan to the bank. Contending that the term borrower under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act does not extend to include legal representatives, the dead mans heirs refused to pay back the remaining amount. Referring to  and drawing analogy from  the Contract Act and the Transfer of Property Act, the court held that the mortgage does not become invalid after the death of the borrower as his legal representatives then step into his shoes (Kamal Gupta vs Bank of India).            Family matters 
    A woman who got a lump sum as well as Rs 15 per month from her husband after winning a maintenance case, filed another one against her grown up son under the Code of Criminal Procedure. This entitles a person to maintenance from husband and children. The son contended that her entitlement to a second maintenance was suspect; also she had other grown up children so why should he be singled out for payment? The Bombay High Court held that the maintenance provided by the husband was too little and while she could not file a second maintenance suit against him, she could file one against her son. Although he was not her only son, it was up to her to decide whom she wanted to claim maintenance from. The court ruled in the womans favour but, considering the hardships faced by the son, reduced the maintenance amount from Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,000 (Rafiuddin vs Smt. Saleha Khatoon).            Far and away 
    A woman filed a case for child custody in Himachal Pradesh where she was living with her parents. A preliminary objection was raised about the courts territorial jurisdiction over the child who lived in Delhi. The Himachal Pradesh High Court pointed out that the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, clearly lays down that only such court shall entertain a petition for custody where the child normally lives. While the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act stipulates that the custody of a child below five years shall ordinarily be with the mother, the provisions of natural guardianship cannot be thrust upon the 1890 Act (Himanshu Mahajan vs Rashu Mahajan and others).

	Not divorce  
	 A husband opposed his wifes claim for maintenance, arguing that the decree for judicial separation, which he had sought and obtained, was granted only when various provisions of the Divorce Act and Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were met. The Kerala High Court, however, pointed out that a judicial separation was not the equivalent of a decree of divorce. To resist a claim under Section 125, the husband had to prove that it was the wife who had refused to live with him while he was willing to live with her. The court held that a decree for judicial separation is of no value while granting maintenance under Section 125, which deals with the seeking of maintenance from husband, major children etc. (Mary vs Varghese)    
	Father dear        
	 A grandfather pleaded for the custody of his grandchild when the mother committed suicide. The Andhra Pradesh High Court held that in the case of the custody of a minor child, the natural father was legally on firmer ground than the grandfather. While the welfare of the child was paramount, the grandfather had to satisfy the court that the father was unfit for taking custody of the child. In this case, since the father was financially sound and his second wife had undergone tubectomy so that she could devote all her attention to the child, denying them custody was unjustifiable, the court ruled.

	 A pregnant woman, sitting at the back of a motorcycle, died in a road accident. The husband claimed compensation for the loss of two lives. Upholding the husbands contention, the Kerala High Court held that the death of a foetus was worthy of compensation. The court, however, also added that in this case there was contributory negligence on the husbands part as well. After all, he had taken his wife as a pillion rider, fully aware of the fact that it was risky for a pregnant woman to do so. The husband was granted a nominal additional compensation of Rs 10,000 for the loss of the foetus.

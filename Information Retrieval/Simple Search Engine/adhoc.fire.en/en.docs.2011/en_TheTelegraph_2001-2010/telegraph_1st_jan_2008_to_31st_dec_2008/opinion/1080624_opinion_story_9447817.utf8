	Water everywhere                  
	Sir  The Telegraphs photographers should visit Bangur Avenue and take some pictures of the woeful state of the roads and drainage in the area during the monsoon. The only way to mobilize the municipal corporation into action would be to embarrass it by splashing in the media the details of the ghastly waterlogging here. Around this time last year, while the rest of Calcutta was going about its business, residents of Bangur Avenue were almost under water. Access to the basic amenities was blocked, there was the constant fear of electrocution through open cables coming in contact with the water, and rickshaw-pullers were charging as much as Rs 150 to ferry commuters from one end of Bangur Avenue to the other. Now that the monsoons have set in again, it is time the authorities woke up and did some work to improve drainage in the area.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Yogesh Verma, Calcutta

                
	Sir  With the coming of the monsoons, Calcutta has gone back to showing its weary old face of watery doom. The menace of water-logging is upon us again and the mayor has predictably hit the headlines, seeming as unapologetic as ever. This despite the fact that the Rs 1,200 crore municipal project to prepare the city to face the monsoons has fallen flat on its face (Down the drain, June 18). The mayor proudly claimed that the city will not be as badly hit by waterlogging this year as it had been in the previous years. Maybe he thinks that giving Calcuttans the feeling that they are in a water park or a lakeside resort within the comforts of their home or office is some sort of an achievement. The city is quick to show outrage when buses run recklessly or policemen are inefficient. Are we going to silently bear the dereliction of duty by the municipal authorities?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arijit Mukherjee, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The havoc created by the monsoon flash floods in West Bengal, Orissa and Assam has thrown normal life out of gear. Roads and rail networks have been damaged, and there are regular reports of people being stranded at railway stations in these states (Buses to bring 5,000 from Puri, June 20). Come monsoon every year, incidents of flooding are common in the areas lining the Bay of Bengal. The government should evolve a plan to tackle such situations, including organizing aid and help from the military. Further, alternative routes should be chalked out for rail communications to be resumed while the flood-hit train tracks are repaired swiftly. It is unfortunate that the Visakhapatnam railway station, a main centre of the East Coast Railways, was a place of utter confusion for three days owing to the cancellation of many important express trains after a derailment took place (Derailment hits train services, June 13). The station manager, it is heard, could not provide information about the delay in services or the status of the injured passengers on the derailed train. Operations at our railway stations need to be managed by private call centres who would be far more efficient in providing information in situations of emergency.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The authorities of the Calcutta municipal corporation choose the summer and the brief winter to float the idea of beautiful dry roads in the following monsoon. The money is no problem. The Asian Development Bank is ready to part with crores of rupees. Engineers normally recommend underground work between November and May. But this schedule is never followed. The contractors usually employ a few labourers to give the misleading impression that work is on in full swing. They dig a few trenches here and there during the most favourable working period and pipe-laying begins only from the last week of May, without adequate protection against caving. By this time the rains have started. This results in adjoining buildings and other structures being damaged. Waterlogging is inevitable. Work stops because local residents complain about the menace of the dug-up roads. Then negotiations begin for more loans because the money allotted is not enough. The next step is arbitration, signalling the death of the project. In Behala, as reported, Rs 500 crore have already been buried in the trenches. Now it has come to light that so far, the execution was done on the basis of a preliminary project report without referring to the final, detailed design. The preliminary design is wrong and will not give any relief. The politicians want to oblige the maximum number of people in minimum time, while making some fast bucks for themselves. Projects, as in Behala, progress on a piecemeal basis and create greater inconvenience. In this scene of gloom, the only consolation is the regular visits by journalists who envy us for being able to stay in our own Venice through the rains.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Flooded paras and false assurances have become the identifying features of Calcutta monsoons. No development project undertaken by the state government is without its share of stupendous flaws. Flyovers develop cracks soon after they are inaugurated, a project to relieve the city of the menace of flooding does exactly the opposite, roads are dug up and relaid but potholes and craters remain the bane of travellers. One wonders what kind of civil engineers are in charge of these projects, and whether the governments knack of choosing the most incompetent of the lot has something to do with corruption and nepotism among the people in power.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anindita Bagchi, Calcutta

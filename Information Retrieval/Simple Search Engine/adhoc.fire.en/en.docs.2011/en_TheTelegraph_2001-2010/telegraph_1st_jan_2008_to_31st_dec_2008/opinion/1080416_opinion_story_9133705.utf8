	Unkindest cut                  
	Sir  It was horrifying to see elderly persons, who had once been responsible for the security of this nation, being beaten up mercilessly by the police (Siliguri hit by rally riot, April 10). Most of All-Gorkha Ex-Servicemens Morcha members participating in the peaceful procession were over sixty years of age. Some rowdy youths may slipped into the rally and created trouble. But this was not the only reason why the police lathi-charged so ruthlessly. It is apparent that their main objective was to discourage such rallies in the future. Having served in the army, the former servicemen cannot be assumed to be an indisciplined lot who would resort to needless violence. The riot could have been avoided had the administration been prudent enough to allow the marchers to proceed till Air View More, where the procession was headed before it was broken up.           
	Every citizen of this democracy has the right to stage a protest, provided it causes no disruption. The Gorkha ex-servicemen were doing just that. The rallies organized by Bengals ruling party are hardly ever peaceful. Do they invite such police high-handedness? Why should a non-violent protest in Siliguri be treated differently? It would be unwise of the government of West Bengal to try suppressing the democratic movement of the Gorkhas through State-sponsored violence. The Gorkhas are a patient lot but the state government should realize that unfortunate incidents like the recent one will surely test their tolerance.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Abel Rai, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  We are old residents of Darjeeling and would like to express our disgust at the atrocities perpetrated on members of the All-Gorkha Ex-Servicemens Morcha. The attack on the marchers was vicious and unwarranted. It was cowardly of the police to assail a group of elderly and unarmed ex-servicemen who have every right to voice their demands. Brave soldiers who had once risked their lives to protect the country have been dishonoured. Is this how India rewards its soldiers?          
	The people of the hills are essentially simple and do not like to see the serenity of their homeland disturbed by unruly people. If some youths threw stones at the police, they were clearly in the wrong. But the police acted rashly by unleashing more violence in return. Instead of resorting to hostility at the slightest provocation, the administration should try to understand the Gorkhas sentiments. They have always longed for a separate state and their right to self-determination must be respected.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Manuel and Clara Coutinho, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  The fault for the bloodshed in Siliguri on April 9 lies not just with the police, who were, after all, only following orders. The hooligans in the rally are equally to blame since they caused the confusion by throwing stones at the police. However, the police should have been able to distinguish between the elderly ex-servicemen and the ruffians.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Nritya Rai, Siliguri

                
	Sir  The unfortunate episode on April 9 proves yet again that Gorkhas are not safe in their own land. Their services to the country are always ignored and they continue to remain foreigners. Since the existing law and order machinery cannot guarantee their safety, they are justified in asking for a system of governance they can call their own.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chandramani, Cecil and Solim Yonzone, Kalimpong 

                
	Sir  It is time the governments of both the state and the Centre put their foot down on secessionist demands or the call for new state formations. If every other community keeps demanding a separate state then West Bengal might soon be left only with Calcutta. It is true that there is a huge number of Gorkhas in the army and the paramilitary forces. But it is not that only Gorkhas have sacrificed their lives without getting anything in return. Neither are Gorkhas the only community fighting for the country. Rajputs too have served the army. All soldiers need to be revered but if their wants are out of proportion, the line has to be drawn between respect and indulgence.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Jeet Sarkar, Siliguri 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  In Imagine a better India, (April 11), Malvika Singh says that Sheila Dikshit, Renuka Chowdhury and Ambika Soni have been victims of bad press. Is she trying to make saints of these politicians? What have they done for the future of the country except pass laws that have failed to achieve anything substantial for those they were supposed to benefit? Violence against women in the home continues unabated despite the law against domestic violence. Chowdhury sits smugly in her chair while children keep working in the unorganized sector. Under Sheila Dikshit, Delhi has remained the most unsafe city for women in India. As for Soni, she has hardly ever thought of anyones interest other than that of her own.           
	Yours faithfully,       
P.B. Saha, Arlington, Texas

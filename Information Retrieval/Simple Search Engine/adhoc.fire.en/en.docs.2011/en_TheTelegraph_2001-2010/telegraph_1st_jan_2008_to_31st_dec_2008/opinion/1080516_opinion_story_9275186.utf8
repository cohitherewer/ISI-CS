	The charge of rape engenders around it a fog of confusion. In Yamunanagar near Chandigarh, a 25-year-old nurse was detained for a day in a police station for tearing off parts of her kurta in protest against the fact that the persons who had allegedly raped her the week before had not been arrested. She not only tried to strip herself publicly and invite policemen to do what the rapists had done, but she also tried to smash herself with a brick and touch a live wire. She was put into custody for attempting suicide, although she got bail later. Against this pitiful display of hurt, the police claimed that the supposed victim was unwilling to show them the place of the crime, her medical tests were inconclusive, and that she had brought along a television crew so that the drama she put up could be recorded.         
	This looks like a competition in blackmailing. In a fair world, either side could be in the right. But it is not a fair world, and it is easier to believe that if the nurse was mad enough to strip or threaten suicide, she could have brought the TV crew along to put pressure on the police. The polices claims are less easy to take seriously. And that is where the real danger lies. The police have acquired a reputation for gender-insensitivity and unwillingness to pursue cases of rape. The reasons for this are rooted deep in sexual, social and cultural attitudes. Also, the conviction rate for rape in India is abysmal while the crime itself is increasing. In a situation such as the one the nurse created, the police would at once be branded untrustworthy in the popular mind. Their pigheadedness about charges of rape not only intensifies the suffering of the victim, who may stop at nothing to make her grief and fury known, but it also gives space to those who want to frame innocent people. Once the law is ignored, blackmail and aggression can work both ways. The result of it all is to generate a confusion around every charge of rape that neatly sets the rapist free.

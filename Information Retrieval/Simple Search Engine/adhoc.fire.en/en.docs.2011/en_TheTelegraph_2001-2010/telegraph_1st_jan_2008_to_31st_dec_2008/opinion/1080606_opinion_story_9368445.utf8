                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AFTER THE NOISE                          - Tin cans or mangoes?                                              
	The Shape of the beast: Conversations with Arundhati Roy Viking, Rs 499        
	Arundhati Roy wants to cry out, like Bunty in Bunty aur Babli, ldquo;Mujhe aisi izzat aur sharafat ki zindagi se bachao (Save me from this life of honour and respectability).         
	Soon after Roy joined the Narmada Bachao Andolan, wrote The Greater Common Good (a scathing criticism of big dams), and was imprisoned for speaking out against the Supreme Courts ruling on the Sardar Sarovar Dam in 2002, the social welfare industry started wooing her with righteous zeal. A woman called her up and said, Oh, darling, that essay on the Narmada was absolutely wonderful. I wonder if you could do one for me on child abuse? For or against? was her instant riposte. This was, for Roy, a telling instance of how, in India, people with some credentials (who need not always be celebrities) get inevitably co-opted (a keyword for Roy) into variously interested schemes. Ever since The God of Small Things appeared in 1997, earned a 50,000 publishers advance and won the Booker prize, Roy has been acutely conscious of, and anxious about, the public image that has been conferred on her by the media. The Shape of the Beast  a polemical, inspiring, even slightly mad collection of interviews from the last ten years  is haunted by this spectre of conscious self-vindication.        
	Speaking to N. Ram in 2001, Roy had pointed out, with her acerbic wit, that the celebrity part just trails along behind me making a heck of a noise  like a tin can attached to a cats tail. It is revealing that seven years on, with much less of this noise around, Roy is still struggling to stay above the debris of half-truths piled upon her. The co-opters are all offended by her rebuff, so an angry little cottage industry has sprung up around her. She is simultaneously accused of being anti-Left, anti-Right, extreme Left, extreme Right, extreme Green, RSS and even the Swadeshi Jagran Manch. Page Three would love to make her one of its own, but Roy remains an aberration on its pristine dazzle  a blighted pimple on a scrupulously dolled-up face. Discouraged, the tin cans jangle no more, but she returns like Nemesis, with her own dissonant rattle  speaking out against the neoliberal state, the flip side of globalization, Americas war on terror, industrialization and mindless land acquisition. Sceptics dismiss The God of Small Things with a mixture of squeamishness and impatience, her politics as foolishly sentimental, and Roy herself as a one-novel wonder. Many feel that her real calling is fiction, not public welfare. The rest listen with their ears to the ground to pick up the music underlying the cans.        
	Arundhati Roy is an anachronism in present-day India, a phenomenon yet to be reckoned with. She is embedded in the present, yet her style and rhetoric hark back to another time. Her participation in the NBA is not just an outcome of the ethical outrage she shares with the other leaders of the movement. Rather, it is at once a dispassionate engagement with the first principles of social contract  the right to information (predating the actual legislation), the way in which political decision-making excludes the public, and the Big Questions (nuclear deals, wars and industrialization) made obscure by a formidably inaccessible jargon. There is a universality in the NBA that surpasses social or political reasons: it involves the vital issues  rivers, estuaries, earth, mountains, deserts, crops, forests, fish. Her involvement does not end with lending solidarity to the struggle, but becomes an intellectual challenge, where every argument is corroborated by intense research and extensive travels in the Narmada valley.        
	Her mission, as a creative writer, is to demystify this puzzle, to create links, to join the dots, to tell politics like a story, to communicate it, to make it real. She does this not with any specific design in mind  this leaves her neither here nor there, but somewhere on her own, alone but not aloof. The so-called development sector, as she says, feeds on concern rather than on empathy: Empathy would lead to passion, to incandescent anger, to wild indignation, to action. Concern, on the other hand, leads to articles, books, PhDs, fellowships. The consequences of such a remark would be disastrous for many, but Roy remains unapologetic about her absolute conviction in why she does what she does. She has nothing to lose: My essays are not about me or my brilliance or my originality or lack of it. Theyre not meant to be a career move  theyre about re-stating the issue, theyre about saying the same things over and over again...        
	Repetitiveness is an inevitable outcome, and even one of the redeeming features, of such a collection. Still, the conversations with David Barsamian are a bit choppy  the questions are prefaced with lengthy explanatory comments (perhaps for the benefit of a non-Indian readership), the transition from one topic to the next is abrupt, and the discussion somewhat incoherent. N. Ram probes Roy, a little too persistently, to answer Ramachandra Guhas criticisms of her. Shoma Chaudhurys unobtrusiveness brings the best out of her: the concluding interview, commemorating the first decade of her Booker win, is by far the most rewarding in this selection.        
	It is important to approach these semi-formal conversations (as Roy calls them) in the right spirit. They were a flexible way of thinking aloud... without having to nail them down with an artificially structured cohesion and fit them into an unassailable grand thesis. Roy considers The Shape of the Beast somewhere between the spoken and the written word. This in-betweenness, a characteristic stance in Roy as well, brings to mind another interview she had given to Madeleine Bunting in 2001. Once the tin cans drop off, Roy had said to Bunting, she would write some worstsellers and eat mangoes in the moonlight. That time is near. The noise has subsided, and the new novel is being written. It only remains to be seen if she will end up quietly eating mangoes or setting off that deafening clatter yet again.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

	In policymaking, like in politics, timing is important. Last week, the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, chose an odd time to suggest that banks should cut interest rates, when the need for such a rate cut  or a demand for one  does not exist. The idea has been mooted before, particularly since the United States of Americas Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been cutting their policy rates in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. On the face of it, economic conditions do not warrant an interest rate cut. Credit growth has not declined by much, and still runs at about 23 per cent; there appears to be no shortage of liquidity  in fact there is an abundance of it  and there are no signs that demands for credit are not being met. The larger concern appears to be the impact of rate cuts overseas, particularly in the US ; so far, the European Central Bank has resisted calls for a rate reduction. 
    
	But that concern may be misplaced. First, the domestic economy has not suffered from any slowdown in growth. Output growth, using both the index of industrial production and tax collections as proxies, seems to be going strong. Economic research suggests that it is hard to disentangle whether changes in interest rates drive output growth or vice versa. Poor fundamentals could drive up borrowing costs and slow output growth, and push interest rates up, but that is not the case in the Indian context. Second, inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index has been relatively low and stable; true, the lower inflation index leaves out the impact of changes in global fuel prices, which have been absorbed by the oil companies; if Mr Chidambaram raises fuel prices, the impact is likely to be almost immediate in terms of a higher inflation rate. The risks of taking such a step so close to national elections are sure to give the minister pause. But add rising food prices to the equation, and there seems to be more inflation out there than is captured in the WPI. Third, low US rates have generated large capital inflows, which is the crux of the problem facing the Reserve Bank of India  in managing liquidity to keep prices down, and in trying to ensure that exchange rate appreciation as a result of lower foreign interest rates does not harm export industries too much. In fact, changes in world interest rates flow through monetary policy on the exchange rate, not interest rates. As the proverb says, albeit in incorrect grammar, If it aint broke, dont fix it.

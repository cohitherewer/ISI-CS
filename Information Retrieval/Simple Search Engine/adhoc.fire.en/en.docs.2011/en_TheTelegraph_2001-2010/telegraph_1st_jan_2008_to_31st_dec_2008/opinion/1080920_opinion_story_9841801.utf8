	Prabir Sen has of late been participating in exhibitions where his paintings have been displayed. But he has, for years, been known as an illustrator, and for good reason too. His paintings seemed to be enlarged versions of his illustrations, although these were more intricately worked. Recently, he became quite well known as a publisher who brought out a few large-format books printed in letterpress.         
	Sens exhibition at Weavers Studio, titled, Different Face, was exactly that  it was an entire series of faces drawn with broad lines in luminous black. These lines were his main tool for improvization. Sen had let himself go and many of the faces were phantasmagoric and had little to do with reality as we know it. Figments of his imagination they may have been, but he drew every line with great precision, and that needed a lot of technical skill. These faces were like quick-change artists who switch roles from moment to moment. They changed their mood and look almost instantaneously  sometimes sad, sometimes lugubrious, sometimes inscrutable. At times they look as if they were inspired by patas, which is not unlikely. In one case, a face resembled the goggle-eyed TV star, Homer J. Simpson. That may have been by pure accident but the resemblance was unmistakable. One thing they all had in common was the element of surprise. Sen never failed us.

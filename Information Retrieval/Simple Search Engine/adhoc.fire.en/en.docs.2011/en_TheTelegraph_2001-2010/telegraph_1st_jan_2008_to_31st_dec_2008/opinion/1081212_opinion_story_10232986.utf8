	Perform or perish                  
	Sir  In leading the Congress to its third successive victory in this years assembly elections in Delhi, Sheila Dikshit has achieved a remarkable feat (Third time lucky, Dec 9). Dikshit does not enjoy the support of a particular caste or community, she even had to face scheming factionalists in her own party. Yet, she has thrived because of her clean image and common sense in dealing with the problems of a modern metropolis. She may not have succeeded in ensuring perfect law and order in Delhi, but that is primarily because the Union home ministry, which directly controls the Delhi police, has been found wanting. The Congress should consider Dikshit for a larger role in national politics, an honour she justly deserves.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshobhya, Mysore

                
	Sir  Sheila Dikshits hat-trick as the chief minister of Delhi bespeaks her exceptional gift as a politician. Gimmicks could not have fooled the electorate for years, especially in a city like Delhi, where performance alone fetches votes. Her successive victories clearly indicate that Dikshit has delivered the goods throughout her three terms. One wishes there were chief ministers like her in the other states as well.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.V.S.N. Murthy, Secunderabad 

                
	Sir  The result of the assembly polls in five states has proved that the people of India are no longer just a mob but rather a mature group of citizens, keen to preserve the democratic ethos of their country. There are lessons for the opposition parties in these trends. While the people have transformed themselves into an organized unit, some political parties are yet to come to terms with this change. That faction-fights within the Bharatiya Janata Party is costing the party dearly was amply evident from the results of the Delhi polls. The Opposition also needs to realize that one of the evils of these times is that every activity, including politics, is perceived as competition. Competition may be good for business but competitive politics has only helped denigrate the social value of politics. Political parties tend to make a big deal out of non-issues and often succeed in igniting the fury of the common man. The BJP needs to come out with issues concerned with the public good. Indians have always voted in favour of charismatic leaders, who can connect with the masses. The Opposition has faltered on this count.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajeev Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  As the editorial, Vote for work (Dec 9), points out, in four states in the assembly polls, the fight was clearly between the Congress and the BJP. The voters made good of the choice before them, unlike the people of West Bengal who have been re-electing the same government since 1977. However, it would be premature to conclude, as the editorial does, that voters preferred governments with a record of performance. Performance, in concrete terms, should translate into better living conditions for the common man. Development has little meaning if it is not inclusive and has a direct bearing on reducing poverty. So Sheila Dikshits win should be taken with a pinch of salt. Delhis development is, at present, centred around the planning for the 2010 Commonwealth games, while ordinary citizens suffer from power cuts, irregular water supply, bad roads, traffic congestion, lack of safety on the roads and for women. The results should neither pamper the Congress nor demoralize the BJP. The mature voter punished the arrogant leaders and warned the Opposition in Rajasthan, gave the Congress a wake-up call in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and did not accept the alternative in Delhi.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attack, the assembly election results in five states should come as an eye-opener to the BJP. Confidently assuming that the Indian voter is in an anti-incumbency mood can be costly. The BJP also needs to act like a responsible, national party. Recently, the offer of a joint Indo-Pakistan investigation into the Mumbai attacks was sneered at by the BJP without considering the possible benefits.           
	The other interesting, though highly improbable, scenario that has been suggested by the assembly polls is the formation of a coalition government at the Centre by the Congress and the BJP. Both parties need each other now more than ever. Indians want a strong government that can tackle terror as well as the declining economy. In the long term, having a two- or a three-party political system will lead to a more stable India, compared to the fractured mandate spread over dozens of small state-level parties. These minuscule parties, with one or a few seats in the assembly or Parliament, give rise to corruption. If a national government comprising the Congress and the BJP can remain in power even for one term, then the small parties will fade away, merging with one or the other national party, leading to a better political system.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

                
	Sir  Anti-incumbency is grossly overplayed by political parties while strategizing their election campaigns. If the incumbent government performs well and is able to connect with the people in a meaningful way, then anti-incumbency can be bucked: as evident in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Good governance and good politics make an unbeatable combination. Maybe psephologists in India will now abandon their favourite explanation, anti-incumbency, and replace it with the performance factor.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  I would not say that the BJP has suffered in the state assembly polls. The party won in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It also increased its vote share and number of seats in Delhi. Its defeat in Rajasthan is the result of its value-based politics. The BJP refused to bow to the Gujjar demand for OBC status. The Congress pandered to this vote bank and walked away with the trophy. This was highly unethical and may lead to other caste groups asking for such favours in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Danendra Jain, Agartala

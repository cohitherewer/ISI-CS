                 FIFTH COLUMN - Abhijit Bhattacharyya
               
	If a navy operates in the high seas, it is termed a call of duty, but if it were to host the naval chiefs of 31 nations, it would be called an exercise in diplomacy. The Indian navy is reportedly keen on a dual role: establish its influence among littoral states and promote security in the Indian Ocean region. With this in mind, it is reportedly organizing a naval symposium for Indian Ocean-rim countries next month.
    
	Significantly, another high profile exhibition, titled Def Expo, is also slated to be held around the same time. It thus appears that while the navy resorts to discussion on defence issues during the day, it falls back on diplomacy and dinner by night.
    
	Who are the participants and what are their current positions in the Indian Ocean? Are they in a position to make useful contributions during the proposed meet? Of the participants, only a few have the capacity of limited, but sustained, ocean-going capability  South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia can be cited as examples. However, the navies of Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Yemen, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Mauritius have virtually little to offer in terms of conventional naval combat.
    
	Perhaps what prompted the naval pundits to invite these nations as well was their desire to pre-empt terror strikes by using the naval facilities, beaches, ports and wharfs of these littoral states. Significantly, two important littoral states Pakistan and Iran  may give the meet a miss. Of course, the show will go on even then, but this would mean that the chances of developing an effective deterrent against an unexpected but real time threat emanating from areas such as the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman or the Strait of Hormuz remain slim. In this context, one may cite the fact that in the high seas, small, agile vessels manned by suicide squads often succeed in exposing the weaknesses of bigger, powerful ships.

	The naval strength of some of the participants remain doubtful, even during peace. Amongst the African nations, barring South Africa, none of the other countries possess submarines, frigates or even corvettes. In fact, they have virtually no sea-going vessels to deal with a threat from the seas. The capability of some of the Asian navies, such as Yemen, the Maldives and Cambodia, is equally circumspect. Interestingly, tiny Bahrain, which houses the headquarters of the US navys fifth fleet, is a strong naval power. 
    
	The Indian navy appears to be a Goliath among the participants. Only the French navy, which will be present on the occasion, appears stronger. The French connection is of considerable importance to the proposed naval seminar, considering Nicolas Sarkozy has signed a deal with the UAE to set up a military base there. Nevertheless, the possible absence of Pakistan and Iran is likely to take some shine off the show. Tehran and Islamabad would have offered rare first-hand insights into the problems that sailors face on this perilous oil route.
    
	Judging by the names and numbers of participants, New Delhis aim is quite clear. India seems to have taken the cue from the recent utterances of the US navys chief of naval operations, who propounded the formation of a 1,000-ship navy comprising like-minded foreign flotillas to fight the war on terror. There is a difference between the approaches of New Delhi and Washington though. Whereas the US navy is concentrating on the worlds oceans, New Delhi is focussing on the Indian ocean only. India thus cannot be compared to the US, which is the lord of the seven seas.

	Fireflies in the Mist By Qurratulain Hyder, Women Unlimited, Rs 350        
	When the novel opens on a languorous summer evening in June 1890, the sun has just set over the Padma or Boorhi Ganga at Narayan Gunj near Dacca. Inspired by the beauty of the evening, the noveau-riche landholder, Romesh Chandra Sarkar, breaks into an extempore ode to Goddess Laxmi, but is rudely interrupted by the discovery of the Golden Album, featuring photographs of Bootiful...Mem-log and Saheb-log. It is a decisive moment, since the discovery would chart the course of his successors lives, making and unmaking them. When the novel closes some eighty years later, Romesh Baboos granddaughter, Deepali Sarkar, is leaving Bangladesh and India one last time for faraway Trinidad, where she has her husband and her home. She feels weary and tired like Old Ganga at Narayan Gunj, but not dead. As she watches the sun rising over the South China Sea from the window of the Boeing, she tries humming the Raga Bhairav to greet the new day. But Deepali cannot concentrate because secret melodies inside the head distract her. The music of the turbulent times she has left behind and the tumultuous lands she has relinquished refuses to be forgotten, much like the lilting strains of the Padma boatmans song.         
	The Padma flows through the novel like memory, carrying the ashes and bones of time past, merging it with time present. In contrast to the circularity of memory, there is the linear progress of historical time, marked by the rising and setting of the sun. History, remarked Qurratulain Hyder, is another name for humanitys inability to learn its lesson. Since man refuses to be taught, he keeps dreaming of a freedom that is falsified as soon as it is realized. No sooner are the British driven away from India than the country starts fighting with Pakistan, which, in turn, fights with its eastern province until Bangladesh is born. But that is not the end  wars continue, families perish, lives are ended suddenly. What survives the turmoil is the terrible beauty of moments of love  evanescent, flickering, like fireflies in the mist.         
	In the decentred universe of this novel covering over eight decades, Deepali provides a tenuous point of reference, partly because she outlives her own generation and the next much of which is cut short by wars. She is framed as the young woman, singing in the stillness of a winter night in the turret of the colonial mansion purchased by her grandfather and ruined by his extravagance. There is Deepali having a tryst with her lover, Rehan Ahmed, in the overgrown garden grotto of Chandrakunj or Lunas grove, and then being lectured by him about a classless society in the rainforests of the Sunderbans. After India gains its dubious freedom, Deepali migrates from Dacca to Calcutta to find Comrade Rehan transformed into a successful politician. As the world gets curiouser and curiouser, Deepali learns to survive history by cultivating her habit of turning everything upside down, inside out and then reduc[ing] it to the level of the ludicrous.         
	Deepalis consciousness gives coherence to the otherwise sprawling narrative. She is granted an insight that the others are denied because, unlike them, she can stand apart from the events in which she participates. Rehan, the great exponent of revolutionary change, remains unchanged in his pomposity and self-absorption. Thus his adoption of poverty and vagrancy in sympathy with the suffering masses of Golden Bengal becomes only a step in his transition from a displaced aristocrat to a 555-smoking man of the world in an expensive suit. Although the other characters in the drama are equally blundering in their ignorance, a tentative line is drawn between the male and the female figures.         
	Being born in a position of un-freedom, women like Deepali and her friends, Jehan Ara and Rosie, are early made aware of the limits of freedom while their male counterparts cling to delusions of liberty till the end. Because the women have no grandiose dreams, either about their own future or that of independent India, they are able to achieve their modest freedoms without deceiving themselves too much. Rosie Banerjee joins the revolutionary nationalists, but her rebellion is directed more against the servile middle-class piety of her converted-Christian father than against the British rulers. If Rosie emerges a winner from her revolt, it is not because the British are frightened by the bomb she hurls but because she acquires a rich husband in the process. Jehan Ara, on the other hand, staidly refuses to challenge what she thinks is her destiny. The daughter of Nawab Qamrul Zaman, Jehan Ara, Decoration of the World, sit[s] and brood[s] and knit[s] booties. She loses Rehan, to whom she was betrothed, when he defies her father to become a communist. Rehan invites her to join him in his struggle one fateful stormy night, but this Madeline prefers to stay back in the safety of the castle. Jehan Ara pines for Rehan but willingly marries the corpulent, pan-chewing nawab chosen for her. After all, All Indian girls were taught to bear their anguish in silence, cry on the quiet, and face the world with a smile.         
	Any commentary on Qurratulain Hyders novel would inevitably sound banal because the work, by its very richness, resists analysis. Here time does not pass but accumulates, events meet their logical conclusion in later episodes, and each character is mirrored in the other. The struggle for Indias independence is repeated in Bangladeshs war of liberation, Deepalis revolutionary zeal lives on in Rehans niece, Nasira, while her artistic self unites her with Yasmin Bano, the eccentric and intelligent Muslim girl whose defiance destroys her. Yasmin exists as a possibility in the novel  she is what Deepali, or even Jehan Ara, could have been if they had chosen differently. Only Yasmin, among all the women, has the courage to test the limits of her freedom. In the final part of the novel, the narrative is handed over to Yasmins voice as recorded in her good/bad luck diary. It is as if her cry breaks out from the restrictions of the novelistic form because her anguish is too intense to be contained within it.         
	Nietzsches myth of eternal return signifies that history, with it never-ending struggle for an elusive peace, is absurd. Deepali thinks about Yasmins death and her own imminent mortality when she returns to Dacca after decades in exile. The sight of the motherland inspires an uncharacteristic poetic outburst  Hail to thee, O Ganga, O Padma, O Eternal India. Hail, hail. But then, She smiled irreverently to herself, again.

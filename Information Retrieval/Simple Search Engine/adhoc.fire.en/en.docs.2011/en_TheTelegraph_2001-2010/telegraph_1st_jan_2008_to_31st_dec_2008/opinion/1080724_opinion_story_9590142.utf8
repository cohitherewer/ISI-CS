	Community policing is now practised in different countries. However, there is considerable confusion regarding its meaning. Many police officers feel that any kind of cooperation received by the police from the public in the course of their duties comes under the rubric of community policing. In reality though, community policing refers to arrangements in which the police and the community work together to improve the quality of life. Here, the police function not only as enforcers but also as facilitators of new community-based and police supervised initiatives.         
	Policing has evolved through different stages. At first, the State created and monopolized the force. Then came the stage when citizens started participating in and defining police work. More recently, residential groups have started articulating their needs and assisting the police in their responsibilities. Community policing represents this third evolutionary phase.         
	In the United States of America and western Europe, the idea of community policing gained ground in the Seventies and the Eighties as the police realized the need to identify and resolve security problems with the help and consent of the community.         
	But the most successful implementation of community policing has been done in Japan and Singapore. In Japan, it centres around Koban where officers patrol neighbourhoods on foot or bicycle, respond to citizens distress calls, help lost children and also function as neighbourhood councillors. Japan is considered one of the most peaceful countries in the world, and community policing has played an important role in making the country a safe place to stay.        
	Singapore followed the British model of policing till 1983. But then it decided to adopt the Japanese model and changes were effected within a short period of time without any increase in the police budget  a remarkable achievement.        
	Community policing was practised in ancient India too, where crime control was entrusted upon the village community. The Police Act of 1861, which instituted the colonial police system in India, also contains provisions on citizens duties regarding the maintenance of law and order. Post independence, community policing experiments have been tried with some measure of success by formal legislation and individual initiatives of police officers.         
	Community policing faces numerous problems though. There is resistance from high-ranking police officers who are critical of community policing because it transfers power over strategies from people in the headquarters to people in operational posts. Some people believe that community policing interferes with the standard of crime fighting and prefer traditional methods. Problems also arise because community policing aims at reforming such time-tested strategies as the use of force to control crime.        
	Significantly, community policing can often deliver mixed results. In some cases, the crime rate increased following the introduction of community policing, although it diminished the peoples fear of the police.         
	Evaluation of community programmes is needed to assess problems and constraints. But it is seldom done. For instance, at a seminar in Bangalore, the city police chief mentioned several community policing initiatives. However, it was evident that the programmes had not been evaluated which made modifications difficult to implement.

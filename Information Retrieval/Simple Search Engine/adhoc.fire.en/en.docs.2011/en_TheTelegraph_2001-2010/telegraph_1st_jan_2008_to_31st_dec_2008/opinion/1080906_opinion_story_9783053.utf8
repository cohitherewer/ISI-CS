	Mona Lisa smile  
	Sir  The photograph of Mamata Banerjee on page 7 of The Telegraph (Aug 26) spoke a thousand words. Her hand on her waist in the picture denoted her combative and defiant mood. The enigmatic smile ( la Mona Lisa) expressed the relish with which she enjoys the predicament she has put Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in. The photograph deftly captured Banerjees jubilation at having achieved a favourable position for herself. The photographer, Pradip Sanyal, deserves to be congratulated. I have never come across such an eloquent portrayal of her face before.           
	Yours faithfully,         Satyabrata Gupta, Calcutta 
        
	Minor triumph  
	Sir  The Delhi court, which on September 2 convicted businessman Sanjeev Nanda in the infamous BMW hit-and-run case, has said that he deserved strict punishment because of drunken driving (High and mighty Nanda is guilty, Sept 3). Even though the verdict comes a bit late in the day, it is more than welcome. The judgment has raised great hopes that justice will finally be done in the cases pertaining to the Uphar Cinema and the Bhopal gas tragedies. The Indian judicial system which used to resemble a snail more than any other animal not so long ago, has quickened its step a bit. There is no doubt that a faster pace of things will benefit millions of litigants around the country.  
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Justice has finally caught up with the Nandas after a span of nine years. The agony and trauma of the victims and their families would be considerably lessened by this pathbreaking judgment. All credit must go to the criminal justice system of the country, to the public for never giving up the demand for justice, and finally, to the media, which exposed the nexus between the prosecution and the defence through an effective sting operation. The Nanda family should feel ashamed of itself for sheltering the guilty individual knowing full well the nature of his crime. What is worse, the family even tried to mislead the course of the judicial process. Hopefully, the case will be a lesson for the rich and the powerful to not let their machismo stop them from taking the help of drivers when they are in no position to drive themselves.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The verdict of the BMW hit-and-run case may be too flimsy a pretext to start saying that the rich and the poor are truly equal before the eyes of the Indian law. There needs to be more verdicts like this for Indians to start reposing faith in the legal system again.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Ode to a shoemaker  
	Sir  The demise of Thomas Bata at the age of 93 has probably left most Calcuttans feeling sad like me (Bata head dead, Sept 2). I grew up in the 1960s wearing that timeless Bata product, the Naughty Boy shoes, that would take ages to show any signs of wear and tear. In Bengal in particular, Bata became such a household name that its full-page advertisements in the city dailies seemed to usher in the Durga Puja. Surprisingly, in the face of a changing urban clientele and strong competition, the association of Bata with the Puja remains.           
	However, with time, Batas production philosophy seems to have changed. The Naughty Boys are not as sturdy as before. The company had introduced a range of low-end rubberized products, with an eye on the suburban market. But of late, it seems that Bata India is focused more on high-end products for urban consumers. Is Bata distancing itself from the common people? For die-hard Bata fans like me, nothing could be more disheartening.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Arindam Ghosh, Nagpur

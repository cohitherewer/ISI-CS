	The Bad Girl By Mario Vargas Llosa, Penguin, Rs 495        
	Mario Vargas Llosas new novel opens in the fabulous summer of 1950 in Miraflores, Lima, when the upheavals created by love led to much sentimental restructuring in the neighbourhood. Riding the wave, the adolescent Ricardo Somocurcio is ensnared by the demonic whirlwind of [the] madly leaping legs of the Chilean girl, Lily. For Ricardo, Lilys greatest charm is her manner of speaking, its intonation and musicality so different from that of Peruvian girls. The disaster which brings that summer to its close would reveal that Lily is not Chilean at all, that she is as much a Peruvian as Ricardo is, but worse off financially. She had presented herself as an exotic Chilean to escape her drab, poor Peruvian self. Shorn of the foreign allure, the Chilean girl disappears, but not before she has charted out the course of young Ricardos life. Driven by his obsession for the Chilean girl, now transformed into the bad girl, Ricardo would keep meeting her in different cities all over the world throughout his life. His fascination for her (false) foreign accent would also dictate his choice of profession. He starts working as an interpreter for Unesco in Paris. His musings on life, love and the bad girl would now be in Spanish, French, Russian and English at the same time.         
	Ricardos adult identity as a polyglot, which the bad girl has indirectly helped to evolve, is central to the novel. Ricardos intense longing for mastering new languages defines him and explains his undying devotion to the bad girl who dumps him repeatedly. Speaking for other people in their varied languages, Ricardo is, and is not, these people. The desire to inhabit different linguistic identities that has at its heart his initial dissatisfaction with his provincial Peruvian self, unites him with the girl. Only in her case, the dissatisfaction finds expression not in attempts to learn new languages but in the desperate need to change her name and her appearance as she flits from Peru to Paris to London to Tokyo and back to France. It is only towards the end that Ricardo learns that Lily the Chilean girl, Comrade Arlette, Madame Robert Arnoux, Mrs Richardson, Kuriko, and Madame Ricardo Somocurcio was, in reality, named Otilita. However, the more she changes the more she remains the same, defined as she is by the conventional attributes of a femme fatale  a madwoman, an adventurer, an unscrupulous female who strips her lovers clothes only to strip them of their money eventually.         
	To keep the reader entertained while the bad girl goes to the greenroom for a dress-change, as it were, Llosa puts in chunks of political talk that can only be endured as sympathetic concessions for the authors failed career as a presidential candidate for Peru. We get to know about racial prejudices, inflation and poverty in Peru under successive governments, and wonder about their relevance to the narrative. Talking to the bad girl in the avatar of Comrade Arlette, who is en route to Cuba to join a training programme for guerrilla fighters sponsored by the Left, Ricardo comes to the conclusion that she didnt give a damn about politics. It would have been better for the novel had the same been true of its author. Or, to suggest the other extreme, if the authors interest in politics had been authentic enough. The reports about the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba or the political upheavals in Peru have less to do with concern for the actual conditions prevailing in these countries than with the effect the news has on Ricardo. It is as if he turns to politics as an alternative when the bad girl fails him, only to return to his thoughts of love after convincing himself of the inevitability of corruption in political activism. In that sense, love and politics are in conflict for Ricardo and yet they are strangely united in the purpose both are made to serve. The bad girl makes Ricardo suffer excruciating torments in love, but gifts him with the inspiration for writing this novel. She thus makes him the writer he had always wanted to be. One is reminded here of the reasons cited by Llosas wife, Patricia, for her husbands turning to politics in the Eighties. She is quoted in Llosas memoir, A Fish in the Water, as saying, It was the adventure, the illusion of living an experience full of excitement and risk, of writing the great novel in real life, that made him switch to politics from writing. It is a pity that Llosa has to keep shuttling between passion and politics to fetch new ideas for his novels.         
	The novel is littered with names of literary texts that generally remain just that names, and not allusions. However, when the bad girl pops up in Paris as Madame Arnoux, Ricardo is amused that she has stolen a name from Flaubert. Madame Arnoux appears in Flauberts LEducation Sentimentale, which is the story of an indecisive young man, Frdric Moreau, battling for his sentiments in a philistine Parisian society during the tumultuous period leading to the 1848 Revolution. While the similarity between the girl and Madame Arnoux is mostly confined to the name, the character of Ricardo seems modelled on that of Frdric. Yet Ricardo, with his triteness, is no more than a shadow of Frdric. The same is true of the girl, who can be called a Hispanicized ghost, not of Madame Arnoux, but of Flauberts Madame Bovary.         
	Llosa confesses in The Perpetual Orgy: Flaubert and Madame Bovary that he had fallen in love with Emma from the time he first read the novel named after her. The picture of Emma he paints in the work emphasizes her glamour, her passion, her flamboyance in such exuberant terms that one cannot help but feel that this is more of an Emma as Llosa would like her to be and less of the Emma as imagined by Flaubert himself. The Emma of Llosas fantasy seems to have been brought to life in this novel. The life of the bad girl, like that of Emma, is governed by a lack. Born in a family that belongs to the poorest section of Peruvian society, sharing space with eleven siblings, she wants to be what she is not, that is, rich. All her subsequent actions, which earn her the sobriquet of bad girl, are to be seen in the light of this initial dissatisfaction with her station in life. However, the very concreteness, veering towards the banal, of the rationale behind the girls debaucheries deprives her of Emmas charm, which had its roots in the romantic vagueness of her discontents. Besides, by the time the revelation about the girls background comes, not many except the long-suffering Ricardo would presumably be interested in it. The reader hardly needed any justification for her actions, which, truth to tell, are innocent enough. Ricardo is understandably shattered by her wantonness because he is besotted with her. But he only bores the reader by pouring out his outrage. Worse, he makes a saint out of the unabashed sinner by trying to persuade the reader that the bad girl has performed a miracle and by reforming her at the end.        
	When Ricardo is deserted by the girl for the umpteenth time, he laments that she has extinguished, by her betrayals, the illusions that make existence more than the sum of its routines. The observation is significant, not least because it is one of the very few remarkable lines in the novel. Apart from pointing, in a sudden unexpected flash, to the fact that love is a necessary illusion, the line also provides a phrase to describe The Bad Girl itself. For this novel is little more than the sum of [the] routines of love (read lovemaking) between Ricardo and the bad girl. The illusion that there is something more is so insubstantial, and presented in such a hackneyed manner, that the novel would have been better off without the pretension.

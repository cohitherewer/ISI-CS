	All about money                  
	Sir  It is commendable that the Reserve Bank of India and the Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, have rescued the Indian financial market from a huge crash by instantly dismissing the rumour of the bankruptcy of ICICI Bank (Apex bank vouches for ICICI, Oct 1). But both have been wilfully ignoring for some time the malpractices of the huge number of private banks that create funds by absorbing hoards of money from its customers through suspense-accounts. ICICI Bank alone has reportedly been holding about 83 crore rupees in its suspense account in Delhi. If there is even a slight difference in the spelling of the account-holders name on cheques, drafts and pay-orders, these banks freeze the accounts after they clear the cheques and drafts. The account holder remains in the dark as the account-statements received after the transaction have no mention of the account being suspended. It is only after some months or usually when a fiscal year ends that the customers are told about the freezing of their accounts.           
	Since most big firms scrutinize their bank-statements at the end of every financial year, it becomes impossible for them to locate the specific transaction that created the trouble. The dispute over the wrong spelling of names often goes against the account-holders interest as they are alerted very late, and the money thus goes into the banks suspense account, fattening its revenue. Such financial malpractices should be curbed immediately.           
	Also, many private financing-companies are giving easy loans by getting advance monthly post-dated cheques against the granted loan. But most takers of loans are unaware that under the Income Tax Act, a tax will be deducted from the quantum of interest charged in the equated monthIy instalment cheques. These finance companies should be granted exemption from tax-deduction in the manner that the Central Board of Direct Taxes allows in bank-loans. Otherwise, provisions should be made for advance tax-deduction for up to at least three financial years. This may be adjusted by the finance companies from the initial EMIs at the time of disbursing loans. In any case, it should be the responsibility of the companies to inform the loan-takers about the mandatory tax deduction.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  The tide of financial wreckage in the United States of America has hit the Indian shore, and prices of stocks of reputed companies are sliding down everyday. The stocks of ICICI Bank struck an all-time low very recently. The rumours of its bankruptcy reflected the panic among small and big traders of the country. In the last five years, the bank has expanded its operations at a much greater pace in terms of branch presence and capital base, compared to the other major Indian private banks. With increased market penetration, any financial institution runs the risk of overlooking the balances that need to be maintained before credit is offered to individuals or organizations.           
	While the US is yet to recover from the subprime crisis, investors and depositors around the globe are wary of the financial institutions they deal with and the quality of their assets. Intense competition in the Indian private banking space might force ICICI to spread its operations in terms of customer acquisition, but it should also realize that in the long term, winning the confidence of the customer would go a longer way in establishing its credibility as a responsible financial organization.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The apprehensions resonating through Tall claims (Sept 29) are quite realistic. India may very soon face the jolt of a financial downturn like the US and Europe owing to its current fiscal policies that give a free rein to private retail bankers. Also, the Centre, under the influence of the BPO industry and suchlike, is allowing largescale foreign direct investment into the Indian market. The foreign institutional investors are permitting a free penetration of foreign funds and business ventures in India, liquidating Indian stocks dangerously. Besides, the recent farm loan waivers and the pay revisions of Central government employees are close to wiping the treasury clean. The finance ministry should act before it is too late.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Old men lost          
	Sir  According to the directives of the United Nations, October 1 was celebrated as the International Day of Older Persons. Does this day feature in the Indian governments calendar? Ageing in this country, unlike in the West, is fraught with anxieties and uncertainties. So far, the State has paid little attention to the rights of the elderly in India. The pension scheme and healthcare system are more or less dysfunctional. The withering away of the joint-family system has led to a major change in the attitude to geriatric care. The media are full of reports of violence against helpless old men and women  by strangers or by their kin. It would take more than a few laws to change the lives of the elderly in India. Until the younger generation changes its attitude fundamentally, senior citizens would continue to live in insecurity.          
	Yours faithfully,        Jatindra Nath Bhattacharya,Durgapur

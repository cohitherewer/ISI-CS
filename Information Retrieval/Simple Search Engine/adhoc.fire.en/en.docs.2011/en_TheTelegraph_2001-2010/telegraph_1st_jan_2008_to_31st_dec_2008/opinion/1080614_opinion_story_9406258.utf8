The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | After the silence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AFTER THE SILENCE                          - Since authority responds to pressure, people power is a real force        Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                            Caught                                              
	Being caught in an altercation at Dum Dum airport was both embarrassing and encouraging. It demonstrated in a small way that people power can also be put to constructive use in a state that suffers from an excess of destructive muscle-flexing in the name of the people.        
	There being two queues at the prepaid taxi kiosk, one windingly long and the other of only three persons, my wife and I naturally joined the latter. All hell broke loose at once, for, apparently, the short queue was irregular. Presumably, resentment against it had been simmering for some time and the appearance of two additional passengers  us  with a laden trolley was the catalyst. People shrieked and shouted, a mutt head (from his covered head and tilaks) waved frantic arms, another man dashed up to the counter to demand that our queue should be ignored. He succeeded. It was a just victory of people power, even if it meant a slightly longer wait for us to book a taxi.        
	The question that occurs to me is why such force cannot also be exerted to tone up negligent, inefficient and often corrupt services. A dramatic event like confronting Asok Bhattacharyas escapism makes headlines, but the likes of Dilip Singh could also direct their energies to many areas of public activity where we now suffer in silence. Prolonged power cuts and disrupted train services are taken for granted. Sanctioned storm relief compensation is pocketed in the 24 Parganas (and elsewhere) by party loyalists and village schools force the poor to pay for facilities that, pitiable as they are, are supposed to be free. Its Calcuttas niggling little abuses that moved the renowned British journalist, James Cameron, who loved India deeply, to revulsion and recrimination.               
	Take Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Returning to Calcutta after 18 months abroad during which I continued to pay for its unused broadband service, I find the service inoperative. Many telephone calls have been made. Sometimes we are given a docket number. Sometimes we are promised that an engineer will come round. Sometimes the man at the other end is downright rude. Most often, no one picks up the telephone. Tiring of these futile attempts to get value for money, I wrote them a letter. In it, I also pointed out that, initially, I had paid a lump sum for an annual contract. This was changed soon afterwards at BSNLs instance to the cheaper monthly Home Plan, but the excess money I paid has still not been returned. A durwan took the letter round at three in the afternoon but BSNL refused to accept it. We have a meeting, they said. Come back tomorrow. They did accept the letter the next morning after making abusive comments about the complaint. I still dont have the broadband for which I pay.        
	Its the same  but worse  with house tax. I paid the rate demanded but went to court, obtained a reduction and forwarded the judgment to Calcutta Municipal Corporation, asking for a refund. There was no reply. The tax demands continue as before. What I suffered with my lawyer and the courts is another matter. Not all these problems  with which readers will be familiar  can be laid at authoritys door. The malpractices of building promoters or our cable providers incredibly bad service, for instance, represent private enterprise gone awry. But the state, whose shadow lies darkly on daily life, sets the pattern of shortchanging people and getting away with the least service possible, and that least invariably the worst.        
	When Rajiv Gandhi said that West Bengal needed a strong consumer movement, I explained that resistance could only be effective if the political leadership was caring, the bureaucracy diligent and the police honest and effective. There is no point in lodging a complaint if the police ignore it. But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees strictures encourage the faint hope that the lawless might at last be brought within the purview of the law. Let him not be misled by the argument that the police cannot wait for a warrant if they know of an AK47 in someones house. Sadly, it is far more likely that the AK47 will be planted in any house someone in authority has targeted. The police in civilized societies might arguably be allowed to use discretion to search, seize, raid, arrest or take other action without a warrant. But India is not in this sense a civilized society and loopholes and leeway inevitably mean abuse.         
	A former police commissioner with whom I discussed the ethics of rounding up people without magisterial sanction blandly replied, In India the exception becomes the rule. When I pushed matters further, another police commissioner in bulging khaki in his Lalbazar office chattily warned me that the police are very dirty fellows, going on to say that Evidence for sale signs were common in 19th-century London. A third police commissioner did help me once, but only because one of his bara babus, the Beliaghata OC I think, happened to drop in while I was talking to the commissioner and vigorously took my part.         
	It concerned a traumatic encounter with a police inspector who incited a gang of drunk motorcyclists to claim that the car in which my infant son and I were travelling had knocked down one of them. The inspector haunted my office for months afterwards pleading that the proceedings against him (initiated only because of the Beliaghata OC) should be called off. I salved my conscience by not giving evidence. That, I was assured, would kill the case. The other two incidents concerned trying to save my mothers cook from harassment and asking why a young man should suddenly be gripped and dragged screaming into a truck. For my inquisitiveness, I, too, was shoved into the truck, as I wrote in these columns at the time. For a totally apolitical person with some pretension to respectability, I seem to have had a surprisingly large number of brushes with not the law but the police!               
	A thorough cleansing of not just the police but the civil bureaucracy should not be beyond the competence of a caring chief minister, who has brought himself to recognize that the police can do wrong, and whose finance minister commendably seeks to curb ostentation and extravagance. Asked shortly before his death about his greatest failure, Jawaharlal Nehru replied, I failed to change the administration. It is still a colonial administration. He was wrong. The colonial administration was paternalistic; its successor is self-serving. Attempts at democratization have worsened things, for the sad truth is that red lights on cars and peons at the door are even more highly prized at societys bottom.         
	Much as I dislike the pretentious collective noun of intellectual, the protest of writers and artists  another positive demonstration of people power  may have persuaded Bhattacharjee to condemn the Jadavpur raid. Authority responds to pressure; while public interest litigation serves a purpose (though it is abused too), the high visibility of a local equivalent of what Americans called Naders Raiders can be even more effective in mobilizing all ranks. It is in this context that I welcome an e-mail from someone called Avik Saha of the Anti-Bandh Forum Team (antibandh.kolkatagmail.com) asking How long will we be taken for granted?         
	Bandhs are a ticklish question since the organizers also claim to manifest people power. But when the same group responds one day to one partys call and the next day to anothers, its clear no cause is at stake. They only want a paid holiday and a show of political strength. In those circumstances, its those who say Enough is Enough! Let us join hands and Ban the Bandhs, who represent honest people power. Not those who abuse constitutional authority or use force to effect closures that further damage an already threadbare quality of life.

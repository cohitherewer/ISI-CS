	When an array of leaders across the political spectrum is trying to keep tens of thousands of old, fatally-polluting vehicles running on Calcuttas streets, then something is dreadfully wrong with governance in West Bengal. The chief minister, transport minister and Opposition leader, among others, have all been trying to get around the imminent high court ban on two-stroke autorickshaws through contradictory, non-committal or ignorant statements or silences. What is going on here? Apart from showing outrageous disrespect for the rule of law (the transport minister has accused the judiciary of running a parallel government), what are the stakes in sustaining this long and criminal indifference to the grave physical damage caused by these vehicles? What unites these politicians has been the bane of West Bengal for decades  populism. This is ostensibly being done for the sake of the people  in this case, the owners and drivers of the vehicles who will be left unemployed by the implementation of a series of bans by the court. But there is a cruder way of putting this: what matters, always and above all else, are the votes; the single-mindedness of staying in, or getting back to, power. For that reason, there will be bandhs at the drop of a hat, pavements will never be cleared of hawkers, rallies and meetings will continue to ravage the citys greens, the law will never be changed to give murderously rash bus drivers the kind of punishment they deserve  this could turn into an endless list.        
	The other factor uniting these leaders is corruption  money. The money coming in from adulterated oil, illegal fitness certificates, bribes from registered as well as unregistered vehicles and from a whole range of other invisible sources is far too high, and freely moves up and down the bureaucratic hierarchy. In such a scheme of things, what chances do life and law have?

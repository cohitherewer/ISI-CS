The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Far from wild
                                                                                                               Far from wild

	Calcuttas club circuit played host last weekend to the intriguingly-named de Musset amp; Co., two Londoners who presented Wilde at Heart, a biodrama on Oscar Wildes flamboyant life. Nothing in their act, however, justified the glorious accolades in the publicity: universally acclaimed, magnificent and riveting. I do not know how celebrated the performers are in Britain, but not too highly, I hope, for the sake of British theatre.         
	Patrick Marley had the script on a music stand in front of him, and referred to it every now and then, which not only irritated, but also indicated a shaky memory, not exactly the best qualification for an actor. He was also exceedingly low in volume, barely audible even though miked. Genevieve Allenbury gave a much better display of theatre training with poses and manners apt for the multiple roles, from Wildes mother to his wife and Sarah Bernhardt, as well as characters from his plays. Although peppered with delightful nuggets, including his precious epigrams and passages from correspondence, the production ended abruptly, with the announcement of his notorious trial for homosexuality. There was no mention of his incarceration, his brilliant prison writings like The Ballad of Reading Gaol and De Profundis, or self-imposed exile in Paris after his release.

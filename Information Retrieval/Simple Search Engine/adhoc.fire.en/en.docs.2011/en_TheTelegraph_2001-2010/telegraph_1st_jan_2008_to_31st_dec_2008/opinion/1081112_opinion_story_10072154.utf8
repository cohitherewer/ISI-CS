	At last, if only by accident, the language of political correctness has turned out to tell the truth. Americas voters last week elected as president the son of a Kenyan father and an American mother: a man who genuinely deserves the adjective, African-American.         
	That phrase in the past 20 years has almost wholly replaced  in America  such earlier ones as nigger, negro and coloured, and has largely overtaken the more recent, and by now quite unopprobrious, black. It took its time. In 1910, when the National Negro Committee, founded a year earlier, reinvented itself as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, coloured  as we spell it  was seen as neutral and inoffensive. The NAACP became Americas leading black political body, and still sticks to its original title. But the word is a left-over, doomed by its use in segregationist signage such as No Colored or Colored at the Back.        
	In Britain, the politically correct word is black, despite the efforts made for Afro-Caribbean. Indeed, left-leaning enthusiasts have extended black to almost anyone, short of ethnic Chinese, who looks other than white. So people of South Asian origin who would hardly welcome the word in that region are happy enough to be enlisted under it in British organizations such as the Southall Black Sisters, a campaigning womens group that is, Im told, largely peopled by (of all inappropriate folk) Punjabis.        
	To your average Briton, that usage is odd: he uses Paki impartially, if offensively, for anyone from Pakistan or India alike, and reserves black for people of West Indian or African descent. Yet in other European languages, such niceties are less observed. A man I knew went back once to a Greek island to collect his wife and children after a family holiday there, only to find they had decamped, in the company of a man whom the local villagers suspected  accurately, I fear  to be the ladys lover. What kind of a man, asked the unhappy cuckold? Enas mavros, replied one of the islanders: a black man.                
	Shade card        
	The Greek word is linked, via the Spanish Moro, to our own Moor  a word that, five centuries ago, Britons used for almost anyone from Moroccans to Turks. The man at issue was, in fact, a Bengali executive, little darker than the Greek villager, I suspect, who so described him. But ancient recognition of the stranger, the outsider, defined him as black.        
	White in Victorian days was similarly used, to the opposite effect, as a word of approval. Hes a real white man didnt suggest his skin colour but his sense of honour and duty, his steadfastness in a tough corner. Hence Kiplings well-known lines, put into the mouth of a British private in India praising his regimental bhisti: But for all is dirty ide, e was white, clear white inside.... Youre a better man than I am, Gunga Din!        
	You can have a nice discussion these days whether those lines show the private, or their author, or both to have been racist. But their intent at the time was simple: Gunga Din was a good guy. Today, however, white in British usage has largely lost its incantatory effect. If theres a racial punch-up involving ethnic Asians, nasty-minded Brits will talk of Pakis, the media of Asians, but both, indeed both sets of combatants, will refer to the lighter-skinned side as English.        
	Its bizarre that even a force as strong as group feeling has corralled under the one word black hundreds of millions of individuals whose skin-colours range from near-ebony to pale cafe au lait, but nearly all of whom would far more accurately be called brown; while white indicates another group not one of whom is anywhere near that shade. Personally, I think its also regrettable. But thats politics, and we know what happens to truth and language when politicians lay hands on them.

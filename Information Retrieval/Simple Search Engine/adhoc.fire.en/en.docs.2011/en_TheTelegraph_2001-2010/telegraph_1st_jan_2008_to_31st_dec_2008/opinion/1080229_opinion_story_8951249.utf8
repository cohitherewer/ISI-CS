The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Back to   basics
                                                                                                                 [+uc('Back to   basics')+]                                  Malvika Singh                                    
	There was a newspaper item on February 26 saying that at an emergency meeting to try and save the tiger, a decision was taken to allocate larger sums of money towards its protection. We know well what that means because we have witnessed, much too often, how such decisions and allocations end up being a cover-up for inaction and corruption, which ensure, yet again, that there are no deviations from failed policies initiated by the government and thereby support the detrimental status quo of weak policies and sub-standard populism in fragile areas of our land. It makes one sick to see this intellectual corruption running riot amongst those who determine policies. The rapid descent into chaos and corrupt practices happening in front of our eyes, leaving us helpless spectators of selfish destruction, can only be deemed criminal negligence.        
	Bereft of ideas and solutions, maybe our rulers need to go back in time, pour over the initiatives taken by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who comprehended well the essential imperatives for protecting and nurturing our forests, our varied wildlife and sensitive eco-system. She continues to stand out in the political crowd decades after her death. Her determined commitment to such issues should be a lesson for the Congress party that has lost the idea of enhancing and protecting the remains of a devastated natural environment. As regimes destroy this bank of enormous wealth, the leaders are damaging one critical limb of the culture of Bharat.                
	Right or wrong        
	The other two that are injured but not fully maimed are the human skills and the man-made heritage of this country. The decline in all these areas is more than evident, but protection is virtually non-existent. The nexus of politicians, the administration and vote-banks must be disbanded. India and her natural environment, her forests, rivers, mountains and wildlife belong to us all and cannot be parcelled into segments to appease castes and communities.        
	Rather than indulging in the two easy options  one of releasing more money for failed policies and the second of holding futile meetings with non-expert babus to protect the dreadfully negative status quo that protects the babu and not the tiger  the government should set up a new central wildlife service. The existing forest service in India has taken on the avatar of a rural development service! Decisions and mandates get twisted and contorted as they go through the bureaucratic machine, only to confuse, corrupt and destroy further. Does this regime have the commitment to create a new service? Does it see the looming threat of annihilation? Is it intellectually capable or congenitally inept? Will it succumb to political lobbying only to keep temporary coalition peace at huge costs to the nation?        
	It is this political weakness and lack of forceful, intelligent, knowledge-based determination that allow the babu to triumph time and again in every sector of Bharat. They know well how to wriggle in and out of situations in which they would be forced to take hard decisions and they are equally capable of stalling decisions that are forced upon them. Rather than running the administrative machine effectively, this class of individuals seems to spend the best part of their careers scheming, plotting and making plans to let the status quo survive a while longer. The babu needs to go back to learning what is right and what is wrong, back to attending courses that teach efficiency and integrity, that define ethics and social service. They need to model themselves on former ICS officers like L.K. Jha and L.P. Singh, who did India proud, who were well-read intellectuals, who did not hesitate to raise their voices against unconstitutional aberrations.

	Money for nothing                  
	Sir  The high rate of inflation in India can only be attributed to the accumulation of black money due to corruption and misappropriation of funds (Inflation close to 8%, May 17). It is well known that in India, no work in the government gets done without some corrupt practice or another. When Karnataka Lokayukta judge, Santhosh Hegde, got an order to conduct raids for unaccounted money, he met with stiff resistance from government officials including IAS and IPS officers. Besides, the voluntary disclosure scheme, endorsed by the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, is nothing but a way of regularizing corruption. A finance minister should know better, else how can inflation be checked?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  In spite of the finance ministers tall talk and the prime ministers praise for it, inflation is at an all-time high now, standing at around 7.83 per cent. The government is spending heavily on security of VIPs, mainly those from the political classes. A huge convoy of vehicles forms the entourage of all our politicians. This means unnecessary spending from the government exchequer which is one of the factors contributing to inflation in the country. Subsidies also add to inflation. It is time for all politicians to tighten their belts and bring their expenditures down as much as possible. The prime minister too should take a firm stand on this issue.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  The worst sufferers of high inflation are the senior citizens of India who have limited earnings in the form of pension or returns from savings. Unlike todays young professionals, they have not earned in crores or lakhs per month when they were working. The middle class today earns more money than it has time to spend. But needless to say, the poor suffer the most. There is too much money in the hands middle classes, leading to a retail boom. If the total money circulating in the economy is the same, then a section of the people must be having a lower purchasing power than before. The government adds to the woes by levying multiple taxes on a single commodity. To reduce prices, and thereby inflation, taxes must be removed from all essential commodities.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report on Muni Reddy made for interesting reading (Piping hot dosa, for just 10 paise, May 11). It is wonderful to find a man of such rare moral integrity that he can cover his expenses by pricing his dosas at 10 paise a piece, without compromising on the quality of the food he sells. Reddys dosas cost far less than those available in any metro. His city peers could pick up a thing or two from his business model.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Policy watch          
	Sir  As a 72-year-old senior citizen, I am quite surprised to find that there has been an almost 150 per cent increase in the premium payable towards mediclaim policies. While the premium I paid to New India Assurance Co. Ltd. against my policy was Rs 3,224 for the year 2007-08, I have paid Rs 8,055 for the current year. I have aged further since because of this enormous expense. Our benevolent finance minister had proclaimed liberal health insurance policies for senior citizens in his annual budget speech, but the increased rate of insurance premium points to the hollowness of his promises. I appeal to him to take some steps in this matter to ameliorate the hardship of retired elders whose numbers are going up every year. It is of little help that the insurance regulator has asked insurance companies not to raise the renewal premium for mediclaim to senior citizens by more than 75 per cent, because even that amount is fairly exorbitant (Mediclaim relief for seniors, May 14). I also draw the attention of all senior citizens associations to this arbitrary increase in premium amount.           
	Yours faithfully,       
P. Misra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Mediclaim policy-holders seem to be caught in a fix between private hospitals and nursing homes. Then there are the nationalized medical insurance companies with their associated reimbursement agencies.           
	On the one hand, the private hospitals and nursing homes, in connivance with many medical practitioners, fleece the patient (that is, the policy-holder) with their overpriced services. On the other hand, the reimbursing agencies enforce rules formulated by the nationalized companies to give the policy-holder as little as possible of his dues.           
	Room rents in any reputed hospital are very high. Insurance agencies usually pay only one per cent of the total sum assured in the policy as room rent. One wonders how the figure  one per cent  was arrived at. The policy often does not include service charges added to the hospital bill. Finally, of the many tests that doctors order for a patients treatment, there are some that the reimbursement agency refuses to pay, labelling them NRTD  a curious acronym which stands for not related to disease.           
	Different nationalized companies have different rules regarding reimbursement, but common sense suggests that these rules cannot or should not be too different, since their objective is the same, that is, protection of the company from the financial demands of the policy-holder. It is acceptable that the beneficiary of the policy should have to bear a part of the cost of treatment. In most countries, this amount is fixed at 20 to 25 per cent. I found that in India, one pays a whopping 33.3 per cent.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fire on the roof of the world
                                                                                                                 FIRE ON THE ROOF OF THE WORLD                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	A small news item on the bottom of the front page informed readers that the Dalai Lama was behind the sabotage in Lhasa. This was about it on Tibets bloody Friday in the Weekend China Daily, published in English and read mainly by foreigners. However, the next two days carried long reports on Fridays events, by Xinhua, the official news agency.         
	The Chinese media havent clamped up on Tibet. CCTV showed visuals of Fridays rioting, but the news clip was abruptly cut, grumbled one viewer. Xinhua has been prolific, not only carrying lengthy reports of the official response, but also interviews with survivors of Fridays violence.         
	The governments line is very clear. A minority of people, followers of the Dalai Lama, are creating mayhem. That is also the average citizens view. Ordinary Chinese are surprised when Indians refer to Tibetans as such. You mean Chinese from Tibet?  this diaryist was asked sharply by a woman who is herself critical of the government.         
	This time, the Chinese from Tibet have not just protested against the government, but also attacked other Chinese there. Xinhua interviewed Muslims in Lhasas hospital, hailing from a neighbouring province, whose eateries and mosque had been burnt down. They managed to save themselves by jumping from the first floor, or had been forced to run out into the knife-wielding mob. Other survivors interviewed by Xinhua included Hans, who form the majority in China, and also some Tibetans. Significantly, many victims said they had been saved from the mob by Tibetans.                 
	Lone voice        
	Normally, bloggers in China are barely tolerated. But this time, Xinhua actually quoted a blog posted by a Han Chinese. An eye-witness to the mayhem, the blogger wrote: March 14, 2008 will be a day that will be forever remembered in Tibetan history, and even in Chinese history. In March 2008 of this new millennium, a mob openly burned temples and shops and assaulted members of other ethnic groups. In an instant, black smoke rose over all Lhasa as the people grew anxious. The newspapers ceased publication, the offices were not operating, the shops were shuttered and there were no vehicles in the streets...could this be happening somewhere in the Peoples Republic? Such was the very public provocation made by the mobsters in Lhasa.         
	The blogger received many calls from government officials asking him to take care, not to go outdoors. However, as a former reporter, he was unable to resist, and drove into town to see huge rocks on the road and inside the compound of the public security office, taxis burnt or speeding away with their windows smashed, the front of a supermarket burnt down, a Han woman running with blood streaming down her face. All over, said the bloggers, spectators gathered to watch mobs setting fire to cars. A Tibetan ceramic shop had its shutters half-down, obviously not worried about being attacked.         
	We have not fired a single gunshot, we have used no lethal force, the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region told the press in Beijing repeatedly, giving the death toll as 13. Media reports citing a higher toll were exaggerated, he said. Citizens, however, had their own sources. The blogger received an anxious call from his mother in the mainland, an indicator that people in China knew about the violence. People in Tibet do not accept the Panchen Lama appointed by the government, said one resident of a city unaffected by the violence. They follow the Dalai Lama. The government has sent in the army. This happens often, but we dont get to hear of it. Had it not been for the National Peoples Congress in Beijing going on now, we may not have got to know this time too.

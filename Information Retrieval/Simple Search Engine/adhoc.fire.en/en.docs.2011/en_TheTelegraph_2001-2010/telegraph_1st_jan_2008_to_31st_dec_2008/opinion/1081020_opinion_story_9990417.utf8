	Blindness gave way to sight, and Mayavati made an about-turn. The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has now decided to let the Centre build its railway coach factory on the land in Rae Bareli that she had snatched away the day before the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, came to lay the foundation. Ms Mayavatis abrupt change of stance is perhaps a measure of the importance that all politicians are being compelled to accord to the notion of development. It must have struck Ms Mayavati that being labelled anti-development would not do her image much good, even if in her state development is a less emotive issue than questions of caste and sect. Having managed the unprecedented feat of creating an upper-caste-cum-Dalit constituency, she now has to play up to them all. The upper castes want business and development. Besides, having created a bogey of farmers angry that their land was being taken away, all her officers could produce were people furious at having an employment-generating factory torn away from their doorstep. The Congress chiefs adamant attitude did not help either. A change of stance was the only option.        
	But Ms Mayavati does not believe in being either apologetic or defensive. She has taken the offensive, asking the Centre for a few crores for the development of the area, which includes Rae Bareli and Amethi, thus taking the development war to the Congresss doorstep. She will show the world who does more for UP. She has also demanded a raise in the annual income ceiling of other backward classes to Rs 5 lakh, over the Rs 4.5 lakh fixed by the Centre. She is anxious because of the precarious condition of 16 castes under the OBC category, hence the demand. Competing with the Congress in development initiatives and in compassion is especially significant with her new closeness to the Left, which may be making Delhi seem closer. All the balls are now in the air.

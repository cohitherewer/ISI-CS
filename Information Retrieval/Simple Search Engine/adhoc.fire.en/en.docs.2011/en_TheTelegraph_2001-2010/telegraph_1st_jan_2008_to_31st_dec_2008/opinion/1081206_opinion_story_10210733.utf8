                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TINY CARS AND TUMBLING SHADOWS                              VISUAL ARTS      Soumitra Das                                                
	Tapestry as a medium of artistic expression is not widely in use in our country. Shrabani Roy, a young artist trained in Santiniketan, uses tapestry, appliqu and paint as her vehicle of expression. Her current exhibition, Shrabanis Alternative (Akar Prakar, till December 20), provides ample proof of the innovative ways these under-used media can be utilized to create work that has a contemporary relevance. The best thing about this young Santiniketan-trained artist is that she is alive to what is happening around her, and this impacts her work in a significant manner.         
	She often uses simple images, which are almost childlike in their directness (picture, top), to project the ironies, tensions, paranoia and madness without method in modern-day life and to aim her barbs of witticism at the conventions of art. Her aeroplanes, banks of clouds, cars, firearms and kitchen utensils have a strong graphic appeal, something that it has in common with child art. Basu is capable of distancing herself from her situation and taking an objective view of it without missing the quirks and greeting them with occasional bursts of humour. This gives her work a certain freshness as she is no po-faced observer.                   
	Her works look very special as they are multi-textured, the smoothness of the paintwork contrasting with colourful pieces of cloth used in the appliqu and the tapestry with individual strands of thread standing out. The contrasts of colour and textures add to the pleasure of viewing her works in which she makes light of the preoccupations of modern women. A woman is behind the cage-like window of a car that she is driving, while a traditional stone spice-grinder occupies the adjacent panel. In www.postcontemporarylife.com, Basu uses rectangular black boxes of several sizes to critique the lifestyle of modern women torn between their careers and aspirations and their families and motherhood.        
	She takes delight in ridiculing the archaic conventions of academism still in vogue in certain art schools in this city. A curvaceous nude wears a pot on her head, her feet in ankle-deep water. The naked woman is caught between two panels depicting cooking utensils, Subodh-Gupta-style, only these were painstakingly woven by the artist herself. Fear of flying is graphically demonstrated as two pistols are aimed at a woman, presumably a passenger in an aeroplane.         
	Basu is also adept at non-figurative work. She creates a subtle harmony of colours and forms in this work. Here, as in her other works such as the tiny cars rolling over the tongue and the myriad eyes, it is Roys strong sense of composition and a certain twinkle in her eyes that set her apart.         
	K. S. Radhakrishnan, originally from Kerala, was trained at Santiniketan under the guidance of both Ramkinkar Baij and Sarbari Roychoudhury. His works are usually on a large scale, so thanks to Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, this is the first time that a full scale exhibition of his Liminal Figures Liminal Space (picture, bottom) can be seen here (till December 10). Besides his magnum opus on a 60ft-long ramp, there are several other smaller pieces that are variations on the theme of human figures executing cartwheels with the abandon of Cretans leaping effortlessly over bulls.        
	The big piece took Radhakrishnan two years to give shape to and is being exhibited for the first time in Calcutta, from where it will travel to other metropolises. He uses bronze and that makes it costlier and more time consuming. Beneath the life-size acrobatic figures in suspended animation and balanced on columns are myriad men and women dancing to unheard music. Langlands fair field full of folk? Not really. They are clones multiplied severalfold. While the large pieces have the daintiness and cuteness of Llardo figurines, their tapering shapes seem to be a cross between Giacomettis spindly forms and Meera Mukherjees graceful figures. At the climactic stage, the vaulting figure confronts a wall of bronze alive with tiny forms in bas relief. The shadow of the large piece is outlined, as it were, on this block of bronze. But the shadow seems to have more substance than the life-size forms. Hence the title of this exhibition.        
	The smaller pieces of sculpture have a single dominating figure on a cube, a boat, a square or some other geometrical formation. The ground of these shapes also teems with the minuscule dancing figures, some defying gravity. At times, however, viewers may find the sameness of the tiny figures dull and insipid. Size does not always impress.

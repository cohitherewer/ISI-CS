	Who can forget Tomari matir kanya, Aranya amrita, or the other remarkable choreographies done by Manjusri Chaki Sirkar? Dancers Guild, established by Manjusri and her daughter, Ranjabati, organized a two-day dance festival at Rabindra Sadan (August 17-18) to mark its silver jubilee. The festival featured classical dance performances by artists from the Indian Cultural Ensemble, Manipuri Nartanalay and Upasana Centre for Dance.        
	The prime attraction of the event was the premiere of Jajnaseni, a dance piece presented by Dancers Guild under the guidance of Jonaki Sarkar. Based on the Mahabharat, the performance presented the myriad facets of Draupadis character by placing her in a contemporary context. The dancers made use of diverse dance traditions  Mayurbhanj chhau, Bharatnatyam, Kathakali, Manipuri, Thang-ta and so on  but their movements lacked finesse and precision. Despite their shortcomings, Sarkars ability to singlehandedly carry forward the illustrious legacy is indeed praiseworthy.         
	Jajnaseni was followed by Trayee, directed by Indian Cultural Ensembles Aditya Mitra.The festival concluded with Samavratee, a spirited performance by Manipuri Nartanalay under the guidance of Bimbabati.

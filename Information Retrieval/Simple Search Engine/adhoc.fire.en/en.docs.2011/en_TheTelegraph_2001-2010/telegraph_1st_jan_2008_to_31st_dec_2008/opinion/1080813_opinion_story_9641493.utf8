	Red and green                  
	Sir  The state administration occasionally comes up with bright ideas to improve Calcuttas environs. But the results are invariably the same: further wastage of public funds in the futile attempt to control and reduce Calcuttas ever-increasing pollution. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has reportedly set up a young brigade to help police make the city greener and cleaner (Green cops for clean Calcutta, Aug 3). While it makes sense to save the trees, wetlands and the water bodies with the help of the green police, there are doubts surrounding Bhattacharjees noble endeavour. Preventing trees from being felled would definitely make Calcutta greener but the city will not be cleaner until the squatters who occupy and litter its footpaths are rehabilitated elsewhere.           
	The S.P. Mukherjee Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing must be one of Calcuttas busiest intersections. While hawkers have occupied a major portion of S.P Mukherjee Road, the entire stretch of the footpath on the south-eastern side of the street is now home to about a hundred families. In the absence of proper sanitary facilities, the families are forced to relieve themselves either on the nearby tram tracks or anywhere on the road. Dozens of coal or wood-fire chulas belch out heavy smoke in the morning and dirty or washed clothes are spread out for drying later in the day. Most of these squatters take drugs and some of the women are involved in the flesh trade. The Tollygunge police station is nearby, but the police do not seem to notice anything. They seem not to mind when even pujas are performed on the footpaths, complete with blaring loudspeakers and bedecked pandals. Recently, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has spent a substantial amount of money in constructing a park in the area, and decorated it beautifully with trees and costly light fittings. The squatters have taken over the park almost overnight, making a mockery of the beautification drive.           
	Before launching yet another project to protect the greens, Bhattacharjee should draw up an account of the public money that is wasted regularly because of inept officials and inefficient departments. A walk along S.P. Mukherjee Road would enable the chief minister to see for himself the problems pedestrians face just because the police refuse to do anything about the squatters.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The chief minister may make a great show of launching the green cops but the fact remains that Calcuttas greenery has been systematically obliterated over the years with the tacit approval of the officials at Alimuddin Street and at CMC. The construction of the Taj Bengal hotel, the massive highrises along VIP Road and the encroachments on the Howrah Maidan led to the disappearance of acres of green cover that had once been Calcuttas pride. As Calcutta becomes barer, the party lackeys grow richer. The losers in the bargain are the people: their money is wasted on useless projects and they are made to breathe the citys poisoned air.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  One cannot but hesitate before rejoicing over the introduction of the green police to protect Calcuttas environment. Ideally, this force should go a long way in preventing the illegal felling of trees. However, danger lurks in the fact that the members of the force have been selected from the 560 clubs that participated in the para-football tournament organized by Calcutta police. Most of these clubs enjoy the patronage of some party or the other. The club members might be reluctant to act against their patrons who have vested interests in cutting trees or in filling up ponds in the locality. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has acted commendably after a long time by setting up the green police. However, to be effective, this force should put up helpline numbers specific to an area so that it can be contacted by residents to prevent felling in their localities.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I was travelling from Dhakuria to my office at Mission Row in a mini bus (WBY 2893, Route N 137) on the morning of August 11. The driver of an adjacent private bus (Route No. 212) started honking and continued blowing the horn even as the bus left Lansdowne Road and reached Deshapriya Park crossing so that the vehicle could overtake ours. But the driver of our mini bus kept blocking the road and even slowed down occasionally to pick up passengers,inconveniencing the traffic coming from behind. Finally, near the Sishu Mangal Hospital, the private bus succeeded in overtaking from the left, even as the minibus stopped to pick up more passengers. In the melee, the passengers, including some women, who were boarding our bus suffered injuries.          
	Buses blocking roads and rash driving are the hallmarks of Calcuttas traffic. The police can put a stop to these ills by arresting errant bus driver or penalizing them in the form of spot fines, revocation of licenses and so on. This would certainly deter bus drivers from driving dangerously and reduce the miseries of common people. However, such punitive actions on the part of the police are rare.          
	The Calcutta police need to understand the plight of commuters. They should enforce the laws to prevent such lawlessness on our roads. Only then will we be able to create a Calcutta that is safe and habitable.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Mallick, Calcutta

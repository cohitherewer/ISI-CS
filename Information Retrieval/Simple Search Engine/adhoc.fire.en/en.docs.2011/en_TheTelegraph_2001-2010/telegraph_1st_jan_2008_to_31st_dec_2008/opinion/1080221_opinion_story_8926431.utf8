The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Left out in the cold
                                                                                                                 LEFT OUT IN THE COLD                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	Chinas unnatural snowy weather has returned; south and central China are again reeling under extreme cold. The discussion in the media, however, is getting hotter. There has been strong criticism in the official English newspaper, China Daily, of the way the system, especially the countrys showpieces of growth, simply collapsed.         
	Wuhan, for example, the largest city in central China, a provincial capital and a major commercial, industrial and educational centre, faced a breakdown of water supply and transport as well as blackouts. Food prices doubled too, in the worst snowstorm in 60 years. Hefei, another historical provincial capital and a foreign investors Mecca with major universities, saw the roofs of key facilities in a state-of-the-art industrial hub cave in under the snow.         
	If one disaster can do so much damage to the worlds second-largest economy, how will China face rising sea levels and climate change, asked one columnist. Another wondered whether the dependence on electricity-driven infrastructure was such a good thing, and also criticized the glittering lights in areas unaffected by the weather. But the president and the premier got full marks for spending the New Year with the victims.         
	The biggest media debate was on the complete absence of any intervention by Asias world city in the current crisis. Indeed, alighting from the mainland ferry at Hong Kong at the start of the Chinese new year holiday, was like escaping from a dungeon to a fairyland. The unconcern was evident everywhere, including in the media. All through the days that the Chinese media were flooding viewers with disaster coverage, Hong Kongs media were exploding with pictures of three of its top pop stars indulging in sex, pictures picked up from the internet.                 
	Uncaring attitude        
	It wasnt as if Hong Kong was untouched by the disaster across the border. Many of its residents were stuck in the mainland as flights and trains to Hong Kong were disrupted. Hong Kongers own many factories and restaurants in Guangdong. It was a human, political and economic story that went untold, except briefly in a few English papers. The irony is that the Hong Kong media are envied by mainland journalists for their freedom. Now they are asking: is this what freedom of the press means?         
	Many Chinese are furious that the international financial centre, probably Chinas wealthiest city, didnt move a finger to help, despite the privileges it enjoys as a specially administered region. Hong Kongers are very particular about being different from mainlanders. They fancy themselves as global citizens with little in common with the country bumpkins from the mainland, though they are quite willing to take advantage of the mainlands cheap labour and mainland exports, be they food or extravagant shoppers, who have boosted Hong Kongs economy.         
	This time, the difference became a yawning gulf as the global citizens, with the worlds NGOs represented in their island city, neither sent relief themselves nor mobilized agencies to do so. It wouldnt have cost much for Hong Kongers to send teams to Guangzhou railway station where lakhs of migrant workers were stranded in freezing weather; Guangzhou is only an hours bus or train ride away. Many of these stranded migrants literally had nowhere to go; the dormitories they normally live in had closed for the New Year. In a belated response, a Hong Kong business association asked members to reopen dormitories for their workers. Even then there was no consensus on the issue.         
	Counselling is still in its infancy in China. Yet, local authorities in Hangzhou sent 16 psychologists to talk to the stranded passengers. Hong Kongs help would have been much appreciated in Guangzhou, where hysteria claimed one life in a stampede.

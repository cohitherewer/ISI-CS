	Ill to the core                  
	Sir  It is a shame for civil society that a terminally-ill patient had to die without treatment on the pavement in front of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (Cancer patient denied hospital entry dies after spending night on pavement, Feb 29). Despite the best efforts by her son, the government-run hospital refused to admit her because she did not have a registration card. Perhaps Rajpati Devi would not have survived even with medical care, but she should at least have got life support. The authorities at CNCI may well plead that they were going by the rulebook. Had our state-run medical institutions been sticklers for rules, then rats would not gnaw at patients and medicines meant for the ailing would not be sold in the black market. Before referring a critically ill patient, the Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College and Hospital should have found out from CNCI whether treatment at that hour would be possible at all. This would have spared Rajpati Devis son all the running around, only to watch his mother die.           
	Private hospitals are no better in West Bengal, but at least patients who can afford the higher expenses can hope to find the basic amenities. The health sector in Bengal under Surjya Kanta Mishra is ailing. The health ministry will at best set up an enquiry commission to probe the circumstances of Rajpati Devis death. The findings will be vague, exonerating higher officials and finding fault with junior-level employees. But suspension or punishment of the erring doctor or official will not cure this social malaise. What is needed is a lesson in humanity.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  What was Rajpati Devis fault that she had to meet such a cruel end? It is time we asked ourselves who should be held responsible for her death. I think every Calcuttan should respond to this case of fatal negligence by the authorities with the same fervour that we saw after the death of Rizwanur Rahman.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Nothing great          
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, This god did not fail (Feb 29), reads more like an emotional, anti-American propaganda than an objective assessment of Fidel Castro and his regime in Cuba. What is Castros contribution to the rehabilitation of Cubas flagging economy? Assuming that Castros decades-long rule contributed to success in some fields of social welfare, does such a condition give automatic licence to perpetuate ones rule? Is not choosing his brother, Raul, as successor a manifestation of undemocratic, dynastic rule? Mitra says that Castros revolutionaries did away with the ethnic divide. Such a claim is inconsistent with world history, and the failure of communism in, say, the former Czech Republic. The real fusion of cultures can be found in the United States of America, where Latin Americans, native Africans, Chinese and Indians have come together in a melting-pot culture. One can only hope that Cuba will be able to retain its ethnic unity after Castro. Continuing with a form of governance that is breathing its last, instead of making way for democracy, is not the mark of a great leader.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra gives a lucid account of how Fidel Castros communist policies have succeeded in vanquishing the USs self-importance and shaking the superpower at its roots. But it would be wrong to claim that Castro has restored a degree of pride to Cubans just by ensuring harmony and solidarity, good healthcare, education and an equitable distribution of resources in society, because he has simultaneously failed to bring the nation onto a path of steady GDP growth. For a nation to match up to superpowers, what matters most is its economic prosperity along with increased non-manoeuvred competition in all fields. This is unlikely to be possible in an archaic communist regime like Cuba, which has a low income from exports of sugar, nickel and tobacco. Cuba should have taken lessons from China about how a change in tack can actually facilitate an economic boom. With virtually everything under the protection and control of the government, Cubans today can hardly boast of pride and self-esteem and of being on a par with the rest of the world.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting Shot          
	Sir  Why did Khushwant Singh have to give out the story of Alan Bennetts The Uncommon Reader (The queen who read too much, Mar 8)? Those who havent read the book will not thank him for this.                    
	Yours faithfully,

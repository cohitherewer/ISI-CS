The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Some transposed home truths
                                                                                                              SOME TRANSPOSED HOME TRUTHS                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	The double award of the Pulitzer Prize and Tony in 2001 for Proof catapulted its 31-year-old author, David Auburn, to Broadway fame, which also sealed its cinematization in 2005. Auburn employed the classic methods of domestic drama, based on few but strong characterizations and chiselled dialogue, occurring in a single-set family home. He proved that such conventional dramaturgy could still draw crowds in the 21st century if it revealed universal human truths.        
	That is why The Red Curtains The Proof (curiously adding a definite article to the title) could seamlessly transpose the source to a Calcutta setting and strike home. Here, the mathematician who loses his mental stability used to teach in Presidency College. He is cared for by his brilliant but unrecognized daughter, Sharmistha, who sacrificed her studies at the Indian Statistical Institute to look after him. We can instantly identify with the situation. His older daughter, Supriya, works in Mumbai, which, director Sumit Lai Roy observes rightly, represents the struggle todays young people have between the idea of leaving Calcutta and staying in the city they love. In this sense, too, the play holds up a mirror to the state of our city.        
	Then there is Katy Lai Roys meticulously detailed mise en scne rivalling the acclaimed John Lee Beattys realistic original, and reflecting the fading away of Calcuttas old houses: a shabby verandah stepping down to a garden with discarded furniture and dried-up potted plants (which should have changed for the flashbacks), the interiors upstage warmly lit behind glass-panelled doors by Naveen Kishore.         
	The performances are exceptional  real-life father and daughter Kabir and Niharika Seth take up the same roles theatrically for the first time, playing off genius against vulnerability. Sunayana Roy combines Supriyas self-absorption with protectiveness (or control) over Sharmi. And Dhruv Mookerji shows no trace of being thrown into the part of former student Anup with just ten days notice.        
	The one shortcoming is a certain stasis in the characters, which do not develop in the way a traditional drama demands. Supriya does not need to, since she enters in the present. But Sharmi goes through her fathers death, falling in love, and a possible change of abode in just eight days, plus flashbacks to four years before  the gap between ages 21 and 25, in any case, is quite eventful for a young woman. A method actor might have done wonders with this journey.         
	To a lesser extent, the same applies to Anup, whom we also see over an identical time-frame. Even the professor, appearing live only in two flashbacks, travels from lucidity to fogginess originally in six months, those scenes oddly telescoped here into six weeks. Otherwise, this is a very faithful adaptation.

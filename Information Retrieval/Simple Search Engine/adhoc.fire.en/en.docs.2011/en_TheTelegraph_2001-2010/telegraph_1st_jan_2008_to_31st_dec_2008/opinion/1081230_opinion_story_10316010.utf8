                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HEAL THE WOUNDS                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The results of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections are out, and the National Conference has emerged as the single largest party, followed closely by the Peoples Democratic Party. The Congress has won 17 seats and can form the government with the National Conference if the two agree to come together in a concerted effort to change the course of politics in Jammu and Kashmir. If the National Conference and the Congress form a coalition, Omar Abdullah and Rahul Gandhi  the two new-generation leaders with a commitment to bring radical change and development to the nation  could help India move ahead and discard the baggage of the past.        
	Farooq Abdullah has been categorical about the fact that he will lead the state into a new phase and ensure quick and substantial change. It is time we endorsed the challenge and stood by the out-of-the-box-thinking. The National Conference and the Congress, both parties with representation at the Centre, will not polarize politics in Jammu and in the Kashmir valley. The recent disaster, triggered by the governor of Jammu and Kashmir, S.K. Sinha, left a bad taste in the mouth and detracted us from the many efforts, undertaken over the last few years, to calm the volatile realities of the troubled state. Now there is an opportunity to restore peace and rebuild the confidence of the people.        
	The mandate is clear. The people of Jammu and Kashmir do not want Delhi to rule it. The presidents rule is unacceptable. The call of the separatists is also unacceptable. Enough is enough. It seems apparent that the people want their representatives to take the responsibility to deliver the goods and services. Elected leaders are going to be judged ruthlessly and they have to perform. The high turnout of people during the polls established the resolve of the Kashmiris to make their politicians accountable. This time, the people are demanding action and have said so loud and clear. Any of the leaders who does not deliver on the promises made will pay a heavy price.                
	Emotional moment        
	Autonomy is the single-most important issue, and it must be structured with utmost care and brought into play virtually immediately. If the government of India, sitting in Delhi and being advised by politicians out of touch with the fast changing realities and demands of an embittered people, does not address this fundamental problem, the state will enter a divisive situation, which may never ease again. Changing the course will require a dynamic, different approach by a fresh set of leaders who are motivated by the possibility of bringing peace and order to Jammu and Kashmir. It will be critical to move fast, and with a determined pace. It is an exciting risk that the Congress might take, considering that it has nothing to lose except some of its old, outdated leadership!        
	To bring back some normalcy into the towns and cities, the signs of the presence of the military and the paramilitary, such as barricades and the like, will need to be reduced drastically. The men in uniform will need to become increasingly invisible because they represent repression and the restriction of freedoms. Democracy  and this vote has been a triumph of the democratic process  is by definition a structure within which liberty, fraternity and equality thrive. Therefore, the first step will be to renew that faith, and the government of India will have to lead the way. The other critical steps required to heal the wounds will be implemented by the newly-elected state government, and by those leaders on whom the people have put their faith.        
	The victory of the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir has been an emotional moment in our recent history. Let us hope that the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh will not be let down this time round.

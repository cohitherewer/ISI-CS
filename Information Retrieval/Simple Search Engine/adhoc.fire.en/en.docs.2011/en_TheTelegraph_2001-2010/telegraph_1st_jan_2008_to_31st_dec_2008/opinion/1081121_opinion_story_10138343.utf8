                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             HEAD OVER HEELS                                                    
	Somersaults do not become dignified elder statesmen. But when L.K. Advani is outraged at the unpleasant techniques of pressure the police have been allegedly exerting on Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur after her arrest as a suspect in the Malegaon blast case, he has neatly turned heels over head. He wants the anti-terror squad changed, and a judicial probe as well, although he and his party had questioned the need for such a probe in the Jamia Nagar incident not so long ago. Such pious excitement ill becomes a prime ministerial aspirant, particularly when it is on behalf of a terror suspect who sports the saffron to which Mr Advani is loyal. Disinterested passion in defence of civil rights is welcome, but it is Mr Advanis disinterest that is sorely compromised. He was deputy prime minister when the Bharatiya Janata Party, heading the National Democratic Alliance, forged the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which gave the police the right to detain anyone suspected of links to terrorism for 180 days just for questioning, without filing charges in court.         
	No one was more vociferous in criticism than the BJP when the act was repealed later by the United Progressive Alliance. All anti-terror laws, including Pota, have been charged with discriminatory use, being directed chiefly against members of the minority community. As important is the fact that such laws work by ignoring the legal safeguards and rights the republic grants its citizens. Since the BJP and Mr Advani support Pota, they cannot now be critical of the alleged treatment meted out to Ms Singh Thakur. The state can have its own anti-terror laws, as Maharashtra does. Given that power, the police will use it to extract confessions, links, facts or whatever else they need. Mr Advanis confusion is twofold. He apparently always believed, with his party, that terrorism and the minority community are identical. And that there is nothing called Hindu terror. His association of terror with religion has not been shaken by the firm declaration of Muslim clerics all over India that terror is unacceptable in their religion. Also, it seems, he believed that laws against terror  presumably since they would be targeted only against non-Hindus  have nothing to do with rights. He may now have to revise his views about terrorism and religion, generally and specifically, and face the fact that any law that allows the violation of civil rights is dangerous, no matter who is arrested.

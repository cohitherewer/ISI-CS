	All work and no play                  
	Sir  Sunil Gavaskar has lauded M.S. Dhonis decision to opt out of the Sri Lankan tour because of fatigue (Its a brave decision, July 12). It seems that the wise men in the BCCI do not consider factors such as fatigue while planning their hectic tours. Dhonis move, however, will encourage players to drop out of tours on their own convenience. Perhaps its time for a rotation system for junior players as well. It will certainly help tired players devote more time to their commercial commitments.           
	Yours faithfully,         S.B. Gupta, Calcutta
        
	Dry as a bone          
	Sir  Large swathes of southern and western India are reportedly reeling under the shortage of rainfall (Rain shortfall worry in centre amp; south, July 18). Other parts of the country have also been suffering from an acute water shortage. Steps need to be taken to remedy the situation quickly. For instance, our cities can save a large amount of water by plugging leaks and controlling the output at different levels. Even households can help conserve water by ensuring that tap water is not wasted while doing domestic chores. There are regulators to control fan speed, but, unfortunately, no company has managed to produce such simple and effective means to control water taps yet. Some hotels and restaurants also use taps that start functioning automatically when our palms are placed underneath them. Although convenient, these taps waste water as the outflow cannot be controlled. Perhaps they need to be changed too, along with peoples attitude to water conservation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Marathwada, Gujarat and coastal Andhra Pradesh have been affected by scanty rainfall. Already, inflation rates are soaring and a weak monsoon is likely to compound problems in the agricultural sector, besides pushing up food prices further. Also the water crisis means that debt-ridden farmers would continue to suffer despite the loan waiver. The weather, political and otherwise, is likely to deepen the frowns of the government.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The water crisis looms not just in parts of India but in distant Palestine as well, albeit for different reasons. Scores of villages in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip apparently wait every day for the arrival of water tankers, which reach after passing through various Israeli checkpoints and military enclosures. The truth is that the situation is unlikely to change unless Israel recognizes and protects Palestines right to water. Till then, Palestinians will continue to feel the pinch of thirst.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It seems that we Indians have not learnt much from our long history of subjugation to foreign raiders and traders alike. In the past, India failed to repel attacks on its borders on account of internal squabbles. Post-Independence, however, we have managed to survive as a nation due to the commitment of our armed forces that have often suffered as a result of erroneous political decisions. Our political masters and bureaucrats have even refused to include any member from defence on board for the pay commission. The only way out is to lend the army a political voice. The government should form a defence personnel constituency, much like a graduate constituency for the serving and retired defence personnel. Surely this would be in the interest of both the nation and its securitymen.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

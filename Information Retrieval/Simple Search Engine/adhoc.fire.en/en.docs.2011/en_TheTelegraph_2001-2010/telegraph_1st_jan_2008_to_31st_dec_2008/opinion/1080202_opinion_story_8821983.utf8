                 Visual Arts - Soumitra Das
                         
	The works of Jeram Patel and Amitav Das, which were recently exhibited at Anant Art Gallery, stand at two opposite poles. While Patels works are monochromatic and stark, Das creates works that stimulate the imagination by conjuring up images of rich brocade and star-filled skies. Patels ink-on-paper works are deceptively simple-looking coils of black, often with hints of carmine, yellow and blue. It must have taken him years of practice to create these fluid and serpentine bands of the colour black, which are suggestive of great depths and calm, with a field of energy congealed within.
    
	Das uses a limited number of contrasting shades such as dove gray, yellow, viridian and sky blue against black or other dramatic tones. These colours are applied in mostly broad, vertical swathes, and worked over with threads of white paint creating the effect of intricate chikan embroidery or hieroglyph. One can detect in them figures of fauna or the anthropomorphic birds of Egyptian iconography, or even creatures from Rabindranaths doodles. The decorative element gets out of hand at times. However honourable Dass intentions, too much gloss cannot be glossed over.

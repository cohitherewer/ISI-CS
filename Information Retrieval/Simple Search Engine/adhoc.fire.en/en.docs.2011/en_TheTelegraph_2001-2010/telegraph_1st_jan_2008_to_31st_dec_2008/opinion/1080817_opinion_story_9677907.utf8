	Suffering in silence                  
	Sir  I would like to add a few more clauses to those mentioned by Khushwant Singh in defence of non-vegetarianism (They stoop to conquer, Aug 9). Vegetarians protest against the slaughter of animals for their meat. But plants are also living beings and, as such, they too must feel pain when they are plucked. Perhaps we find it easy to identify with creatures of flesh and blood and are unable to imagine the hurt felt by other forms of life. We are outraged by the chop of the butchers knife but not by the swing of the farmers sickle.           
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta
        
	Lights off          
	Sir In the recent past, Calcutta has been suffering from frequent bouts of load-shedding because of power shortage. The residents of Dum Dum Park are bearing the brunt of it, probably due to the low priority accorded to the area by the CESC. Strangely, certain adjacent pockets enjoy constant power supply even when Dum Dum Park remains in darkness. We had an extended power cut from 10.10 p.m on August 8 till 3.50 a.m on August 9. Power supply was intermittent throughout the morning and afternoon of August 9. However, at about 4.30 p.m, we had a pleasant surprise. A mobile power-generating van was brought in by the CESC and it provided us with uninterrupted power for the next two days. I am not an admirer of the CESC but I found the way it chose to act on this occasion quite admirable. Its gesture has set an example that ought to be followed by the corporation itself in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A.K. Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta

                
	Sir The CESCs indiscriminate power rationing, in and around Calcutta, calls for urgent intervention. As a public utility service provider, it has a very poor record of power distribution. Of late, it has been deliberately targeting certain areas of Calcutta in its attempts to make up for the daily shortfalls elsewhere in the city. Apart from power-cuts all through the day, the Selimpur area in Dhakuria has to undergo protracted spells of darkness from midnight to dawn regularly. The CESCs customer care centre for the locality is almost defunct. It cannot give any information whatsoever on power interruptions at odd hours. The same applies to its nearest distribution centre. We hear much talk about corporate ethics and social responsibility nowadays. If there is some truth in those professed ideals, then the CESC, as a corporate body, should arrange for a public disclosure of the duration for which it intends to keep power off in specific areas. As long-suffering victims of the CESCs vagaries, we expect at least this much transparency from the corporation. And if this is too much to ask, any sort of help from the authorities would be a breather for us.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ratnadeb Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir It is shameful that the CESC failed to ensure regular power supply even during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. There was no power in Regent Estate, where I live, on August 8 for over three and a half hours. This was followed by a fault that the CESC men took almost five hours to locate and rectify. Can the CESC be sued for failing to provide normal service? I wonder whether the chief minister is serious about Bengals industrialization because even a basic requirement such as reliable power cannot be assured by his government.           
	Living as I do in a middle-class locality, I would request The Telegraph to commission a comparative study of the monthly hours of load shedding happening in the richer localities and in disadvantaged areas such as ours. That would certainly reveal the CESCs bias.           
	Yours faithfully,

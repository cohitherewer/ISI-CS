	There has been a sudden and unusual spurt of media reports recalling events from Nazi Germany. A common feature of the reports is their surreal nature, which provides some comic relief in midst of all the gloom and doom.         
	It all started with the news of a wax statue of Adolf Hitler working at his desk that had been installed in a museum in Berlin. Soon afterwards, someone entered the museum and decapitated the figure. There is now a debate raging in Germany whether a new head needs to be cast and restored on the headless wax figure of Hitler or whether the museum should do away with the exhibit altogether. Even after so many years, memories of Hitler and his time are still painful for the Germans.        
	Moving on, very few people would have known that Hitler had gifted a 1936 Mercedes Benz to the ruling Rana of Nepal during World War II. This was apparently a reward for the ruling Ranas encouragement to the Nepali troops to fight on behalf of the Nazis. Whether anything came out of his exhortation is not known but the Rana did accept his gift.         
	The story of Hitlers gift was forgotten until last month, when Nepal abolished the royalty, and the king and his family had to vacate the Narayanhiti palace. The Narayanhiti Palace, from where the Ranas and kings of Nepal ruled for close to three hundred years, was to be converted into a museum. The prize exhibit was supposed to be the 1936 Mercedes Benz, except for the fact that it seems to have disappeared into thin air. The car was apparently last sighted in Darjeeling, where the descendants of the deposed Rana of Nepal reside. The saga of the vanishing Mercedes has yet to play itself out.              
	The third episode relates to a former Nazi who fled from Germany in the closing days of World War II and took refuge in Argentina. While fleeing, he took along with him a stolen Steinway piano, with the intention of selling it to a wealthy buyer in Argentina. Like several of his compatriots, he settled into a new life in Buenos Aires. While he could not find a buyer for his stolen piano, he married a local who could play the piano and helped make a living by teaching young students.         
	After several decades, the former Nazi from Argentina next appears in Goa last month, along with his piano but not his Argentinian wife. There, it seems, he finds himself one night on Calangute beach in an inebriated condition and in an animated conversation with a tourist couple. To them, he relates his lifes story and his role as a commandant of a concentration camp for Jews. He had no way of knowing that the couple he was regaling with his recollections were Israeli soldiers on an R amp;R trip to Goa. Naturally, the local police were alerted by the Israelis who, in turn, got in touch with their colleagues in the Intelligence Branch and they with their counterparts in Germany.              
	The media reports go on to state that as the Indian and German Intelligence folks were preparing to pounce on the ageing former Nazi, (by the way it was reported that the former Nazi was a fit 88-year-old), he got wind of it. Next, the reports claim that he hired a station wagon and mounted the Steinway on the luggage carrier and made a hasty escape towards Karnataka. The last that was heard of the bizarre episode was that the Intelligence sleuths gave the former Nazi a hot chase along the Goa-Karnataka highway.         
	When the escaping German realized that the game was up, he asked the taxi to stop and ran into the woods next to the highway, with the police in hot pursuit. Subsequently, the account gets somewhat blurred. It is not clear whether he was apprehended and deported to Germany or whether he was never found and lost his way in the thick jungles of Karnataka. It is also not clear as to whatever happened to the grand piano which he left on top of the taxi while trying to escape. His name turned out to be J.S. Bach. To top it all, the whole incident turned out to be a hoax.              
	Although memories of World War II are now part of history, nevertheless the quick succession of news items going back to those times turned out to be quite unusual. They provided a rare light relief at a time when readers are being bombarded with gruesome news of murder, mayhem and political skulduggery.

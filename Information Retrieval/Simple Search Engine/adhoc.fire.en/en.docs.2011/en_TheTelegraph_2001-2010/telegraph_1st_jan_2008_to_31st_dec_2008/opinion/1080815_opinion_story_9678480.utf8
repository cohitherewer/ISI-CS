The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The man who survived the bonfire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE MAN WHO SURVIVED THE BONFIRE                                                                  
	The Collector of Worlds By Iliya Troyanov, Faber, Rs 495        
	Alfred Tennyson summed up one of the most nagging paradoxes of the schizophrenic Victorian Age in the difference of temperament between his Ulysses and Telemachus. While the aged Ulysses looks upon experience as an arch wherethro/ Gleams that untravelld world whose margin fades/ For ever and for ever, his young son Telemachus remains centred in the sphere/ Of common duties. Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-90), British soldier, explorer, fencer, spy, polyglot, translator, ethnologist and writer could be considered a Ulysses incarnate, albeit sans the pomposity and smugness of the hero of Tennysons poem.         
	Posted to India in the service of the East India Company, Burton started his career as an officer in the lowest rank and then got himself expelled for writing a report on the homosexual brothels of Karachi that suggested that the writer had known the inmates in the Biblical sense. As his fellow countrymen in the most lucrative colony of the Empire either made inveterate villains of the natives or through soft degrees/ Subdue[d] them to the useful and the good, Burton sought to become one of them. And this he did primarily by learning their languages. So started a lifetime of shape-shifting in which Burtons main tool would be his command over the idiom of the other. He eventually mastered about 25 languages, besides numerous dialects.        
	While the details of Burtons life  his unquenchable thirst for explorations, of countries and bodies, interest in the religions and literature of the Orient and life-long addiction to opium  consist the stuff that legends are made of, the man himself remains an enigma. Iliya Troyanov makes it clear at the outset that he does not aim to write Burtons biography. His novel is intended as a personal approach to a mystery rather than as an attempt at definite revelation, he says. In effect, The Collector of Worlds is as much about Burton as about the people whose identities he tried to take on.        
	Troyanovs interest in Burton must be personal indeed for he has grown up and travelled among different cultures like the subject of his novel. The trajectory of his life has taken him from his birthplace in Bulgaria to Germany and then to Kenya, where he had his schooling. Like Burton, he was attracted to Islam, a fascination that resulted in a haj to Mecca, as Burton had done in mid 19th century. Troyanov has also traced Burtons footsteps across India and earlier in Tanzania. Not surprisingly then, the three sections of this novel are set in Baroda and Sindh in India, in Arabia and in East Africa. It begins where it ends  with Burtons death at his home in Trieste and with his wife starting off a bonfire of his diaries to destroy all evidence of his flamboyant past. The camel skin catches light... page numbers burn... Marathi, Gujarati, Sindi evaporate, leaving only scribbled letters that float up as sparks and sink as cinders.        
	This final erasure is significant, because what is being consigned to the flames are the writings of a man who meticulously took notes all through his travels because he considered it his duty to waken the country to a new, written life. Like the 18th century German explorer, Alexander von Humboldt, Burton was bringing undiscovered realms into being by documenting peoples, their lifestyles and beliefs. But having removed himself from the political project of the Empire, he could just collect the worlds without appropriating them. He desists from naming, unlike faithful subjects of the Empire like John Hanning Speke, who promptly gives a name, an English name, to everything he encounters on the expedition undertaken with Burton to ascertain the source of the Nile. Thanks to Speke, Nyanza becomes Lake Victoria overnight, apparently as a tribute to the empress but also because, by a happy chance, his mother had the same name as the queen of his country and so [he] could dedicate the lake he had discovered to his mother.        
	It is not difficult to discern the ways in which Troyanovs intentions in this novel coincide with those of Burton. Burtons obsession with disguises took on an almost metaphysical implication because what he was trying to conceal was the presumed difference between the rulers and the ruled. He refused to be the name-giver for much the same reason  because he acknowledged the prior existence of other tongues, and instead of ignoring or obliterating them, took a scholarly interest in them.         
	Taking the cue from Burton, Troyanov lets the subaltern speak in this novel. In the first section in India, the narrative alternates between the spoken voice of Naukaram  who acted as Burtons servant, bearer and procurer  and that of the omniscient narrator. The pattern is repeated in the following sections, with officials of the Ottoman Empire and Burtons fellow-pilgrims replacing Naukaram in the second and the redoubtable Sidi Mubarak Bombay in the third. The narrative trick allows the reader to witness the colonizer in the process of being constructed by the colonized in his parole. Other voices breaking into the narration of Naukaram or Bombay result in a multi-layered account in which the politics of representation is questioned repeatedly. In the sea of shifting perspectives, the slave dissolves in the master, the slayer in the lover, and the fiend in the creator. After completing his haj, Burton participates in the ritual stoning of the devil during which the pilgrims start pushing, shoving and pelting one another with stones. Everyone approached the Devil within in their fellow men they hit the Devil. Amidst the mad jostle, Burton recalls the lesson of the Advaita Vedanta taught by his Hindu guru, Upanishe  as long as we see our fellow men simply as other people, we will never stop hurting them. Seen from this perspective, the Devil was in the difference people created between each other.        
	The Victorians were wary of Burton because he had dared to think and look beyond the clichs of his times. Troyanovs evident admiration for Burton has produced a novel that, while dealing with some of the most hackneyed themes of postcolonial studies, rearranges them so skilfully as to make them almost new. Apart from a few purple patches, like the character of Burtons Indian lover, Kundalini, the dark and lissom ex-devdasi who, predictably, is skilled in the art of loving and is the imagined muse behind Burtons translation of the Kamasutra, the novel is quite remarkable. Since The Collector of Worlds is a translation of the German Der Weltensammler, it is difficult to know whether the occasional oddities are in keeping with the illiterate natives speech habits or if they have been introduced by the translator, William Hobson. Phrases like your warm-hearted and compassionate feelings hand or Leave it be can be baffling if they are not accepted as deliberate on the part of the author.

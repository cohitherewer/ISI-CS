	Even by Thai standards, this is unprecedented. A dozen or more coups detat since 1932 (when absolute monarchy was abolished) may have left little room for new surprises. But the judicial coup on Tuesday added another dimension to the fragile state machinery in Thailand. A constitutional court found the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, and 59 members of the ruling coalition guilty of fraud in the December 2007 elections, and banned them from politics for the next five years. The only palpable sign of relief, following this ruling, is the lifting of the eight-day blockade of Bangkoks main airports by anti-government protesters of the Peoples Alliance for Democracy. And high time it was for the boycott to end. As thousands of tourists were left stranded, the economy, which depends heavily on tourism and exports, plunged. But the economic crisis, compared to the on-going political uncertainty, is but a temporary distraction.         
	The sacking of the government has four possible outcomes, one as grim as the other. The first, and the most obvious, short-term effect is the formation of a caretaker government. The deputy prime minister, Chaowarat Chandeerakul, is expected to act as the head of this interim body for the next 30 days, until parliament convenes to pick up a new prime minister. By far, this looks like the most inconsequential aftermath, just a token filling up of the political vacuum. The second possibility implies a greater tokenism. If members of the outlawed, and now disbanded, People Power Party decide to pick up the pieces, then there may be a relapse of the political paralysis in Thailand. Exile and a trail of corruption charges have not so far dissuaded Thaksin Shinawatra from orchestrating the running of the nation through his brother-in-law, Mr Wongsawat. If the handful of legislators, spared by the court, re-groups as the Puea Thai party then the systemic change that PAD is rallying for would be reduced to wishful thinking. If, on the other hand, PAD takes over, then democracy would end in Thailand. Contrary to its name, PAD considers rule by the people as the root of all evil. The PPP has misused democracy all along to lure the rural and the urban poor with economic policies detrimental to the interests of the middle and the upper classes. Lastly, there is always the possibility of an army takeover. Given the fate of its western neighbour, Myanmar, under the military junta, this possibility is best averted.

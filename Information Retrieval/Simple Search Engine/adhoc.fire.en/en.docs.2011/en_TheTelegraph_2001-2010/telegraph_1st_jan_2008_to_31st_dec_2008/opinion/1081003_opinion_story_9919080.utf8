The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Agree to disagree
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             AGREE TO DISAGREE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The nuclear deal has been ratified by the American Senate that voted with an overwhelming mandate. India has thus moved away from its third world status, and will now be able to share and participate in the areas of technology and scientific expertise, in the realm of ideas and alternatives that had so long been confined to the wealthier countries of the world. India will now be in a position to use the changing methodologies that will make life far more livable for many in a shrinking world. Finally, we will now be in a position to assert ourselves in the debate over various issues that plague the world and even influence the process of decision-making if we choose to be proactive on the high table. Isolation is a thing of the past. This does not mean that we will have to abdicate our intellectual positions but that we will be able to argue and when necessary, agree to disagree. We are no longer on the list of failed nations.        
	Strangely, the opposition parties are threatening to raise black flags and take to the streets because the United Progressive Alliance government and Manmohan Singh, with his committed team, have been successful in crossing the tough hurdles that were placed in their path by internal spoilers, parties and organizations that are comfortable working in the closed system, with hardly any accountability or transparency. Exposure and aspiration for a better future will give a great boost to India and will help put the country in the place where it should have been decades ago. The Left is angry because it has been left behind! The Right is vitriolic and vocal because it was not in the seat of power when the deal and the recent opening up of a vibrant, energetic and intellectually dynamic India took place. Manmohan Singh has made an indelible impact on the subcontinent with this deal.                
	Another chance        
	Those who damn development by shouting hoarse that we have become a stooge of the United States of America have got the wrong end of the stick that they are using to beat the government. India has the resilience, the checks and balances of a joint economy, and the cultural tradition, values, mores and ethics to enable it to adjust with the changes that could affect our economy. We will be able to stem the decline and balance ourselves at a sane point on the scale. In some ways, the bubble of the apparent boom we saw over the last few years has been deflated and India will now settle and calm down. The ridiculous rise in land prices that created a social discord of huge magnitude with rural landowners selling off their lands for big bucks and then joining the ranks of the well-to-do unemployed, has created havoc in the social space.        
	India will not sink if the bail-out is rejected. America will. Looking at the international scene and at the US, a nation that till very recently was deemed to be invincible and dominating, it becomes clear that the country was mis-governed, had an arrogant and intellectually limited leadership, which was unable to recognize diversity. This had resulted in wrong invasions into other cultures that had only shown that the US was unable to comprehend more complex civilizations that may have been economically poor but are culturally rich. Today, America is a nation in decline, its political and economic policies having hit bad times with no immediate solution of any permanence on the horizon. In the process that will evolve through Americas new partnerships with other nations, the country may have to shift gear and reach out to emerging societies and to Europe and the middle East, to the rest of the world, for a clearer comprehension of our planet and for comradeship and future growth. The order has begun to shift and fresh realities will pose new challenges. Democracy, equality and fraternity may well have another chance!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ruling the Roost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RULING THE ROOST                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Sumanta Sen                              
	In a democratic society, all kinds of opinion, barring those against the nation itself, are supposed to be allowed to co-exist and contend with one another, not on the streets but in public platforms and through the media. However, in the worlds largest democracy this does not happen often  opposition is often physically dealt with. Just as in Darjeeling now. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has forced Subash Ghisingh of the Gorkha National Liberation Front to leave the hills and take shelter in Siliguri. Many of his supporters have also met with the same fate or are under threat to switch sides. Notices to quit have also been served to members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).        
	This is sheer lawlessness created by the Morcha. On the one hand, it claims that its movement for a separate state is peaceful, while on the other, it spreads panic. The Morcha was bent upon creating a situation in which only its writ will be followed in the hills, the state government will be reduced to a helpless observer, and people will be too scared to protest, so that it can then go and tell the Centre that since, for all practical purposes, it is running the hills, the creation of a new state is the only way out of the impasse.        
	Blackmail is the path chosen by the Morcha. It has hijacked the hills at gunpoint and is now asking for a ransom. The state government is clearly clueless as to what should be done. The minister for urban development, Asok Bhattacharya, keeps on issuing statements expressing hopes of finding a political solution but does not explain what exactly he and the government have in mind. A political solution implies accommodation. Is the state government then willing to grant more than the benefits granted by the Sixth Schedule to the hill people? Is it prepared to extend the proposed autonomy of the hill administration to adjoining areas in the Terai and the Dooars? Nobody knows.                 
	With folded hands        
	Meanwhile, sections of the state government already seem to have accepted that Bimal Gurung is the man in charge. What else can be concluded from the plea of the state tourism minister, Manab Mukherjee, that Gurung should ensure tourists are not inconvenienced during the coming season? The Morcha is not even a political party and yet the minister went to Gurung almost with folded hands. Mukherjee may call himself a pragmatist but behind his pragmatism lies acceptance of the Morcha and its specious demands. This was just the kind of acknowledgment of its position that the Morcha needed on the eve of the tripartite talks that are to be held between it, the state and the Centre on the Gorkhaland issue.        
	The governments problem is that the principal ruling party, or the Left Front as a whole, does not have a presence in the hills. The Marxists had long ago been driven out of their Bijonbari base and now all the hill leaders are in Siliguri. This makes talks of a political solution quite meaningless in Darjeeling as there is no political force to represent a counterpoint.         
	Meanwhile, the Morcha can rule the roost without any legal or even moral sanction to do so. It will keep on throwing out dissenters, encourage people to re-mark the number-plates on their cars as a gesture of defiance and may even force hotel-owners to issue receipts with Gorkhaland stamped on them. In the Eighties, firm handling of the issue by the then chief minister, along with a bit of diplomacy, had curbed Ghisingh. Since then no efforts have been made to win back lost areas of influence and nobody knew of the rumblings within the GNLF. Today the political battle is lost due to the arrogance of the ruling party. As a result, even a historically unjustifiable demand may triumph. And waiting in the wings are the protagonists of Kamtapur and Gjreater Cooch Behar.

	Comeback man                  
	Sir  Cricket lovers all over Bengal will welcome Jagmohan Dalmiyas resounding victory in the Cricket Association of Bengal election (King again, July 31). As a cricket administrator, Dalmiya has won accolades throughout the cricketing world. From an ordinary cricket player in Rajasthan cricket Club, he rose to become the chief of the International Cricket Council. As a sports administrator, Dalmiya is as skilled as the legendary Pankaj Gupta while his management skills are comparable to Russy Modis.          
	Dalmiyas return to the CAB was far from smooth. Sharad Pawar amp; Co. banned him from contesting elections on false charges. His one-time loyalist, Sourav Ganguly, too, switched horses and joined the opposition camp. All this however failed to stop Dalmiya from returning to his winning ways. Prasun Mukherjees many failures as the CAB boss must have also helped Dalmiya to recover lost ground. It is reassuring to see Dalmiya having the last laugh on Mukherjee. Thanks to Mukherjee, Bengal cricket today is in a shambles. The state team has been ousted from the elite Ranji group. Eden Gardens, once regarded as best cricket venue after Lords, is in a terrible shape.           
	During Dalmiyas previous tenure, various cricketers from the East  Sourav Ganguly, Debashish Mohanty, Deep Dasgupta and so on  had made it to the national side. With Mukherjee at the helm, no one save Ganguly has found a place in the Indian team, that too in the Test side only. Dalmiya thus has his work cut out. To start with, he must assign good coaches to train talented cricketers. Hopefully, Sharad Pawar and his gang will not interfere with Dalmiyas functioning in the CAB. Instead, they should come round and support Dalmiya in his second innings.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  As was expected, Jagmohan Dalmiya won the CAB election with a thumping majority. After his convincing showing  7 to 47 votes  it is now imperative that Dalmiya clears the air with the former skipper, Sourav Ganguly (Dalmiya ready to talk to Sourav, July 30). An astute administrator like Dalmiya will surely know that time wasted in mending his ties with an icon such as Ganguly is likely to impair Bengals cricketing fortunes further.          
	Prasun Mukherjee, the outgoing CAB president, deserves every bit of the condemnation that is now being thrust on him. His stint as the CAB president was below par in all respects and also included the embarrassing fiasco with lights during the IPL. Dalmiya will now have to put in a lot of hard work to correct the mistakes made by his predecessor.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Dalmiyas victory in the CAB elections heralds a return of sorts for this wily administrator. But will Dalmiya remain content with managing the affairs of Bengal cricket only? Unlikely. He will definitely try and recapture the BCCI hot seat at some point in the future. If Dalmiya succeeds in doing that, then he will be well on his way to reclaiming his former fief in the ICC.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Nakul Krishnan, Calcutta

                
	Sacrificial lamb          
	Sir  The Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee is a distinguished individual and quite an exception among his fellow politicians (Speaker not to step down, Aug 2) . Holding the exalted office of the speaker of the Lok Sabha, he did not even once let his conscience suffer. He opted to stand steadfast by constitutional guidelines while performing his duties. Chatterjee not only upheld the lofty ideals and traditions of our parliamentary system. His courageous decision not to quit as the speaker in the face of mounting pressure from his former comrades should be applauded. Chatterjee will be remembered as a guardian of democracy and a man of principles.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Hashim Kidwai, New Delhi 

                
	Sir  Had Somnath Chatterjee been a member of the Soviet communist party during Josef Stalins reign, he would have been executed for defying the partys diktat. Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), seems to be modelling himself on Stalin. Like a dictators, his writ runs large in the party, which is a part of Indias democratic political set up.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

                
	Sir  After he became the speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee should have given up his membership of the CPI(M). Then the question of his expulsion wouldnt have arisen. Also a whip by a party can never be applied to a sitting speaker. Therefore, it was strange to see Prakash Karat and his colleagues pressurizing Chatterjee to vote with the Left Front on the nuclear deal. Karats later decision to expel Chatterjee will cost his party dearly.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil Kumar Bhandari, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  The Left Front infighting has now come out in the open over the Somnath Chatterjee fiasco. Not everyone in the party rank and file is happy with Chatterjees ouster. Worse, in order to blindly oppose the US, the Left parties have decided to sacrifice Indias national interests. Hence they dont have the right to suggest that Indian Muslims should not vote for a deal with America, the supposed harbinger of all evil.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta

				       Out of syllabus      A PIL was filed questioning the government rsquo;s action of requisitioning teachers for election duties during teaching hours for months on end. The petition pointed out that the Delhi School Education Act requires the functioning of schools for at least 210 days a year mdash; a target that could not be achieved if teachers were continuously engaged in polling duties.

Teachers should not be requisitioned for election duties on teaching days and during school hours, the apex court ruled (Election commission of India vs St Mary rsquo;s School).

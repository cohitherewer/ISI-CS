The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blue cowboy among water nymphs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BLUE COWBOY AMONG WATER NYMPHS                              Visual Arts      Soumitra Das                                                
	Looking at Haku Shahs exhibition (Maanush, Aug 2-14), put up by Emami Chisel, one realizes the futility of making generalizations. For one would have thought that a man nurtured on Gandhian ideals, and who was born about 80 years ago in a village in Gujarat, would be too absorbed in the traditional arts and crafts to have much time for the Indian contemporary art movement, which was in a still nascent stage at the time of his birth.         
	But Haku Shahs work proves to be a perfect blend of tradition and modernism that seems to be as inspired by village crafts and our rich body of miniatures as by the Dionysiac aspects of the modern art movement in the West, as well as by the geometric discipline of Cubism. Quite a large number of his works, both big and small, was on display and it gave a fairly good idea of this versatile artists creative output.        
	There were large mural-type paintings on canvas, apart from the more intimate smaller paper works that gave an insight into the various facets of his creativity. Human figures dominate many of Haku Shahs canvases and he seemed to have in mind classical Indian sculpture with streamlined bodies and Modiglianis women with never-ending necks while creating them. Although they do have the asceticism of some of our giant sculptures, such as the figure of Gomateshwara at Sravanabelagola, they are not entirely devoid of sensuousness. He painted the sombre sadhu in saffron and seems to take equal delight in creating the water nymphs who are delighted to discover a drowning blue cowboy in their midst.        
	Since Haku Shah was so deeply involved in the making of folk art, dyeing and pottery, his art cannot be viewed in isolation from such local influences and practices. His holistic approach to art tells on his choice of colours  earth colours, saffron, indigo and parrot green  and on the forms. Traditional representations of the sun as a glowing life-giving orb are reflected in some of Haku Shahs visages.         
	In his more experimental works, he uses scraps of hand-made paper to produce papier coll, not unlike the manner of Picasso and Matisse. In Haku Shahs works, however, there can be no doubt about their country of origin  the undulating lines and the animal forms, often with a touch of sly humour, are very close to the nature we see around us. There are some with nervous lines like hair standing on end that stick out from the rest for they come dangerously close to personal expression, and this is something that Haku Shah seems to studiously avoid. But why cant a Gandhian be associated with erectile tissues? For even when he paints the blue god, he does it like any traditional artist who made it a point to efface the self. Haku Shah does use more simplified and modernized forms but they definitely draw inspiration from our Rajasthani and Kangra masterpieces. Few, if any, of those master artists can now be identified and Haku Shah seems to follow in their footsteps.        
	Although he avoids the overtly erotic, Haku Shah shows that he has a playful side to his personality. In his second painting, Suraj, the sun is a large sunflower with a woman straddled across it, her legs spread out in merriment. Haku Shah may have been chaste, but unlike Christ he wouldnt have said: Noli me tangere. Haku Shah is, after all, a Krishna devotee.

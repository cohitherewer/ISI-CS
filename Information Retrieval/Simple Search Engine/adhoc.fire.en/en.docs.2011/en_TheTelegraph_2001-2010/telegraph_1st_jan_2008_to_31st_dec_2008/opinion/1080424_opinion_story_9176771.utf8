	The jump in the wholesale price index from 5 to nearly 7.5 per cent came as a nasty shock to markets. True, the sudden jump was mostly due to an adjustment in the prices of certain articles in the 540-commodity WPI index after almost six months, even though prices of those commodities had been rising steadily. The size of the adjustment also cast doubts on the governments performance on inflation. What is also surprising is that people who watch the indices of commodities of their specific business interests  such as metals and minerals  did not see this coming even as global prices for these items have been sky-rocketing. It is unclear why the government waited so long before making the adjustment; the provision of timely economic data is essential to both its political and policy credibility. The Indian government states that it is worried about the sudden jump in inflation. But actions dictated by political imperatives and the words of policy-worry seem inconsistent. Just a look at some of the populist measures in this years budget is likely to raise inflationary expectations considerably. Add pay inflation  courtesy of the Sixth Pay Commission  and you get sustained price inflation.        
	It has long been held in some quarters that official estimates of inflation actually overstate the true level of inflation. They do not consistently take full account of the quality of improvements in what people buy, do not account for new goods like computers and mobile telephones  which also tend to fall in price  and do not recognize consumers switching to lower-priced goods. Estimates of the degree of overestimation vary, but range between one-half and 2 percentage points. But the only way this can be established in the Indian economy is through the availability of credible, timely data on prices. Policymakers  in India and in other economies  all aim and hope for minimal inflation. The German Bundesbank, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England and a number of other central banks all have explicit inflation target ranges, usually between zero and three percent. In fact, at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, letting inflation go above the legislated minimum can cost the governor his job. Today, the position of the government and the Reserve Bank of India is similar to that of the Western military alliance after the collapse of the Soviet Union: all that old equipment, and not knowing where or whom to point it at. They will have to find out soon  before the bullets start flying or rather when voters go to the polls.

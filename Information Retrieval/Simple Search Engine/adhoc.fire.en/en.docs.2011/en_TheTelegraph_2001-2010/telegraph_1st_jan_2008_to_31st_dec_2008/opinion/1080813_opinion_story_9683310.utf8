	According to statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau, rape is the fastest growing crime in India, with a woman being raped every 27 minutes. Also, the more recent cases, according to a recent Delhi-based survey, show a greater degree of violence during the rape. It is precisely these realities that the death sentence awarded to Jyotish Prasad and Ashish Kumar by a Delhi court addresses. Prasad and Kumar raped and murdered Dawn Emilie Griggs, more than four years ago in Delhi, with a degree of brutality that was exceptional and protracted. Griggs was a 59-year-old Australian national who had landed in Delhi, to be picked up immediately and brutalized by the men, who were driving the taxi she took from the airport. Even the most extreme of crimes are committed, and punished, within the context of a particular society (one hesitates to use the word, culture, here) and its attitudes. And rape is perhaps the crime that reveals most disturbingly not only a societys unthinking attitudes to women, men, sexuality, violence and power, but also the relationship between these attitudes and the values enshrined in this societys legal discourse.        
	It is significant that the severity of the punishment given to Prasad and Kumar is founded on the facts that their victim was old enough to be a motherly figure, that she was a foreigner and therefore a guest and hence to be regarded as god according to Indian tradition, and that her brutalization was a stigma on Indias reputation. In each case, Griggss personhood becomes a screen on which is projected a set of moral values that transforms this personhood into something other than the actual and irreducible site upon which the violence was inflicted. It is not an enviable task to have to determine, with a verifiable degree of legal precision, whether Prasad and Kumars crime would have been less culpable if their victim was younger than motherly, not a foreigner and a guest, and if Indias reputation for honouring mothers and guests were not at stake.

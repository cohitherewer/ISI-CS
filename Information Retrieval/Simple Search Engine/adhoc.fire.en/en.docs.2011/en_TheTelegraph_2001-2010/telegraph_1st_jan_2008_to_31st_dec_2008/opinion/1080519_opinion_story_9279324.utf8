	The prime minister called in steel barons on May 7, gave them tea and cashew nuts, apprised them of the danger posed to the economy by inflation, and appealed to them to join the government in combating it. Moved by his peroration, they came out and announced that they would reduce prices by Rs 2,000-4,000 a ton. Not to be left behind, the minister of industry called cement producers a week later and asked them to reduce prices. Dutifully, they promised to reduce prices by Rs 3-7.50 per bag of 50 kilograms.         
	These examples show how easy it is for the government to control inflation if it has the will. All that the ministers have to do is to study the details of the wholesale price index every week, call the producers of commodities whose prices have risen, and appeal to them in the name of the nation to roll back the price increases. Inspired by the ministers earnestness, the producers will immediately agree to reduce prices. Some misgivings are in order about this exhortatory style-inflationary policy. The pioneer of this style this year was Ram Vilas Paswan, the minister of steel. In February, he had called steel producers and tried out his persuasive skills on them; they promptly reduced prices by about Rs 1,000. In March, however, they increased prices by more.        
	That suggests that there is something more than a patriotic love-chorus to inflation control. Producers do not like the idea of telling a minister to try his art elsewhere, so they promise him a price reduction. But the reduction is far less than the price increases in the recent past, and may be reversed before long. It is like a housewife haggling with the shopkeeper. She asks him to reduce his price, and he does so every time. But for her, he has a special high price; so she ends up paying the same price as anyone else. Big producers raise their prices enough not to be affected if they have to reduce prices for ministers. Besides, this charade can be played out only with commodities, which are mainly produced at home by a handful of big producers. The ministers could not play it with oil products, for example. There, they do not have to play that game either. For most of the industry is owned by the government; all that Murli Deora has to do is to order the managing directors of oil companies to keep down prices. But he cannot order foreign oil suppliers. So what he achieves is to take away the profits of government oil companies and hand them over to consumers. Immediately, it reduces the companies ability to buy oil concessions and invest; in the long run, it may turn them sick. But that is none of this governments concern; it only looks as far as the next election.

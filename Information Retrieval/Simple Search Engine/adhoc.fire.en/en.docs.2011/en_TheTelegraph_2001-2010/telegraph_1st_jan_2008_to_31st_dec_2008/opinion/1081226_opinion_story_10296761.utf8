Naipaul: warts and all      
	Every December, review pages of newspapers list the best books of the year in different categories as part of the general year end round-ups. Most newspapers and journals tend to be quite exhaustive in this regard, even if it is to remind you of what you have missed.        
	This raises some questions. Do the lists this year reflect changing trends in the choice of published books? Is the list decided on the basis of the number of copies sold? Or, are the old-fashioned criteria of language, style and subject matter still relevant? Have books, like many newspapers and journals, become a sub-division of the entertainment industry?         
	If you look at the best books of the year, you will find that they are divided into two main categories. One is fiction, which includes just about everything including poetry and drama, and the other is non-fiction, divided into several sub-categories like politics and current affairs, economics, business, history, biography, and so on. If you put the lot together, one simple fact stands out: publishers are no longer interested in the big questions  they want stuff that is of immediate interest.        
	There has been a demand this year for books, for instance, on the economic meltdown. Naomi Kleins The Shock Doctrine or Michael Lewiss Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity would score over yet another Keynesian analysis of whats gone wrong with the global financial system.         
	So too with the books on Islam. Most are primers that deal with Islamic terror outfits, like Gilles Kepels The War for Muslim Minds. Unlike Bernard Lewiss What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response or Ahmed Rashids Jihad: The Rise of Militant Islam in Central Asia that went into the root causes of Islamic alienation, the recent crop of books on Islam are little more than reportage on current happenings.         
	What is clear is that publishers now keep away from what they describe as the heavy industry of the mind; they want books for the intelligent common reader of which at least 2,000 copies can be sold within a year of publication. Hence the stress on contemporary affairs.         
	It is to fiction and memoirs that many publishers turn to for quick returns. Both have changed now. Fiction has now turned into faction, an artful mix of fact and fiction. Read them to get information and to be entertained at the same time. Amitav Ghoshs Sea of Poppies, set in the India of 1838 with the opium trade as its backdrop, takes the lead this year. Memoirs must speak about interesting lives, not the lives of the rich and famous where nothing goes wrong. Patrick Frenchs The World is What it is: The Authorized Biography of V.S. Naipaul is the best example of how good biographies should be  depicting lives with warts and all.         
	Success is what counts, and it comes from producing entertainment in a form that best suits the need of the hour.       RAVI VYAS

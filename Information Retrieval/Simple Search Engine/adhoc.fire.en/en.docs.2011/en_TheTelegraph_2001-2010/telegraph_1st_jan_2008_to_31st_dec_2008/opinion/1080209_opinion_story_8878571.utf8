                                                                                                              THE DAY OF THE PEOPLE                                  This above all -   Khushwant Singh                          For the people                                        
	Once again, as in years past, I watched the Republic Day parade down Rajpath and the Beating of Retreat on Vijay Chowk on TV. I love watching smartly dressed men and women marching in step, swinging their arms, with bands playing martial music. And once again, I wondered if this extravaganza of military prowess and bands playing was worth the money and time spent on it. For many days before the march past, rehearsals impede the smooth flow of traffic. Rajpath cuts New Delhi in two: one has to take long detours to get from one side to the other. Many crores are spent to get men, women and children from distant parts of the country for a two-hour display of their regional dances and music as they go down Raisina Hill down Rajpath, India Gate, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg to the Red Fort. The Beating of Retreat is a more compact ceremonial. Nevertheless, it also disrupts the normal flow of traffic around Vijay Chowk for many hours. Must we continue indulging in this extravagant exercise year after year?        
	After weighing the pros and cons, my answer is in the affirmative. No matter what it costs in terms of money and inconvenience to Delhis citizens, it is worth every bit of it, because it has become the most potent factor in national bonding. The spectacle brings Indians of different races, religions and languages together on one stage. Millions of people watch it on their TV sets. I can vouch for this with the simple observation that on the morning of January 26, the blocks of flats, and the green spaces in between, which normally hum with life, are totally bereft of activity of any kind  everyone remains indoors, watching the parade, glued to what is contemptuously described as the idiot box.        
	For a long time our notion of nationhood was confined to the consciousness of our frontiers. Whenever our neighbours encroached on them, we put aside our internal differences and confronted these encroachers as one people. That is not good enough in times of peace: we have to cultivate a sense of oneness overriding our differences of castes, creeds, religions and the languages we speak. Our celebrating gantantra divas together is perhaps the most important factor in making us feel that we are Indians.                 
	Pseuds Corner                
	The title is taken from Private Eye, the British fortnightly journal and the principal debunker of pretentious humbug from different parts of the world, but mainly Great Britain. Excerpts from Indian journals often appear in Pseuds Corner. After all, ours is the land of sages, rishis, munis, all of them spend years in deep meditation (tapasya) in Himalayan caves searching for the Truth (whatever it means) till they get Enlightenment (whatever that means), then descend on the plains to preach to the world as jagatgurus (world teachers). Most of it is about the atma (soul) and the cosmic forces, which go under the heading Spiritual  nothing to do with ghosts or alcohol, but refers to other-wordly pursuits. We are left baffled by the plethora of words we are unable to comprehend. Among the living sages for whom I have some affection but little comprehension of her message to the world is Kapila Vatsyayan, internationally acclaimed for her inter-disciplinary research of fundamental importance, and author of over a dozen books. Her writings are considered as invaluable milestones. She was secretary, Department of Arts, member of the executive board of Unesco, chairperson of the India International Centre, and is currently member of the Rajya Sabha. She could be described as the Tsarina of Indian Culture. I once attended a meeting where she was the principal speaker. I could not understand a word of what she said in her high-pitched rhetoric. I repeated words I recalled to my friends. None of them was able to decipher their meaning.         
	The latest example of her learning is from Aesthetics and the World View. I quote the opening lines: Aesthetics evolves from a world view which regards the cosmic process as a dance of microcosm and the microcosm, a rhythmic interplay of eternity and flux in an unending movement of involution, evolution and devolution. Man on earth is one amongst all living matter, is inter- related to nature, responding to and not conquering it. And so on.         
	Will anyone please explain to me what this scholarly lady is trying to say?                
	No more red faces                
	When it comes to humour, you have to give it to the Brits. That is one reason I look forward to my fortnightly copy of Private Eye. It mocks everyone and everything: royalty, religion, prime ministers, politicians, dukes, duchesses down to taxi drivers. In its last issue it has a whole page devoted to new inventions of its own imagination, yet to be manufactured. This one, which I found amusing, is called Suppositions, designed specially for people who suffer from flatulence. It promises no more red faces from escaped wind. It goes on further: this miniature device [is] activated by release of internal gas and emits a convincing mobile ring tone  which both covers up any unwarranted noise and gives you an excuse to leave business meeting or dinner party or during service to take a call.         
	The tiny gadget, Supposition, offers a choice between a telephone ring and a Strauss Waltz, batteries extra. Price 35.

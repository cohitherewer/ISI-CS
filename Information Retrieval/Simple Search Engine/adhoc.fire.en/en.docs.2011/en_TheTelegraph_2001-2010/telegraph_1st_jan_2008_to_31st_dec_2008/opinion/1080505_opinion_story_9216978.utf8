	India has not worried about inflation for over a decade, only about growth. We reached a stage when policymakers could blithely talk about an acceptable level of inflation that would enable growth. Only a month ago, the finance minister was trying to talk down interest rates, implying that he was not worried that this could have inflationary consequences. Indeed, the State Bank of India and some other nationalized banks at the same time, brought down interest rates by 50 basis points.         
	Crude oil prices were the great worry. Thanks to communist intransigence, their increases were not passed on through increases in consumer prices. Instead, the finance minister repaid the subsidy incurred by the oil companies with oil bonds on which the government paid interest to oil companies. They could, if they wanted, borrow on the bonds. For two years, these subsidies were not counted in the fiscal deficit so that the finance minister could claim reductions in deficit. However, the interest costs did add to government deficits. Since the oil bonds could be monetized, the oil companies could spend the borrowings. Crude oil price increases were not reflected in fuel purchased by users. The finance ministers sleight of hand kept the deficit down, oil companies paid more for crude, but it did not increase user prices for fuels, oil companies had the money to spend borrowed against the bonds. To claim that these oil bonds were not adding to expenditures was incorrect. They were doing that. Since higher crude prices were paid but not charged to users, they added to money supply and had inflationary potential. Inflation in India was caused by this and other massive government expenditures, not supply shortages.               
	Government expenditures in the last three years on infrastructure and on social services rose sharply, especially on employment, health and education. While tax revenues were buoyant, absolute levels of deficits were also much higher. It might have been wiser to lower the taxes on oil products from the outset instead of keeping consumer prices untouched. The finance ministry was for long adamant against doing this.         
	Massive government social and infrastructure expenditures might not have been inflationary if the expenditures had created equivalent assets. They did not. All evaluations of government programmes suggest a high degree of leakage and wastage. Thus the money spent did not create equivalent value. When more money produces less value, prices are under pressure to go up.         
	In India, since the 21st century began, consumer expenditures on housing, durable consumer products, even holidays, travel and others have been important drivers of growth. Thus private expenditures were also being financed by borrowings. We created an economy that, as in developed countries, was increasingly built on debt. In macroeconomic terms this debt was financed by a rising current account deficit, our imports and invisible receipts were more than we earned from exports. While by no means comparable to American squandering, we were also increasing consumption using overseas funds.         
	All these expenditures stimulated economic growth. For three years we talked of approaching Chinas levels of growth. But Chinese growth levels were built on growing export and current account surpluses, with substantial foreign investments in building productive assets in the economy. India was the opposite. Our foreign fund inflows were coming in as remittances, debt and as volatile investments in stock markets. Even foreign direct investment was more in services, especially financial ones, not in creating new productive capacities. They were helped by a generous policy framework that allowed anonymous inflows (through participatory notes) and gave exemption from short-term capital gains tax (to investments from Mauritius ) that created a huge volatility in stock prices. Mauritius has become the largest source of foreign investments in India. Even Indian money is believed to enter from there under secretive labels. So does a lot of other money from a variety of foreign financial institutions and other investors.         
	Meanwhile, agriculture, on which over 60 per cent of the population depends, was receiving short shrift from governments. The rate of growth of investment in agriculture has been declining since 1990-91. So has productivity of most crops, to levels far lower than in similar countries like China. While there is some change in diets, as consumption of vegetables, eggs, and so on went up, the dependence on rice, wheat, pulses, and so on was also rising. The permission to export rice and wheat also meant that their prices rose as international prices reached high levels. The inability of Indian governments to deliver subsidized rations to many poor people entitled to them meant that as domestic prices rose, the poor were unable to get affordable food.         
	Further, the subterfuge used by governments of measuring inflation by the wholesale price index meant that the real burden of rise in prices of consumer goods (both agricultural and manufactured) was not being highlighted. India badly needs a better measure of inflation as it affects the consumer, and separately as it affects the producer.         
	Thus we have blindly stumbled into an inflationary situation from which we will find it difficult to escape. This is because of the many subsidies that governments have allowed. They have postponed the day when consumer prices must reflect costs  on food products, power, fuels, and fertilizers. Interest rates also rose as the Reserve Bank of India sought to moderate inflationary tendencies, with little help from the government. Rising interest rates have squeezed corporate profit margins as well as consumer borrowings and raised prices of industrial products. We must expect a blow-out soon, as consumers find they are unable to repay loans on housing, credit cards and so on. The poor farmer, who borrowed to buy fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, pump sets, found he was unable to repay because much of the inputs were counterfeit, and could not give the necessary yields. His selling prices were restricted by governments keen to hold down prices for industrial and urban workers. Little agricultural innovation is reaching the farmer. His pump sets are of little use as water tables have dropped because of overdrawing over the years, little recharging of wells, no licensing or monitoring of water drawn, and growing water salinity as farmers grow crops on land unsuited for them. The plight of the poor small farmer depending on shallow wells is even worse, since these wells run out of water that has been drawn out by electrically operated bore wells. Subsidized electricity allows over-use of power to draw water.               
	Of course, some inflation is caused by rising crude prices and rising commodity prices. Some of it is due to changes in diets as people grow prosperous and consume more rice and wheat. But a good part of it is of our own making. Governments have for years neglected the real economy and encouraged the financial economy. They have shown huge growth in foreign exchange reserves and in stock prices, not in agricultural production and little in industrial production. They have done little to protect the weak and vulnerable. Inflation will hurt the poor the most. Industry will get away with higher prices. Margins might erode because of higher interest rates, and volumes might decline a little. But not many industries will go bust, unlike the poor who have no support systems.         
	Will inflation affect growth? Since low price levels were not the cause of growth, inflation also might have little effect. Savings might get hit a little, repayments of loans might suffer, banks might have higher non-performing assets for a while, but India will continue to show higher growth than much of the world. Overseas fund inflows will continue and this will help industry. The urban middle classes will not lose jobs. Their purchasing power might be somewhat affected but not enough to bring down growth. The American recession might actually increase outsourcing to India and help industry and services.         
	We must radically change our priorities for agriculture and the capability of our creaking administration to spend public money honestly and efficiently. There is no sign that much is being done about these. We will therefore see a declining Bharat and a buoyant India .

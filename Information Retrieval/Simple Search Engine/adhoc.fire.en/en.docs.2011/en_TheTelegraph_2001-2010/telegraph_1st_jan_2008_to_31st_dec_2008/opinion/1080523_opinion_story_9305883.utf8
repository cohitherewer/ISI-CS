The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When terror strikes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHEN TERROR STRIKES                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	There has been a near-hysterical outcry from the Bharatiya Janata Party for the reintroduction of the faulty Prevention of Terrorism Act that was withdrawn some years ago because of the possibility of its misuse against innocent people based on political and administrative conjecture. In a country where the enforcement of laws, even ordinary civil laws, is subject to scrutiny, given the reality of the corruption that has infiltrated every nook and corner of the administration, it is dangerous to put deadly, non-negotiable acts in the hands of untrained persons. We all know well that the bureaucracy has ceased to be non-partisan, despite loud protestations to the contrary from that reserved community. Citizens are adversely affected each day by the misuse of power for self-serving interests on the part of the political dispensation. There has been a systemic breakdown.        
	The plethora of laws that exist could well be administered to ensure justice. Adding more laws to a malfunctioning system will, be no means, alter the mess that civil society finds itself in. It would be far more gratifying and heroic if chief ministers, prime ministers and suchlike would clean up their own stables, fire officers with known records of corrupt practice, make them fully accountable, compel the oath of office and enforce the existing laws. This happens to be the most crucial challenge that faces politicians of all hues. Unfortunately, there is not one politician on the horizon who is committed to the overhaul.        
	It is easy to blame other agencies, parties, and institutions for the failure of the administration. In my parlance, it is merely the passing-of-the-buck, the attempt to relieve oneself of all responsibility. Surely, if structural reform is imperative in a changing scenario, the chief ministers of all the states need to have a closeddoor session till they have thrashed out the new set of parameters within which our democracy is to function. There is no point in adjourning every dialogue and debate, disagreement and discussion. Neither is there any point in raising accusing fingers and baying for blood on the basis of subjective hunches and conjectures.                 
	Inhuman reality        
	Rajasthan is demanding the right of use of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act that was instituted to deal with criminal operations in Maharashtra. There is no organized crime in Rajasthan. Why should then Rajasthan demand this act? From the citizens viewpoint, Pota and MCOCA are not about preventing terrorist attacks. The existence of these acts may, on the contrary, encourage defiance of the law by criminals. Bad political judgement, governments in denial, partisan politics within a democratic framework and a refusal to indulge in serious national discourse have all led to the creation of the anarchy we live in.        
	Terrorism finds such flabby spaces easily accessible ports of call, enters them with confidence, disrupts peace and then remains quiet for some time to allow the immediate hysteria to fade as human resilience takes over, fights back and gets on with life, however dismal it may be. Terrorism then breaks the calm somewhere else. The carriers of this malaise belong nowhere and they are ready to die with those whom they kill. Pota will neither act as a deterrent nor as a deadly tool that will scare them away. Solutions lie elsewhere and that is why it is imperative for representatives from all political parties to work together and create a system to ensure the safety of our cities, towns and villages.         
	Who cares to prevent the terrorism practised by the upper castes on our less privileged citizens across the sub-continent? We have allowed that assault to continue for decades. Why do our leaders not see what inhuman reality has escalated into and enforce the law of this land?

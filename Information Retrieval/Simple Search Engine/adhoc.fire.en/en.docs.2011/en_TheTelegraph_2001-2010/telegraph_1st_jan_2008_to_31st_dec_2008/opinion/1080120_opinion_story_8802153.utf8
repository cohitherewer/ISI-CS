	 Has anyone bothered to look up Bhairon Singh Shekhawat ever since he vacated the vice-presidential bungalow for Hamid Ansari? So what if hes a senior citizen, so is LK Advani, and he never has any dearth of cameras around him. Advaniji doesnt seem to have a suitable post in the BJP for Shekhawat either. The former VPs supporters were trying to get him into the NDA convenors chair, but then it transpired that only a non-BJP NDA ally can put its candidate on the seat. Why the dedicated lot did not quickly form a little NDA-ally party and secure the chair for their leader may never be fathomed, but let it be known that the poor old man did not get any party leaders support for his cause. Except the charming lady from Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje Scindia. Who but a princess would have such a heart of gold? And guess what the vicious minds have cooked up from this? That Raje, the Rajasthan CM, wants Shekhawat out of the state in an election year!
        
	 Buddhists of Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir are having trouble making matrimonial choices. In a letter to the chief minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the president of the Ladakh Buddhist Association, Sonam Dewa, has said that the Buddhist population bordering Tibet is dwindling, while Muslims and Hindus are growing in number. Buddhists, the law-abiding people that they are, have faithfully followed the governments family-planning advice where Muslims have not. According to Buddhist leader Thupstan Chewang, polyandry, the earlier practice in some areas of the region, had to give way to monogamy, bringing down birth rates drastically. A family now has two or three children, as opposed to the 10 or 13 that a polyandrous marriage would result in. Is there a middle path to this problem? 
              
	 The growing power of Mayavati in Uttar Pradesh has made both the Samajwadi Party and the Congress lose sleep. Ideally, the two insomniacs should come together and strategize, but 10 Janpath is not happy with certain Samajwadi elements. So each must deal with the lady in its own way. The Samajwadi chief clearly prefers state-wide agitations and clandestine meetings with Mayavatis MLAs. For the Congress, thwarting Behenjis demand for SPG cover sounds like a good idea  the ground being that it is too much trouble to change a law (only PMs, ex-PMs and their families can have SPG protection) to make her feel safe. Besides, how does she expect to protect her people if she cannot protect herself?
              
	 Maneka Gandhi has made up her mind. More or less. She wants to vacate the Pilibhit Lok Sabha constituency for her son, Feroze Varun. Many have found in this piece of news echoes of Sonia Gandhis gesture of letting son Rahul contest the safe Amethi seat, while she moved over to Rae Barelli. Of course, Manekas supporters have little regard for such useless comparisons. They would rather people saw this as an example of how the Gandhis think alike.
              
	 Talking of Rahul Gandhi, there is nothing terribly Gandhian (not as in family, but as in Father of the Nation) about his sudden obsession with his Blackberry (as in mobile phone, not kala jamun). He seems always to be doing something or the other with his phone. Does he send messages? Is it a game that he plays? Party members and scribes are equally baffled. Lately, someone has spied a smooth coat Jack Russell terrier on his Blackberry screen, and concluded that the young Congress gen-sec takes a peek at the adorable canine every now and then. Now theres something that should please auntie Maneka.
              
	 If there were a list of people really close to 10 Janpath, then Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi would feature high on it. But the two babus from Bengal are not all that chummy with each other. Or maybe the present tense should be changed to past. There is no mistaking the bonhomie between the two these days. They are frequently spotted talking to each other in halls and corridors, and Das Munshi has become a frequent visitor to Pranabdas office in South Block. On one occasion, he even woke up the senior leader from his afternoon nap  only those who know about the Bengalis love for siesta will understand the importance of this  to discuss matters of party strategy. And with Mukherjee agreeing to pass on the baton of West Bengal Pradesh Congress to Das Munshi, the friendship can be considered sealed. At last.
  
	Footnote
   
	 Rajiv Shukla will not be assistant to someone whose shorts-clad boyhood he has witnessed. Rumour has it that Shuklas principal grouse against being attached to Ajay Maken, one of the AICC general secretaries, is that the latter used to roam around in shorts when Shukla travelled with Rajiv Gandhi. But Shukla has company. Several gen-secs have expressed their displeasure at having secretaries attached to them without consulting them. These secretaries are either too junior or simply not suited to the nature of the work assigned to them. K Suresh, for instance, has been attached with the gen-sec in charge of Delhi, but he knows not a word of Hindi. Rahul Gandhi is yet to get a secretary, while Margaret Alva, with the responsibility of three states, needs more than one. Five secretaries, though, are still without work. And who must face the flak for the shoddy allocations? None other than the gen-sec (organization), Janardan Dwivedi. Oh no, not again!

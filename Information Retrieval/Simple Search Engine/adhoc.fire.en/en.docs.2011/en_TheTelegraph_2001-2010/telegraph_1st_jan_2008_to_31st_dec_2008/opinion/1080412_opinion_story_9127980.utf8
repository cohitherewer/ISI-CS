	Padatik Dance Centre presented Kathak Marathon, a day-long Kathak recital at Gyan Manch on March 30. The programme was divided into three parts  one each in the morning, afternoon and evening  and offered an opportunity for the students of the institution to present their talents and their knowledge of the idiom. Theirs was an encouraging performance. The live accompaniment, especially the spontaneous performance of the tabla artiste, made the show interesting and enjoyable.         
	Featuring 25 dancers, the Kathak Marathon offered various taals and short abhinaya pieces within a well-managed time frame. Tanmayee Chakraborty was a picture of confidence during her presentation based on teentaal. However, Chakrabortys verbal skills are in need of improvement. Luna Poddar, a brilliant dancer, explored the finer nuances of taal dhamar gracefully. Poulami Das, Arunima Sengupta, Sucharita Dutta, Sohini Ganguly and Indira Tripathy were impressive. The other performers  Ashimbandhu Bhattacharya, Madhumita Roy, Soma Sen and Mitul SenGupta  proved their mettle too. Debasish Sarkar and Anand Gupta (vocals), Gopal Mishra, Dinanath Mishra, Utpal Ghosal, Biswajit Pal, Rakesh Mishra (tabla) and others provided able support.

	Two Indias in one frame        
	The French photographer, Johann Rousselot, set out to discover India on his Royal Enfield and had a revelation. He came to know that there are two Indias, and that while one shines, the other cries. He captured his exceptional vision in a series of photographs titled India shining, India crying: A tale of contemporary India (Bose Pacia, until April 19). The usual obscene zeal of foreign tourists for the Asian elephant called India is evident in each frame. A tribal girl in a tattered frock squints at the lens with reddened eyes. A cotton-mill worker, garlanded with marigold, lies ready for his last journey, his sunken face smeared with pink abir. All this is for India crying. For India shining, we have giggling girls with cell phones against the backdrop of swanky condominiums as well as a uniformed chowkidar, theatrically barring the gate of an apartment. The loud colours of the photographs add to the luridness.

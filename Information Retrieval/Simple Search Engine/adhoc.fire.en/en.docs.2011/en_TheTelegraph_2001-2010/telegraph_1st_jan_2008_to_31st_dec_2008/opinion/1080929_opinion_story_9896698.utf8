	The show goes on                  
	Sir  It is obvious that Shivraj Patil will never be ousted from the Union home ministry (Pilloried, Patil hangs on, Sept 16). The Congress has traditionally protected the devotees of the Gandhi clan at any cost, and Patil is a front-ranking devotee. Also, if he were fired, the incompetence of others would be exposed. Following the Volcker episode, Manmohan Singh had claimed that he could testify to Natwar Singhs innocence. Later, on Sonia Gandhis command, Natwar Singh had to be sacked. For the termination of Patils ministerial authority too, we will have to await Madams order.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Pramod Gupta, Delhi

                
	Sir  Even if Shivraj Patil were to be relinquished of his post as home minister  which is least likely to happen owing to his close ties with Indias First Family  he would still have enough resources to have himself clothed in expensive garments. But the families of many who died in the blasts have lost their breadwinners. It is unfortunate that Patil is being allowed to continue in office.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

                
	Sir  Terror strikes have become a regular affair in India. The national security advisor, M.K. Narayanan, has admitted that India lacks a proper intelligence network to prevent such devastating attacks. Such a confession from a top-ranking official is likely to boost the morale of militants. Needless to say, the governments reluctance to hang Afzal Guru, the mastermind behind the Parliament attack, or reintroduce Pota has made things worse. Shivraj Patils inane comments and empty promises after each blast are in bad taste as well. What is expected from Patil is proactiveness, and not shallow sympathy. Politicians are provided maximum security and are hence indifferent to the safety of common people. They are as responsible as the terrorists for bringing the nation to the brink of disaster.          
	Yours faithfully,       
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  The medias scathing attack on Shivraj Patils frequent change of clothes was uncalled for. Patils performance as the home minister has been rather poor, but citing his sartorial preferences as a cause for his failure simply dilutes the gravity of the matter. It is unlikely that if Patil stops changing his clothes, terrorism will vanish from the country. It will also be wrong to blame Patil alone for the deteriorating standards of safety. Swapan Dasgupta, in A dandy in action (Sept 19), is thus right in saying that the entire administrative system and all the political parties are responsible for this collapse of internal security. The laxity of our ministers may have aggravated the situation, but the media too must learn to stop criticizing their personal tastes and focus on the real issue instead.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The increase in terror attacks will cost the Congress dear in the forthcoming general elections. Several politicians supporting the United Progressive Alliance government are sympathetic to the Students Islamic Movement of India  Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mulayam Singh Yadav. But none can beat our home ministers contributions to this noble cause. His inept handling of the terror threat will only strengthen the Bharatiya Janata Party charge that the government is soft on terror. Why is Patil still being retained as home minister despite his success in digging the Congress its grave?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Madhur Mohanty, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  After the blasts in the capital in the course of a fortnight, Shivraj Patil has lost his right to remain Indias home minister. His incapability to root out terror has resulted in death and suffering across the country. It is shameful that the Congress is still protecting this incompetent man.           
	Patils survival as the home minister can only be explained by two things: his loyalty towards 10 Janpath and his political skills that had once procured him a presidential nomination. It is shocking to see the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, maintain a silence on the fervent demands to dismiss Patil. The peoples faith in the government has been shaken, and India is all set to lose face on the international stage for being unable to contain militancy.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Shivraj Patil, Union home minister, has kept his chair, thanks to Sonia Gandhis benevolence. The home ministry is supposedly only second in importance to the prime ministers office. However Patils showing as the home minister has been way below the mark. After the Delhi blasts on September 13, he suggested that the old kotwali system should be revived to boost intelligence gathering. The Congress continues to appease the minority community because Muslims constitute a large section of the partys vote bank. Patil, therefore, can do little at the risk of infuriating minority voters. Patil has also faltered in putting across his views in a firm manner. As a result, he takes recourse to clichd speeches about tough measures to fight the menace. But his powerlessness to prevent another attack only makes him look ridiculous. If the Congress is to survive politically in the future, the party must take a hard look at reality and introduce effective measures to heighten security by dispensing with its time-honoured strategy to please the wrong people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bikash Mohapatra, Bhubaneswar

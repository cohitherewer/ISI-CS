	It is easy enough in Indias criminal justice system  the onus of proof of guilt is on the accuser. The same principle applies when a party or group in governance is accused of  or at least charged with  having lost the numbers required to remain in government. Yet that is not what it looked like when the United Progressive Alliance tumbled almost guiltily into the position of shouldering a confidence motion for itself. If other parties felt that the UPA had become a minority and could no longer be in the governing seat, they should have asked for the no-confidence vote. But when the Left Front withdrew its support from the UPA and started screaming for the UPAs scalp  for if the government does not fall, the Left Front is poised to look pretty foolish  it forgot to ask for that vote. It was busier trying to work out its moral-ethical-ideological-philosophical position vis--vis the Bharatiya Janata Party in anticipation of voting alongside it against the Congress in the forthcoming confidence motion. Following up on constitutional principles and usage as a consequence of its decisions is not something that the Indian Left is used to doing. Someone else is expected to carry the can.        
	Although a party in government can call for a confidence motion as part of strategy, to baffle or outwit dissidents or nip subversion in the bud, the UPAs shouldering of the burden was hasty and unnecessary. It has no need to ask for the parliaments confidence, that is not part of democratic practice. It is in government because of such confidence; if someone in parliament has lost it, that party has every right to call for a no-confidence vote. Yet, the decision was announced when the prime minister was out of the country. More intriguing was the fact that upon his return, the prime minister was asked to see the president. But the president, or the governor of any state, can have no advice to give about the status of an elected government. The propriety of the request of K.R. Narayanan as president to the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to face a confidence motion after some partners had withdrawn support to his government is still questioned. It is beginning to look as if the UPA is expected to pay for the Left Fronts withdrawal, as if everyone around is still willing to dance to the cacophony of the Lefts tantrums. Why does the UPA want to look as though it has lost confidence in itself?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       QUIET CONFIDENCE                          - It is impossible to be ambivalent about the navy any longer        Diplomacy -   K.P. Nayar                                                        
	The defence minister, A.K. Antony, is a mild-mannered man. He is so soft-spoken that sometimes it is hard to hear what Antony is saying if you happen to be at the far end of a table where he is at the head. But his colleagues in the Union council of ministers know from experience that when it comes to defending his defence ministry, Antony can leave his mild manners at home and uncharacteristically thump the cabinet table forcefully with his fist to make his point. On one occasion, shortly after being inducted into the United Progressive Alliance government, he surprised some supremely self-confident colleagues who had taken Antony for granted. When a minister with the reputation of being a combination of Machiavelli and Rasputin anticipated the defence ministrys opposition to a proposal at a cabinet meeting and dismissed it as being of no consequence, Antony got up, insisted on being heard and eventually blocked a cabinet decision on what was being proposed.        
	Therefore, Antonys public statements since the Indian navy destroyed a pirate mother ship in the Gulf of Aden last week have an unmistakable ring of a resolve in the naval headquarters to force open issues about the role and future of the navy, issues which the political leadership of the UPA government has hitherto preferred to sweep under the carpet. Antonys statements in the last one week about the navy have been in the making for at least nine months. He held his tongue in February, when the ministry of external affairs, with tacit support from the Prime Ministers Office, attempted to sabotage a two-day Indian Ocean Naval Symposium in New Delhi that finally took place only because the chief of naval staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, persevered in bringing together 26 chiefs of navy from the Indian Ocean littoral states for the landmark conference.              
	Last weeks action against pirates in the Gulf of Aden is the high point of a process that has been in the making at the naval headquarters for many years. Few Indians now remember that exactly five and a half years ago, when Sri Lanka suffered its worst floods and requested international assistance, INS Sharda sailed for Galle and was the first source of relief for Sri Lankans, landing inflatable rescue craft, providing naval divers, blankets, medical teams and supplies. A month later, the navys INS Ranjit and INS Suvarna set sail for Mozambique on what was initially projected as a goodwill trip to participate in the 28th anniversary of Mozambiques independence. But it was much more. The presence of the ships, it turned out, had been requested by the government of Mozambique as part of an effort to ensure security for an African Union summit of heads of states that was held in Maputo in July, 2003.        
	More recently, Indian naval ships towed a Mauritian coastguard vessel, the Vigilante, all the way from Mauritius on a fortnight-long voyage, covering a stretch of 2,650 nautical miles for its repairs at the naval dockyard in Mumbai. For several years now, at the request of the government of Mauritius, the Indian navy has been carrying out surveillance and surveys of the islands exclusive economic zone.        
	When the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the American president, George W. Bush, announced in the White House on July 18, 2005, that they had jointly launched a US-India disaster relief initiative to strengthen cooperation to prepare for and conduct disaster relief operations and to assist in capacity-building in other countries, neither men envisaged that the DRI would be a vehicle for Indian naval assistance to the United States of America. If anything, the Americans believed it would be the other way round. But five weeks later, Hurricane Katrina became symbolic worldwide of American incompetence in dealing with large natural disasters, and an Indian naval unit of eight divers and 12 salvage experts was among the first of its kind from abroad that was offered to the Americans for providing relief in the US states affected by the hurricane. Eventually, 20 Indian naval divers and salvage experts helped US authorities with relief operations under the DRI launched by Singh and Bush.        
	Regrettably, a major reason for the UPA governments ambivalent political support of a vision for the Indian navy in the 21st century is that this vision was encouraged by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Just as the Manmohan Singh government initially tried to do away with the Next Steps for Strategic Partnership with the US that was rolled out by Vajpayee and Bush, just as the UPA government has been unenthusiastic about Vajpayees initiatives to link Indias rivers or to create north-south and east-west highway corridors, the navy has suffered in recent years from an absence of firm political support for its vision. But because the navy is much more of a professional organization than the ministry of shipping, road transport and highways or the ministry of water resources, it has not been possible for the countrys civilian leaders to altogether smother what the naval headquarters set out to change about a decade ago.        
	It was during National Democratic Alliance rule that the navy toyed with the idea of revising its Nehru-era defensive doctrine that was built around coastal protection of the country. The idea of change received enthusiastic encouragement from Jaswant Singh when he was the defence minister in the NDA government.        
	The revision of Indias naval doctrine was triggered, in part, by the navys action, in 1999, of rescuing a Japanese-owned freighter, the Alondra Rainbow, from Indonesian pirates. The action was sanctioned by the BJP-led government with the same enthusiasm with which it ordered the nuclear tests in 1998, although a section of international opinion maintained that the operation to rescue the Japanese freighter was in violation of international maritime law. A month before the UPA came to power, Admiral Madhvendra Singh, who was then chief of naval staff, unveiled a new maritime doctrine that focused on developing a credible minimum nuclear deterrence and pursuit of littoral warfare aimed at ensuring the navys dominance of the Indian Ocean region.               
	One sentence in the new doctrine offers a key to what the navy did in the Gulf of Aden last week: If India is to exude the quiet confidence of a nation that seeks to be neither deferential nor belligerent, but is aware of its own role in the larger global scheme, it will need to recognize what constitutes strategic currency in a Clausewitzian sense. The navy recognizes what is required of it, but doubts persist if the countrys political leadership recognizes this as well.         
	In a sense, the action by INS Tabar against Somali pirates has made it impossible to be ambivalent about the future role of the Indian navy any longer. It has forced into the open the tensions between the foreign policy establishment and the defence establishment in New Delhi on this issue, and that poses a major long-term challenge to the next government on Raisina Hill. It is an issue that will not be resolved quickly. Indias navy cannot operate in international waters in a vacuum. It has to become part of a coalition: either an existing coalition that it now finds unacceptable because that coalition is engaged in Iraq or it has to create a new coalition with clear objectives that New Delhi considers reasonable.         
	The agreements signed during the prime ministers recent visit to the Gulf  largely ignored in public discourse in India so far  have a naval component in them, and they offer a way forward in realizing what the naval headquarters has been attempting to change in the last decade. The defence ministers statements since INS Tabar went into action last week suggest that he is seized of the complexities of the problem. But with an election only a few months away, it is doubtful if anyone in New Delhi is willing to tackle this issue, which deserves urgent attention.

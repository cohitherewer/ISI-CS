The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | World go slow
                                                                                                                 WORLD GO SLOW                                                    
	By all accounts, the recession in the United States of America has been under way since the beginning of the year, or even since December last year. The index of industrial production in the US fell by 0.5 per cent between January and February of this year. It is the fourth month in a row that the index has fallen. The March report of the Census Bureau says that retail and food services declined by 0.6 per cent in February; the prospects for March are similar. The Business Outlook Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia continues to be strongly negative; all other indicators suggest that there is likely to be no growth, at best, in the second quarter of 2008. Future indices  of general activity, new orders, shipments, employment and average hours worked  are also trending downwards. Martin Feldstein, an economist at Harvard University and a member of a group that studies business cycles at the National Bureau of Economic Research, believes that the recession is already here. The formal determination of a recession is a few months away, primarily because of revisions to monthly data that take place; despite official statements to the contrary, several people believe that the US is already in the middle of what could be the worst recession since World War II.        
	The question has now shifted from whether it is a recession to how long it will last. Opinion is also divided on how severe it is going to be. The average recession has lasted 10 months, and the worst about 16 months. This time, things could be different. Inflation has been the highest in 17 years; input prices, according to producers have also been on the rise. Interest rates are likely to be higher despite the Federal Reserves actions in cutting rates. Combine the two, and you have the dreaded word of the Seventies: stagflation. A very big factor is going to be the resolution  if there is to be one  of the financial and credit market crisis in the US, and whether it spreads globally. A major downturn in the worlds largest economy could have severe consequences for the rest of the world too. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Fed, says that a global recession is inevitable at some point.        
	In the last few months, there have been downward revisions to global growth; those estimates are likely to be revised downward again when the International Monetary Fund publishes its World Economic Outlook in early April. But Indias commerce minister, Kamal Nath, says that trade between developing countries could cushion the effects of a US recession. Despite evidence to the contrary, there are still a few optimists who believe in the decoupling theory.

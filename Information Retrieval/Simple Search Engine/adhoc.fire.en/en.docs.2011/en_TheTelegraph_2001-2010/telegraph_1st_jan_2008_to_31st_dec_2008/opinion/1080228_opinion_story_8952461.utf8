The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Failed money
                                                                                                                 FAILED MONEY                                  Fifth Column - Satrujit Banerjee                              
	Reports that West Bengal was one of the states lagging behind in the utilization of funds made available under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme were on the grapevine of the Planning Commission for much of last year. A few days ago, a frontpage report in The Telegraph revealed that during the eight months ending November 2007, the state had spent less than 8 per cent of the sum allocated. Last year, the state had spent less than 60 per cent. Granting that the total allocation this year includes the spillover of last years unspent amount, the expenditure of 7.54 per cent in eight months points to a dismal reality.        
	On the face of it, NREGS appears tailormade for helping societys weakest section. After all, what can be wrong with a scheme that guarantees 100 days of work per year for one member per family below the poverty line? Moreover, the requirement that employment be restricted to rural areas, sounds fine as the resulting wages would lead to greater liquidity and consumption in these not-so-prosperous areas. But like all such so-called welfare schemes, NREGS looks better on paper than in practice. The irony of it is that since the early Nineties, successive Central governments professed to cut down sharply on new schemes that do not deliver on the promises made. And when one takes into account that the NREGS allocation is about to cross a staggering Rs 30,000 crore next year, making it the costliest welfare scheme in Indias history, one wonders how the Planning Commission could allow this scheme to see the light of day without a trial run. It is now an accepted fact that this misadventure is partly the result of the Lefts support for the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre.                
	Zero delivery        
	Consider this. NREGS requires 60 per cent of any approved project to comprise only of labour costs. The balance can be material and skilled labour costs. Thus, in one stroke it pre-empts building of roads and other meaningful use of brick and mortar. The other little things that can be done, and in fact were undertaken the first year, are cleaning of village-owned ponds and digging new ones. But how many such ponds are there in a village and where can one find areas free to create new water bodies? The only surefire way of utilizing the entire amount allocated, without drawing the ire of the comptroller and auditor general would be to gather people around, dig a hole in the ground one day and fill it up the next day with another set of people! But India can ill-afford expenditure of this nature.         
	Then there are allegations that deserving BPL households are being ignored, while names of workers from BPL families are being falsely used, without the work and wages going to them. True to form, allegations in Bengal relate to discrimination based on the political leanings of potential recipients.         
	No one questions the governments priority to address the problems of people under the poverty-line. At the same time, the cost-effectiveness of a scheme must be addressed. If census figures are anything to go by, little has come out of these massive expenditures (three percentage points of poverty-reduction). In a country crying out for roads, bridges, schools, colleges, hospitals, houses, irrigation, hybrid seeds, ports, airports, dams and electricity  the level of lost opportunity costs is simply staggering. Addressing these problems will take care of the BPL people faster, and generate a higher GDP growth.         
	There is a myth in India that poverty can only be alleviated through huge government expenditure, with a high degree of control to stop leakage. The last 60 years have shown that by the time the benefits of a scheme reach the target group, there is very little left.The reason, we all know, is corruption. People who have lived through it feel that reform is a continuous process. Policy-makers should stop persisting with policies which have failed to deliver in the past.

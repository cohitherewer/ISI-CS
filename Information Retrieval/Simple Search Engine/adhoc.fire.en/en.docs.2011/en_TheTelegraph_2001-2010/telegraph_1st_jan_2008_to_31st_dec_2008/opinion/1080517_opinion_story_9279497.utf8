	When someone begins to look heroic or saintly simply because he has acted ethically, it is time to sit up and think. Tapas Saha is 27 and owns a cycle stand outside Dainhat station in Burdwan. Last year, he had given the police a few leads in a murder investigation in his area. With Mr Sahas help, a local youth involved in the murder had been arrested and put into a correctional home. Last Thursday, just out of the home, this youth, together with a few other men armed with pipe-guns, came to Mr Sahas workplace to take revenge. They chased Mr Saha and a friend into the station, and as they were running towards the platform, the public caught up with them, snatched their guns and started beating up Mr Sahas original assailant, all but one of whose men managed to flee the crowd. This was when Mr Saha took an unusual stand. He fought with the crowd, which was acting on his behalf, and rescued the two young men from being lynched. Mr Saha and his friend then called the police, pacified the crowd, and rushed the two badly beaten up men to hospital, where one of them died soon after.        
	Significantly, the people most surprised by Mr Sahas actions were the police. They had probably expected to arrive in time to find the matter settled by the public. Most cases of mob violence are regarded as popular justice. So when the police heard that Mr Saha had tried to save his own assailants from the hands of a violent mob, whose actions he regarded as illegal, they could not help being candid in their astonishment. For Mr Saha, there was no doubt about what the right thing to do was in such a situation: his pursuers may have been armed criminals, but allowing a crowd to beat them to death was unacceptable. His only regret was that one of the young men (whom he had earlier helped arrest) had died in spite of his best efforts to save his life.        
	Incidents like this  few and far between, and involving moral clarity and physical courage  suddenly reveal what public life has come to in a state like Bengal. The nature of collective public action is most often disruptive here  damaging and destroying lives, or bringing everyday life to a halt. This involves either the direct use of violence or the threat of it. The role of the police in this ambient violence ranges from perpetrator to colluder to ineffectual looker-on. It is thus considered normal for any intervention of the people on behalf of justice to become uncontrollably brutal. This is a brutality that can organize itself instantly in any kind of public space, and is generally regarded as necessary and natural. It also disallows the existence of individuals who have scruples of their own, and may even act on them.         
	Be it in police stations or hospitals, during elections or riots, there is little guarantee that policemen, politicians or other custodians of public order are going to stand up for what an ordinary citizen regards as the right thing to do in a situation where powerful interests are at stake. People like Mr Saha are therefore remarkable  more so because they think, quite rightly, that they have done nothing remarkable.

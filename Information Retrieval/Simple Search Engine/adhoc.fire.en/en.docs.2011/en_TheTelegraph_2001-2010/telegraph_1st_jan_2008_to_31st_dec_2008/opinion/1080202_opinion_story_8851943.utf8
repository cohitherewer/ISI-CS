	The Malayalam Amateur Nataka Samithy, Calcutta, staged N.N. Pillais The President recently. Pillai, who died in 1995, created many a controversy in professional Malayalam theatre with his examinations of morality that had scandalized some people and upset others. The President is probably not among his best works because of its heavy dependence on dialogue  which made it difficult to follow  but its theme issued a timely warning, as political power goes to the protagonists head and he turns autocratic. Antony Jacob directed the actors satisfactorily.

	Samokal Art Gallery hosted an exhibition of paintings and sculptures entitled Art Addressing Violence to mark the 15th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid (Dec 6-30). Dedicated to the victims of the violence, the show featured works by such famous artists as Paritosh Sen, Jogen Chowdhury and Chandana Hore. However, this very fact proved to be a drawback since repeated exposure to canvases by these well-known figures might have had a deadening effect on most of us. On the whole, though, the works were impressive in the way they brought home the horror of the bloodshed. Shipra Bhattacharyas painting had an interesting semiotics. Among the sculptures, Help by Bimal Kundu  just two hands in wood raised imploringly  was moving in its simplicity.

	Mixed moments
    
	Bibek Guha is a mechanical engineer. But his love for capturing fleeting, beautiful moments with his SLR exceeds his passion for gadgets. Some of the stills in Guhas exhibition, titled Celebration of Life (Jan7-9 at the Gaganendra Pradarshashala), startled with their depth and clarity. The Violin Player of 70s, for instance, is a black-and-white shot of an old man playing the violin. The instrument rests lightly on the musicians neck who is immersed in the joy of his own creation. The Dancing Squirrel impressed too, with its surreal theme. However, the photographs of landscapes were disappointing, lending a touch of mediocrity to Guhas otherwise intriguing work.

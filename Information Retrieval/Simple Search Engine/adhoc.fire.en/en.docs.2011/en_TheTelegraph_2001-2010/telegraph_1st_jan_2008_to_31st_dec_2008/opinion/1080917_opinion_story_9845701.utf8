	Debt trap  
	 When a daily wage earner failed to repay a debt, a court in Andhra Pradesh decreed that he had to repay the amount. The man failed to do so. Finding that he owned a house, the court decided that the property would be liquidated to recover the amount. But the daily wage earner denied that he owned the house. The court held that a detailed enquiry should be done before making any decision. But the Andhra Pradesh High Court said that a failure to produce the amount did not automatically lead to attachment of property or arrest of the judgement-debtor (person from whom money is due, as per court judgement). It added that the courts had to ascertain whether the property was exempted from attachment under any law or custom having the force of law. (Pandugayala Subbarayadu vs Kattamuri Sree Krishna)  
	No excuses        
	 A road transport company moved court when one of its employees took up a job elsewhere and began to absent himself. The Punjab and Haryana High Court observed that the enquiry officer was obliged to proceed with the enquiry ex parte (when only one of the contending parties appears before the judge) as he had chosen to evade enquiry. The Supreme Court held that if a person failed to appear before the authorities for departmental enquiry even after receiving a notice for the hearing, he could not plead that the hearing had been held ex parte. (Pepsu Road Transport Corporation vs Rawel Singh)                     
	Be merciful        
	 An employee was removed from service on the basis of his admission that he had defalcated Rs 1,879. Rule 23 of the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules provides that in case of an appeal against an order that imposes penalty on an employee, the appellate authority must see whether the charges are firmly established and also whether the punishment is excessive. The employee appealed to the disciplinary authority under Rule 23 but the order of removal was re-confirmed. He then approached the Madras High Court, which set aside the order. It remitted the matter, directing the appellate authority to re-hear the case in a more considerate manner. (V. Arivuselvan vs State of Tamil Nadu)

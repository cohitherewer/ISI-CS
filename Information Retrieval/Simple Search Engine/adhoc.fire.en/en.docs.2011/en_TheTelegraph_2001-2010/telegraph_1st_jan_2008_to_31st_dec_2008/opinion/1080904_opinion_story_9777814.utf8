The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No place for cherry blossoms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NO PLACE FOR CHERRY BLOSSOMS                                  FAILING MISSION      A critical look at the state education ministrys allegation that teachers dont teach                                                  
	The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was supposed to achieve its objective of Universal Elementary Education by 2010. As the deadline approaches, its name has been modified to Sarva Shiksha Mission but neither the Abhiyan nor the Mission can boast of having brought about revolutionary changes in West Bengals system of primary education. Millions of children are still out of school and a sizeable percentage of the population continues to be illiterate. But point out the dismal performance to the education ministry and it has a stock excuse  the teachers dont teach. They allegedly devote more of their time and attention to private tuition and neglect their students in the schools. It cannot be denied that there is some truth in this accusation. At the same time, there must be more reasons behind teachers finding tuitions more attractive than their inherent avarice or private tuitions irresistible allure.         
	Swati Datta (all names changed) has been teaching in a state-aided school in Howrah for about three years. The journey to and from the school to her residence in Salt Lake takes four hours in all. She changes buses twice and then walks for about 20 minutes to her school everyday. There are thousands like Swati all over West Bengal. Most of the appointments given by the SSC land the teachers in schools that are far away from their homes. After battling the traffic and the elements (the road to Swatis school is flooded every monsoon) for hours, the teachers are usually in a sorry state when they reach their schools. Add to that the prospect of taking on a class of about 140 children packed in a stuffy room, and the teachers cannot be blamed for a lack of enthusiasm.         
	The education department has been issuing a number of instructions to the schools lately that are supposed to help the students perform better. But when the rules are applied, they are found to be doing more harm than good. Take the newly introduced system of unit tests. Teachers complain that so much of their time is spent on conducting these tests, which function somewhat like the class-tests of yore, that it becomes difficult to complete the syllabus. Teachers have also been receiving training of late to mark in grades rather than numbers. Most teachers feel that this is going to further reduce the students standards since the grading system is more lenient. Even weak students will pass their exams easily because of this leniency, and ultimately create a poor knowledge-base for the State.         
	Some full-time teachers feel that the level of teaching in government schools has been lowered with the coming of the para-teachers. Acting on the supposition that if teachers share the same cultural and linguistic background as that of the students, they would be more attuned to the latters needs, the SSA has recruited all para-teachers locally. But familiarity with the students and their families is often found to make the teachers biased, sometimes to the advantage of the students and at times to their detriment. And para-teachers allegedly cross all limits when it comes to private coaching. They are said to make the most of the time permanent teachers lose on travel by taking tuitions to their hearts and purses content.        
	Tapan Mitra is a full-time English teacher in a school in Falta. As a second-language teacher, he faces a unique problem. He has to transcribe most English words in Bengali if the students are to understand what he is trying to say. Besides, the texts in the syllabus require him to explain things like snow or cherry blossoms, which might as well be alienspeak to the village children. Tapan says that most of his students learn English for the first time in Class V and being first-generation learners, they find the language formidable. Some of them even end up using matras, as they do with Bengali, while writing in English. But officials in the education department have happily closed their eyes to the reality. A visiting district inspector once rebuked me for taking occasional recourse to Bengali while explaining things to the children, recalls Tapan with an amused laugh.                    A.M.

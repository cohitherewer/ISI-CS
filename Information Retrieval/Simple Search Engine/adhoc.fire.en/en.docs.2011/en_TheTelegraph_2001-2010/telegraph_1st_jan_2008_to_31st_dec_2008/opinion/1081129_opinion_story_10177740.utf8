	Classical singers Ajoy Chakrabarty and Rashid Khan sang raga-based Rabindra Sangeet at a programme titled Prem Sudha Rasay at Kala Mandir last Tuesday. Ajoy Chakrabarty is a versatile performer, and also has commercial records of Rabindra Sangeet. But Rashid Khan is rarely heard singing this genre. He started the evening with a short alap in the sombre and difficult Shri Raga. This was the first time I heard him singing Shri and I think he did a fairly good job. This was, of course, a prelude to the song, Kar milan chao birohi, in chautal, which he appropriately sang with pakhawaj accompaniment and in a sedate dhrupad style. This was nearly as good as the alap, though certain words (very important in the genre) were a little indistinct.         
	He was in his elements in the next song, the title piece of the show, Prem sudha rasay, based on the raga, Paraj Basant, and in medium tempo teental. He climbed to the high pancham in free movements of the prelude and wove aakar taankari into the song after singing the asthayi in the correct Rabindra Sangeet manner. This sort of thing, done with a sense of aesthetics, as in this case, should not annoy rabindriks. The Kamod, Kedar and Shyam Kalyan cocktail, Rakho rakho re, and the tappa style Ke boshile aaji in Mishra Kafi were also well-sung, with Murad Alis sarangi pitching in expertly.         
	Ajoy Chakrabarty was an image of cool precision in contrast with Rashid Khans involved, intense approach. The alap in Bihag, and the two songs based on the raga Swami tumi esho aaj (chautal) and Maharaj eki shaaje (jhaptal)  could hardly be sung better in the freer manner. He wove in some mild bol-bant, and what could be called rubato, into the songs. The next two songs, Bohay nirantara and Shukhohin nishidin (with sargam taans), are already widely appreciated in the singers manner. But he excelled in the thumri style, Olo shajani, in Pilu, and in Ashim kalo sagare (Shuddh Bhairavi); especially in the former, with its spurts of melodic elaboration and bahlawas. The latter, sung almost without improvization, stood out for the sombre effect, emanating from the chemistry of words and melody. Improvization would have reduced this effect. The evening proved that Rabindra Sangeet can weather improvization if it is done with aesthetic sense and musicianship.

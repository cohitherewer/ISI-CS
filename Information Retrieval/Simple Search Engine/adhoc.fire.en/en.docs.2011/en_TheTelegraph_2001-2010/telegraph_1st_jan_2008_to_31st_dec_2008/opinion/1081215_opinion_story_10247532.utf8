                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Letters to Editor
                
	Lost in the past                  
	Sir  The editorial, A place in the shade (Dec 7), says that Visva-Bharati has a past; it has no present; it possibly has no future. But how bright was the past anyway? Visva-Bharati owes this brightness to the fact that it was founded by Rabindranath Tagore. The big names among its alumni could be a reason why the institution won the prime ministers attention, and a grant of Rupees 95 crore from him. Among its glittering ex-students are Satyajit Ray and Indira Gandhi, both of whom spent very brief periods there. Visva-Bharati, therefore, cannot lay exclusive claim on them. Tagores aim was entirely noble in founding the university to create an alternative model of education; but Visva-Bharati failed to finally live up to his ideals. One finds a disillusioned Lila Majumdar lamenting the decline of the universitys fundamental ethics in Aar Konokhane. If funds alone could make a university function properly, Visva-Bharati by now would have become as popular as the central institutes of management and technology.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  There is not enough reason to say, as The Telegraph has said, that Visva-Bharati has no present or future. By saying it has a past, the editorial, A place in the shade, hinted that it had a name on account of its alumni who earned fame in art and politics. But it must be pointed out that the celebrity alumni of the institution were not famous when they studied there. It is the institute that must have instilled some values in them that helped them make it big later in life. The administrative and academic performance of the university may not have been satisfactory in the recent past, but that does not mean that none of the hundreds of youngsters studying at Patha-Bhavana will make a mark in future.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Purabi Guha, Bolpur

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that an esteemed institute like the Visva-Bharati has fallen prey to internal squabbles and corruption. For years, the heritage institution had spawned a kind of complacency that kept many of its benefactors oblivious to the administrations failings. The government has paid generous incentives as a token of respect for the universitys glorious past. But none of Indias prime ministers, who have been chancellors of the university, took steps to ensure the proper use of funds. Now the Centre has again promised to disburse a hefty sum, but one doubts whether the money will fall in the right hands.          
	It was, however, the government itself whose interference may have been responsible for many of the damages. The central university status given to it in 1951 did away with the uniqueness of its curricula, since more conventionally academic components had to be added to the courses. Santiniketan, too has lost its pastoral appeal. The old residents of the place often complain that the local MP, Somnath Chatterjee, gave liberal permissions to property developers. As a result, the place today is choc-a-bloc with bungalows and apartments that have changed the bucolic Santiniketan into a crowded and dingy town. Now that the Centre seems so keen on reviving the universitys lost glory, it should also try to restore Santiniketans image as a peaceful, tranquil place that had inspired Tagore.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Anirban Ray, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is a shame that a university of Visva-Bharatis stature has failed to maintain its standards. Much of the blame would have to go to the decision to turn it into a national university. It meant that the university had to conform to the governments regulations in order to get funds that gave it less freedom to pursue its goals. Tagore would never have wanted this. The prime minister has now sanctioned a handsome package of Rupees 95 crore. This will, no doubt, make the university toe the governments line rather than be faithful to its own principles.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

                
	Left righteous          
	Sir  After the horrific terrorist attack on Mumbai, while the whole country is criticizing the security lapses in and around the attack sites and demanding positive action, both the ruling Left in West Bengal and the main Opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, have remained silent. The Left has always been vocal on issues that have no direct impact on the lives of the masses, such as the nuclear deal or Taslima Nasreens stay in the state-capital. But the party never had a comment to spare on jihadi terror, lest it infuriated the minority voters. The West Bengal governments silence on terrorism is even more unsettling since the state shares a border with Bangladesh, which has reportedly been harbouring Pakistani terrorists. Besides, Calcutta is already accused of being a safe haven for jihadi elements that use the city as a transit point. Even the ongoing investigations have revealed that some of the SIM cards used by the Mumbai terrorists were taken from shops in Calcutta.           
	On the other hand, the Trinamul Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee, has left no stone unturned in opposing the Tata Nano project. Her street politics drove the Tatas away from Bengal. But she did not bother to issue an official statement condemning the Mumbai attacks. Isnt the silence of Bengal giving a fillip to the notion that Bengalis are not only soft on terror, but are also cowards?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Koushik Das, Calcutta

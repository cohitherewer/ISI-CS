                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IT COMES FULL CIRCLE                                  Mala Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	There is a sense of unease in Delhi. The festive month of December  its normal happy mood that we all look forward to at the end of each year  has been marred by the recent attack by mindless terrorists who struck at the nerve centre of this country, Mumbai. The contrary posturing by a democratically elected government in Pakistan  one that is increasingly unwilling and unable to come to grips with the frightening internal reality of its failed State  and the control of civil society and politics by the Inter-Services Intelligence and the army that call the shots, have made the situation on the ground untenable. The United States of America, responsible for all the horrors in this region over the last few decades, is now speaking a language that pretends to be firm but is clearly not effective at all. The mantra is always the same: as long as America is not the prime target, call for long winded multi-partite negotiations and delay tactics. What sense is there in that?        
	How come the US and other Western powers, with China as an active partner in the process, have not been able to restrain Pakistans generals and the treacherous ISI that has been active in India for long? Why all the false moves and blatant lies? Why the delay in calling a spade a spade and finding sane ways of dealing with and destroying the menace that we know has the tacit support of official agencies? Soon the target will shift and the Western powers may not remain safe. If the hoods dont get them, the economic downturn sure will and they too will pay a huge price along with their citizens. It all comes full circle.                
	Bitter truths        
	India is caught in a dreadful trap. There is the serious issue of training camps for terrorists operating out of Bangladesh, apart from the unending problem of immigrants who have entered Assam and other areas, settled there and could be involved in unacceptable activities. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam seems to have its back against the wall and soon India will be overwhelmed with the influx of refugees into Tamil Nadu. Pakistan speaks for itself and the Maoist insurgency from the terai, moving down very systematically to Andhra Pradesh and elsewhere, has thrown vast areas into complete administrative disarray.         
	To deal with all of this, and at the same time, requires a political will that is firm and unbiased, devoid of petty politicking and reactionary positions against communities, castes, creeds and faiths. We need a clean, pure and committed machinery of governance that is ruled by a humane, constitutional framework of norms and procedures. Using laws to settle personal scores needs to be dealt with harshly and any officer or politician doing so needs to be hauled up. A we-mean-business signal needs to go out loud and clear. We-are-united needs to be the mantra of the ruling dispensation. Confidence in the system needs to be restored.        
	It is becoming more and more apparent to the ordinary citizen that the US establishment has failed miserably in containing the ISI, the army and the government of Pakistan. The Americans know well that the instigators are all there and in powerful positions. Pakistan has been their buffer against India for the many decades of a hugely uncomfortable relationship with the latter. They have always been threatened by the potential market of both India and China. They have better knowledge of the political games being played over the years in Pakistan than they have of the weapons of mass destruction in Iraqs possession! America was the tacit support system for Pakistan in the sub-continent. Indians know that well. Its time to cease the pussy-footing and face the reality of this region and the impact it could have on the entire world, with an open, fresh and clean mind.

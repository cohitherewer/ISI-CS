	Lalu Prasad Shaw first began to catch the eye of discerning viewers and collectors around the Nineties with his depictions of typical Bengali babus and their beautiful consorts. His draughtsmanship was exquisite in the good old tradition of Calcuttas Government Art College. But he always gave a sly twist to these stereotypical images and postures by adding a hint of mystery and drollery that carried them beyond clichs. As in the works of his deceased contemporary, Dharmanarayan Dasgupta, Shaws paintings have an undercurrent of eroticism, and one need not be acquainted with Freudian theory to discover the hint of sexuality in decapitated lovers, given the well-known Biblical story of Salom and Saint John, and Oscar Wildes notorious dramatization of it. Thus, though these works harked back to Kalighat patas for inspiration, their treatment was quite contemporary.        
	Shaw turned 70 recently, and Gallery Sanskriti held a retrospective of his works (The Myriad Minded Artist, Jan 11-Feb 9). Although the works displayed were technically perfect  or at least close to perfection  they were all recent works and, in most cases, lacked the quirkiness of his earlier paintings and drawings, and looked rather flat or merely decorative as a result. This was in marked contrast with his graphics executed decades ago, but whose angularity and starkness do not fail to surprise us even today.        
	This being a retrospective, Shaws works from his student days, some dating back to the late Fifties and early Sixties were exhibited. There were some pastel and pencil drawings and watercolours of those times in this large exhibition. Included were some typical art school studies. As in the case of most artists who have made a name for themselves late in life, Shaws early paintings were full of promise. This could surely be said of the works of many other students also, but Shaw was one of those rare ones whose talent flowered later in life.         
	Most of the larger paintings highlighted in this show were, however, executed recently. There were familiar and rather tame images of a toppled vase, a line of portraits of men with beards and moustaches, contemplative beauties, sometimes headless, a brilliant yellow clump of radhachura blossoms and gentle human beings with pet dogs. There can be no doubt that Shaw has a certain mastery over the medium in use but at least here he had made no effort to exploit its possibilities to the fullest.         
	They were eye-catching, even charming exercises, that viewers may easily have fallen for but one missed the sometimes savage humour of his best works. As a painter, Shaw has in the past shown considerable boldness by depicting dogs in heat, the male trying to mount the bitch. It was a striking image rendered all the more shocking because it was very physical and full frontal to boot without any attempt at beating about the bush. In a retrospective one expected to see works of such high quality and calibre, regardless of vintage. These were, sadly, absent from this show. So it was the rule of mediocrity.         
	The gallery certainly should have worked harder to bring these together on a single platform. In all these recent images, however, embellishments and colours were kept to the minimum and this brought to the fore the strong graphic quality in Shaws work.         
	But this is only to be expected of an artist who early in his career had made a name for himself as an exceptional printmaker. Shaws classics are in black-and-white (picture). With their hieroglyphic flourishes, their complex mesh and juxtapositions of non-figurative geometric forms, and dramatic use of black, they threw open spaces that could stimulate ones imagination. Another contemporary of his who excelled in printmaking was Suhas Roy, whose graphic work is quite different from his paintings. The same can be said of Shaw, whose prints and paintings show no point of convergence. While his paintings, their high production values notwithstanding, may at times have been tedious to look at, the same could not have been said of his graphic work. They bore the mark of a nimble- witted artist unafraid of taking chances with his medium. Here Shaw took liberties he would not have dared to with either gouache or watercolour. Which is why it is always so fulfilling to take another look at them.

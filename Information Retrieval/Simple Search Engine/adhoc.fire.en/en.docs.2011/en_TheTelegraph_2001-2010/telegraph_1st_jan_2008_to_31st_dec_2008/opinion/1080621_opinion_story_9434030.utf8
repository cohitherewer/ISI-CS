	Avant-garde performance art is rarely encountered in Calcutta, so Embrace: Flash Points by De Quincey Co and Monirath provided a novel experience. Tess de Quincey, an Australian practitioner of Butoh, the contemporary Japanese form influenced by German expressionist new dance that has now spread internationally, joined Calcuttas Santanu Bose in a cross- cultural interdisciplinary exchange. At Uma Gallery, they began solo in separate rooms and gradually converged, moving in the slow motion typical of the style, to a grating metronomic sound piece by Michael Toisuta, contorting their faces in the anguish that Butoh demands (originally intended to overthrow Japanese societal inhibitions) to release our primal animality.         
	Since Butoh privileges spontaneity above technique, the artists improvised on the eight rasas, though Bose misinterprets vira (heroism) as energy. Fascinatingly, de Quinceys video collaborator, Sam Jones, projected live greyscale feed of both performers on a wall, deliberately distorted so that viewers saw different images in real time, of the person alongside the picture.

	Samskritiki Shreyaskar, a dance academy run by the veteran Kathak dancer, Rani Karnaa, along with Brindaar, an institution under the tutelage of Debasree Bhattacharya, a senior disciple of Karnaa, jointly presented their annual programme at Gyan Manch on June 11. The entire show was divided into two segments. The evening began with the traditional vandana in Kathak style. Both in pure dance as well as in abhinaya, the students learning the ropes under Karnaa and Bhattacharya left the mark of their good training. Their movements were neat, and the chakkars and command over taal were admirable.        
	Taal Vaichitrya and Tarana were enjoyable because of the crisp footwork, and synchronized rhythmic pattern. The dancers were full of enthusiasm and seemed to enjoy the juggling of different beats in their presentation. The second half featured excerpts from Karnaas popular productions, such as Ananda-dhara, Tasher Desh and Surya, the Sun God.

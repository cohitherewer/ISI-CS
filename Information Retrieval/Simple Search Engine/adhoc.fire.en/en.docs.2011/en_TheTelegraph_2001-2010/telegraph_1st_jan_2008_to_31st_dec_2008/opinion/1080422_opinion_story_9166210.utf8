The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | some relief, at last
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SOME RELIEF, AT LAST                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	For a divisional commissioner to shut his doors on local constituents  who wanted to meet him for a redressal of their grievances that have been ignored forever  and that too on the day of Mahavir Jayanti, only exposes the inept and non-performing local administrator. He is answerable to the public but, unfortunately, follows the diktats of the reigning political boss. This typical figure has become the rule rather than the exception, and is seen strutting about pompously, nose in the air, with a subservient police force in attendance  both in denial of the tenets enshrined in the Constitution.         
	The promise of change in the attitude of the officialdom and the commitment to democratic, equal and inclusive governance made in 1947 has failed. The bureaucratic machine that was conceived and put in place to give dignity to Indians emerging from colonial repression and exploitation, is in a pathetic, corrupt condition.        
	This truth was reinforced when a television channel realized that Rahul Gandhi was away from Delhi and in Bundelkhand, and showed the Congress leader walking with a large group of exploited villagers, whose demands had not been heard and whose due had not been delivered. The DC of Jhansi did not appear, nor invite the group to meet him till Rahul Gandhi staged a dharna outside his residence. The fleeting image of this one short intervention, in a surfeit of predictable and repetitive stories laced with endless cricket or Bollywood tales, was a visual relief. The lethargic politicians of today, who are fixtures on all our news channels, every hour on the hour, spouting irrelevant rebuttals, mindless abuse and illiterate rhetoric, need to look at themselves in their personal mirrors within the four walls of the sprawling Lutyens bungalows they occupy at the cost of the public, and plead guilty for dishonouring their profession with inaction and abuse of their oath of office.                
	Whispering vines        
	Instead of using the media to mock and damn Rahul Gandhi and his political call, to cry hoarse about family and dynasty, these men and women should take a leaf out of Rahul Gandhis book and spend dedicated time in the districts of India making sure the delivery mechanism is working efficiently, and if it is not, they should ensure that it functions. Sitting in the television studios of Delhi, wining and dining with the chatteratti, these people have diluted the concept of governance as it should have been.         
	They must hit the road on their own, not in an occasional cavalcade. They must hit the road in the height of summer when their constituents suffer the most. It was such a relief to the eye not to see the same old, frayed and many-times-failed Congress leaders hanging around Rahul Gandhi. One gathers from the whispering vine that they are busy being sarcastic about this new and real party strategy to ensure substantial support for the future and not merely for the election at hand. This fresh, sensible and mature thinking, planning and execution, once the hallmark of the Congress, could restore the liberal party that encompassed the plurality of India.        
	With Rahul Gandhi as Congress president, the party could breathe oxygen again. The suffocating carbon-dioxide of the past decades, the wily ancients who do not want to let go lest they lose their homes, hearth and medical perks, the intellectually-maimed cup-bearers, the sycophants upfront, the jee huzoors, schemeing destructively behind the scenes, often successfully and from touching distance of the sanctorum, need to be exposed for what they are and for what they are doing. A fresh and energetic wind needs to radically cleanse the Congress and sweep away the operators who are furiously working to maintain the status quo. What better time than now?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Just the gear and a bit of luck
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JUST THE GEAR AND A BIT OF LUCK                                  It was a big day at the Eden Gardens. The clash between the Riders and the Chargers flitted among the real, the unreal and the surreal                                            
	Last Sunday, I was at the Eden Gardens, watching the Kolkata Knight Riders play the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League. Or was I? I could have been watching a contest at the Colosseum. Or, equally, attending a concert in Wembley. Even after four days, I am not sure where I had been.         
	From where I sat, in one of the higher stands, a strange world unfolded in miniature: a tiny, glowing, green turf filled with midget-like cricketers with gladiatorial airs. I could also hear a disembodied voice, that of the circus-ring announcer  it could have been the DJ  inciting the roaring crowd. There was blaring music, movie stars, spinning, lithe women, dance troupes on a corner stage, and men walking around on stilts. And there was the sheer, biting heat. The light and the myriad sounds, this unreality, made the cricket incongruous, an unnecessary appendage.         
	I was watching the wheels of an entertainment economy in motion. I didnt like what I saw.        
	I have always been indifferent to Twenty20 cricket. I knew that the purists have been scathing about this innovation. And that there was already a burgeoning market for this form of the game. But now, after having been inside the charade, I realize that there is something disturbing about this manufactured spectacle. It can impair our understanding and appreciation of real cricket  Test matches and other longer versions  as we know it.        
	Cricket has a binary character. It is played between two teams, and is also a contest between the bat and the ball. It should be played under equal conditions, so that no one component is favoured. Unfortunately T20 cricket, with its rules designed to entertain, violates this principle, creating a game that is so much in favour of batsmen that bowling  and bowlers with their intricate skills  is made redundant. Batsmen can paddle- sweep fast bowlers for six over fine leg! Not once, but with frightening regularity, in a similar array of other, wondrous strikes over ridiculously short boundaries. (Brendon McCullum, one of the Knights, did just that against Zaheer Khan and the others to become the hero against the Royal Challengers.) This is why I found the indignant voices complaining about a shocking pitch after this game particularly pleasing. One difficult track was all it took to turn Olympic batsmen into mortals.         
	T20 cricket  with its cross-batted pulls, heaves and drives, and the occasionally spectacular catch  can be entertaining. But only if one agrees with the template of entertainment that has introduced this ugly edge to cricket. I often wonder why only a few people find T20 cricket ugly. Is it because of a gradual thickening of the senses, and the resistance to learn (and value) everything that is difficult yet beautiful? That evening, at the Eden Gardens, I watched in dismay the crowd greeting a towering six by David Hussey ecstatically, while a classy cover-drive by Wriddhiman Saha drew a muted applause. We are losing out on a kind of sensibility here, I realized, a knowledge of the finer points of cricket  the perfect leave by a batsman, a straight, low throw from the deep, or a flighted delivery from a spinner. Some might argue that much the same can be said about one-day cricket. This is only half the truth. One-day cricket, in comparison, is an even contest. Even fifty overs require cricketing skills. For anything less, all you need is your gear and a bit of luck.        
	IPL, I have heard it being said, will help discover new talent for India. Such views are as absurd as this kind of cricket. The League, when it ends, will have its share of heroes. But only a few would be considered complete cricketers  players who would succeed for India in all forms of the game. So isnt there a case for the board supporting domestic cricket  the lifeline of cricket in India  in a manner similar to the IPL? A perfect business model for domestic cricket is not unattainable. Better payments and infrastructure (to keep the big fish interested), a touch of glamour (Shah Rukh Khan wouldnt mind owning East Zone if he got the right returns), a change in the rules (a quota for foreign players?), and there we have it: wholesome entertainment for the crowds, as well as quality cricket.        
	I did not think all this up while watching the Riders play the visitors. I couldnt. The ambience forbade anything constructive, on or off the field. I left before the lights tripped, and did not see darkness descend, briefly, on the radiant bowl. This interregnum, I read later, lasted for 31 minutes. I regret having missed the best half-hour of the evening.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

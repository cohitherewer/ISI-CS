	Dealing in secret                  
	Sir  Undoubtedly, Manmohan Singhs greatest achievement as the prime minister lies in securing the final seal of approval on the Indo-US nuclear deal (How the nuke wall was scaled, Sept 8). Although Singh has been heavily criticized for playing safe, he showed exemplary courage when it came to upholding the nations interest. He did not hesitate putting his government at stake for the sake of the nuclear deal. After the meeting in Vienna, not only has he been vindicated, but he has also emerged the tallest among other political leaders of the country. While most parties could not see beyond petty electoral arithmetic, Singh had the foresight to envisage the benefits of this diplomatic alliance with the United States of America. The same Nuclear Suppliers Group that was once responsible for Indias nuclear isolation has relented, thanks to the tireless efforts of the prime minister and his cabinet.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There are now rumours that a secret letter by George W. Bush states that the Hyde Act supersedes the 123 Agreement. Hence, the United Progressive Alliance government should be careful while celebrating NSGs waiver to India. According to official sources, the government was fully aware of this letter all the time which implies that the UPA had, at one point, connived to mislead the parliament. If the UPA wants to salvage itself, it ought to resign at the earliest.           
	Yours faithfully,         M.M. Kale,Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh              
	Sir  To what extent the leaked letter influenced the NSG only time will tell, but this expos has given the Opposition a chance to play dirty politics again. With global warming leading to drastic climate change, the importance of energy management is becoming increasingly evident. The role of the nuclear deal in our daily lives cannot be undermined. The politicians seem keener to score points over the NSG waiver. But their games will not affect the common people, who are more interested in the social impact of this deal rather than in Indias politicians and their petty interests.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  The hysterical reaction of the media to the secret letter was unwarranted. The clarification merely stated the obvious: that India has the right to conduct tests and the US has the right to terminate the deal. The media turned this molehill into a mountain, leading the Opposition to question the validity of Manmohan Singhs victory in the trust vote on July 22.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhur Mohanty, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  After the latest controversy over the nuclear deal, the nation is now aware of the way in which Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, along with their coterie, had misused the democratic process by putting blinkers on the eyes of the aam aadmi. Even with the NSG waiver, George Bushs controversial letter is going to blight the UPAs image. This is also a severe blow to the Congress which is already plagued by the Bofors scandal and the money-for-oil scams.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Pramod Gupta, Delhi

                
	Sir  What H.L. Berman had disclosed about the conditions of the 123 Agreement had been reiterated by Nicholas Burns and Condoleezza Rice as the debate over the nuclear deal was gathering steam. The prime minister owes us an explanation as to why he chose to underplay the conditions appended to the draft agreement.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani

                
	Sir  The US state departments answers in January to the questions asked by the House of Representatives on the Indo-US civil nuclear deal made it abundantly clear that if India conducts nuclear tests, the US will immediately call the deal off and stop nuclear fuel supply. To the storm raised by the media over a controversial state department letter, the US ambassador, David Mulford, has said that there is nothing in that document that was previously unknown. Although the prime minister knew this, he assured the parliament that the agreement does not in any way affect India s right to conduct future nuclear tests.           
	The UPA has now explained that if India has the right to test, the US has the authority to terminate the nuclear deal. This is sophistry at its best. It was not expected of Manmohan Singh to quibble and obfuscate our understanding in this manner.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Santosh Adhikary, Bhubaneswar

                
	Sir  It was delusive to think that the US would continue with its supply of nuclear equipment if India carries out a test. It makes no difference whether the 123 Agreement overrides the Hyde Act or not, Americas position has been clear from the start: no country should have unconditional control over its own nuclear capability. America wants to put India on a tight leash to forestall the possibility of future nuclear tests and other technological advances.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Partho Datta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Yet another hurdle has been crossed for the Indo-US nuclear deal with the NSG waiver. The Vienna conference saw history being made: the NSG states approved the US proposal to lift the embargo on nuclear trade with India. Although the final ratification of the deal is yet to be passed by the US Congress, India has finally joined the nuclear club after many impediments  the trust vote, the Left pullout, and the recent leak of a secret document. Every party should rejoice at this victory and put an end to conspiracies to destabilize Manmohan Singhs government.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohd Mubarak, Ranchi

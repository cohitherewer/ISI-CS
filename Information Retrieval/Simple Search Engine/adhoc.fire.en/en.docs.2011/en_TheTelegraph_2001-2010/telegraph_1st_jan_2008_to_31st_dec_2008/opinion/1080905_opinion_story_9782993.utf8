                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TIME AND TIDE WAIT FOR NONE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Political manipulations, negative and self-serving, indulged in by almost all parties in India, along with the ruthless jockeying for power and gain, are giving rise to grave situations where innocent citizens are being used as pawns in a divisive game as party leaders jostle with each other to win brownie points and votes. This assault on the citizenry overrides all semblance of human dignity, intellectual discourse and a move towards effective solutions. Mamata Banerjee has made a caricature of herself and the West Bengal government has shown itself up as being incapable of dealing with the big, real, ever-changing world outside the unbending, adamant, dictatorial, insular realities of a Stalinist manner of governance that brooks no differences of thought or opinion. Prakash Karats silence through these days of deep turmoil speaks volumes!        
	Ratan Tata is an honourable businessman, and heads a clutch of blue chip companies. We must doff our hats to him for having stayed the course this far in the fruitless and demeaning game being played, despite all the price of the land and other concessions that the Bengal government brought to the table. Frankly, had it been anyone else, chances are he would have cut his losses and gone elsewhere. Now, there are suicides because of the possible stalling of the project. Is this the way to handle politics and business? Surely India is capable of doing much better. The level of leadership is abysmal because it has, individually and collectively, ceased to think big, out of the box and for the good of the country.        
	The phenomenal and sudden rise of Chiranjeevi in the South and his amazing rally in Tirupati are tentative and early pointers that reveal the mood of the younger and majority voters, reflecting their need to reach out to fresh and new leaders with potential  professionals in their fields who want to enter the public space in an effort to correct, overcome and discard the abject failure of our present-day leadership and its corrosive mal-governance.                 
	Lead by example        
	Rahul Gandhi could well play a similar role in the North, for a start, and excite the imagination of a whole new generation with the many challenges, their solutions and opportunities that could alter the destructive trajectory that we are on, leading us into a rather dark and dismal future.        
	It is so predictable to listen to old, die-hard, pass Congressmen pronounce negative judgment on what Rahul Gandhi and his team are attempting to do as they try to rebuild the frayed base of the Congress by using a different methodology within a democratic structure to conduct party elections, starting with the states that are scheduled to go to the polls by year-end. Typically, the lumpen elements are starting to feel insecure and are scurrying about with a silent campaign against the young Gandhi while bending and bowing shamelessly in his presence. Hopefully, they are all in for a rude shock!        
	As a nation, we have managed well to make a mockery of all the institutions that uphold democratic truths and realities. The leaders who hold high ministerial offices and handle matters of law and order, who are mandated with the responsibility to deal with and ease any ensuing social discord, have come to epitomize the horrors of the breakdown. They are the symbols of the national failure and their continuing presence in sensitive offices of governance has begun to appal the common man. Never has the home ministry been perceived as being so hopelessly incompetent, out of sync and in complete denial. It is truly scary that the present volatility of India and Bharat is in such weak, non-committal hands. Have the administrative service and the political class lost the plot?

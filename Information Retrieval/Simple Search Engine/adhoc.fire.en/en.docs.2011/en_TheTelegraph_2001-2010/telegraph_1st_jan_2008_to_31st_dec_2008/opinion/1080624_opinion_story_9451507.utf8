	Even sworn enemies take time off, but enmity does not necessarily end with truce. The tahdiya between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, brokered by Egypt, promises literally what the word means in Arabic  a quiet spell for six months. It would be premature to hope for lasting peace in West Asia on the basis of this ceasefire. After relentless cross-border firing at each other for decades, both parties stand to benefit from a tactical time-out. Israel has eased its embargo on the supply of food and medicine into Gaza, prompted not so much by the acute humanitarian crisis there as by self-interest. The prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has conceded that Israel needed respite from the interminable guerrilla war. Faced with mounting corruption charges, Mr Olmert is also desperate to salvage some credibility from the international community. Hamas sees in the lifting of the economic blockade a tacit, if provisional, triumph. The organization has openly welcomed this opportunity to replenish its arsenal and prepare for the next phase of war. Period of calm sounds deceptively hopeful, particularly when both parties are busy calculating mutual gains rather than working on the possibility of sustained peace.        
	The Israelis would be justly suspicious of the advantages that Hamas could hope to secure from this temporary relief. Hamas has now the perfect chance to consolidate itself within the loosely-formed coalition of Islamic elements  centred around Iran and fortified by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates  that have aligned itself against pro-Western forces in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadnejad, has described Israel as a rotting corpse  a comment that has put the fear of radical Islam in the hearts of Israelis. Hamass standing, at present, closely parallels the triumph of Hizbullah in Lebanon. In fact, the Israeli deputy prime minister, Haim Ramon, despaired of the tahdiya as another chance to represent Gaza as Hamastan. But Ehud Barak, the defence minister, would be waiting for Hamas to slip, so that Israel is able to earn its legitimacy for a full-fledged operation into Gaza that it sees as inevitable. It is unlikely that Hamas would act with any haste. It would rather establish itself on an equal footing with its rival Fatah, and earn enough support to contest fresh elections.

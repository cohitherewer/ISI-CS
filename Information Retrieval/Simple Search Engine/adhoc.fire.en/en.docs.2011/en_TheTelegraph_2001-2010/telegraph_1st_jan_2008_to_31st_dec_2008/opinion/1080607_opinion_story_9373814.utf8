	When cardboard lovers become papier mch villains, the simple art of murder that Raymond Chandler speaks of becomes too contrived. Theatricians latest production, Agatha Christies Towards Zero, looks slick but leaves the audience dissatisfied. Originally written in the form of a novel, Towards Zero was dramatized by Christie in collaboration with Gerald Verner in 1956. It is among her weaker whodunnits, lacking in verisimilitude, with an implausible plot, an assortment of clues that fools nobody, and a shoddy, unimaginative ending. Christie puts in all the ingredients that make a murder mystery  the isolated seaside villa, the old dowager, a group of genteel men and women, thunder and lightning, secret lovers, sparring former and current wives, a servant with a grouse, a shrewd attorney and an investigator duo. Yet she cannot create any more than bewilderment when the killer is revealed.        
	Neville Strange (Kanak Gupta), a tennis star, invites his former wife, Audrey (Anuradha Dutta), to spend a weekend at Lady Tressillians cottage by the sea. Also present are his new wife, Kay, who is joined by her lover (Dhruva Lal), and Thomas Royde, just returned from an Oriental adventure, who has for long been smitten by Audrey. The loyal family solicitor, Matthew Treves (Dhruv Mookerji), and Mary Aldin (Srishti Bhatnagar), the old ladys housekeeper, make up the rest of this merry party of potential murderers. Soon enough, Lady Tressillian is killed with Nevilles golf club, and a string of clues is strewn at the site of murder with the obvious intention of implicating him. Superintendent Armstrong from Scotland Yard is brought in with his trusty sidekick and a series of interrogations and testimonies that try hard to make a killer of all those present follows, till the final, disappointing denouement. Perhaps because of the slowness of the plot, the director, Tathagata Chowdhury, tries to tighten things by having his characters make quick and frequent entries and exits. But all the action takes place in Lady Tressillians drawing room, and the monotony of the setting is hardly balanced by the frenzied comings and goings of the characters.        
	A lavish set designed by Gitanjali Alagh Jolly and the posh costumes make the production look good. But the acting falls short, though the women do well. Dutta and Bhatnagar make impressive debuts. Lal is endearing as the playboy, but is often too sweet to be convincingly profligate. Gupta is unable to grasp the complexities of Nevilles character, and Barat is an embarrassment. It is left to Mookerji to salvage the acting. He towers over the rest and is the plays saving grace.

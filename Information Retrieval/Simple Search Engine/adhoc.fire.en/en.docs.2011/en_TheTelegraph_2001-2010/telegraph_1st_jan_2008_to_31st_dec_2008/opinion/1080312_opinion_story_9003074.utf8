	The Left Fronts victory in Tripura reminds one of its electoral success in Bengal in 2006. Not only has the Tripura victory been as resounding as the one in Bengal two years ago, but in both states, the Front had gone to the polls with development as its main slogan. This is also the slogan of the Congress at the national level but, strangely enough in the two states, as also earlier in Gujarat, the party chose to travel along a different path, warning the electorate not to be misled by what they heard. The Congress could have pointed out that Central funds play a large part in any development work. Hence the development that has taken place could be attributed to the role the Congress has played as a party in power at the Centre.        
	However, the party chose not to do that. In Tripura, on the other hand, it went about telling a bemused electorate that there has been no development when there were visible signs to the contrary: in the form of wider, better roads, irrigation facilities, schools, colleges and even a university. It also spoke of terror at a time when the threat of terrorism has been largely dealt with. The fact that over 90 per cent of the voters managed to cast their votes was simply because peace had returned to the state. Congress leaders were excited by the huge turnout. They thought that the anti-incumbency factor was at work and that the party would be back in office after 15 years. After the results, the Congress found itself trounced together with its ally, the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura.        
	Why did the Congress mix up things so badly? The only reason is that it lacks a capable leader in Tripura. The election was supervised on behalf of the party by Prithviraj Chauhan, a Central minister, who has very little knowledge about political ground realities in the state. His cabinet colleague, Santosh Mohan Dev, fared as badly. He had publicly stated that the INPT would do well in the hills, and would ensure the transfer of a large number of votes to the Congresss kitty. In the end, the INPT lost all but one of the six seats it had won the last time around.                 
	Vote for growth        
	Elsewhere, in Meghalaya, there was good news for the Congress. Thanks largely to the efforts of D.D. Lapang, the Congress was able to emerge as the largest single party. P.A. Sangmas hopes of becoming chief minister did not materialize and, at a personal level, that should bring some comfort to Sonia Gandhi.        
	For the Congress, however, Tripura was more important than Meghalaya. At a time when the party has decided to raise the ante against the Left, a victory in Tripura was what it needed. That did not happen, despite campaigns by Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. On the other hand, the victory in Tripura will embolden the Marxists to become even more rigid at the national level. Their success will now strengthen their hands against former allies like the Forward Bloc, which came a cropper after deciding to go it alone in the state.        
	Development is our politics, was what the Tripura chief minister, Manik Sarkar, had said before the polls. That the people favour such politics is now clear. Perhaps there is a message here for Bengals Leftists who, these days, are eager to oppose the chief minister when he talks along similar lines. The people desire an economy that will allow them to survive. Hence, they cannot support those who seek to deny them their wish. In Tripura, the Forward Bloc had dubbed the Marxists agents of capitalists and suffered a drubbing. In Bengal, some Leftists have been heard talking in the same vein. Perhaps the Tripura results will force them to hold their tongues.        
	The Trinamul Congress and Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party had also been in the fray in Tripura and went on to lose deposits everywhere. Was there any need for them to fight the polls in the state?

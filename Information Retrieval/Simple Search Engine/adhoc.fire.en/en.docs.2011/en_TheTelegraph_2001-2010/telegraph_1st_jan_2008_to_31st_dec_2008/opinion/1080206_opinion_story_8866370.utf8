                                                                                                              STATE OF TERROR                                                    
	Six decades is a long time in the life of a nation, long enough for it to move from the promise of stability to the cesspool of chaos. Sri Lanka observed its 60th independence anniversary on February 4 amid roadblocks, jammed mobile services, a suspended civic life and a gripping fear that would not go away despite the fulminations of the president or the shine of the guns and armoured vehicles paraded before a thin crowd. President Mahinda Rajapakse wants his people to believe in his armys achieved victories against the Tamil Tigers and in his ability to defeat terrorism. But with the Tigers now stalking the heart of the city and targeting civilians at random, the people can listen to him with only half their minds. Since the government formally dumped the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire early in January, the Tigers have moved the offensive closer home. Independence eve and the day itself were marked by roadside bombings and suicide attacks on a railway station and a zoo within the city which took lives and caused injury. Amidst this fear and insecurity, suspicion and divisions within the people  the Tamil population in Colombo is already apprehending a wave of persecution  are bound to push the chances of peace further away from the grip of the nation.        
	The president, however, sees the achievement of peace as a less complicated process. Since the Liberation Tigers of the Tamil Eelam and its supremo are seen as the chief impediment to peace, the war machine of the State has been geared to seek their extermination. In the war of attrition, both the army and the Tigers have paid scant regard for human lives and the basic rights they have systematically violated. The withdrawal of neutral authorities from the negotiations and the governments own resistance to monitoring by human-rights watchdogs have made the goings-on in Sri Lanka opaque and incomprehensible. Which is why intervention from neighbouring countries in peace-making, now much desired by the Sri Lanka government, may not be as forthcoming as Mr Rajapakse would want it to be. For the island to achieve long-term peace, which it is unlikely to find within one year, it is important for the government to understand that its military operation is pushing the country into a deeper crevice. Peoples rights and aspirations and their political will have to be respected for the bloodshed to end in Sri Lanka.

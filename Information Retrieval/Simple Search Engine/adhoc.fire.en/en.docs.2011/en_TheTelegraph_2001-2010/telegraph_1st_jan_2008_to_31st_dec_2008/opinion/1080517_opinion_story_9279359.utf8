The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | All on a summer day
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ALL ON A SUMMER DAY                              THIS ABOVE ALL      Khushwant Singh      
	As summer comes on, days get longer, nights shorter. Days go from warm to hot and hotter, till they become scorching. Dust hangs in the air and every few days a dust storm sweeps over the city making it dustier than before. Flies and mosquitos multiply and add to our misery. By some miracle, trees remain unaffected. Gulmohurs blaze in burning reds and yellows; jacarandas in lapis lazuli blue; jaruls in mauves, pinks and whites. And finally there are the amaltas dripping gold in grape-like bunches. They are a glorious sight.        
	I am finding the summer months in Delhi more and more tiresome. I stay cooped up in my air-cooled room all day. It is only after sunset that I go to my sitting room to have my quota of booze and supper. I sleep fitfully and am up around 3:30 in the morning. I switch off my air-conditioner and throw open my window. The world outside is enveloped in silent darkness. I catch the melancholy wail of an engine siren, the rumble of a train approaching New Delhi railway station. Soft, cool breeze wafts in bringing memories of past days. All my contemporaries are now gone. Where are they? Will I ever see them again? Will they be waiting for me when my time is over? Futile questions to which no one has the answers.        
	By five in the morning, the sky turns grey and the dawn comes on. I am used to hearing owlets hoot in the mulberry tree and the koels wake-up call. Half an hour later, the morning papers are dropped at my doorstep. I glance over the headlines of different pages: road accidents, rail accidents, plane crashes, murders, rapes, politicians abusing each other. I turn to the pleasanter pastime of solving crossword puzzles. I tackle an average of six every day. By 10 am, I am done with them. The morning drags on. I switch on my World Satellite Radio to listen to European classical music. It crackles to life, goes off and comes back. I manage to hear some Mozart, Bach or Beethoven before it conks out: I lose patience and switch it off. Now I have nothing to do but fidget with something or the other for two hours till it is time for my meal. I gulp down a bowl of cold soup, lie in bed, read a few couplets of Ghalib. I switch myself off to enjoy what will be, hopefully, a dreamless siesta. Dreamless it often is, but rarely long enough to cut short the tedium of a long summer day.        
	How do I cope with the seemingly endless afternoon? I relax in my armchair in the sitting room and look out of the one window that gives me a view of the world outside. It is a sweltering afternoon, with the sun scorching the lawn. Two sprinklers rotate, sending showers in the air. The sun filters through, making rainbows. Flocks of grey rock pigeons fly in to slake their thirst and to bathe in the muddy water. It is a happy sight, but does not last long. Sprinklers are switched off, pigeons fly away, the earth soaks in the water, leaving the grass cleaner and drier. Thereafter, only the coming and going of people remain to distract my mind. Shadows of the evening begin to lengthen. Boys and girls come out on the lawn with their pet dogs to play football. Dogs chase the football, try in vain to bite it, wag their tails joyfully and wait for the ball to be kicked round, so that they can chase it again. This too is a happy sight. At long last the night comes. It is time for me to get a little sizzled and take a kinder view of life. I raise a toast to Omar Khayyam:                
	Into this world, why not knowing,        
	Like water willy-nilly flowing        
	Like wind along the waste,        
	Hither-thither, willy-nilly going.                
	I eat my supper and retire to bed. I read a few more couplets of Ghalib before I switch off my bedside lamps. Thus ends the long summer day.                
	Dropping names                          Boris Johnson: tortuous kinship       
	It may not impress my readers but I felt quite like a VIP when I heard the news that Boris Johnson had been elected Lord Mayor of London. He is a Tory MP and former editor of The Spectator. He defeated the Labour party member, Ken Livingstone, despite the latter getting votes of the immigrants from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. I happen to be distantly related to Johnson. The tortuous kinship needs elaboration. My eldest and youngest brothers married two sisters, both beauties of their times. My younger sister-in-law divorced my brother and married Charles Wheeler of the BBC. Boris Johnsons wife is Wheeler-Singhs daughter.        
	Around five years ago, Boris was in India to join the baraat of the cousin of his half-Sikh wife. The baratis, which included my daughter, Mala, were flown in a chartered plane to Kerala: the bride being an ex ministers daughter. As the Sikh bridegroom was being taken on an elephants back to the marriage pandal for the nuptial ceremonies, the elephant, which had never seen too many sardars and goras, lost its temper and charged at the baratis walking alongside. Among those hospitalized were the bridegrooms father and my nephew. Boris found the incident funny enough to write about it in The Spectator.        
	Boris Johnson is a blond-haired chubby-faced man known for his buffoonery and ready wit. He has not been a very faithful husband, but the marriage holds. If the Tories win the next general elections, as is being predicted, and David Cameron becomes Englands prime minister, Boris Johnson is almost certain to find a place in the cabinet. Then there will be more reason for me to drop his name. I have never met him; he does not know I exist.                
	Scary proposition                
	Ghanta was at the age of thirty. One day his fathers friend, Santa, asked him: Ghanta now you must get married and be settled in life. Ghanta replied: Uncle, I am scared of girls. Santa: If you marry, you will be scared of only one, but will love others.

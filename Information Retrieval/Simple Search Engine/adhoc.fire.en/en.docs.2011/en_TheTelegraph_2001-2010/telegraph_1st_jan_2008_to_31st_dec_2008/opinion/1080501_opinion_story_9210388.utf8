	The aam aadmi in India is providing more food for thought than expected of him. He was supposed to quietly push the circus over the nuclear deal into the background while giving the chief constituent of the ruling coalition its punchline for the elections. Now a matter as basic as what he eats has become the deciding factor for its electoral survival. The movement of the aam aadmi from the sidelines to centre-stage is not a phenomenon unique to India. Had the allies in the coalition been less engrossed with themselves, they would have noticed how close India was to being hit by the wave of food-price inflation that had already set other nations rocking. The worldwide food crisis, also called the silent tsunami  which lies at the root of the spiralling inflation in India and of unprecedented violence in other parts of the world  is forcing prime ministers to resign, elections to be cancelled and stringent laws to be passed against hoarders.         
	The trouble is that India, with its booming markets and a burgeoning population of the upwardly-mobile, is itself a part of the problem. The sudden surge in the demand for food, particularly cereals and animal protein, which is one of the many reasons for the crisis, has been precipitated by Indias, and also Chinas, growing population of the moneyed. This section can now pay for its excess need of food, and pay more for it. But because it is being able to do so, those down the chain of consumption  the middling classes and the poor  are being compelled to either cut down on the quantity of food and the number of meals, or, at times, to go without any food at all. Obviously, all the blame does not lie with the rich. Together with failing harvests, inclement weather, insufficient agricultural growth, there is also the worlds increasing need for biofuels to tide over the energy crisis. The large-scale conversion of cereals into fuel has added to the crisis. All that, and the skewed policies of governments that complicate the global trade in food and the adoption of new scientific practices, which could help agriculture keep pace with growing demands.        
	The food crisis is supposed to last some time. In other words, a new dispensation in India is unlikely to get the aam aadmi off its back very easily. In the parts of the world that depend on food imports, humanitarian aid and social protection programmes are expected to help the people and their governments. But in India, which is yet to acknowledge the crisis, the process might be more difficult. India may have sufficient food stocks, but it will need a great deal of administrative competence to reach this food to the poor. Apart from considering how its regulations, such as those on food exports, will affect its farmers, India has to take a long-term view of its developmental priorities to keep its aam aadmi alive and kicking.

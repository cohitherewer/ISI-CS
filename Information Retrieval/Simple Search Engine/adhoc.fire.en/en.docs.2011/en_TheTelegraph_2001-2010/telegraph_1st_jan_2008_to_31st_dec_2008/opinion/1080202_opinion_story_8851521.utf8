                 This Above All- Khushwant Singh
             Glory of golden Bengal
                    
	I am a small but fussy eater, a gourmet, not a gourmand. I eat very little during the day but like my dinner to be a one-course followed by a dessert. I try out different kinds of cuisine, Indian and foreign. I am not a vegetarian; I prefer fish preparations to chicken or meat. I am blessed with a gifted cook, a Garhwali  Chandan Singh Pundir  who has been with me for over 50 years. My wife used to read out recipes of Indian, French and Italian dishes to him. He would reproduce them better than chefs at five-star hotels. My wife has been gone for several years; but Chandan Singh still manages to cook whatever I fancy to perfection. I say all this as a prelude to my comments on Chitrita Banerjis latest book, Eating India: Exploring a Nations Cuisine. She is internationally recognized as an authority on Bengali food. Her earlier publications, Life and Food in Bengal, and The Hour of the Goddess: Memories of Women, Food and Ritual, were widely acclaimed in America and Europe. In Eating India, she takes readers on a tour across India, introducing them to the people, their history, religion, rituals and preferences in food. Needless to say, her sonar bangla wins the Oscar for the best the world has to offer by way of gourmet delights.
    
	Bengalis on both sides of the divide between West and East Bengal are fussy eaters. They can identify different kinds of freshwater fish and crustacea and know various ways of cooking them. They also concede that hilsa from the Padma or the Ganges is the queen of all fishes. For most of inland India, one kind of fish is like any other, it is mucchee. The only way to cook it is to fry it, and the only way to eat it is to dip bits of it in pudina or imli chutney. Bengalis also produce the best desserts: sandesh, rosogollahs, chamcham and rasa malai. Banerji tells us that these mouth-watering delicacies were evolved from the Portuguese love for cottage cheese in their earliest settlements in Bengal. I am however baffled that, till a few years ago, Calcutta, which has excellent restaurants specialising in Mughlai, Chinese, French and Italian food, did not have a restaurant exclusively for Bengali cuisine. It also escapes me why it is that you can eat tastier hilsa in Dhaka than in Calcutta.
    
	Banerjis travelogue takes us to Goa. Here, as could be expected, Portuguese Catholic predominance tickled the Goan taste buds. Just about everything  from pao (bread) eaten with vindaloo, to the 117 varieties of fish they eat  has an Iberian touch. But instead of the banana leaf on which Bengalis prefer to eat, their fingers dipping into mounds of rice, the Goans eat on metal or china plates and wash their food down with copious intakes of beer and coconut or cashewnut feni. Banerji travels by train and car, sampling food at roadside eateries and never finding anything wrong with what she eats. The only cuisine she did not find worth praising is Punjabi. Her experience was limited to eating at the Guri-ka-Langar in Amritsars Golden Temple, which feeds many thousands at every sitting, and my home in Delhi. The only Punjabi food I eat during winter months is sarson saag and gajar halwa. We did not have either on the menu when we celebrated her birthday while she was a guest at our house.
    
	Chitrita Banerjis enthusiasm for Indian food can be ascribed to home-sickness. She lives in Boston with her doctor husband and her widowed mother. She misses her sunny homeland. She is not a great eater as we might conclude after reading her book, but a selective one. She preserves her curvaceous figure and is as palatable a dish as the ones she writes about, with the sauciest eyes sparkling with mischief. Her book makes delightful reading.
        
	Requiem for a leader
        
	Benazir dead!
    
	So what?
    
	Pursuit of democracy
    
	In the subcontinent
    
	Is a big slur on this wondrous word
    
	It embodies everything to everybody
    
	But delivers nothing... so what?
    
	Votes have to be got
    
	Sometimes bought
    
	By means vile as well as by 
    
	emotional rabble-rousing
    
	The masses are dumb
    
	Will be forever  so convenient!
    
	Benazir  what a name,
    
	Means unparalleled
    
	So are all our politicians, mostly
    
	Power  unbridled, whichever way 
    
	it comes 
    
	Is welcomed and craved for
    
	I am, I rule  
    
	I am Benazir!
    
	So are all fellow politicians in this doomed subcontinent
    
	She leaves behind three teenage 
    
	children
    
	And an ailing husband, 
    
	So what... .

	Wedding wiles
        
	The parents of a girl went to meet the father of the boy they had in mind for their daughter, and asked him, How much can your son read or write? The boys father replied He cannot read, but he has certainly been written about.
    
	How can that be?
    
	When he was born his name was entered in the records of the municipality.

	Neighbours envy                  
	Sir  Chinas informal objection to Manmohan Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh deserves a str- onger reply than what Pranab Mukherjee has given (Pranab scoffs at China protest, Feb 9). Mukherjee has argued that the Indian parliament has elected representatives from the state, and, therefore, the prime minister is within his rights to visit it. India could have retorted that the Chinese premier does not require a clearance from New Delhi when he is visiting parts of Tibet! Such an answer would have made Indias stand clear and sounded less grim than the diplomatic explanation that has been offered. Thankfully, India has not responded officially yet. But the foreign ministers remark may have given the Chinese unwarranted importance.           
	Chinas expansionist tendencies are not unknown. Its occupation of Tibet, claiming historical territorial rights, has been the subject of a global controversy. Since the 1962 debacle, China continues to occupy large swathes of Indian territory. Yet, the Chinese are eager for more, for which they remain engaged in a diplomatic bargaining with India. The relationship between the two countries has become increasingly strained. Foreign visits or joint military exercises are unlikely to stop the downslide. If India wants to deal with China from a position of strength, it has to stop being placatory and jittery about angering Beijing. Incidentally, one wonders what the Left Front has to say about this incident.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The protest over the visit of the Indian prime minister to Arunachal Pradesh reveals how little China cares for diplomatic niceties. The remarkable rise of China as an economic and military power has persuaded its leaders into believing that it wields an overwhelming influence over India. China has made no bones about claiming more and more portions of its bordering countries as its own. It is important for India to deal with China firmly, without succumbing to the designs of this neighbouring bully. However, India, unlike China, should not be rude and upfront           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Chinas claim over Arunachal Pradesh is highly contentious. The overreaching ambition is typical of the country. The Macmahon Line, since the early 20th century, has demarcated the border between China and India. The fact was never questioned till the communists came to power in China. If the Mongoloid or Tibet-Myanmar ethnicity is the reason behind Chinas claim on Arunachal Pradesh, then it should lay a similar claim over all the major southeast Asian countries, including Korea and Japan. By the same logic of shared ethnicity, India could claim Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. National boundaries, all over the world, are political constructions which are not based on racial grounds. Incidentally, the Indian communists reticence over the Chinese claim clearly shows where their loyalties rest. When an American warship dropped anchor in an Indian port with government approval, the Marxists saw it as a threat to our sovereignty, Now that the Chinese have laid unfair claims on our land the comrades have chosen keep quiet.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  Statements staking claims on Arunachal Pradesh to counter the Chinese, as made by Pranab Mukherjee, are best avoided. What is ours is ours and there is no need to reiterate it. Not taking offence in such cases is the best defence. India must remember 1962 and never let its guards down. India needs to improve the infrastructure in the border areas, given that China has successfully built a railroad up to Lhasa. Most important, India must strengthen its armed forces and find ways to attract the young to the army. Only better salaries and perquisites could tempt the young to remain confined to desolate border posts instead of pursuing lucrative careers in multinational companies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Public victim          
	Sir  Rajen Hazra was a victim of circumstances gone horribly wrong. The absurdity of his death is heightened by the fact that even after he had fallen off a crowded train compartment and hit a signal post, he had enough life left in him to arrange for his daughter to be collected from Sealdah station. Yet he could not make it through because the public did not will it. What were the people trying to achieve by protesting around Hazras supine body instead of reaching him to the nearest hospital? (Man bleeds on tracks, Feb 9). Commuters travelling on local trains during peak hours often have to hang on to the handrails with their bodies left leaning out of the doorway. A few more trains, a little more frequently would certainly help. Crores are being spent on modernizing railway stations but little thought has been devoted to the safety of passengers. It is difficult to put the entire blame for Hazras death on the riotous mobs. It is common for the railway police to attend victims hours after an accident.           
	Yours faithfully,        Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan      
	Sir  The people of West Bengal are prompt in raising their voices. It is as if they are on the lookout for causes, big or small, which could be protested against. It is because of such a righteous crowd that Rajen Hazra died by the railway tracks before he could be taken to a hospital. Every other day, people lose their temper at the drop of a hat and then block roads or torch vehicles. Such activities can hardly be justified.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
B.C. Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Everyday affair (Feb 10), moves beyond the death of Rajen Hazra, elaborating on the hazards faced by ordinary Calcuttans on public transport every day. Ramshackle buses, unauthorized carpools and dangerous pedestrian-crossings have become familiar features of our perilous city.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                 POLITICS OF THE BUDGET                          - A budget with pre-election stunts, not ministerial insights					 					      S.L. Rao      Commentarao                        Chidambaram with the RBI governor: banking heavily				                                             
	After the budget was announced, there has been a precipitous decline in the stock market, severe criticism of some proposals  especially the bank loan write-offs for farmers, of the lack of transparency about how banks are to be reimbursed, the moral hazards in writing off, the inflationary pressures that will be unleashed, the lack of measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness in government expenditures, the neglect of the consequences of the pay commission, among others.         
	Agriculture has been neglected by every Central government for over 20 years. In the early years of the economy, agriculture and infrastructure were the areas that suffered cuts in expenditures to show that the deficit was under control. Governments could not cut on sacred cows like defence, subsidies, government staffing and so on. Public investment in agriculture has been declining, private investment has been rising. Public investment benefits the community, particularly small and marginal farmers who cannot afford to spend from their own pockets. The investment is in dams, ponds, water storage, canals  dealing with salinity, storage, rural roads  connecting agricultural markets, credit, disseminating new technologies, ensuring quality of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and so on. Private investment benefits individual farmers and is in tractors and farm equipment, pump sets, and such things.         
	The write-off itself appears to have been casually decided. It does not differentiate between dry lands and irrigated lands. In the former, many small farmers have over the five hectares below which the write-off is to apply. This leaves out the really distressed small and marginal farmers in the dry areas Vidharbha.         
	Bank credit has been more easily available to larger farmers, but the others still depend heavily on moneylenders. To say that they need not repay moneylenders since the interest charged is extortionate and illegal ignores reality. Until small farmers can be assured that other sources will always be available, they will go to moneylenders.               
	The crux of the problem is the subsidizing of the urban consumer at the cost of the farmer. Prices of major crops like wheat and rice are much lower than international prices. It helps to keep down the costs of public distribution and the farmer is thus taxed by the government to support the public distribution system.         
	Another problem is the declining productivity of most crops, and to much lower levels than in other countries in Asia. Here, the adulteration of pesticides, wrong use of fertilizers, fake seeds add to the woes of the farmer who has borrowed to buy them, expecting better productivity, only to have his expectations shattered and be confronted with a mountain of debt that he cannot repay. Governments have failed miserably to ensure that only quality inputs reach the farmer. The interference of do-gooders has held up the testing and introduction of genetically modified seeds, at the cost of the farmers. If governments had tackled these problems in past years, we would not have had this write-off of bank loans to farmers. We can expect another write-off in a few years since the problems will continue.         
	This inactivity is not confined to agriculture. When the Ahluwalia committee securitized Rs 40,000 crore owed by state electricity distribution enterprises to Central undertakings, the former were to correct themselves and not allow such an accumulation to recur. This has not happened.        
	The finance minister has petulantly dismissed questions about the write-off of bank loans, saying that these questions should have been asked of the politicians who had pushed for it. Surely a government action has to have stronger logic than such suggestions of politicians out of office? There is yet no clarity about how the banks are to be reimbursed. The finance minister airily dismisses questions by saying that government has a way and will repay banks over three years. Banks are expected to welcome the write-off, since they will now be reimbursed for loans that were non-performing assets. Presumably the government will issue government bonds which can recapitalize the banks. It is not surprising that the stock markets took fright at this massive write-off of what are today assets in the books of the banks.         
	With these actions the finance minister continues the fudge of last year on the deficit, though he now accepts that below-the-line items will have to be dealt with. Rise in tax collections and boom in direct tax receipts give room for correction of these fudges. However, the economy, and especially manufacturing, is already slowing down. Tax revenues may not remain as buoyant.         
	Inflation is the sword hanging over the economy. It will be aggravated by the budget. The finance ministry has been able to get its nationalized banks led by the State Bank of India to lower interest rates, contrary to the Reserve Bank of India stance. The continuing deficit above and below the line, massive expenditures and tax cuts proposed in the budget, will fuel inflation further. Rising fuel prices with crude at $105 a barrel will make it worse.         
	The finance minister has also been reticent about the massive defence expenditures. There is no talk of efficiency, better negotiations, or eliminating price-padding by agents and corrupt defence officials.         
	Thanks to the Left, the United Progressive Alliance has given a strong social dimension to its budgets, with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme now extended to all districts, more money for education and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Bharat Nirman that particularly builds rural infrastructure, the midday meals scheme, scholarships for high school and higher education to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and minorities; training of health activists; development finance corporations for these classes; disbursements to states under Central government schemes only on the basis of performance. Building further on the National Democratic Alliance initiatives on infrastructure will also stimulate the economy.         
	Some innovative initiatives must be recognized. The best is the funding for skill-development in the context of actually earning a demographic dividend by improving the quality of the working-age population. Another is the provision of drinking water for all schools in water-deficit areas. A third is the exemption from capital gains to assets under the reverse mortgage scheme on transfer of assets and from tax on interest income.               
	Another scheme that seems to have been announced without adequate preparation is the setting up of more Central universities and Indian institutes of technology. The basic problem is the declining quality of the faculty, mainly because of huge differentials between their remuneration and in other occupations. An airhostess at 20 earns twice and more of what is paid to a PhD. This must be corrected, but the budget does not do that. The Pay Commission is unlikely to do much about it. It needs urgent action. The budget has also ignored the recommendations of the Vaidyanathan committee to improve the funding and quality of social sciences research.        
	Industry has much to be pleased about. There is across-the-board reduction in excise duties with more for pharmaceuticals, paper and the automotive sector. Project imports will also benefit. The exemption from dividend distribution tax of one level of subsidiary companies will enable promoters to leverage smaller equity into larger capitalizations.         
	However, the expansion of coverage for service tax is still iniquitous, leaving out lawyers as it does. The raising of slabs for income tax is good news and will add to consumer demand. The vast social and infrastructure expenditures will help to stimulate industry. But the volatility in stock markets will increase because of the controlling of inflationary pressures without interest rate increases. We will see frequent raising and lowering of the cash reserve ratio and limits on external commercial borrowings. This will have a waxing-waning effect on liquidity. Companies will find it difficult to raise fresh primary equity.         
	As it sinks in, it is clear that this is a purely political and pre-election budget without the stamp of the finance ministers famous sharp mind and attention to detail.

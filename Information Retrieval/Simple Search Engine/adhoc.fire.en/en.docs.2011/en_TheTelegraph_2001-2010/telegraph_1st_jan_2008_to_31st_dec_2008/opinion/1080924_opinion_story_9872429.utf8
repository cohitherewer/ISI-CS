The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Brave New Nepal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A BRAVE NEW NEPAL                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Since the time he assumed office, Pushpa Kumar Dahal or Prachanda had kept the government and the Opposition in India wondering about what path he would follow in his country that would have a direct bearing on Indo-Nepal relations. During his first official visit to India, the new prime minister of Nepal said things in public that should lead to some head- scratching. Of course, he did stress on the need for friendship between the two neighbours but he also said more. The emphasis all along was on the word new. A new Nepal had emerged after the historic elections and that new Nepal would introduce a new democracy, distinct from parliamentary democracy as is followed the world over.        
	Prachanda spoke of his new democracy at a gathering organized by the the Indo-Nepal Peoples Solidarity Forum and there may be a tendency to interpret his words as just an assurance to radicals that he has not changed from the days he spent as a Maoist revolutionary. That perhaps would be a mistake. He has to stick to his Maoist commitment and seek a change in the system if he has to remain as the leader of his constituency. That is the meaning of the recent mandate as he understands it. And that commitment is sure to make him traverse a path that may always keep New Delhi on tenterhooks.         
	Right now, Prachanda and his comrades cannot afford any confrontation with India as neither their coalition partners nor a large section of the Nepali population will allow it. At the same time, he must seek to be seen as delivering his country from the clutches of the big neighbour. That will earn him friends not only among the masses but also other political forces like the communists and perhaps even among the opposition, Nepali Congress. It is in the nature of a small and weak country to be always suspicious of the big and relatively strong, and Nepal has never been an exception.                
	Handle with care        
	If that were all, New Delhi should not worry, for this has been the way since the days of Jawaharlal Nehru. But Prachanda has spoken of a new democracy. What exactly he has in mind is not known but that new democracy implies that foreign relations will also take a new turn. And let it not be forgotten that India is always mightily nervous of Nepals other big neighbour, China. And as things stand, China also brings Pakistan into the scene, albeit indirectly.        
	Right now there is a lot of uncertainty around but at least one thing is certain. Prachandas becoming prime minister can in no way encourage Indian Maoists. Nepal is too small a country to be materially helpful to Maoists across the borders and, more importantly, it cannot be a conduit for Chinese help since China is not interested. Prachanda knows that revolutionary struggles must be sustained from within the country, that getting help from outside is no way out. The fears in Indias political circles about such a possibility are unfounded.        
	It is what Prachanda plans to do within his own country that should cause worries. Right now he cannot do without India but what about the future? What would be the extent of Indias presence in the new Nepal and what price will be charged for that presence? One thing is clear: the Indo-Nepal Treaty of 1950 will have to be revised, and Prachanda and his ministry will insist on greater accommodation both in terms of trade and transit. He may insist on a curb on Indian businessmen setting up shop in his country, particularly in the Terai areas. He is also sure to tell India to respect Nepals sovereignty and not covertly interfere in possible policy decisions. Nepals geographic location and Prachandas ideological leanings should be cause enough for Indias political-bureaucratic establishment to treat him with extra caution.

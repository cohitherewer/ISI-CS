	Tread with caution                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, in his article on India and the current Tibet crisis, has been somewhat unfair. If India supports a free-Tibet movement, then China has equal right to support the cause of an independent Kashmir (In fear of fear itself, March 23). Unfortunately, our idea of international relations is still mired in the farcical Nehruvian doctrine that India can sermonize all and sundry but none dare do the same to us. We profess to be the worlds conscience-keeper though we are among the most corrupt nations. Tibet, or for that matter Taiwan, is an internal matter of China and we have no business interfering in it. We seem to have learnt nothing from our bitter experience with Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Our biggest drawback has been the absence of a competent foreign minister, proficient in forging international diplomatic relations  the present incumbent is basically a finance person who has been made to wear the defence hat. It appears that the ongoing unrest in Tibet has been engineered by an organization like the CIA, with the objective of queering the pitch for the Beijing Olympics. Those who remember Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984 cannot escape a sense of dj vu.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray does not mince words when he talks about Indias shameless foreign policy vis--vis China. Indias ham-handed and safe response to the Tibetan crisis may be in keeping with its policy of not antagonizing China at any cost, but it is a shame that the land of the Mahatma has not stood up for arguably the most non-violent people on earth in their hour of need. The Dalai Lama has to be one of the last living embodiments of peace and non-violence, and it is hypocritical of a country that calls Mahatma Gandhi the father of the nation to not have the courage to publicly support him.          
	Even from a diplomatic point of view, Indias timid response is a dampener for those who expected it to capitalize on the Tibetan unrest. Tibet could have been used by India to put pressure on China to return the territories it had captured  including the part of Kashmir ceded to it illegally by Pakistan  and also to make it publicly recognize Sikkim as an integral part of India. If China succeeds in crushing the aspirations to freedom of the culturally distinct Tibetans  which seems imminent in the absence of global support  it will prove that non-violence only begets misery and failure when used on ruthless enemy like China.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur 

                
	Book bond          
	Sir  L.K. Advanis visit to Sonia Gandhis residence on Holi to give her a copy of his autobiography is being blown out of proportion (To Sonia, with My Life, March 23). If this was indeed a political gesture to improve Advanis public image, now that he is the Bharatiya Janata Partys prime ministerial candidate, then what harm is there in it? Both Sonia Gandhi and Advani have been in politics long enough to know that gimmicks go a long way in boosting their image. They may still be sworn enemies, contrary to the claims of the Congress spokesman, Abhishek Singhvi, or else Advani would not have presented Sonia Gandhi with a book where he has roundly criticized her. One wonders whether he really expects her to read it.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In his biography, My Country My Life, why has L.K. Advani not talked about the resounding defeat of his party and coalition in the 2004 general elections? Why does he not admit that the people rejected them because they could not provide good governance? As a leader, Advani is well-known for his doublespeak, and this has repeatedly been exposed during his partys tenure at the Centre.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Other worlds          
	Sir  A void will be created in the world of science fiction with Arthur C. Clarke passing away in Colombo on March 19 (Thank you, for dropping us on unknown planets, March 20). On the one hand, the world will miss a visionary and sci-fi mastermind, while on the other, the subcontinent will lose another famous Westerner who chose this part of the world to live. Clarke will be remembered as the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, on which Stanley Kubrick based his landmark film. India and Indian civilization had a marked impact on his writings, as borne out by works such as Rendezvous with Rama. He was in touch with Satyajit Ray, and the association was based on mutual respect. Rays script, The Alien, is considered to have provided the basis for Steven Spielbergs classic, E.T. In an article, Clarke had spoken out against what he viewed to be plagiarism on Spielbergs part. Arthur C. Clarke will go down in history not only as one of the greatest science-fiction writers, but also as a man of principles.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Arindam Ghosh, Nagpur

                
	Sir  Samit Basus tribute to Arthur C. Clarke revealed some facets of the late writers life that were hitherto unknown to us. One identifies with Basu when he says that most of us who were reading Clarke while growing up would discover the wonders of science in ways that the others never would. Clarke is one of the reasons behind science-fiction being recognized as a mainstream literary genre today. His death will be mourned by those who are curious about other worlds.           
	Yours faithfully,

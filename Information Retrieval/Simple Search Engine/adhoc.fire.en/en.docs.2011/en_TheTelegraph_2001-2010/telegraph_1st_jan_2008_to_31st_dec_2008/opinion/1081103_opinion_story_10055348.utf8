	My favourite rumour about US president-elect Barack Obamas cabinet is that he will create the post of Secretary of Environment and offer it to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course, its unlikely that Schwarzenegger would take the offer, because being governor of California is a much more satisfying job, but Obama will need a couple of Republicans in his cabinet and Arnie is serious about the environment. Stranger things have happened.         
	I know, Obama wont officially be president-elect until Tuesday night, so I shouldnt put it like that yet, but it really is over. The media have to keep it looking like a real race right down to the finish line, but you know and I know that Obama is going to win, possibly by a landslide.        
	With both presidential candidates essentially running against George W. Bush, the one who wasnt a Republican started with a huge built-in advantage, and then the financial crisis and the recession sealed John McCains fate. So now its time to consider what Obama will do with his power. And even how much power he will really have, given his spending options will be hugely constrained by the same recession.        
	It helps that the Democrats will have firm control of both houses of the Congress, but Obama will benefit even more from the fact that he is probably going to enjoy one of the longest honeymoons in presidential history. Americans, including most of those who didnt vote for him, are going to be very pleased with themselves for having elected an African-American as president.         
	Obama is extraordinarily fortunate that the huge financial bubble that built up on Bushs watch collapsed while the man responsible was still in office. So people will remember for some time that the recession that dominates the first years of his term is not actually his fault. That memory will eventually erode, of course, but if it is an ordinary two-year recession it will be coming to an end by the time the public starts to blame him for it, and the economy could be booming again by the time he runs for re-election.                
	Policy matters        
	But that is getting well ahead of ourselves. What big thing is he actually going to do early in his term to make his mark? It has to be something that doesnt cost too much, at least in the early stages, so the answer is almost surely healthcare reform. The long-term cost of giving basic medical cover to a sixth of the US population that currently has no cover will not be small, but Obama is unlikely to go for a comprehensive national system. The power of the insurance companies is too great for that. So it will be some insurance-based system supported by federal subsidies. By the time the system is running, federal revenues should be recovering from the recession.        
	Obama can also expect a honeymoon internationally, but it could be shorter. Opinion polls show that most people in the developed countries, and more in the developing ones, would back Obama. The standing of the US in the eyes of foreigners, so badly battered by eight years of George W. Bush, will soar as soon as Obama takes office, but one doubts whether American foreign policy will change all that much.        
	Obama will pull American troops out of Iraq by 2010 as promised, but he is promising to reinforce the US military commitment in Afghanistan, the allegedly winnable war, and he is also on record supporting American attacks on Pakistani territory without Islamabads permission. His forte has never been foreign policy, and there are disturbing signs that he has bought into the war on terror narrative that has dominated the American domestic debate since 9/11.        
	If that is the case, then Obamas present popularity in other countries will decline quite rapidly, but that is of limited interest to most Americans. They want healing at home more than anything else, and Obama can deliver that.

	Troubled land                  
	Sir  The editorial, Twilight of a state (Aug 31), declares Mamata Banerjee to be a political leader bent on getting political mileage at the cost of the economic development of the state. Perhaps it is a bit presumptuous to conclude that the small-car plant in West Bengal would have resulted in industrialists vying with each other to invest in the state. Singur is not an isolated case. The problem of huge swathes of land that have proved to be a bane for investment remains unsorted in India. If one small-car project were to be scrapped, as it has happened with the Tatas relocating the Nano plant, it would have no real impact on Bengals economy. The hue and cry raised by the media and the government about the salutary effects of the Tata project is overstated. In spite of heavy industrialization, the poverty level in Maharashtra has not decreased appreciably, while Punjab and Himachal Pradesh remain better off without any major industry. In an agrarian economy, development takes place only when agro-based industries are emphasized.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The reason why the government of West Bengal is not taking any action against Mamata Banerjee seems to be rather perverse. Now that the Tatas have announced that they will not be manufacturing the Nano in Singur, the blame for the mishap can be squarely placed on Banerjee and her party. The peoples sentiment at the moment is such that Banerjee would have to bear the brunt of their ire. She would be labelled the sole culprit responsible for the death of industrialization in the state. Such a denouement was perhaps ideal for the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The dismal performance of the Left in the last panchayat elections has made the CPI(M) realize that it would not be wise to quell the opposition against industry by using force. The Left should realize that the shocking results of the panchayat polls were caused by the atrocities the party committed in Nandigram. Buddhadeb Bhatacharjee must understand that industrialization in Bengal cannot happen by killing people or by remaining idle even as a project worth crores has now been shelved.           
	Yours faithfully,           Rajesh Kumar Sharma, Kankinara, North 24 Parganas                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra makes a pragmatic appeal in A way out for Singur (Aug 29) by asking the warring parties to arrive at a compromise. This paradigm shift  from domination to consensus  must have been a spontaneous change of heart rather than one that was forced by political expediencies. Even a functioning democracy cannot right wrongs on its own. Any negotiation on Singur should have begun with an admission by the government that all was not well with Singur ab initio. A party that withdrew support from the United Progressive Alliance government over the lack of transparency in the Indo-US nuclear deal preferred not to reveal the agreement it entered into with the Tatas in the state assembly. This initial highhandedness, arbitrariness and obfuscation of facts, made the governments conduct appear suspicious. With the Tatas now out of the picture, a compromise is now irrelevant. But had the negotiations started with an open admission by the Left that it was wrong on several counts  like imposing Section 144 or arranging for a bhoomi puja on the plot before it was formally handed over to the Tatas  a solution could have been found. Violent events  Tapasi Maliks death being the most gruesome  have turned Singur into a hornets nest. Bengal continues with its glorious tradition of political resistance but what was considered revolutionary in another time may appear criminal in the globalized world.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It was a pleasure reading Ashok Mitras solution to the Singur imbroglio. His suggestions are, for a change, unbiased, rational and worth serious consideration.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Soumit Dutt, Calcutta
                  
	Sir  Before the Tatas announced their departure, Ashok Mitra, in his article, had suggested that the state government should persuade Tata Motors to pass 25 per cent equity. Of this, the government keeps 12.5 per cent and the remaining half is to be allotted to the people who earned their living from the acquired land. But why just the Tatas? Why not include reputed companies like Bosch, Gabriel, Exide, Behr in the deal, since they are supposed to provide the ancillary services? Moreover, the profit margin of a company largely depends on the fluctuations in the share market. Who then will shoulder the duty of teaching the semi-literate farmers about the nuances of share markets that do not go by any thumb rule? Further, how long would the farmers be allowed to enjoy such ownership? The inclusion of bureaucrats and politicians on the board of directors of a company has never really proved to be effective. Would it be prudent to allow the government to get involved? A free economy cannot flourish if entrepreneurial activities are thwarted time and again in public interest.           
	Yours faithfully,         Narayan Das, Calcutta
                  
	Sir  Unlike the selfish urban elite, Ashok Mitra is sympathetic towards the woes of the displaced farmers. Driving out industries is bad, but forcible eviction of poor, unwilling farmers from their ancestral land is worse. The Singur crisis could have been solved if the Tatas came up with the proposal to build housing colonies for the land losers and offered permanent employment to at least one family member at the car plant. After all, a sum of money cannot serve as adequate compensation for lost land.  
	Yours faithfully,         Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Great empire in ruins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A GREAT EMPIRE IN RUINS                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Many decades ago, Calcutta was a thriving cultural metropolis, a business hub, and an intellectual capital that had embraced plurality and diversity. The experiences and ideas, experiments and innovations made Calcutta a role model for the other cities in India. Then, in the 1950s, an assertion by the Bengalis that Calcutta should be for the Bengalis and by the Bengalis, diluted the collective creative energy that had made the city special, dissipated its vitality and the lively city became a relic of the past and chronically ill.        
	Now, it is the turn of Bombay, or Mumbai, to confront and grapple with a potentially similar fate. The prerogative of the Marathi manoos is all very well, but it will alienate Maharashtra from the rest of the country. Divisive politics makes no sense at all in a large, plural, multi-cultural and multi-lingual polity. It may ignite a false sense of Maharashtrian pride for a short term, but is bound to have a negative impact in the long run, particularly in a changed world, where communication and sharing of skills and services have begun to dominate the economic and social agendas for growth, change and development. To force a closing of the Indian mind when cooperation, dialogue and consensus are imperative for peace and progress, is equivalent to a severe assault on the body of India.        
	If all professional foreigners in Mumbai, the imported work force, were to put down their tools for one week  stop driving taxis, running hospitals, teaching in schools, selling in markets or even supplying food and other essentials that come from factories in the other states  Mumbai and Maharashtra would be crippled. Industry, business, financial institutions, Bollywood and more, may translocate next-door to Gujarat. Mumbai would whither away. Today, it is unlivable to say the least. Land mafias are making money, the political class is handing over prime areas for a high price, no one cares about the environment. And the standard excuse is that the non-Marathas are occupying the limited space, when in fact it is the faulty, corrupt governance that has brought Mumbai and all our other cities and towns, on their knees.                
	Lost mandate        
	Great cities die because of the parochial mindset of those who claim rulership. Usually before the fall of an empire, the insecure ruler gets desperate to assert his authority in a fast-fading political space where governance, over the decades, has failed to deliver the promises! Bombay is hurtling down that governance and soon the fabric of Mumbai will begin to fray. In no time it will become an erstwhile cosmopolitan megapolis. Maybe this is the natural teutonic shift that allows new centres to emerge and bloom.         
	The time now is perfect for each state to choose one city that will be the model for the future towns of a rapidly transforming urban India. There is a rich and strong socio-cultural diversity in many states of India that make them perfect. The linguistic diversity, too, makes this nation truly special and one of a kind. To celebrate this inherent strength of Bharat, we need to extricate ourselves from the political, and more importantly, the bureaucratic mire.         
	A cohesive multi-disciplinary project in each state would enhance and encourage a positive change. These projects must involve the citizens, from all castes and creeds, all classes and faiths; and make use of their professional skills to satisfy their many needs, and make them the stakeholders, responsible and accountable for the habitat that their children will inherit. The government only has to provide a well-oiled machine of an honest, functioning, responsible and active infrastructure committed to an integrity of spirit. But that had been its only mandate, which it has already lost on the way.

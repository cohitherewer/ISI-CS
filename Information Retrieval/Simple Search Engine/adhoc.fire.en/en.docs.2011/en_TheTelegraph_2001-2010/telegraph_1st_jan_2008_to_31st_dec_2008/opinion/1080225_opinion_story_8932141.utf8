	Fresh start                  
	Sir  Almost a week after the election results were declared in Pakistan, it is slowly becoming clear that a coalition government will rule the country. However, the post-election political marginalization of the countrys Islamist forces is undoubtedly, a positive development (Islamist phalanx routed all across Pakistan, Feb 20). The United States of America and Pakistan have jointly promoted terrorism all over the world. While Pakistan provided the men  jihadis  who were given the task of liberating Afghanistan and Kashmir from infidel Russia and India  the US provided money and material for this noble cause. Today, both Pakistan and America feel that the monster needs to be terminated, but only because it has turned against its mentors. The people of Pakistan have rejected the very forces that have made the country a haven for militants. The new government has to take the cue and free the country of terrorists completely.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The drubbing suffered by the Kings Party in the Pakistan elections shows how unpopular Pervez Musharraf is with the voters. The verdict reflects the peoples desire to rid Pakistan of a dictator and usher in a liberal, democratic and stable government. The people of Pakistan have spoken through the ballot. Now the politicians will have to deliver what they had promised the people in order to ensure that democracy is not subverted again in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa 

                
	Sir  The Pakistan Muslim League (Q), which had the support of the president, has been routed in the polls of February 18. This has led many to believe that the recent elections were free and fair. This, however, cannot be true. That is simply because it is impossible to hold free and fair elections in a country that has a dictator at the helm of affairs.           
	There are several factors that contributed to the PML(Q)s defeat. Benazir Bhuttos tragic death has turned her into a martyr. As a result, those who were set to vote for the PML(Q) either abstained or voted in favour of the Pakistan Peoples Party. Musharrafs future now looks shaky, especially if the new government were to restore the judges who had been ousted by the president. However, it would be wrong to write off Musharraf just yet. Neither the PPP nor Nawaz Sharifs PML (Nawaz) has an absolute majority. Asif Ali Zardari, the PPP leader, may have joined hands with Sharif and ruled out having any truck with Musharraf at the moment, but politicians seldom honour their promises. Hence, it would not be surprising if Zardari and Musharraf were to strike a deal. If Musharraf is to survive, he has to see that a coalition is formed between the PPP, the PML-Q, and the MQM, leaving Sharifs party out of the arrangement. But will the General succeed in his plan? The next few days would certainly give the world the answer.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Shameek Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The PPP and the PML(N) are inching closer to forming the next government in Pakistan, but will they manage to bury their differences? Forming the government will hardly be the end of their worries. The president, Pervez Musharraf, still retains the power to dismiss the government whenever he wants. Hence, whichever party comes to power would have to concur with Musharrafs wishes. This, effectively, puts paid to hopes of Musharrafs impeachment.           
	The only way the president could have been removed from power was for any one party to get a two-thirds majority in the parliament. Since that has not happened, much to the chagrin of Pakistans citizens, the stalemate would continue.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Democracy has its own way of settling scores. After the elections, the PPP and the PML(N) have emerged as the leading contenders for power in Pakistan. They would now have to stitch together an alliance to run the country. Perhaps Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif need to take lessons from Indias politicians who have mastered the art of forging successful coalitions.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  The people of Pakistan should be congratulated for bringing back democracy and clipping the wings of a dictator president. We would now want to see Pakistan as a stable, peaceful, democratic nation. After all, India and Pakistan have many things in common. The people of Pakistan have always wished India well. But successive military regimes in Pakistan have tried to poison the peoples minds against their neighbours. Now that democracy has returned to Pakistan, Indians hope that the two governments would try and improve mutual ties through commerce and culture.           
	Yours faithfully,

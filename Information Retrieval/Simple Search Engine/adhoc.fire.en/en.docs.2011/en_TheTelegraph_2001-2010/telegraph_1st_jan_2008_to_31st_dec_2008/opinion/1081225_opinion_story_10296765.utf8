	Contrary to popular perception, reporting in China isnt just about accepting party handouts. Beijings China Youth Daily ranks journalism as the third most dangerous profession in the country, after policing and mining. Reporters have been arrested, and even killed, for travelling hundreds of miles to expose party officials up to all kinds of things far away from Beijings eagle eye. But like in any democracy, media uproar has led to quick punitive action.        
	This month, two Beijing reporters were arrested for taking bribes. While one was picked up by police sent from outside Beijing, the other was whisked away from the lobby of a hotel in a town far away from the capital. The family could obtain the hotel CCTV footage showing him being taken away and pushed into a car, and released it to a Beijing paper.         
	Like in India, here too, the reporters family wasnt informed about his arrest. The first call they received was a day after the footage was published, 15 days after his disappearance. The caller identified himself as a policeman and told them to bring medicines and money for the reporter, who was in their custody. No other details were given.         
	This senior reporter was investigating the illegality of a government official continuing to hold an executive post in a real estate firm. When this story broke, the media were already up in arms about the arrest of a popular TV reporter in Beijing who had been investigating the alleged partisan role of a local government in a land dispute between two businessmen in a far-away town. Significantly, the official who ordered her arrest was the very man whose role she had been investigating. She was charged with taking bribes from the brother of one of the businessmen. In fact, during the course of her investigation, she had started having an affair with the brother. As of now, the authorities have banned all investigations into her arrest.                 
	Uneasy bond        
	The two apparently unrelated incidents have an important common thread: both journalists were investigating the abuse of power in Shanxi province. Journalists in this western mining province have themselves been the focus of news. In January 2007, a reporter was beaten to death by the goons of an illegal mineowner. His death was quickly converted by the authorities into a debate on real and fake reporters, for he was not an accredited journalist. It was made out that he was really into extortion, when suddenly President Hu Jintao himself stepped in. Immediately, the mine-owner was arrested and the family provided legal aid.         
	In October, a landslide  passed off as a natural disaster with just a few deaths  was exposed by a journalist to have been caused by an illegal mine, resulting in four times the official number of deaths. Websites that picked up the report were immediately blocked. The journalist then posted on his personal blog a letter to the Shanxi governor on this cover-up. Three days later, Premier Wen Jiabao ordered an inquiry.         
	In October again, came another expos  of the media themselves. Newspapers carried pictures taken by a journalist, showing reporters gathered at the office of a mine where one person had died in an accident. They were shown signing the register, collecting slips and queuing up for cash from the mine management.         
	But Shanxi isnt the only province that has an uneasy relationship with the media. Early this year, a party secretary from the eastern Liaoning province ordered the arrest of a reporter in Beijing, who had been investigating the allegedly illegal arrest of a businesswoman on his orders. The reporter was accused of having taken bribes from the businesswomans sister. Again, the media uproar resulted in the case being dropped and the party secretary sacked. Last month, he was back as deputy director of a light-rail project.

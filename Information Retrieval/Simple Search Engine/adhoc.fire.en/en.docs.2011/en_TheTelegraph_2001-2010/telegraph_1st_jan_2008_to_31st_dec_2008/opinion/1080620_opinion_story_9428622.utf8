	Home thoughts from abroad            
	Happiness and other disorders: short stories (Penguin, Rs 299) by Ahmad Saidullah begins with a deliciously frank editor note pleading helplessness for the collection of stories that follow his introduction. He had discovered these stories in a gigantic black trunk, after his inquisitive wife fell into it. Chronically spineless  a medical disability as much as a marital one  the editor, M. Samiullah, leaves off his research on the hidden forms of the divine in Shamshuddins calligraphy to reproduce these stories, some of which are clearly untenable, if not impossible, he confesses. The tales engage with the lives of characters in a north Indian small town ravaged by religious violence. Ahmed Saidullah is tantalizingly witty and presents the savagery of communal riots in all its searing rawness.                         
	Dear Popples: Love letters from an unlikely mother (Undercover Utopia, Rs 225) by Anouradha Bakshi mentions in the blurb that it is a simple book. It has no clever sentences. Indeed, it does not. This is the effusive, moralistic outpouring of a social worker to the child she rescues from the clutches of death and takes in while his mother is battling alcoholism in a rehabilitation centre. The author is undoubtedly well-intentioned in her maternal decrees to little Popples about life, people and godJi, but her epistolary cooings to her angel boy are tiresome and dreadfully inelegant.                         
	 Families at home (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Reeti Gadekar melds crime fiction with family drama in an engrossing thriller. ACP Nikhil Juneja, a foul-mouthed and brash Delhi cop, is asked to look into the suicide of one of the daughters of the capitals most respectable industrialist families. Investigations reveal that the suicide was in fact a deviously plotted murder and a trail of dirty family secrets is uncovered. Family ties become an important concern in the novel, with the protagonist struggling to reconcile himself to his own uneasy relationship with his father, as he observes the differing importance and role of the family in the lives of the people he comes in contact with. Gadekars incisive wit invests the narrative with an endearing bonhomie. This lightens the tone of murder, intrigue, and corruption in the police force that runs through the novel, without ever making light of these compelling issues.                        
	 Parenting with purpose: Five keys to raising children with values and vision (Macmillan, Rs 295) by Robert W. Reasoner and Marilyn L. Lane is a handbook that analyses and offers guidelines to parents. A team of counsellors and child specialists design activity plans and set out a curriculum of proper, purposeful parenting. Although helpful, the book can get frightening in its inveterate sunniness at times.                                 
	Lands i live in: Poems (Mayapple, Rs 300) by Zilka Joseph tells the immigrant story, with all its anxiety of displacement. The first section of this slim volume describes the poets migration to Chicago from India to join her husband, while the second recalls memories of home. Josephs poetry is intimate and conversational, drawing the reader into her exploration of an unfamiliar land. Her expression of loss and realization of the foreignness of her surroundings are powerfully conveyed, as in Green card: the dust in the creases of the poets Indian passport knows its days are numbered and lets itself be taken to undisclosed destinations as she queues up for her green card.

	Differing standards                  
	Sir  It is heartening to note that the masses have started reacting to the high-handed actions of the political parties in calling bandhs in West Bengal (P-Power and party power, June 6). The way the minister for urban development, Asok Bhattacharya, was stopped from leaving the stranded Darjeeling Mail in Kishanganj by his fellow-travellers, bore the stamp of spontaneous action. The minister was forced to admit that the bandhs the politicians so frequently call cause no end of pain to the public. It is time Indias political parties, particularly the leftist ones, realized that they cannot take the public for granted and that their Bastille may be attacked by the masses when the situation spins out of their limits of tolerance.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amit Brahmo, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The 12-hour Bangla bandh sponsored by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) last Thursday had a rather adverse impact on the partys prominent member and cabinet minister, Asok Bhattacharya. As the Siliguri-bound train in which he was travelling was stalled by the bandh enforcers near Kishanganj, the minister got a taste of his own medicine. Bhattacharyas political influence failed to run the train on time. Dilip Singh and his fellow passengers did the right thing in preventing the minister from going to Siliguri by road. To make matters worse, the minister engaged in an unsavoury altercation with his co-passengers. The manner in which Dilip Singh was threatened is a blot on the democratic ideals that the country is supposed to uphold. Bhattacharya is a veteran leader; he should have been aware of the fact that he is nothing without the support of the people behind him. Under the circumstances, it was silly of him to misbehave with the people, particularly when they were bearing the brunt of his partys whim.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The pictures of protest against the oil price hike in Bangalore and Bhopal, published in The Telegraph of June 6, make for an interesting comparison with West Bengal. While the Reds were out to make the laggard economy of this state bleed further by stopping all work in a state-sponsored bandh, other cities and parties were finding novel ways of protesting  mainly by taking out non-fuel-consuming carriages on the road. The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh himself, along with his cabinet colleagues, rode a bicycle to work. What a stark difference of political attitude! To citizens of this country, protests of the latter kind hold more meaning than those resorted to by the Left parties, which bring nothing but suffering on the people. What could be more illogical than causing losses of crores of rupees to the public and the government in the name of protesting against rising prices. The losses incurred by the poor and the middle classes during a bandh far outweigh the influence of oil price hike on their living expenses for a year or two. No wonder the people of a Bengal-bound train resorted to the extreme step of detaining a minister travelling on the same train.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Mandal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Asok Bhattacharyas predicament on bandh day perfectly illustrates the double standards of Left politicians. They have no problem with their party cadre using strong-arm tactics to bring about a complete suspension of public utility services, causing untold miseries to daily wage-earners, patients, children and stranded passengers in railway stations and airports. But if the long-suffering public show the temerity to make a minister share their troubles, our communist leaders see red (pun intended). The minister sent out this message loud and clear by having his protesting co-passenger, Dilip Singh, arrested.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Against all odds          
	Sir  It was really inspiring to learn that in gender-equal societies, girls score more than boys in mathematics (All things equal, girls score in math, May 30). The results of the study by Italian and American economists have well and truly exploded the myth that girls are weak in mathematics and science subjects in general. The study has also revealed that a girls underperformance in mathematics relative to that of a boy is contingent upon gender-inequality in a society. Boys in india on an average score higher than girls in maths primarily because Indian society has never been fair to its girls. But the trend of girls outperforming boys in board examinations  for the second year running a girl has topped the Madhyamik in Bengal  is a clear indication that as standards of gender-equality rises, so does the performance of girls.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Around this time every year, we come to know about some exceptional boys and girls who struggle against enormous odds in pursuit of academic excellence. This year too, Narasimha Rao, a poor teenager from a small village in Andhra Pradesh, has cracked the IIT entrance examination. There was the case of Anshuman Panda from a Bengal village securing a fully-funded entry into the MIT. Only some days back, 30 brilliant but poor students from Bihar, who were taught by two dedicated teachers under the banner of Super-30, cleared the IIT entrance examination.           
	While incidents like these generate a great deal of hope about the future of the country, what dashes much of this hope is the attempt of power-hungry politicians to upset this rule of merit by introducing reservation wherever they get a chance. It is ironic that the same politicians who cry themselves hoarse demanding for quotas for the backward classes, provide no financial help to the likes of Narasimha Rao, who did not need any quota to clear the IIT entrance test, but would need money to make it to the IIT counselling in Chennai. Reservation given on economic grounds is acceptable, but caste-based quotas can only compromise the standards of education in the country.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TOUGH ON TIPPLERS                              If the government accepts the recommendations of a parliamentary committee on drunken driving, the law will no longer be lenient to those who have a tipple too many and get behind the wheel, 
  says V. Kumara Swamy                        None for the road: No matter how tempting they look, avoid drinks if you are planning to drive, or you may have to pay a hefty fine				                                 
	November 12, 2006: Alistair Pereira, a 21-year-old drunk driver, caused the death of seven persons and injured seven others in Mumbai.The trial court said that the evidence was insufficient to apply stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code. The punishment he got was three years of rigorous imprisonment, that too after the intervention of the Bombay High Court last year.        
	But if the government accepts the recommendations of a parliamentary committee on drunken driving, the law will no longer be lenient with the Pereiras of the world.         
	Dont mix drinking and driving. And if you do, be ready to pay for your offence is the message of the committee that has suggested tough provisions for errant drivers and repeat offenders. Whether it is speeding, using mobile phones while driving or the issuing of driving licenses, it has come out with a slew of suggestions to make the roads safer for everybody.         
	The Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill, 2007, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha by the Union ministry of road transport and highways on May 15, 2007. It was referred to the parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, headed by Sitaram Yechury, for examining the Bill and to recommend changes. The committee submitted its report recently to Parliament.         
	One of the significant suggestions of the committee relates to accidents caused by drunken driving. The panel has asked the government to amend the necessary legislation to include deaths as a result of drunken driving as culpable homicide not amounting to murder. According to the committee a drunken driving accident should not be considered as mere negligence as it is nowadays, but be treated as the premeditated commitment of a crime and the driver be punished under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code.         
	The main aim of the committee was to see to it that provisions against drunken driving are strict so that the roads are made safe for everybody. The offenders cannot be allowed to get away lightly, says Yechury.         
	Activists campaigning against drunken driving have welcomed the step. If the driver of a vehicle is drunk, an accident caused by him should be treated as premeditated murder, and it should be a non-bailable offence, says Prince Singhal, president, Community Against Drunken Driving (CADD), Delhi.         
	In my opinion, drunken driving should be banned completely and violators should be dealt with strictly, says Mabel Rebello, member of parliament and an advocate of stringent laws against drunken driving.         
	But not all are convinced that the provision will stand the test of the courts. It is a debatable issue. The court may not accept that the accident is premeditated murder, and it might lead to further complications in getting a conviction, says Maxwell Pereira, former joint commissioner of police (traffic), Delhi. According to Pereira, impounding licences and increased drives against drunken driving are better solutions.         
	More than one lakh people die in road accidents in India, and most of these are due to drunken driving. These are the official statistics; now imagine the number of unreported deaths. India has just overtaken China when it comes to road accidents, and that is a very dubious distinction we can do without, says Singhal.         
	The committee has rejected the one-time penalty for drunken driving proposed by the ministry and instead suggested a slab system. A fine to the tune of Rs 2,000 has been recommended for the driver if the level of alcohol in blood is detected to be 30-60mg/100ml. If the level is 60-150mg/100ml, a fine of Rs 4,000 and if the level is 150mg and above per 100ml of blood, a fine of Rs 5,000 with a provision to cancel the driving licence have been proposed.               
	This was after a deposition of the officials of the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE) who said that the breath alcohol tests conducted on drunken drivers proved that they had alcohol level of 30mg to 200mg and above in 100ml of blood. The more the quantity of alcohol, more vulnerable drivers will be to accidents.         
	Some, however, argue that the government could have been far tougher here. I think the panel missed a chance. The driver who is found to be driving under the influence of alcohol should not be allowed to drive at all, and his vehicle should be impounded on the spot, rather than giving a chance to the police to indulge in corruption, says Singhal.         
	Agrees Arul Rhaj, chairman, Indian Alcohol Policy Alliance, a nongovernmental organisation involved in anti-drinking drives. The government should make the law even more stringent and suspend the driving licence of the first time offender for a year; a repeat offence should lead to permanent suspension, he says.         
	One of the sticking points when it comes to implementing the laws against drunken driving is states that own liquor stores. If certain states are reluctant to make the laws stringent, it is the duty of the central government to raise the issue and prevail upon them, says Yechury.         
	The committee has also suggested slab rates for speeding as the danger increases manifold when the vehicle is driven at 90km or at 120km per hour. The committee has suggested a fine of Rs 500 for 20 per cent more than the speed limit, and Rs 1,000 for 50 per cent more than the speed limit as well as cancellation of licence and being arrested under Section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act.         
	The central government has been asked to create common software to be used in all motor vehicles offices of the country and connect these electronically so that a real time database can be created at the all India level on the lines of the National Crime Record Bureau. This will help stop the culprits from obtaining multiple licences and also in apprehending repeat offenders, says Rhaj.         
	The committee has also asked the ministry to have a separate section defining the penalties for using mobile phones while driving. Although the government has issued an executive order on the usage of mobile phones, it is silent on issues like hands-free phones, talking while at a traffic signal and others.         
	Taking note that there is no provision for the civil liability of a driver if he causes accidents, the panel has proposed a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 if one drives a motor vehicle in a rash or negligent manner, causing injury to a person or damage to any property. The amount collected in the form of penalties will be credited to the Solatium Fund, which will be used for the accident victims.         
	The committee has also endorsed the outsourcing of the job of granting driving licences to various automobiles associations to bring down the burden on the regional transport offices (RTOs) which are the sole authorities to issue licences.         
	The licence issuing authorities are overburdened and corrupt. It makes sense for the government to hand over some of these responsibilities as we have a ready infrastructure and we are also capable of doing a good job, says T.K. Malhotra of the Automobile Association of Upper India (AAUI), Delhi.         
	The suggestions if implemented will act as a deterrent to law breakers and law abiding citizens will feel safer, says Yechury.

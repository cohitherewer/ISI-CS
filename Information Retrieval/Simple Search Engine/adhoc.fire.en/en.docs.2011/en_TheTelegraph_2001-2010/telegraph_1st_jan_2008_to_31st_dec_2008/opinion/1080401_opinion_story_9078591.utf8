                                                                                                                 ROAMING INDIA                                                    
	Rahul Gandhi is on his own trip to discover India. His grandfather discovered India by remembering things past, while Mr Gandhi wants to know India in the present and in the grim, real light. The journey of discovery began in Uttar Pradesh and has entered Karnataka after a tour of Orissa. This is no whistle-stop election campaign tour. Mr Gandhi is spending time among the people to learn about their lives and their problems. There can be no doubt about the sincerity of the man who, for security and other reasons, has so far had a very sheltered existence. He has been honest enough to admit that his lineage allows him an easy entry into politics. But instead of wallowing in the advantages of birth, Mr Gandhi has chosen to learn about his country and its people the hard way. This by no reckoning is the typical behaviour on the part of someone who is often seen as the heir apparent. Whether Mr Gandhi will ever become the leader of the country is a matter that history will decide. What is obvious at the moment is that, within the Congress and within Indian politics, he represents, for reasons of his age alone, a breath of fresh air. Mr Gandhi is not yet forty: he can no longer be called young. But by the standards of Indian politicians, he will probably be considered under-age. His age brings for Mr Gandhi certain advantages: hope and the expectation of change.        
	Mr Gandhi cannot afford to ignore that while he is learning, he is also being watched. Wherever he is going, he is carrying the message of youth and of something new. The latter is related to his promise to establish a proper democratic process in the internal organization of the Congress. This promise can only boost the morale of the party workers, but a failure to deliver on the promise will be a disaster. Mr Gandhi cannot be unaware of the double-edged nature of the message he is taking to the people and to Congress workers. His father, Rajiv Gandhi, had similarly raised expectations and had failed to deliver. As a son and as a leader of a new generation, Mr Gandhi needs to draw the right lessons from his fathers career. There is, of course, a critical difference between father and son. The former had leadership thrust upon him. Mr Gandhi is trying to acquire the right to lead. This difference is something novel in Indian politics even though an early promise is often deceptive.

                        Laughing at Myself (Nijeke Dekhi Aar Hansi)				                                       
	The violently coloured, larger-than-life protagonist of Sumitro Basaks On the Verge (CIMA, until April 8) is the exact opposite, or an inside-out version, of Kafkas hunger artist. Kafkas artist ends up performing the art of fasting in a circus, to the gaping hordes, for longer and longer periods of time, until he is killed by his own performance. He fasts not just to entertain, but also to fight against a whole world of non-understanding, which stupidly assumes that it is fatally difficult to fast, when it is actually the easiest thing to do. And before he dies, he whispers to the overseer of the circus, with his lips pursed, as if for a kiss, that he could not help fasting because I couldnt find the food I liked. If I had found it, believe me, I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else.        
	Basaks man seems to have found, with a vengeance, the food he likes. He is the devouring, rather than the fasting, artist. And he eats up endlessly fabricated, hotly selling, global, postmodern trash. He has an insatiable appetite for prettiness in loud, trendy colours and blown-up patterns (Seventies retro-chic florals, stripes, checks, polka dots), and this theatre of spectacular consumption is about absorbing the food of the world, and about eliminating it too. Hence the eaters relationship with what he eats is violently divided: his voracity is fuelled as much by revulsion towards the deliciously pretty as by a compulsion to engage with it and even to churn it out with apparent effortlessness.         
	The visual elements through which this internal conflict is played out are the loudness of the colours, largeness of scale and a ruthless simplification of forms. On entering the exhibition, there is an initial delight afforded by the bright colours and happy patterns. One recalls, rather unthinkingly, the cut-outs from Matisses Jazz, made from such brightly coloured paper in the artists last years that his doctor had advised him to work with dark glasses on. But the vibrant happiness of Matisses Late Style is very different in character from the youthful virulence of Basaks best work, the sly pleasure it takes in seducing the viewer with its apparent delightfulness and then confronting him with something irreverent, ungentle or menacing. Some of the sharpest and most restless work in On the Verge owe rather to the paper-cuts, abstract as well as figurative, that Benodebehari Mukherjee made in the late Fifties and Sixties.        
	Yet, On the Verge is acrylic on canvas and not cut-out on paper, although some of the small, post-card-size versions of the large canvases are done with paper cut-outs. So, a great deal of skill and steadiness of hand and body is required to create the effect of paper in acrylic, especially the uniformity of the colour fields and the sharp edges that define their shapes. It is ironic, too, that in order to do this, Basak uses the techniques of colouring and line taught in his miniature-painting classes when he was studying art at Santiniketan and closely acquainting himself with Pahari and Rajput miniatures. When the closeness and precision of smaller-scale work is used to paint on large canvases, then the intimacy and exquisiteness of miniature painting turn into a virtuosic impersonality that blocks out the quiet, contemplative viewing that small works elicit.        
	This seems to be a deliberate strategy in Basak, and is part of his ambiguous relationship with the world that provides him with subjects as well as viewers  with the food for his art. If you dont want to be made to think by my art, then you dont have to. Why dont you just look? this recent work seems to be saying, not without a certain flirtatious condescension, blocking out thought by the assault of pure visuality. There is thus a kind of vengefully prettified anger in these works that is totally un-Matissean. The huge, immaculately painted colour-forms that make up each image give it a flat, utterly superficial quality  pure surfaces that annul any possibility of depth, spotless carpets under which the messiness and treacherous complexity of the actual world (in which all art is embedded) are hidden away. And only those who are clever enough, paranoid enough or narcissistic enough can guess what might have been swept away, or under, in the process.        
	This is an art that swallows everything and then lets us see what happens to this food inside the body. Yet the eater reveals nothing, or perhaps has nothing to reveal. And sometimes, among the lovely shapes and colours surrounding it, the bodys only truth is to be an empty place  form as nothingness.

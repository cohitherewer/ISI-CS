	A marriage of convenience such as the one between the Congress and the Left is always a matter of a fine balance. The crucial question is who determines the terms of the balance. Looking back over the last four years, it can be said without too many doubts that the Left has determined the balance in the Congress-Left relationship. The Left parties, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have consistently kept the Congress on the back foot because of its control over the number of members of parliament necessary for the survival of the Congress-led government. Enjoying the privilege of having power without responsibility, the Left has scuppered all major policy initiatives  from the progress of economic reforms to the Indo-US nuclear deal. On the latter, the Left parties threatened to withdraw support and bring down the government. The Congress has taken all this lying down. The leadership of the Congress has failed to seize the initiative from the Left. Here, Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, could learn a thing or two from her late mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi. The senior Ms Gandhi, even when she was in the minority within the Congress, after she split the party, never allowed control to slip from her. Friend and foe both knew she was the boss and she determined the terms of all relationships. The role of the withdrawn leader was not something she liked, and she knew such a role was singularly unsuited to Indian politics.        
	The Left and Congress have only one reason for staying together: to stop the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Left would prefer a weak Congress whose direction it can dictate. The Congress would also like a weak Left. But the situation as it is emerging after the panchayat polls will probably mean that the comrades will gain in West Bengal only at the expense of the Congress since the latter will never join a grand anti-Left alliance of which the BJP is a part. This looks like a possible scenario. But there is another theoretical possibility, provided the Congress moves with finesse and with much more courage than it has shown so far. It can go for an early and a snap poll after signing the nuclear deal, and use the latter against the Left. This could seriously reduce the Lefts numbers in a new Lok Sabha, and thus free the Congress from the Lefts shackles. But between the theory and its realization, there is the cloud of a leadership in rigor mortis.

	Life begins at dusk                
	Discourses on Aging and Dying (Sage, Rs 350) edited by Suhita Chopra Chatterjee, Priyadarshi Patnaik and Vijayaraghavan M. Chariaris an unusual book in the sense that it explores the truth about these inevitable yet painful bodily processes from widely different perspectives, ranging from the philosophical, spiritual and ethical to the political and medical. Thus one gets know of what the Vedas, the Hadith or the Buddhist scriptures say of dying and death in Section I, while Section II has such essays as those on the socio-ethical issues in the existing paradigm of care for the elderly or on the gender issues in care giving. Interestingly, all the essays analysing the religious view include discourses on suicide and euthanasia, which are banned by most modern States. The case studies done by Paromita Ghosh and Anindita Dey reveal facts that might be heartening to the elderly people who find themselves rejected by their families. Statistics say that although most aged people prefer to stay with their spouses and children, those living in old-age homes feel less depressed than their counterparts living within the family.                        
	3, Zakia Mansion (Penguin, Rs 200) by Gouri Dange tells the story of a disintegrating Parsi household through the protagonist, Shaheen, whose life alters irreversibly as the fortunes of her family change for the worse. The more Shaheen tries to belong, the more she finds herself drifting away, first as a daughter, then as a wife and a mother. All the time, the burden of memories keeps getting heavier and is marked by the photographs that are clicked diligently at every family event. The novella that has a house address as it title is ultimately about the need to lose oneself on lifes interminable roads.                          
	The Courtesans Keeper: A Satire from Ancient Kashmir (Rupa, Rs 150) by A.N.D. Haksar is a translation of the Sanskrit work, Samaya Matrika, by Kshemendra, an 11th-century Kashmiri writer. The beautiful courtesan, Kalavati, searches for a new madam and finds one in Kankali. Perhaps symbolizing the close association between eros and thanatos, the cadaverous Kankali teaches Kalavati the rules of love. Granting that the beauty of Sanskrit is difficult to translate into English, Haksars prose sounds a bit too jerky in places.

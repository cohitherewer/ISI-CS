                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Selective sympathy                  
	Sir  By reprimanding M.S. Dhoni for sacrificing a goat in a Ranchi temple, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is trying to get some media coverage and gain lost ground (Miffed PeTa writes to Dhoni, March 20). In 2007, PeTA opted to remain a mute spectator when Shambo, a bull held sacred by a large number of Hindus in Britain was killed. For over three months, thousands protested peacefully, pleading that Shambo be deported to India, but to no avail. A global organization like PeTA, with its office in London, did nothing to stop the authorities from killing Shambo. PeTA has lost the right to preach.

	Terminal illness          
	Sir  As Abhijit Bhattacharyya has pointed out, not only are most of Indias airports hopelessly clogged, the quality of services and amenities is shoddy in even the best of them (Time to clear the air, March 27). However, this is not a problem unique to India. In Britain, Heathrow has faced complaints regarding delays, overpriced shops and never-ending security checks that make journeys an ordeal. The author is correct in saying that replacing a public monopoly (Airports Authority of India here or British Airport Authority in the United Kingdom) with a private one does nothing to solve the problem, as the underlying incentive to modernize the facilities is missing. However, parallels cannot really be drawn with China. As an authoritarian regime, it can bulldoze its citizens into submission and complete projects faster than a democracy. Look at the furore over Heathrows Terminal 5, and you will find simi- larities with the Indian situation.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The reporting on the recent airport employees strike or work-to-rule at the airports has been heavily biased. The report, Death of an airport, executed by saviours (March 14), talks of the Centres assurance to the striking employees that the former would talk to the developers of the new airport if the old facilities (meaning the Begumpet airport) could be made viable. The same report also states that the old airport had been making a profit of Rs 2.5 billion every year. Is this not ample proof of viability? The photograph of the old airport shows a sign reading Rajiv Gandhi Terminal, but the airport itself was named after N.T. Rama Rao. It is strange that the NDA government had agreed to do away with the Telugu Desam leaders name, given that the TDP is an NDA ally. An advertisement of the new airport which appeared in the same issue of The Telegraph boasts of the countrys longest runway of 4.26km. Is it not common for first-class international airports to have more than one runway? Maybe the Shamshabad airport too would, in due course, add one or more such runways, but it is not understandable why, until such time, Begumpet could not be kept operational? Will the reader be right in concluding, as he well might from the report, that the unions move to go on strike was senseless?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The standard of English-teaching in West Bengal is so abysmal that it is affecting the job prospects of the people in the state. The governments hare-brained decision to keep English out of the syllabus till Class VI is mainly responsible for this. Now there is only a handful of schools which follow the proper methodology of teaching English. BPO companies in Calcutta are often heard complaining of a dearth of fluent speakers of English. It is time schools, colleges and the government itself considered introducing soft skills in the curriculum.                    
	Yours faithfully,

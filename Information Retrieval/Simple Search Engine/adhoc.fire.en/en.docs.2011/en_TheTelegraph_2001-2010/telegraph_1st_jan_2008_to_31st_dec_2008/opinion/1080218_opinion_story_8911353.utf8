The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A crippling indifference

	The Reserve Bank of India dutifully publishes each year A Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy. The latest such publication carries, on page 50, a table detailing the production of principal foodgrains all the way from 1950-51 till 2006-07. The data presented are most enlightening. Wheat production in the country has advanced from 6.46 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 74.89 million tonnes in 2006-07, that is, by more than eleven-and-a-half times. The corresponding rise in the output of rice is from 20.58 millions tonnes to 92.76 million, which works out to an order of increase slightly exceeding four-and-a-half times.         
	In the case of coarse grains like jowar, bajra and ragi, however, the increase in output is markedly less, from 15.38 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 34.25 million in 2006-2007; production has doubled, but hardly much more than that. Considerably worse is the state of things with regard to pulses. The production of pulses in the country was 8.41 million tonnes in 1950-51; in 2006-07, almost six decades later, it was 14.23 million tonnes, the rise in output being less than 60 per cent. In fact, the production of pulses was already 10.62 million tonnes in 1953-54. To suggest that, over the vast stretch of half a century, the national output of pulses has increased by barely 40 per cent would not therefore be at all unfair.        
	Seasoned politicians as well as civil servants constantly express their concern over the nations food security, mentioning, inter alia, how this security has been ensured by thoughtful official measures such as the induction of path-breaking new farm technologies. Some economists are nonetheless convinced that, over the past half-century, per capita availability of foodgrains  an important index of food security  has declined; given the phenomenon of growing income inequalities, per capita grain availability for the countrys poor has actually fallen far more sharply.               
	Other economists do contest this point of view, and the debate remains open-ended. Since the national population has increased roughly two-and-a-half times between the early Fifties and the first decade of the 21st century, per capita availability of wheat must have, on the face of it, gone up to an appreciable extent. Per capita availability with respect to rice too has risen, but moderately. The picture is altogether different for both coarse grains and pulses. Per capita availability of coarse grains is likely to have fallen by at least one-third during the epoch of economic planning. For pulses, the situation is staggeringly much more frightening. The countrys population has increased by around 150 per cent during the period we have in mind; overall production of pulses has gone up, as noted above, by at most 40 per cent.        
	In the terminology of economics, pulses belong to the category of so-called Giffen goods, inferior commodities the demand for which drops with rising standard of living. Pulses are a minor constituent in the consumption basket of the affluent sections in society; the same is true for coarse grains like jowar and bajra. The relative sluggishness in their output leads to but one conclusion: inferior foodgrains such as pulses and coarse cereals do not come within the orbit of interest of national planners. The gross domestic product has maintained a rate of growth of 9 per cent or more per annum in recent years. In the circumstances, there is scarcely any need, so it seems is the view of officialdom, to strive to augment the production of inferior grains.        
	The GDP may increase at a breathtakingly exponential rate, but that has little impact on the state of poverty and destitution in the country. Roughly one-third of the nation continues to be horrendously poor even after six decades of independence and spiralling growth in GDP in recent years. The upper stratum  consisting of, say, one-fifth of the national population  are monopolizing the fruits of the GDP growth, the rest remain outside its pale.        
	New experiments with farm technology have from time to time bestirred the countryside. The focus of these experiments has been on effecting improvement in the productivity of rice, wheat and the general range of commercial crops, including export crops. Coarse grains and pulses do not make the agenda, none has the time to spare a thought particularly for pulses, despite this grain being a significant source of protein so essential for human existence.        
	It is a sorry, tragic, depressing story. The poor are a constant of the Indian reality; their proportion does not decline, nor their absolute number. For sheer survival, they need to have a minimum intake of protein. Milk, fish, meat, eggs, items rich in protein, have, of course, always been beyond their means. They have, through the ages, fallen back on pulses for ensuring the ingress of a minimal quantity of proteins in their bodies. In the course of the past half a century, the rate of growth of pulse production, as already indicated, has been whimperingly low. The shortage of supply has not only encroached on the per capita availability of this protein-rich grain, it has also led to a continuous increase in the price level of the grain. The poorer sections, lacking adequate purchasing power, have therefore been further shoved out of the market for pulses. The inevitable consequence is a declining intake of protein on their part.         
	The steady fall in per capita protein intake by the nations poor is reflected in the finding of the Human Development Report periodically released by the United Nations. Gross domestic product growth fetishists scowl at the mention of this report; mere scowling however cannot unmake facts. The principal reason for the disappointing nutritional condition of the average Indian, highlighted in the report, is the declining availability of pulses for the countrys poor, a fall uncompensated for by increased intake of protein from any other source. The authorities are obviously not worried: the HDR notwithstanding, there is every prospect of the GDP maintaining its high rate of growth; nobody can then stop India from emerging as one of the major countries in the world.              
	There is a grim sequel to the story of the continuously shrinking availability of pulses in the food intake of Indias poverty-ridden millions. The poor may be poor, their bodies still have a hankering for protein. They are devoid of the means to buy protein-rich foods, and cannot even afford pulses; they therefore take as substitute a species of vetch, lathyrus sativus, widely known in the countryside as khesari, which provides them with some protein. Unfortunately, the consumption of this vetch over a period of time leads to a form of permanent paralysis described in the literature of biological sciences as latherysm. Its incidence is especially virulent, for understandable reason, among the destitute masses in central and eastern India, notably among the tribals. The word khesari is actually a corrupt version of the vetchs nomenclature in Sanskrit, khanjakari, meaning what lames or deforms.        
	None of these facts has been unearthed recently. Official quarters were well aware of the relationship between consumption of khesari and latherysm as early as the Fifties. Established facts and knowledge concerning their implications do not ensure either preventive or curative action. Poverty and pestilence accompanying the consumption are assumed to be unchanging aspects of the eternal verity that is India. The low production of pulses plays a major contributory role in that tragedy.

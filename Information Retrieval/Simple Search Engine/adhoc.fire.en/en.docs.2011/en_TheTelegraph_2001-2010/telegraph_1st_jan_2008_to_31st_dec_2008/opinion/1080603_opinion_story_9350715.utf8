	No way to treat a friend                  
	Sir  The former Pakistani minister and human rights activist, Ansar Burney, who was instrumental in securing the release of Kashmir Singh from incarceration in Pakistani jails and is now working tirelessly to save Sarabjit Singh from the gallows, was shamefully sent back from the New Delhi airport on May 30. The reason provided by the home ministry officials is that Burney had inadequate documents (Ministry red-faced over Burney, June 1). Then, to add respectability to the goof-up, it was said that a lookout notice issued against Burney was still in force. When it was pointed out that Burney was permitted to enter India only one-and-a-half months ago, the cornered ministry expressed regret in so bureaucratic a manner that it could at best be described as pro forma. The monumental cock-up at the airport against a well-known friend of India like Burney calls for a personal apology from the home minister, Shivraj Patil. But Patil may not have time for such niceties, given his current preoccupation with the defence of Afzal Guru and the illegal Bangladeshis. Patil has always been known for defending the indefensible. He cares little if a delay in his apology complicates the situation further.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  The external affairs ministry officials who had a hand in turning away Ansar Burney from Delhi airport should be suspended forthwith and departmental proceedings initiated against them. Such acts of omission and commission only sully the image of the country abroad.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the man who has been trying to help Indian prisoners get out of Pakistani jails has been deported from Delhi without proper reason. This is also a moment of utter hopelessness for the people who are eagerly looking forward to the thawing of the ice in the Indo-Pakistan relationship. Individuals like Ansar Burney are above politics, they work tirelessly for the welfare of people without expecting anything in return. Why are they repeatedly made victims of dirty politics? Given the courage and commitment shown by Burney in the matter of Sarabjit Singh, he deserves honour and respect, and certainly not the humiliation that has been given to him by the Indian authorities at the Delhi airport. Before things get out of hand, the Indian government should immediately apologize to Burney and punish the guilty officers. Else, no one will feel encouraged to work for the distressed prisoners languishing in Indian and Pakistani jails.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The worlds only Hindu nation finally did away with 240 years of monarchy (Nepal abolishes monarchy, May 28). It happened only when the people of Nepal realized that King Gyanendra was not the best person to be ruling them. For the god-fearing  and the king is generally regarded as the representative of god  people, it needed a truly incompetent and malevolent king for things to come to such a pass. It is a shame that the ousted kings birthday has been publicly celebrated in India by some politicians, in the company of some erstwhile Indian royalty and the Nepalese ambassador.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  By abolishing monarchy, Nepalese Maoists are playing to the gallery. They know that this alone cannot pull up Nepals economy from the dump. Many countries  England, Japan, Sweden  have managed to marry monarchy to their national aspirations. Emperor Heile Selassie was dethroned by Lieutenant Colonel Mariam in Ethiopia, who practised Marxism for 17 years. He ruined the Ethiopian economy and the people ultimately rejected Marxism. A look at the comparative status of South and North Korea in per capita GDP could teach Prachanda one or two things .           
	Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, however, feels that the Maoist movement in Nepal can beget other revolutions, presumably in India (Mission possible, May 31). But, with democracy well-entrenched in India and the Marxists no longer believing that parliament is a pigsty, such a revolution is a very far cry indeed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The visit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader, Sitaram Yechury, to Nepal is rather curious. His interest in forging ties with Maoists in the new Himalayan republic is in sharp contrast with his partys attitude to Maoists in Kerala and West Bengal, where the Left is in power. The case of the Kerala High Court employee and her children who were tortured by the police for her alleged association with Maoists is still fresh in public memory. Maoists in both Nepal and India should be wary of Yechury amp; Co..           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Kaithakkal, Kerala

                
	Sir  It is facile to argue that India should welcome the emergence of a democratic, secular and republican Nepal on its northern border. With the Maoist ideology of its ruling class, Nepal will be heavily influenced, even dominated, by China much sooner than its valiant liberators realize. Its relations with India are already prickly in places. This would be fully exploited by China in the guise of being a friend to Nepal, and will be entirely to Indias detriment. The new republics impoverished conditions would make it a vassal state to the economically mighty Chinese. On the world stage, Nepal will forever remain China s stooge.           
	The developments in our neighbouring state are quite ominous for India. As a Hindu monarchy, it was our natural ally. But now, there are tectonic shifts. Nepal s delirium as a secular state will soon give way to a Tibet-style assimilation of its culture and religion by the Chinese. The republic of Nepal is destined to prove difficult for India hereafter. We should watch out for China s new cats paw.           
	Yours faithfully,

	If you are a peeping tom, it is most likely that youll get past the lone napping security guard of a JNU girls hostel. But beware. I remember a sultry summer day in Tapti hostel, where I spent two years, when an over-confident male student sneaked past the guard, but ran into deeper trouble when he found himself cornered by girls in various stages of undress. He learnt a hard lesson: its easier to get into a girls hostel than escape from the clutches of the infuriated ladies living in it. Funnily, the security rules of hostel life in JNU turn topsy-turvy when it comes to women students unbounded entry into and exit from boys hostels. Far from harbouring a Victorian morality, the security guards of boys hostels are usually hand in glove with the girlfriends who make their lovers rooms their permanent abode. In some ways, the familiarity with everyday faces, and the trust and bonhomie shared by the students and the old guards make security the least of headaches in JNU.

	Male students could never say for sure what lay behind the towering wall that surrounded the womens hostel in Pune University. A moat? A sentry, a menacing eunuch, or perhaps both? All they knew was that the women disappeared into the other world sharp at 10 every night. There was a telephone booth at the entrance, to help visitors call the inmates. The phone seldom worked. A cubby hole to its left contained an old bicycle and a glaring watchman. The women, expectedly, felt safe inside. Most spent their time thinking about the next meal, or about the shops on M.G. Road. Boyfriends came next, and then, time permitting, they would turn to books. The men, on the other hand, were a miserable lot. They lived in dingy hostel rooms, sharing dirty latrines, and doing without fans. Some of them had pets  bedbugs and dogs  that shared their beds. The warden, a fat man who lived in a weedy bungalow, was least concerned about mens safety or comfort. The women had to be safeguarded, even if it meant locking them up early in the night.

	At the womens hostel at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, there have been three thefts in the last one year. On one occasion, the thief, a young chap, said Ek minit to the girls and fled. Our hostel is at the farthest end of the campus and isnt very judiciously built, with half-grilled balconies and windows within reach, says an inmate. Boys and girls have free access to each others quarters, though boys prefer to use the girls hostel for study groups: girls rooms are tidier; and there is incentive in the form of tea and coffee. There are no guards for the buildings, but one at the main gate. So the Santiniketan incident can happen at ISI? Never, there are no madcaps here, everyone says in unison.

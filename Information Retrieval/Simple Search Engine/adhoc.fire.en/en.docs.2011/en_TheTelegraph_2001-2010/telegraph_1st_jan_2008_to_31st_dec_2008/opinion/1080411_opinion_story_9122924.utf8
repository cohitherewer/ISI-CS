	Remembrance can be a an awesome burden. Were memories to keep piling on other memories, that old curiosity shop, otherwise known as the mind, would get helplessly cluttered up. To sort out the still useful from the heap of rubbish would then be altogether impossible. The mind however is smart enough; it sets to work and does its own weeding. It trains itself to forget things that are worth forgetting, for example, names of authors who wrote yesterdays bestsellers.        
	There is nothing startling therefore in the fact that nobody talks any more about an episode that took place barely a decade ago. Attention is riveted on the most eye-catching item in this years Union budget. Santa Claus in the form of the finance minister has worked overtime; he has written off, at one go, borrowings by small and marginal farmers from financial institutions; the munificence adds up to Rs 60,000 crore. Even though some six weeks have passed since the presentation of the budget, gossip concerning the motives behind the announcement of the freebie refuses to die down. The wise ones are almost unanimous in their conclusion: aye, aye, the whopping debt relief, without precedent in contemporary history, is a sure sign that the polls are a-coming.        
	The wise ones cannot be faulted for reaching the surmise they reached. A loan waiver, particularly a loan waiver for the poor, goes against the grain of liberal economic philosophy. An expression of sympathy for the social underdog may be all right as a general principle, but must it assume a form which dilutes the distinction between efficiency and inefficiency and purposely discriminates in favour of lifes failure? The peasantry who are in distress are, after all, those who could not succeed in the competitive market.              
	No need to cross swords with precious neo-liberal theory; a misconception still deserves correction. The record should be put straight. The loan waiver to the extent of Rs 60,000 crore is not such a big deal. It is possible to dig out of the junkyard of memory the account of another loan waiver, even though it has not been till this day, for understandable reasons, described as such, at least officially.         
	The story goes back to 1996. A report prepared, for internal use, by the research staff of the Reserve Bank of India came up with a noteworthy revelation: unrecovered bank loans, where the quantum of each individual loan is Rs 1 crore or more, aggregated to a figure exceeded Rs 100,000 crore. At about the time this report was being put together, quite a few of the countrys scheduled commercial banks were under heavy fire allegedly because of their inability to register adequate profits. Their balance sheets were in the red; each of them was tarred with the infamy of carrying an unconscionable load of non-paying assets. The disappointing performance of these banks was undoubtedly due to the poor record of the recovery of loans of the size of Rs 1 crore or more.        
	The parties incurring these loans, either on behalf of companies they owned or controlled or on their personal accounts, were not non-entities. Several of them were leading figures in industry or trade; there was no question of their being short of funds. They did not pay back the money they had borrowed from the banks because they simply did not care to pay it back. They had economic clout, which spelled political clout too. Because they had clout, they could dare not to pay what they owed to the banks. Even if they defaulted  and wilfully defaulted  the banks, they felt confident enough, would not dare to initiate action against them. They were right. Advice must have been sought by the banks from quarters that mattered. Signals from these quarters were promptly received: the powerful people who had borrowed and failed to repay what they had borrowed must not be disturbed, they should be treated with courtesy; if they do not bother to settle their accounts, well, just grin and bear it.        
	Mind you, banks in any event do not act in a huff. If repayments on a loan turn irregular, the banks keep watch, patiently, for some time. If the state of the borrowal account continues to be unsatisfactory for a stretch of, say, three to four years, it is then designated as sticky. And it takes maybe as much as another half a dozen years before a sticky account is finally given up as a lost cause and declared to be a bad debt.         
	So, when the RBI researchers went to work on their report of unrecovered big-sized bank loans, the loan accounts concerned must have been at least a decade old. The defaulters were, as already mentioned, constituents of the social and economic elite. They were solvent parties and had ample funds at their disposal to meet their obligations. They however refused to clear their bank dues. In consequence, some of the banks went into the red; some others piled up NPAs of a magnitude which constituted an inordinately high proportion of their profits. The sword of Damocles in the form of the Basel Convention goaded them to take measures which could, by some means or other, boost their gross profits, thereby bringing down the NPA-profits ratio to a satisfactory level. The easiest way out was to retrench thousands of junior-grade bank employees, resulting in considerable social agony. At the end of it though, thank goodness, the gods of Basel were propitiated, the banks were restored to health and once again ready to offer fresh loans to the affluent sections.              
	That internal report of the RBI was of no avail. Not even one little finger was raised by the authorities to coax cushy borrowers to behave. If one were to add the interest accumulation over the past dozen years, the banks at this moment are entitled to demand from the big-shot defaulters a sum well exceeding Rs 200,000 crore. So what, the decision was taken in the highest echelons to bury the matter. The comfortably placed defaulters happened to belong to the social class the authorities consider as both honourable and adorable. Quietly, quietly, without any formal announcement, a great debt waiver was rendered a reality.        
	The issue was raised and discussed in Parliament, only to be talked out. Various suggestions were offered by experts who regarded the whole thing to be a scandal of the first order. One such suggestion was that in case the defaulters were joint stock or corporate entities, they should be blacklisted and debarred from further accommodation from any banks in the country; in case they were individuals, they and their near relatives should be accorded the same treatment. The authorities know on which side their bread is buttered; the banks too know why discretion is the better part of valour. A number of banks are known to engage private musclemen, who are sent after generally god-fearing householders who have perchance missed repaying a couple of installments that were due. The banks, however, are well aware that the small fry abide the question, the tycoons are free.        
	Loan waivers for the poor make news. Not similar waivers for the rich. To refuse to meet their obligations is the birthright of wealthy people, nothing to write home about. And if, as a consequence of such non-payment by affluent groups, thousands of low-grade bank employees have to be sent packing, that too is nothing to write home about.

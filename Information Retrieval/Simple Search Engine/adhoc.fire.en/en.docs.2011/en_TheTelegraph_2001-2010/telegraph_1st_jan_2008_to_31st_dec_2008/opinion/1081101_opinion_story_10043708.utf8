	It was an excellent idea to show some of the recent paintings of Rao Kodanda and Basist Kumar together (Bose Pacia, until today). Instead of choosing to paint on large canvases unthinkingly, or only with an eye on the market, both artists make this choice integral to their art. Kodanda and Kumar, trained in Baroda and Santiniketan respectively, provoke reflections on the meaning and function of scale in relation to their visions of humanity, and to their understanding of what we do when we look at paintings.         
	Rao Kodandas oils may be seen as a series of reflections on the relationship between human masses and scale. Human Flood (72x96 inches) presents a high, panoramic view of a huge crowd on a beach, with the sea and the shore painted in vivid colours melting and folding into one another. We can stand back and look at the large shapes created by these colour-forms, or we can focus on the little people and try to pick out each faceless figure  and lose the larger picture, as it were, in the process. The Flow is a smaller canvas, yet the vastness of its riverine landscape is created by the line of tiny people you see in the distance. And in Hearts Land (Africa) (picture, bottom)  the same size as Human Flood  people get massed and dwarfed by the background of harsh light and colour that creates both distance and height. Only Transparency, Wetness amp; Liquidity, with its lone gull rising out of the waves, is about singularity. And careful viewing will reveal the reflection of a painter-like figure with a brush, who is also there among the construction-workers in The Social Sector.         
	Is the artist just one among the many? Or does he have to stand apart (or above) the many in order to discover their myriad collective forms? The Unity-1 is something like an answer to these questions. It shows, from closer than in Human Flood, a gathering of people seated in sociable clusters on a lawn in the evening, perhaps to watch a play or listen to a concert that is kept outside the frame. Warm patches of light fall on them, but they also seem to be bathed in the light of what the painter feels as he looks at the scene from a distance and composes it into a visual and social unity. Unity-1 reminded me of Bhupen Khakhar  of the overarching human caritas that gathers small huddles of people into larger compositions in many of Khakhars paintings.        
	Basist Kumars 66x120 inch acrylic diptychs are all called Facing. All four depict human singularity on a nearly monumental scale. The largeness of the canvas dwarfs people in Kodanda. But, in Kumar, it turns individuals into vaguely terrifying giants, paired with equally colossal presences: a huge structure with pillars and arches, woods and falls, an iceberg, and a strange wall (picture, top). In one half of each diptych, what we face is the human face, enlarged to uncanny proportions, rising out of shimmering, dark waters or placed under an open sky. In the other half of the diptych, we are confronted with a non-human presence. Then, as we stand surrounded by the four works, we begin to sense something strange about the four pairs of eyes looking straight at us. And on peering closer, we see, perhaps with something close to a little shudder, that the pupils in each pair of eyes reflect, not us or the painter, but the huge thing that stands in the other half of the diptych. What each face confronts, then, is not us or the painter, but another presence in the landscape: the person in the picture returns, and does not return, our gaze.        
	These colossal, solitary people, smiling or blank-faced, play with scale in many ways. First, they reduce the viewer by their larger-than-life presence, their size determined not only by what we actually see but also in comparison to what they are placed next to. This can be a deeply disorienting visual experience. Second, once we know what is reflected in the eyes of these people, we are rendered strangely absent by the fact of not being looked at by them at all. Third, the gigantic objects they are looking at instead also get reduced to tiny reflections in their eyes.         
	Do people exist in landscapes, these paintings seem to be asking, or do landscapes exist in people? In what way does the act of looking bring people and objects into being? Or conversely, if somebody or something is not being looked at, then does this person or thing not exist at all? And how do these relationships of looking and not looking determine those among the painter, the viewer, the painting and its subject?

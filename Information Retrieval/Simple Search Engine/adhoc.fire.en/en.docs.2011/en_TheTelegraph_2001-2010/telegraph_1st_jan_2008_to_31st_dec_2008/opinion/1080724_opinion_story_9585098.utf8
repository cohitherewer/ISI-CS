	Private tuition poses the same sort of problem for the Left Front government in Bengal as autorickshaws do. It is irreparably damaging, too many people have become dependent on it, and getting rid of it calls for the complete transformation of a system in the existing state of which the governments political and commercial stakes are scandalously high. So years of negligence, procrastination and two-facedness on the part of the government have turned both private tutors and autorickshaws into forms of annoyance that it can neither deny nor manage. So it comes as no surprise that the school education ministers latest statements in the assembly are full of the usual evasive and deliberately vague non-proposals, which are only ways of buying more time. Partha Dey has come up with two assurances: school syllabi will be changed in such a way that, first, students will not need private tuition, and second, they will not be left with the time to go for tuition. This could mean just about anything, or nothing, in practical terms. But are not the two safeguards absurdly contradictory and mutually exclusive? The first implies that the syllabi will become more creative and inspiring and will ensure better teaching so that tuition becomes unnecessary. The second sounds vaguely terrifying, conjuring up visions of an impossibly demanding curriculum that leaves students with no time for independent study. Both suggest confused  or more likely, non-existent  thinking on the issue, and make it difficult for any serious educationist or student to take the ministers statement seriously.        
	Mr Dey has also announced a survey to be conducted among students, private tutors and, presumably, the schools to assess the benefits, if any, of private tuition. But the surveyor will be a government body, no timeline has been set for the survey, and there are no concrete details regarding principles and methodology. Any sincere consideration of the problem of private tuition cannot but open a dangerous can of worms. Everything  from the quality of teaching, textbooks and teachers salaries, to the physical infrastructure of education (roads, electricity, toilets, meals, libraries)  will have to be looked into and thought through. Cities, towns and villages will have to be considered in terms of their distinct realities. Is the government ready to do this? Or more crucially, does it have the expertise for such a task?

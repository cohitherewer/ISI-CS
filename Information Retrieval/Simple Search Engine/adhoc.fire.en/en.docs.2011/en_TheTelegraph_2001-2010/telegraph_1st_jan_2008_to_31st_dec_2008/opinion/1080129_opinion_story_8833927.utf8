The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | in the realm of words
                                                                                                              IN THE REALM OF WORDS                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The weather was wonderful, the sun shone crisp and warm, the dcor consisted of strips of multi-coloured fabrics strung like a maypole overhead, a tent where the workshops took place, a hall where the reading and the Q amp;A sessions happened, alongside lots of socializing, talking and buying books. The Jaipur Literature Festival was a great way to spend a few days in the realm of the imagination, where diversity is enunciated for everyone who wishes to know another opinion and point of view. Nayantara Sahgal, who was the inaugural speaker, received a standing ovation after her speech. She reinforced the need to protect and nurture the freedom of expression, diversity of thought, and the generation of new, untested ideas and out-of-the-box thinking, in order to keep alive the dynamic and vital growth of the mind, and, by extension, the values and ethics of a nation. She spoke with a quiet passion and with enormous dignity that crossed the footlights and enveloped the venue.        
	Many thoughts entered and excited my mind as I watched the people, hungry to keep in touch with the changing world of literature within and outside of India, actively participate in the many sessions. Imagine the outpouring of energy and excitement if every state capital had such a festival, one that first celebrated its regional language writing and then, in addition, the fiction of other countries, all for the local community to participate in and absorb. It would make for an important event, where language is honoured, because without a language, culture fades away and gets bastardized into something no one can identify with.                
	New ventures        
	The most critical aspect of this small, week-long treat was that it was organized by people who care for and are intrinsic to the world of literature, and was not convened by a state apparatus led by a babu. Of course, there are babus and babus but, at the end of the day, government employees, arrogant and covered in a frayed mantle of the command economy, and therefore seen to be patrons of the arts, are not intellectually empowered or skilled to put together an eclectic show. Yes, they can bring on the troupes, the co-opted culturists and such like, but the non-official mood of freedom, created by this years Jaipur Literature Festival should stand as an example of what can be done outside of state sponsorship.        
	That brings me to the larger issue of patronage. Business houses worldwide indulge in generous philanthrophy. In India, endowments were traditionally given to temples, hospitals and educational institutions. The royals nurtured the arts, dance and music. They built palaces and forts that represented the unmatched fund of living knowledge and workmanship that India has been known for through the centuries. Skills were kept alive because of constant usage. Craftmanship grew and developed as needs changed. Then came Independence and the superimposition of alien ideas, which began to disengage our pluralistic society from its diverse roots.        
	In this new millennium, we must persuade those who generate wealth in the private sector to begin to put some percentage of their profits into reviving the many cultural threads that once made up the warp and the weft of this ancient society, one that had enthralled the world at a time. Today, some sponsor events to get a certain legitimacy in society, others do it because they believe cultural pride brings true societal stability. Both are stepping stones towards the same goal. When the economy is booming, when there is a sudden excess of money, when many are not part of that boom and need to be absorbed in the growth, cultural rooting is essential if ugly anarchy is to be avoided. We need more corporate sponsors and less state involvement in this realm.

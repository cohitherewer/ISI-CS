	It has been a vivid demonstration of how power really works. A week ago, Robert Mugabe was still the undisputed ruler of Zimbabwe. He was 84, and he had reduced the country to ruin: four out of five adults are unemployed, inflation is running (officially) at over 100,000 per cent, and one-third of the population has fled abroad in search of work, mostly to South Africa. Yet nobody in his own party, Zanu-PF, dared to question his rule, the police and the army remained loyal, and ordinary people lived in quiet desperation.        
	The silent submission of the population owed a good deal to the brutality of the police, but what can explain the loyalty of his own colleagues in the party and the army? After all, Zimbabwe is their country, too, and nobody likes to see their homeland dragged in the dirt. Moreover, it was all Mugabes fault, brought about by policies that he freely chose to pursue. He is not ten feet tall and he has no magical powers. Why did they obey him?        
	They obeyed him because he has been in power for 28 years, longer than the great majority of Zimbabweans have been alive. They obeyed him because he was the hero of the independence struggle and an icon of African liberation. Most of all, they obeyed him because his rule was apparently the only thing that kept them out of the desperate poverty in which most Zimbabweans live. Powerful people who defied him were rarely killed, but they were cut off from the flow of wealth and had a very hard time. So the regime cruised on almost unaffected by the ruin of the country, and Mugabe even felt secure enough to allow more-or-less free elections.        
	Mugabe was so confident that he didnt even send out Zanu-PFs storm-troopers, the so-called war veterans (most of whom were not born during the liberation war), to frighten people into voting the right way. But he had made one crucial miscalculation: in response to pressure from the African Union, he agreed to let the vote be counted locally, with the results posted up outside each polling station.                
	Still in the game        
	So the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, sent members to photograph the results at more than 8,000 polling stations, and it suddenly got very hard to manipulate the returns. It turned out that around half the population had not voted for Zanu-PF despite the pressures.        
	Mugabes party has already lost its majority in parliament, but the real transformation has been in Zanu-PF itself. Suddenly, the old man is not the object of fear and adulation any more. In the eyes of some senior party people and their military and police colleagues, Mugabe has become a bargaining counter.         
	If the jig is really up, maybe they could trade Mugabe and power for a peaceful retirement with no awkward questions about where their wealth came from. Of course, Mugabe would also have to be allowed an honourable retirement himself. Or maybe they should declare martial law, annul the election and push Mugabe aside  or leave him as a figurehead and flak-catcher. It must be very disconcerting to discover after 28 years of absolute power that it was just a confidence trick all along.        
	But the game is not over yet. While both those options remain open, the party elders and the security forces have opted, for the moment, to play by the rules: a run-off election in two weeks between Mugabe and MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai. This gives them time to re-intimidate the rural population and pull off a second-round victory for Mugabe. Or, if that strategy doesnt look like its going to work, then they still have time to exercise Option A or Option B. So what has this episode taught us about the nature of power? That the more absolute and illegitimate it is, the easier it is for it to dissolve overnight. And that democracy is a good solvent.

	No other phrase could have better captured Partha Pratim Debs obsession with lines than the title of his latest exhibition of drawings, A Million Lines (Gallery K2, March 16-April 5). This collection  ink on paper and mixed media, each 30x23 inches  is dizzyingly brilliant; sometimes quite literally so. In one of his best works  Mediation Deb uses as many lines as he promises, but not with frenzied abandon. His lines are arranged with subtle deliberation, densely stacked together in neat rows, one row then precariously poised on top of another. The eye has to learn to take in this combination of serenity and plenitude, and get used to its giddy pleasures.        
	These images are not pure abstractions, not in the way that Rothkos panels or Bridget Rileys labyrinths are. Debs non-figurative images at their most enigmatic are wittily ambivalent. Mediation itself is a playfully illusionist work: its delicate texture is reminiscent of a Japanese bamboo screen, while the spots of red on it might bring to mind a patchwork quilt. But the eye is not meant to dwell merely on the surface. As the intensity and the concentration of lines are varied, the surface becomes layered, and depths emerge out of the light and shade. The red spots start resembling mysterious footprints or, even more sinisterly, bits of blood.        
	Deb creates a charged visual field between a work and its viewer, a field that stops not at the surface of the paper but extends into imagined spaces within. The drawings are not just to be seen, but are rather meant to be inhabited, to quote Bridget Riley, so that the minds eye, or the eyes mind, can move about it credibly. Building Trauma is, at a purely visual level, a geometric arrangement of jagged pieces, like a hastily-put-together jigsaw puzzle. But once the eye begins to inhabit these broken forms, it searches out the crumbling figures, sinking into the earth under enormous weights, of a ton of bricks perhaps. The real and the metaphorical become one and the same. The bricklayers, like the many little bricks they carry, are turned into little units building up a great edifice. But only the bricks remain the visible proof of the numerous invisible hands that have laid them.        
	A sense of belonging is reinforced in the more distinctly figurative works. The viewers are invited to step inside these powerfully narratorial portraits, to observe and understand the protagonists, if not to become one with them. Most of these images have a disquieting mirroring effect: if you break into a smile on looking at The Pedant, the pedant, in the same way, could be smiling back at you. The images and their viewers are locked in this mutually amused, and amusing, interplay of gazes. What is risible might at once leave you feeling slightly ridiculous.         
	Debs portraits are thus more complicated than caricature. The men and women appear rather dandyish, combining a certain bourgeois elegance with a kinky twist. A girl of indeterminate age sits seductively with parted lips and limpid eyes. She sports a skimpy blouse, and has a couple of her beautifully tapering fingers delicately crossed. The caption with this image says, The Kissing Fish, drawing attention to the picture of the lip-locked creatures printed across her bosom. The room behind her is a bizarre assembly of squares and rectangles, vertiginously piled, and filled with a million lines.         
	Debs setting and his characters are both too assertively individual, which is why they can be more readily likened to a frame from a graphic novel, hinting at a story, than to merely pictorial sarcasm.        
	Moo is more directly satirical. It shows a man, spotted all over, on all fours, with his limbs ending in hooves. His eyes are watery, doleful, as bovine as he is made to appear. But he is certainly not a cow, and probably has the pox on him from some licentious past. Switch Bitch shows a dog sitting upright, rather woman-like  but with her tongue hanging out and her teats dangling.        
	Debs affiliation with popular comic-book traditions is obvious in the way he deploys the ligne claire or the clear-line method, with which Harvey Pekar or Herg (the great masters of animation) created a viewer-friendly medium. However, Deb breaks the clear line into a million more, twisting and turning them into shapes, sometimes even compressing them into an indistinguishable blackness.        
	 Crinkle Crinkle uses lines of different thicknesses as theme and variation. It is a delightfully witty experiment, but the outcome is a humanoid rag-doll, surgically stitched together. Funiculli captures a person of uncertain gender with a strikingly ugly face in the act of scratching his or her armpit. The curving lines lend an apish grimness to the face, while those snaking up the limbs look like fish-scales.         
	Deb also manipulates lines in Funiculla and Oh My God! but with markedly different results. Despite the cubist principles, the harshness of lines in these drawings is dissolved into a delicate sensuality, as in Picassos drawings of Franoise Gilot or in his portrait of a weeping woman.         
	In Pseud in Her Corner, some sort of a satire of a modern bluestocking, fine lines crawl up the arms of the luscious female subject. Are they body hair or merely the texture of the sleeves of her blouse? Pseuds vaguely amused stare will leave you wondering. And in this dithering lies the fun of it all.

	There is a persistent confusion in the Indian political process among locality, province and nation. It is this confusion that is manifest in the completely bizarre verbal encounter reported in the media between the member of parliament from Haldia, Lakshman Seth, and the deputy inspector-general of the CRPF, Alok Raj, in Nandigram during the panchayat polls on Sunday. Elections to the panchayat should be a strictly local affair. Unfortunately, in West Bengal panchayat polls are seen by politicians as a dress rehearsal for the assembly and the Lok Sabha elections. Consequently, elections to the body designed to represent the interests and problems at the grassroots are hijacked to the level of a different kind of power struggle, and, as is evident from Nandigram, to a vicious turf war among political parties. The Election Commission should seriously consider a regulation by which political parties and personalities involved at the provincial and the national levels are debarred from any participation in elections at the panchayat level. Elections to local bodies should be on the basis of local issues fought by local politicians. Moreover, these elections should not be held on the same day all over the state. They should be spread throughout the year. These will enable elections to local bodies to retain their local character. This may not completely eliminate the kind of violence seen in Nandigram, but will certainly reduce the risk of it.        
	The violence in Nandigram is not new in West Bengal under Left Front rule. What remains remarkable, however, is the continued insouciance of the government and the administration. There should be no violence during elections and in the period leading up to it. Any outbreak of violence and even the tiniest show of intimidation should be viewed as a lapse on the part of the administration. Events in Nandigram convey the distinct impression that the government deliberately turns a blind eye to the violence because the ruling party often perpetrates it. There has been no attempt whatsoever to discipline someone like Mr Seth and others who are known for their allegiance to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). By this failure, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government fails to inspire even a modicum of confidence in its impartiality and in its ability to maintain law and order.

	For the third time in 30 years, Citigroup  once the most powerful bank in the world  has been bailed out of serious, even disastrous, trouble. The first time was in the 1980s, following the Latin American sovereign debt crisis. The second time was in the 1990s, by a coordinated series of measures by private participants. This week, the American Federal Reserve announced the third rescue: a $300-plus billion guarantee of Citis assets (read riskiest loans) and a capital infusion of $20 billion in preferred stock. Last Friday, Citi had about $2 trillion in assets  twice the gross domestic product of India, to put things in perspective  and over $20 billion in market capitalization. On Sunday night, the government of the United States of America announced the largest rescue plan of the ongoing financial crisis without any plan of restructuring or any other corporate action on the part of the banks management. Saudi Arabias Prince Walid bin Talal, who heads his countrys sovereign wealth fund, which owns a significant chunk of Citi stock, has been reassuring investors and the public that it was undervalued and that he was buying more shares. Citis market capitalization has fallen from $250 billion in 2006 to $20.5 billion on November 21, 2008. On Monday, Citi management held a townhall meeting to announce that the bank was laying off over 50,000 employees worldwide. How the mighty are fallen!        
	The storyline of what got Citigroup into trouble is by now a familiar one: its corporate culture, lack of internal oversight of risky lending practices and a big move into mortgage-backed securities that ultimately proved disastrous. Newspaper editorials have called for a break-up of the bank, and a sacking of its management. The banks board has been particularly critical of the banks performance, and has even fought with the management over several issues. Prince Walid, on the other hand, has suggested that much of Citis problems have been inherited from the tenure of the previous chief executive, Charles Prince; he recommends giving the current incumbent, Vikram Pandit, the opportunity to right the ship. Hes even putting his money where his mouth is by buying more stock (which may also be because it is so cheap).        
	The disaster that struck Citi has reverberations beyond American shores; after all, the bank is  or was  a global giant whose fate has driven the currencies of Australia and New Zealand down against the dollar. This has led some to say that saving Citi may be beyond the ability of the US government; it is simply too big to rescue. No investor is capable of putting in the kind of money that Citi may ultimately require, so nationalization may be the only answer. But that is not likely to sit well with the idea of American capitalism. Walter Wriston, the former chairman of Citi and an iconic figure in the banks history, said that judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. Except in his former banks case, apparently.

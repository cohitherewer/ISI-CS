	A Modern Approach to Islam By Asaf A.A. Fyzee, Oxford, Rs 395         
	Even in this age of easy access to books and technology, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the world. September 11, besides changing political equations around the world, gave Muslims and Islam a bad name. Since then, in many countries, Muslims have been trying to do some soul-searching. Strictly speaking, Fyzees book should not be seen in that light, having been published in 1963. One may even ask if the book has any relevance to our time. The publisher thinks it is more relevant today than when it was written. The compact introduction by Saiyid Hamid not only highlights the main features of the book but also serves as a good critique of it. His thoughts on several issues are more sensible than the authors who, now and again, oversteps his limits.         
	The book has just four chapters. The first deals with the essence of Islam and the last with the re-interpretation of the faith. Fyzee, being a scholar of Islamic law, has devoted two chapters to law, religion and theology in India. It is in the end that his real aim in writing the book becomes evident when he tries to reinterpret Islam to fit in with the changing times. In discussing the essence of Islam, the author refers to Ameer Ali, Iqbal and Azad. But instead of elucidating on the fundamentals of Islam, he restricts himself to Azads translation of the first chapter, the Fatiha, of the Quran, followed by a short critique of it.         
	The second chapter explains the position of law in Islam. It also explains several technical terms like sharia, fiqh, sunna, and so on. Fyzee also points out the common features of Semitic monotheistic faiths and Islam. In explaining the synthesis of law and religion in Islam, Fyzee gives the translation of the Prophets last sermon. This is a worthy addition, which also contains Caliph Omars instructions to the Qazi and the testament of Hazrat Ali to the importance of tradition in Islam.         
	Fyzee lays down five stages in which Islam may be reinterpreted. There is no harm in following these, or any other for that matter, but a sensitive issue like re-interpretation is better left to the experts. The next chapter gives a short history of Islamic learning in India, in particular the contributions of Sir Syed Ahmed, Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Azad and Ajmal Khan. Fyzee is concerned about the spiritual bankruptcy amongst the Muslims but does not know how to rectify it.         
	Perhaps owing to the authors over-enthusiasm, some inaccuracies of thought have crept into the work. For instance, Fyzee considers himself a non-conformist and does not accept the interpretations of Islam by Imams of authority. Then who will interpret them? Surely not everybody who throngs the mosque? He gives several general principles of reinterpretation, half of which could easily have been done away with. None of his six specific rules holds much sense except the one dealing with the re-interpretation of the sharia and the kalam. He is right in saying that since Ghazalis days little reformation has taken place, but his proposal to examine the changes in the light of European thoughts is not only irrelevant but unexpected from an learned man like him. He is more interested in his ideas than about their consequences.         
	Fyzees view is that Islam has to be seen in the light of the changes in society. The irony is that today, when the book has gone into its second edition, the authors views do not fit in with the sweeping changes of the last decade or so. It can only serve as a scholarly book written years ago that can be read only for academic purposes.                             SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

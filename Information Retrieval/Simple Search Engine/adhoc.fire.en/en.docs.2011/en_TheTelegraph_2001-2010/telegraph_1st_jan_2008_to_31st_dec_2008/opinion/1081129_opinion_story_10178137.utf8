The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | on the war front
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ON THE WAR FRONT                                                          
	The battle of Mumbai may perhaps be over and won. But the war is not over, and victory is nowhere in sight. The attack on Mumbai by militants who came in by sea and were in all possibility aided by collaborators within the city has not only scarred the landscape of the city and left, according to official estimates, over a hundred dead and many more injured, it has also exposed how vulnerable India actually is. Terrorist attacks on Indian cities have become an almost monthly occurrence in 2008, but the scale, the intensity and the focus of the blitzkrieg on Mumbai is something that is unprecedented. It has left the intelligence agencies floundering and the political leadership of the country with nothing to do save the mouthing of pious platitudes. The prime minister must do something more than give a much-belated address to the nation to instil a sense of confidence and security among the people of the country. It is only the bravery of the armed forces that has saved Mumbai. The saving of India will, however, prove to be a different and a tougher matter, which cannot be left only to the armed forces. The political class has to wake up to the danger, and to their responsibilities, and bring about a change in their attitudes and even to the system.        
	From even the little that has come to be known about the militants, their motives, their methods and their planning, it is obvious that India is now in the frontline of the battle between the peddlers of terror and ordinary human beings who want to get on with their civilized existence. The way the assault on Mumbai was mounted  the meticulous planning that preceded it and the organization that made the operation so successful  suggests the hand of al Qaida. If this suspicion is factually established, then the nationality of the actual attackers becomes somewhat irrelevant. India is now at the receiving end of the wrath of a transnational terrorist organization that trains militants and then lets them loose to wreak destruction on well-chosen targets. The aim is to create chaos and fear. The mode of execution of the attacks sends the clear message of defiance. India is clearly not prepared to meet and pre-empt strikes from what appears to be an omnipresent terrorist outfit.        
	India is not prepared because its politicians are not. They would rather remain involved in their petty electoral squabbles and rivalries while the country is ripped apart by Kalashnikovs, grenades and RDX. Raj Thackeray should remember that commandos from outside Maharashtra helped to clear Mumbai of terrorists. The leaders of the two largest national parties should recognize that the blame game regarding terrorism must stop.         
	There are moments in the history of a country when unity is more than a patriotic duty. India stands precisely at that crossroads. The gateway to India lies through the debris of Mumbai and the corpses that lie there.

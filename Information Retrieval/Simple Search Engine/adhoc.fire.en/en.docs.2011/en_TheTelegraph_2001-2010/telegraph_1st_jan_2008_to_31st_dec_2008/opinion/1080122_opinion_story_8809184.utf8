	A state as dense with people and poultry as West Bengal cannot afford to be inept in tackling bird flu. The virus is spreading steadily through the districts, but the government and the people most at risk have shown no signs of learning how to cope better with the escalating crisis. First, the culling targets are being missed every day. Several lakhs remain to be culled, the affected areas are growing, and the deadlines declared by the government keep changing. Second, public awareness, particularly in the villages, remains at alarmingly low levels. Just as the culling teams have not reached huge stretches of inhabited terrain, an alarming number of poultry owners and consumers seems to be unaware of the risks involved, and of the basic preventive measures. Third, the government also seems to be more-or-less clueless about distributing the medication properly, particularly to the culling teams. Finally, any attempt to politicize the matter of culling the peoples poultry, signs of which are beginning to be noticed in some districts, should be firmly put down. Even when panchayat elections are not quite round the corner, some local leaders seem to be afraid to annoy their electorate.
    
	Culling teams are being roughed up in places, local young people informing them about poultry to be culled are being resented by their neighbours, and villagers are hiding, or eating up, their surviving birds as they see the teams approach their homes. Extreme economic anxiety is, of course, at the back of all this. But there is backwardness too, that can only be eradicated through immediate and concerted awareness-raising. For some people, selling poultry is the only means of subsistence, and the implications of this fact will have to be properly understood, and effectively dealt with. Why culling is an imperative, how waterbodies and marshland increase the spread of the epidemic, why locals helping the cullers with information are not anti-social: these are all matters of information and attitude that need to be communicated to the districts without delay. Neighbouring states must also be alerted and kept under vigilance before the virus reaches them. The ministries of health and of animal resource development, and no less crucially, the panchayats, will have to shed their apathy and self-interest, and prevent the situation from hurtling further out of control.

	Poison in the air                  
	Sir  The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati, who promotes herself as the daughter of the Dalits, has come into riches since she came to occupy the hot seat. She has become controversial as well  three of her pet development projects have been stopped by the Allahabad high court for allegedly flouting environmental norms (Green clamp on Maya projects, April 8). When Mayavati came to power, she had promised to cleanse the corrupt government machinery. What the people of UP had not bargained for, one supposes, is that the purification hunt would end up polluting the environment.           
	Yours faithfully,         S. Mukherjee, Burdwan
        
	Upward curve          
	Sir  The fee hike for post-graduate courses at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad  from Rs 4.5 lakh to Rs 11.5 lakh  came as a shock. The chairman, Vijaypat Singhania, may have convinced the education minister that the hike was necessary for a number of reasons. However, the decision should be reconsidered as it will increase the sufferings of eligible students from poor families for no fault of theirs (IIMA no to fee rollback, April 3). Instead of raising course fees, the government should arrange for grants to the institute. This will enable it to improve the existing infrastructure in order to take in more students that has become necessary after the increase in the reservation quota.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The fee hikes at the IIMs have raised a storm and grabbed plenty of media attention. It is being said that this move will go against the interests of meritorious but needy students. One is reminded of a similar outcry in 2004, when the then education minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, had proposed a reduction in fees at the IIMs. The argument at the time was that there was no need for subsidized education at institutes of higher learning, as eligible candidates would be able to manage just as well with the help of scholarships and loans. It was said that a fee-slash would lower the standards of these premier institutes, thereby adversely affecting the students careers. Now, the contention once again is that the latest hike will harm students. One wonders whether the plight of students is really a matter of concern for the authorities and politicians alike.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi 

                
	Sir  Although India has witnessed phenomenal economic growth, higher education still remains inaccessible (or inaffordable) to the masses. The increase in fees at the IIMs is the latest case in point. Many success stories have been scripted at the IIMs, such as of students with middle-class backgrounds emerging with flying colours from these centres of excellence. Now the hefty fee hike will make these places of learning inaccessible even to those from the middle class. The purpose of having these institutes will be lost if they close the doors to meritorious but poor students by raising the fee.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Governments may change but ministerial attitudes tend to remain the same. One only has to look at Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister, as he continues meddling in the affairs and decisions of the governing council of IIMA. The babus at the HRD ministry would do well to concentrate on primary and lower education, and on empowering the poor. Till such time that schools in villages have basic amenities, they have no business interfering in the ways the IITs and IIMs are run.                     
	Yours faithfully,

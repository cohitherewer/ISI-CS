The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Who says its heritage?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHO SAYS ITS HERITAGE?
- Calcutta is yet to clarify its attitude to the colonial past                                PEOPLE PLACES                                                
	One of the problems plaguing the conservation of old and heritage buildings is that there are no proper guidelines. There are no problems, of course, when one is talking about buildings like the Victoria Memorial and Raj Bhavan since the issue there is largely self-explanatory and without dispute. But are all old buildings heritage? What constitutes heritage in a city like Calcutta  age of a building, its beauty, its associations and a host of other factors?        
	The problem is best illustrated by that building at the northern end of Central Avenue. The actor Girish Chandra Ghosh is said to have lived there in the late 19th century. It was decided  who knows by whom and why?  that the building should be preserved, so the road actually goes around the house which stands in the middle of the road. One can assume that the justification was that an eminent personality lived there, so let it stand. You could say that this is a justified position, but for the fact that buildings in which other eminent personalities lived have not been accorded similar importance. Does anyone know the houses in which Iswarchandra Vidyasagar, Michael Madhusudan Dutt or Henry Louis Vivian Derozio lived or what state of neglect they are in?        
	A further problem with this kind of yardstick is how to decide the order of eminence? Will the house in Hindustan Park in which Jyoti Basu lived be given heritage status? A heritage status imposes certain restrictions on present owners  in terms of sale, reconstruction and so on. This might be somewhat unfair to the owners of a really ordinary looking building in which once upon a time a famous person lived. London has such buildings much more in number than Calcutta, and there the authorities have found a good solution. They have given to such buildings a blue plaque that states who lived there and when. Whatever happens to the building, that plaque stays. There is even a blue plaque guide to London for those who are interested. This can be easily implemented in Calcutta.        
	These questions arise because of the present state of the Metropolitan Building, which in its days of glory was known by the name of the department store it housed  Whiteaway Laidlaw amp; Co. One irrelevant debate should be got out of the way. According to reports, a modern department store that has opened in the ground floor of the building is running on giant generators that belch smoke and make a racket. This should not be allowed irrespective of the condition of the building and its status. Commercial establishments can start operation only after they have received the required electricity connection and clearance. If they start operation without electricity, they are violating the law, and steps need to be taken and an inquiry made about how they were allowed to open the store.        
	To return to the status of the Metropolitan Building. Even by the standards of the history of Calcutta, the building is not that old, not even a hundred years. There are many other buildings and houses in Calcutta that are older. Is the building aesthetically appealing? The answer is bound to be subjective. For the moment let us agree that by the standards of Raj architecture in Calcutta, it is a nice enough building. But there are other buildings of similar style  Esplanade Mansions for one  that do not receive half the attention that Metropolitan Building does. If the argument is that it deserves heritage status because a famous departmental store had a home there, then what do we do with that characterless red building on Chowringhee that housed Lloyds and the Army and Navy Store  two other great institutions of the British Empire?        
	As a city we are yet to clarify our attitude to our colonial past. We changed the name that the British rulers had given to the city. With alacrity we change names of streets that have British associations. But we are all agog to save a building that housed a department store, which sold commodities only the elites (largely white) could afford.

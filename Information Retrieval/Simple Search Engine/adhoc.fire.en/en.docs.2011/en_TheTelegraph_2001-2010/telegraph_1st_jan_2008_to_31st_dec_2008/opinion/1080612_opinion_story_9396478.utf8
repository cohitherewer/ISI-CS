	Let us go back in time and revisit two incidents. First stop: July 2006. Benny Santoso, the chief of the Salim group of companies, was on a visit to Haldia. He reached the town and headed straight to the Ishwardaha-Jalpai village. The village has the Haldi river on one side and NH 41 on the other, and is just five kilometres from the industrial area and right next to the Haldia municipality office. One of the two multi-product SEZs planned around the Haldia-Nandigram region had Ishwardaha as its centre. Everything seemed picture perfect. As Santoso reached the flower-bedecked spot that would soon launch a thousand dreams, a formal assent-note was handed over to him by local CPI(M) leaders in the presence of Lakshman Seth. It bore the signatures of 500 farmers.         
	One year later. July 2007. The results of the Haldia municipal elections had just been announced, and the CPI(M) had swept the polls, quite like the last time, in 1997. The opposition (meaning the Trinamul Congress, mainly) could not make much of a dent with its tally of 7 seats. This was at the height of the Nandigram agitation, and also the time around which Ishwardaha witnessed political clashes over land-acquisition that left an intelligence-branch police officer dead. But Haldia did indeed vote as if Nandigram hadnt happened, and even if it had, the site of the turbulence was thousands of miles away, rather than next door.        
	This is 2008, and the panchayat poll results in Haldia have been a shocker for the ruling party. There was a strong belief among CPI(M) supporters and, more importantly, among the party leaders  perhaps strengthened by the outcome of the municipal elections last year  that upwardly mobile, industrial-minded Haldia was an entirely different universe from its neighbouring, predominantly agricultural areas. In other words, Nandigram may go against the Party, but Haldia will remain a rock-solid bastion.         
	This is precisely the perception that has been shaken in Haldia. Of the 53 seats in the East Midnapore parishad, TMC has won 35, where it had managed just 2 in 2003. The CPI(M) has lost all the parishad seats in Haldia, Sutahata and Mahishadal, the area earmarked by the government for the proposed shipyard. The local CPI(M) leadership  and in Haldia you could just as well substitute this with Lakshman Seth  still prefers to blame Nandigram for the loss. After the results were declared, Seth told reporters, Our men had been misled and wrongly convinced that our government had bad intentions.        
	Bojhano (to explain, persuade, or convince) has become a very important word in the CPI(M)s post-panchayat vocabulary in Haldia. The results are being explained in terms of a failure to explain, to send the message across. CPI(M) ebar bojhate pare ni, na bhul bojhate pare ni (Has the CPI(M) failed to explain its policies, or failed to mislead the voters this time)? asks a CPI(M)-turned-Trinamul supporter. And what does the process of explication entail? Let us take an example. Some months before the panchayat polls, a number of factory workers in Haldia lost their jobs. Many of them belonged to villages around the industrial area, including those in Nandigram. They had been assured that letters from the Party would be sent to them, insuring them against loss of jobs. Needless to say, incidents like this eroded a significant chunk of the CPI(M) vote bank, importantly, one which included a large number of young men.        
	Villages, which are represented by the panchayats, are places where a leaders being approachable is as important as his ability to get the message across. In Haldia, the CPI(M) faltered big time on this. Conversations with villagers have repeatedly thrown up the question of the treatment poor farmers received at the hands of their leaders. The increasing material comforts of the latter had created a wall of sorts between them and the people they represented. Approachability was replaced in many cases by terror. Terrified of the repercussions, the villagers did not dare to make their grievances public. The opposition parties took advantage of this. In their campaign, Trinamul leaders asked the people of Haldia to work for the Reds but to vote for them. The results show that the people have done that quite willingly. The ruling party could never have imagined that the area where it had planned to acquire land and build industries would land it in so much trouble.       SUKUMAR DASGUPTA

	A holocaust in return for home-made rockets exactly conveys the asymmetry on which Israels latest assault on Gaza is founded. Israels deputy defence minister has used precisely that historically loaded word to describe what he was threatening the Palestinians with if they continued to fire home-made rockets into Israel. This was at the end of a five-day offensive in the West Bank, mainly Gaza, which killed three Israelis (two of them soldiers) and more than a hundred Palestinians (most of them civilians, including many children). It was a reaction to the rockets targeted at Israeli towns by Hamas militants. The rockets were allegedly supplied by Iran, smuggled across the recently-opened Egyptian border. And their range seems to have improved, managing to get closer to Tel Aviv than before. So the Israeli tanks have been rolling into Gaza, over and above the usual ground operations that keep its 1.5 million people perpetually on tenterhooks. This new operation has even been given a name (Operation Hot Winter), and the Israeli prime minister has warned that he might have to defend his people more sternly this time.        
	It would be absurd, however, to stop the chain of action and reaction at the Palestinian rockets fired a few days ago into Israel. The story goes back at least four decades, with Israels occupation of Palestinian territories, its sustained expansion of settlements, its refusal to allow the return of expelled refugees, and its imposition of an economic blockade on the Gaza Strip that has all but cut off its fuel, electricity and essential supplies. The asymmetry has also escalated simultaneously. At the peak of the intifada (2000-2005), four Palestinians were killed for every Israeli. In 2006, it was thirty, and last year the ratio became forty to one. Two years ago, the democratic West got a nasty surprise when the Palestinians elected Hamas, and since then the Americans have been trying to stir up a civil war between Hamas and its rival faction, Fatah. Condoleezza Rice, who just visited the region, maintains the faade of insisting on peaceful negotiations, with a few token raps, from time to time, on Israeli knuckles for slaughtering innocent civilians. But the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, more Fatah than Hamas, has refused to talk to Israel unless the violence stops. The end of the road, on the map or otherwise, is still nowhere in sight.

	Serving a life-term in prison, these secluded hearts had arisen, through rhythm, movement and music, like phoenix from the ashes of their previous selves. The West Bengal Correctional Services, in association with Alokananda Roy, presented Rabindranath Tagores Valmiki Pratibha featuring prisoners from state correctional homes, on the concluding day of the Udayshankar Nrityotsav at Rabindra Sadan on December 15.         
	It was a soul-stirring experience to watch Valmiki Pratibha become a real-life story for the participants. A lot of the prisoners, along with a few officials, performed with amazing professional skill and unbelievable team spirit. Their efforts pleased the eye, warmed the heart and made one feel humane. From synchronized group movements and movingly rendered songs to the beautiful props and bright costumes  everything was done by the participants.        
	Intelligent incorporation of Purulia chhau dance with colourful masks by the inmates of Midnapore Jail heightened the drama. The simple body movements with the song, Sahe na sahe na, were expressive and apt. Nigil Akkara (Vicky) as Valmiki stole the show with his captivating stage presence. Stage props like mashal, bow, arrow and paper-flowers made by the inmates created a startling visual impact.         
	Alokananda Roy in the role of Saraswati looked elegant in a white costume. B.D. Sharma (IG, Prison) sang the songs of Valmiki with emotion. Assisted by Arnab, Subho, Rajesh, Imran, Gobindo, Indrani and Sharmistha, Roy gave a transforming performance. Even if it were not known that most of the performers were prisoners, the entire presentation still had an intrinsic merit, for which both Alokananda Roy and B.D. Sharma deserve to be warmly congratulated.

	The constant reference to elections  either mid-term or at the end of the term  drowns all ideas and initiatives that the government should be charged up with, to do and deliver. And as the huge, cumbersome bureaucracy prepares itself to adjust its steps to be in sync with a new political dispensation at the Centre, it continues speculating on the various possible combinations, marks time, puts decisions on the back-burner, slows down the pace deliberately, discourages out-of-the-box initiatives and reduces governance to status quo. 
    
	All this while India suffers. The let down is not quantifiable. The selfishness is palpable. The corruption is transparent. The standstill is apparent. Will the prime minister, with a little more than a year in office (assuming that the elections will take place when they are due), call the bluff of this kind of bureaucratic intrigue and compel some tangible actions that will help extricate this nation from some of its archaic and untenable realities?
    
	Will the cabinet take urgent cognizance of the recommendation to restructure the states and reduce the size of some to make our democratic functions socially viable? Uttar Pradesh is an example of a state that needs to be divided into four more manageable areas for better governance. Eighty elected representatives come to the Lok Sabha from UP and they determine the fate of the ruling dispensation at the Centre. Often, they hold perfectly sane governance to ransom, much like the Left Front has done with their arch-enemy, and unfortunate partner, the Congress. Smaller and more cohesive states have grown and developed economically because of their governable size. Many are beginning to offer opportunities in various disciplines, particularly in the service sector. Some have succeeded in dealing with caste disparities. Some have achieved high literacy levels, and so on.
        
	India suffering
    
	In a diverse and multi-cultural polity such as ours, a decentralized and functioning federalism is imperative for growth and development, peace and equanimity. Centralized governance can only polarize aspirations and stunt inclusive evolution, forcing this sub-continent to regress and lose its place in the international competitive arena. In the end, the strength of our civilization lies in the fact that we are a plural society with many cultures and languages that come together, surprisingly, as a cohesive whole, with a shared, common ethos, something that other continents are struggling to achieve. This intrinsic reality of our sub-continent could put us in a prime political position worldwide because we have learnt how to coexist, absorb and reject influences to suit our multi-dimensional society. 
    
	Modern Nation-State politics, alien to our indigenous systems of governance, was superimposed on us at the time of Independence, without the necessary cultural adjustments. This separated the people from the mechanism of the State and led to insular, exclusive administration. The tools that the British used to govern us natives were passed on to the brown sahibs.
    
	This thread from the Raj to modern democratic India has destroyed the ethos and values that Indians could identify with. The new rulers were worse because they were Indians and not foreigners. Instead of starting on a clean slate, instituting a legal system for Indians by Indians, laying down a framework within which to operate the administration of this infant nation, the founding fathers reinforced the colonial structure that had become redundant. This set us back in time and assisted the furthering of closed-door governance and a command economy that suppressed, for decades, the entrepreneurial and creative spirit of all Indians. Executive exploitation, neglect of the law, sycophancy, corruption  all led to rampant anarchy. We are paying the price of this folly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Corus fails to give Tatas the edge
                                                                                                               Corus fails to give Tatas the edge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, March 12: Tata Steel today announced a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,416 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 against Rs 1,055 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The numbers are not strictly comparable as this years third quarter results include the profits earned by Corus Group Plc, which was acquired by the company for $12 billion last year.        
	Tata Steel did not separately disclose the profits clocked by Corus. Analysts were disappointed by the numbers and reckoned that the Anglo-Dutch steel makers profits were lower than their estimates.        
	Two analysts at Morgan Stanley  Vipul Prasad and Ketaki Kulkarni  estimated that Corus had earned a profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of a little over Rs 1,800 crore, which was 12 per cent lower than their forecast.        
	The poor showing by Corus impacted the Tata Steel stock which plunged over 6 per cent on the BSE today. The stock closed at Rs 766.45 after opening at Rs 825 and hitting a low of Rs 760.        
	The brokerages were, however, optimistic about the future prospects of Tata Steel. They said the company would benefit from firm steel prices.        
	Tata Steel said during the quarter ended December 31, its turnover rose Rs 2,157 crore to Rs 32,096.03 crore.         
	This does not include the turnover of Rs 23,867 crore registered by Tata Steel UK (formerly Corus).        
	The growth in turnover was mainly attributed to Tata Steels Indian operations (Rs 472 crore), Natsteel (Rs 1,135 crore) and Tata Steel Thailand (Rs 554 crore).         
	The increase in Tata Steels domestic operations was primarily because of the increase in prices.         
	In the case of Natsteel and Tata Steel Thailand, the growth in the topline was on account of both price increases and a surge in volumes.        
	Tata Steel said total expenditure during the quarter amounted to Rs 28,967 crore (including total expenditure of Rs 22,808 crore of Tata Steel UK) against Rs 4,325 crore during the previous year.

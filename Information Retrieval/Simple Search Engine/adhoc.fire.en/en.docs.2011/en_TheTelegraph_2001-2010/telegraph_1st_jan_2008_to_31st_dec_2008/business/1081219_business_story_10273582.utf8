          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL                          
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: The State Bank of India today reduced the interest rate on loan to micro, small and medium enterprises by 50-100 basis points. The reduction will take effect from December 16.        
	Working capital finance will now be available to micro enterprises at an interest rate of 10.25 per cent.         
	According to a statement of the SBI, the reduction will benefit small-scale industries as well as larger entities with a working capital limit of up to Rs 10 crore.         
	The bank said it had already taken a slew of measures to support small and medium units reeling under the impact of the economic slowdown. These included the reduction of margin for loans and increasing the duration of the working capital period to cover the holding of inventory and receivables.         
	To meet the greater demand for cash, as a consequence of the increase in the duration of the working capital, the SBI has extended the limit for working capital by 20 per cent. This is under a scheme called SME Care.        
	Besides this, the bank has come out with a scheme to support units requiring generators to maintain production.         
	Its loans to small and medium units has increased to Rs 81,794 crore by November-end from Rs 74,324 crore in March. The SBI is one of the largest lenders to small and medium units.         
	This reduction comes days after public sector banks announced that they would give additional loans to small and medium units up to 20 per cent of their working capital limit. This will be need-based and on an ad-hoc basis. Besides, the existing credit facility of the units should be up to Rs 10 crore.        
	These loans can be repaid within a year with a provision of a moratorium of six months during which only interest will be paid.        
	On Monday, state-owned banks had slashed interest rates on home loans below Rs 20 lakh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel makers to hold prices
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel makers to hold prices
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Steel industry representatives have promised to continue with a moratorium on prices but sought checks on rising input costs.         
	The steel industry has told me that it will not increase prices for the time being, steel secretary P. K. Rastogi said here today. The government had in the last few days passed on a message to major steel manufacturers that they should not increase prices. It also held out the threat of coercive action such as bans on exports and even possible price control measures.        
	Rastogi today also reiterated a promise made in private to steel makers that the government would consider sympathetically their demands for duty cuts and other measures to ease input cost pressures. Steel ministry officials said a package of duty cuts on inputs was being given final touches.         
	I met the secretary of mines yesterday. He has agreed on certain issues and showed interest to meet (steel producers), Rastogi said. Officials said the government was likely to ask iron ore suppliers to sell at reasonable rates and enter into long-term contracts with steel makers.        
	A moratorium on increase in coal prices will also continue to ensure steel and cement manufacturers are not affected, officials said.        
	However, the steel ministry feels manufacturers have been enjoying high margins for quite some time, and it is only recently that they have started suffering some margin erosion.        
	The government had in April slapped a hefty 15 per cent export duty on semi-finished steel products and a 5 per cent export duty on galvanised sheets.         
	Imports of pig iron, mild steel products, such as hot-rolled and cold-rolled coil, sponge iron and semi-finished products were also made duty free.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High-value home loans get a boost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       High-value home loans get a boost
          JAYATI GHOSE                               
	New Delhi, May 6: More borrowers will opt for home loans in the range of Rs 20-30 lakh following the relief provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), according to bankers.        
	Reduced risk weight on housing loans means banks can lend more (up to Rs 30 lakh) and customers can borrow more at a lower interest rate. Therefore, a higher percentage of borrowers should take loans of up to Rs 30 lakh, Punjab National Bank executive director K. Raghuraman told The Telegraph.         
	The RBI in its monetary policy review has reduced the risk weight  the amount of capital set aside for a loan  on home loans of more than Rs 20 lakh and up to Rs 30 lakh to 50 per cent from 100 per cent.         
	Because of the lower provisioning requirements, bankers said the benefit would be extended to new customers and existing customers on floating rate. The RBI had reduced the risk weight on housing loans for up to Rs 20 lakh to 50 per cent from 75 per cent in May 2007. Home loans of up to Rs 20 lakh qualify as priority sector loans.         
	Amit Banerjee, research head at a nationalised bank, said, Since home loans of up to Rs 30 lakh will now be available at sub-Rs 20 lakh interest rates, many borrowers would like to move into the Rs 20-30 lakh bracket.         
	Earlier, home loans of up to Rs 20 lakh came with interest rates of 9.25-10.75 per cent, depending on the tenure. Loans of more than Rs 20 lakh were priced 50-75 basis points higher.         
	After the change in risk weightage, loans of Rs 20-30 lakh will be charged on a par with those of less than Rs 20 lakh, but there will be no change in interest rates for loans below that threshold. Nearly 80 per cent customers opt for loans of up to Rs 20 lakh. In the total home loan portfolio, 40 per cent are fixed rate loans.         
	Analysts said lower provisioning would also reduce the banks cost of lending and, therefore, bankers might pass the benefits to borrowers.         
	The effective capital adequacy ratio for loans of up to Rs 30 lakh will come down to half, which means banks have to park less funds for provisioning. Moreover, the RBI has allowed urban co-operative banks to lend up to Rs 50 lakh in Tier-II cities for housing.         
	These measures will also improve demand for home loans, said Raghuraman.         
	For the last one year, home loans had suffered a slowdown because of rising interest rates. The home loan portfolio of banks grew just 12 per cent between April 2007 and February 15, 2008 (Rs 26,930 crore) compared with 25.8 per cent (Rs 46,019 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year.

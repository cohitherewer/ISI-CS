	Mumbai, May 16: Tata Investment Corporation Ltd (TICL) will raise Rs 723 crore through a rights issue of zero-coupon convertible bonds.         
	The bonds, with a face value of Rs 650 each, will be offered to the existing shareholders in the ratio of one bond for every five shares held, the Tata Sons subsidiary said.        
	Each bond will have three parts. The first part of Rs 300 will be converted into one share on October 1, 2009. This will increase the companys share capital by Rs 6.89 crore. The second part of Rs 350 will be converted into one share on October 1, 2010, raising the share capital again by an identical amount.        
	The third part will be a detachable warrant which will entitle the holder, at his option, to purchase one share of the company by paying cash a price of Rs 400 in April 2011.         
	TICL, however, did not specify the objectives of this fund-raising exercise.

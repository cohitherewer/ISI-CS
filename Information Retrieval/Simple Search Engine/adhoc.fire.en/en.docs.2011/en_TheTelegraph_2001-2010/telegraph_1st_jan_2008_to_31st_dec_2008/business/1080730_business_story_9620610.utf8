	New Delhi, July 29: The Congress-led government is set to announce global auctions for 3G (third generation) mobile service licences on August 1, which have been opposed by both the telecom regulator and domestic players. 3G players will also be able to offer 2G (second generation) services, now accessed by all mobile phone users.        
	Senior telecom ministry officials said the government would also come out with a scheme of penalties for operators who were sitting on spectrum over and above the 6.2Mhz allotted to them.        
	Earlier last month, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding a one-time fee for spectrum held beyond 6.2 Mhz by GSM operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone.        
	Existing GSM operators are likely to vehemently oppose the proposal, while both GSM and CDMA operators will deeply resent global auctions for 3G licences. However, global auctions could boost revenues of the government. Analysts said the revenues could be in excess of Rs 21,000 crore.        
	Domestic entities such as Vodafone Essar, Bharti Airtel, the Tatas and Reliance Communications are expected to bid for 3G licences. Foreign firms such as AT amp;T, Frances Orange and UKs Virgin Mobile may join the fray. Virgin is already present in the country through a franchisee agreement with the Tatas. The 3G guidelines, being finalised by the Telecom Commission, proposes to auction 3G spectrum in the 2.1 Ghz band for GSM players and in the 800 Mhz band for CDMA players.        
	The guidelines also suggest that in the event of a merger or an acquisition, the new entity will have to pay the government 25 per cent of its new valuation (as a kind of a fee), the officials said. Earlier, the department of telecommunications (DoT) had proposed that there would not be any mergers and acquisitions for five years to discourage trading in spectrum. The levy would come into effect after the five-year cooling off period, the officials said.        
	Licensees who win the bidding will be required to pay half a per cent of total adjusted gross revenue to the government annually for the first three years. From the fourth year, it will be one per cent. About 30MHz would be sold through the auction.

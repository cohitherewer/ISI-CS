                          Pandit: Weak performance                    
	New York, Oct. 16 (PTI): Financial services behemoth Citigroup today reported a net loss of $2.8 billion for the third quarter ended September, partially blaming its poor health on deteriorating credit conditions in India.         
	The American giant led by chief executive Vikram Pandit also slashed 11,000 jobs. It had clocked a net profit of $2.2 billion for the same period a year ago.        
	In the third quarter, Citi incurred net pre-tax write-downs in securities and banking totalling $4.4 billion, net credit losses to the tune of $4.9 billion and another $3.9 billion as net charge to increase loan loss reserves.        
	Higher credit costs were mainly driven by a continued deterioration in the credit environment in India, where the business is being actively repositioned to reduce costs and mitigate losses, Citi said in a statement.        
	Citi said the headcount had been reduced by about 11,000 since the second quarter of 2008 and by nearly 23,000 in the first nine months of this year.        
	Its revenues for the third quarter stood at $16.7 billion, down 23 per cent compared with the corresponding period a year ago.         
	Merrill woe        
	Beleaguered investment banking major Merrill Lynchs losses widened to $5.15 billion for the third quarter as write-downs to the tune of $9.5 billion took a heavy toll on the bottomline.        
	Merrill Lynch recorded losses of $2.24 billion in the third quarter of 2007.        
	The US giant which is being taken over by its rival Bank of America posted losses for the fifth consecutive quarter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex at six-month low 
                                                                                                               Sensex at six-month low 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, March 13: Stocks floundered, the rupee tumbled and gold sparkled on another day of convulsions across global markets today.        
	The sensex plunged 771 points to 15357.35  its lowest level in the past six months  on a day when investors scrambled to dump stocks.        
	The ground crumbled for realty stocks that collapsed 12 per cent and bore the brunt of the savage selling that was precipitated by a sharp slowdown in industrial growth in January.        
	The fall in retail sales in the US accentuated concerns about the worlds largest economy where the fear of another recession looms.         
	The sensex hit the lowest intra-day level in 2008 at 15228.99. The fall wiped out about Rs 3.25 lakh crore of investors wealth today. The 50-share index of the National Stock Exchange also hit a six-month low at 4623.60, a loss of about 250 points.         
	Weak global markets have hurt investor sentiments badly. There was more panic when the stocks fell below the January lows. Short-term traders are exiting the market as there is no hope of any positive news from the government in the near term, said D.D. Sharma, senior vice-president (equity) at Anand Rathi Securities.         
	Sharma, however, believes that the market has reached as low as it can possibly go and the trend reversal should start any time soon.        
	The weakness in the stock markets had its impact on the rupee which ended lower by 10 paise against the dollar at 40.44.         
	Dollar slide        
	The dollar also had a bad hair day: it sank to a 12-year low against the yen. The dollar fell to a low of 99.77 yen after which it was traded at 100.48 yen. It was also weak against the euro. Analysts said a strong yen was also responsible for the weak Asian indices as major Japanese companies, particularly exporters, stand to lose in the event of the currency appreciating. It is felt that the strong yen could also lead to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.         
	This is a currency strategy in which an investor borrows yen at Japans low interest rates and converts it into US dollars to buy assets in other countries. The investors can make huge gains from this process. But if the dollar falls against the Japanese currency, the investors returns will diminish significantly, forcing them to sell stocks.         
	Gold shines        
	With crude oil prices hitting the $110-per-barrel mark, international gold prices were also seen ruling at $1,000 per ounce.

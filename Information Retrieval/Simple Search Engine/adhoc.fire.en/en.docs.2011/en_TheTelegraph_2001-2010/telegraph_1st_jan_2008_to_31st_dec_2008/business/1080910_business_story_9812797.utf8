	Mumbai, Sept. 9: Duvvuri Subbarao, the new Reserve Bank of India governor, reckons that inflation hasnt peaked as yet though it has shown some signs of moderation in the past few weeks.         
	Inflation leapt to a 13-year high of 12.63 per cent during the week ended August 9. It has since eased marginally to 12.34 per cent.         
	Addressing his first press conference since taking over as the RBI governor, Subbarao said it could take some time to tame inflation.         
	It is too early to take a call on inflation. However, I do have some sense of satisfaction that there has been a moderation in the wholesale price index number (based on which inflation is calculated). So my short answer is we are seeing some moderation, but I am not sure that we can see a discernible trend, he said here today.         
	Although food prices have dipped recently, there is a worry that higher prices of manufacturing inputs can stoke inflationary fires.         
	Subbarao felt that inflation had become a global phenomenon and was being driven by international commodity prices, particularly crude oil, metals and food.         
	Subbaraos predecessor, Yaga Venugopal Reddy, raised the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a seven-year high of 9 per cent after raising it twice in June.         
	He also increased the cash reserve ratio  the proportion of funds that lenders need to set aside as reserves  by 4 percentage points to 9 per cent since December 2006 to stem inflation.         
	While justifying Reddys measures to tame inflation, Subbarao said it was essential to ensure that inflation-busting measures didnt trammel growth.         
	On whether he would tighten the monetary policy, Subbarao said the central bank would watch the impact of the measures that had already been taken. It would also keep tabs on overseas developments and gauge their impact on economic management here.         
	Some have argued that the monetary measures initiated by the Reserve Bank will affect growth. As I had said earlier, the intent behind monetary tightening was to moderate demand and hence, some slowdown should not surprise us, he said.         
	Subbarao said although monetary authorities were independent, there was a need for closer co-ordination between the fiscal and monetary policies.         
	The RBI governor said he intended to pursue financial sector reforms but would draw from the lessons of global experience.

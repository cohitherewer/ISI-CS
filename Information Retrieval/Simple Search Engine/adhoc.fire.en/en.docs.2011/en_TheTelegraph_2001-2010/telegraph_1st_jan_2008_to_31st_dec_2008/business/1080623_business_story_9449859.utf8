        The stage is set for investment in overseas funds. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay tells you why                                            
	A flurry of overseas funds has flooded the Indian shores in recent times.        
	Till 2006, Principal Mutuals Global Opportunities Fund was the only scheme in the domestic market to invest in overseas stocks. Beginning 2007, a dozen more funds have hit the stands.        
	Global equities offer an avenue for portfolio diversification. With the liberalisation of norms, a resident individual can invest up to $200,000 in overseas stocks and mutual funds.        
	Basic rule        
	The basic rule of creating an investment portfolio is to include assets that have low or negative correlation in returns so that a fall in prices of one asset is counter-balanced by a rise or a smaller decline in the prices of other assets.        
	The Indian equity market has a low correlation to other emerging markets. The MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) India index has a correlation of 0.232137 with the MSCI-Emerging Markets index, measured since 2000 till date. This means that when Indian stock prices gain or lose 10 per cent, shares in the other emerging markets increase or decrease by 2.3 per cent on an average.         
	Therefore, it makes sense to diversify into equities of other emerging markets when stocks back home are battered, as is the case now.         
	Moreover, domestic equity markets have a different correlation with different emerging economies. For example, India has a high correlation of 0.5 with China but a low correlation of 0.3 with Brazil and Russia. India has a correlation of 0.21 with Mexico and 0.09 with Argentina.        
	A low or negative correlation, however, alone doesnt justify portfolio diversification. The ultimate aim of creating an investment portfolio is to get a reasonable return with tolerable volatility matching the risk appetite of the investor.         
	Volatility counts        
	The volatility of an asset is measured by its standard deviation, which is the deviation in returns from its mean value over a period of time.                  
	For example, the Indian stock markets have given an annual return of 37.7 per cent between December 2000 and December 2006 but with a standard deviation of 23.3 per cent. During the same period, Peru, Indonesia, Hungary, South Africa and Brazil gave much superior returns compared with India. But, at the same time, stock markets in these countries experienced greater volatility than the domestic bourses.        
	Thus, by investing part of the fund in equities in these countries, an investor could have earned a higher return, with a slightly higher risk, instead of investing only in the domestic market.         
	Role reversal        
	The situation has changed during the last 12 months with the domestic markets showing greater volatility compared with other emerging markets. The global equity funds launched by mutual funds in India have given better returns than domestic diversified equity funds and stock indices during the last six months. This makes a case for diversification through global equity investments.        
	Rupee watch        
	However, investors should take a note of the exchange value of the rupee vis--vis the US dollar while investing in a global equity fund. An appreciating rupee may actually eat into ones returns from such investments.        
	This can be illustrated with the example of ING (L) Invest Latin America Fund, the mother fund to which ING Mutual Funds proposed LatAm Equity Fund will feed into.                   
	In 2005, ING (L) Invest Latin America Fund gave a return of 81.8 per cent in dollar terms. But in rupee terms, the return was 63 per cent.         
	In 2006, the funds return in dollar terms was 30 per cent but it was 44 per cent in rupee terms. This was so because the Indian currency depreciated vis--vis the dollar in 2006. In 2007, when the rupee appreciated again, the return from the fund in dollar terms stood higher at 45.7 per cent compared with 27.3 per cent in rupee terms.         
	Tax poser        
	Another caveat for investment in global equity funds is the tax aspect. If a fund invests more than 65 per cent of its corpus in schemes other than domestic equities, investors wont get the short-term or long-term capital gains tax benefits.         
	On short-term capital gains, one has to pay income tax at a marginal rate corresponding to the income bracket. On long-term capital gains, an individual has to pay income tax at the rate of 10 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation.

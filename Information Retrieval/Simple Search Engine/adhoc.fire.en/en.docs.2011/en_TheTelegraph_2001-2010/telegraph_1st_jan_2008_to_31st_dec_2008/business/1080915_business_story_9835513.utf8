                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Crude falls below $100 
                            
	New York, Sept. 14 (Reuters): US crude oil futures fell more than $1 on Sunday, dropping below $100 a barrel as dealers bet Hurricane Ike did less damage to the countrys oil infrastructure than initially feared.         
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), oil prices were down $2.01 at $99.17 a barrel by 1740 GMT after falling as low as $98.55  the lowest since February 26.        
	 The oil market is selling off because early indications show Ike didnt do as much damage as feared, said Chris Jarvis, senior analyst at Caprock Risk Management. That said, this sell-off could prove to be a bit premature, since it could be a while before things get back to normal. Restoring power to the refineries is going to be a problem, he said.        
	Nymex opened a special energy trading session today because of increased trader interest about Hurricane Ike.

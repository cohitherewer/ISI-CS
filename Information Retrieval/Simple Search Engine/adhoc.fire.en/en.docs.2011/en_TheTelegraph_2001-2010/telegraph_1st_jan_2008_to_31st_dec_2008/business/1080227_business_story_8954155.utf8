     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Railway minister Lalu Prasad today announced schemes and measures to boost revenues.
    
	The railways plan to come out with Vision 2025 to provide a road map for the next 17 years.
    
	The government will invite private investment to the tune of Rs 2,50,000 crore over the next five years for the expansion of the network, modernisation and upgradation of technology. We will provide world class facilities to the passengers in the coming years, Lalu Prasad said.
    
	A large mix of internal resources and borrowings will fund the plan, said the railway minister. The balance will be funded by various public-private partnership programmes which will attract an investment of Rs 1,00,000 crore over the next five years.
    
	The minister said efforts were being made to acquire land for important railway projects. The legislation would be on the pattern of the highways act.
    
	In another initiative, the Indian Rail Bijli Company Limited, in a joint venture with NTPC Ltd, will set up a 1,000MW captive power plant in Nabinagar district of Bihar.
    
	The railways have also decided to set up a coach factory in Kerala. The ministry has taken this initiative because of the increasing requirement of passenger coaches both within the country and overseas. 
    
	Supply orders have been received from Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Myanmar, Angola and Senegal. Kerala has made available to the railways 1,000 acres for this factory. 
    
	The railways are also focusing on IT applications in three core areas freight service management, passenger service management and general management.
    
	A strategic business unit will be set up in the Railway Board for coal, cement, steel and container traffic. Lalu Prasad said this was being done to ensure timely settlement of all problems of our clients through a single window system. 
    
	He also announced the taking over of Mokama and Muzaffarpur wagon factories.

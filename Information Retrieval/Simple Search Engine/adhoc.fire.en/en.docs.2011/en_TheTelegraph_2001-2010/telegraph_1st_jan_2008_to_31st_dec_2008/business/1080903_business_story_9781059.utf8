   Banking, realty lead pack of gainers          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 2: Equities staged a strong rally today following a sharp drop in crude oil prices. Led by rate-sensitive stocks, the BSE sensex surged over 551 points to close at 15049.86 points.        
	Crude oil prices were hammered to nearly $107 per barrel after Hurricane Gustav spared major oil facilities in the US Gulf region.         
	Market observers said the falling crude oil prices reduced fears of a rise in interest rates.        
	The biggest gainers as a result were banking and realty scrips. The BSE Realty Index and the BSE Bankex led the gainers list with an impressive rise of 7.35 per cent and 6.06 per cent, respectively.        
	Among banking stocks, ICICI Bank spurted 7.3 per cent, the State Bank of India leapt 7.4 per cent, while HDFC Bank rose 3.5 per cent.        
	In the realty pack, DLF shares finished at Rs 529.85, a gain of 7.1 per cent, and Unitech at Rs 169.60, also up over 7 per cent.        
	The sensex, which opened firm at 14609.44, spurted to an intra-day high of 15106.15 and thereafter ended at 15049.86, a gain of 551.35 points, or 3.80 per cent, over the previous close.         
	This is the biggest single-session point-wise gain since July 23, 2008 when the key index jumped by 838 points.        
	On the National Stock Exchange, the broader 50-share Nifty also jumped 155.35 points, or 3.57 per cent, to close at 4504.00 from its last close.        
	Oil and Natural Gas Corporation rose 7 per cent to Rs 1,101.55 on expectations that it would have to bear a lower subsidy burden. Airline stocks such as Jet Airways and Deccan Aviation were also in the thick of action.        
	Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries and Reliance Communications also contributed to the overall bullish sentiment.        
	The market breadth was positive, with 1,676 advances and 986 losers.         
	The trading volume jumped to Rs 6,407.38 crore from Rs 4,854.14 crore yesterday.         
	An analyst with a domestic brokerage said crude oil prices would continue to determine movement of the stock markets over the near term.         
	However, the bullish sentiment at the equity markets was not passed on to the forex markets where the rupee finished weak against the dollar.         
	The Indian currency ended at Rs 44.39 per dollar, lower than the previous close of 44.17 per dollar because of a combination of heavy purchases from oil companies and a strong dollar overseas.        
	The domestic currency breached the 44-mark yesterday for the first time in more than 17 months at 44.19 a dollar. Forex dealers said the scarce availability of the US currency following its gaining strength in the overseas market weighed against the rupee.        
	The rupee has fallen by 69 paise, or 1.58 per cent, in the four straight sessions starting August 27.        
	They said foreign banks and oil refiners stepped up dollar purchases in the latter part of the day in the face of the surging greenback in international markets.        
	In the overseas market, the dollar extended its rally to a fresh 2008 high against a basket of currencies as oil prices fell sharply, raising expectations of lower global inflation.

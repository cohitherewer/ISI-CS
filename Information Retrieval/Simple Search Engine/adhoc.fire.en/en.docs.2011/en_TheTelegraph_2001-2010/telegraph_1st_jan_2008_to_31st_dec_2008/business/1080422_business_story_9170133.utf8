          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 21: Reliance Industries (RIL) has once again reported strong results on the strength of its refining and marketing (R amp;M) business  but next year the revenue gusher will move upstream.        
	Towards the end of this year, the famed D6 concession in the Krishna-Godavari basin is expected to start commercial operation.         
	Another revenue stream will come from Reliance Petroleum  the greenfield refinery in Jamnagar  which is also expected to be ready. RIL owns a 70.38 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum.        
	Although analysts feel that the full impact of both these developments will only be seen in 2009-10, a trailer can be evident from the current fiscal, particularly the latter half.         
	Reliance Petroleum was initially estimated to start commercial production in December.         
	However, there are indications that it may start the operations sooner  probably in September. Gas from the KG basin is expected to flow from August. Officially, however, RIL maintains that it will be operational from the second half of the current year.        
	We estimate that RIL should post 35 per cent growth in its bottomline during this fiscal. The prospects for the company are huge considering the production from the KG basin and the refinery, said Sudeep Anand, oil and gas analyst at Religare.        
	However, there are others who are not optimistic about the gas flow. Much will depend on the way the courts decide on its dispute with Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd and NTPC over the issue of cheap gas supplies.

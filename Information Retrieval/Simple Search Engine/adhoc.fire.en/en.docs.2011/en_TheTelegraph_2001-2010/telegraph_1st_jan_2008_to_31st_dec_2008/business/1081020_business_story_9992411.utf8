          JAYATI GHOSE                          Tough call                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Stakeholders in the mobile phone industry will meet on Wednesday to settle their differences over the governments move to charge less for 3G spectrum use vis--vis 2G.        
	To encourage greater foreign investment in 3G (third-generation) mobile services, the department of telecom (DoT) had recently stipulated that telecom players would need to pay 1 per cent of their gross revenues from 3G services as spectrum usage charges compared with 4-6 per cent for 2G services.         
	The finance ministry, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the CDMA operators feel that the separation of 2G and 3G earnings is difficult and can give rise to revenue loss for the government. GSM players, on the other hand, believe the process is workable.         
	According to GSM players, since the 2G and 3G base stations are different and distinctly identifiable, the segregation can be done on the basis of traffic generated by the stations.         
	A high-level committee set up by the DoT to resolve the issue has convened a meeting of all telecom firms on Wednesday.        
	Foreign telecom players, reeling under the financial crisis, will find the lower spectrum charge an added incentive to enter the 3G space, the DoT officials said.         
	The DoT, which expects to earn at least Rs 20,000 crore from the sale of 3G spectrum, wants to ensure participation from global telecom firms to maximmise its revenues.        
	According to telecom analyst Sudipto Basu, For foreign telecom players, who want to deploy standalone 3G high-end mobile value-added services, such as real-time transactions, video streaming and data services, a lower spectrum usage charge will be attractive.         
	The DoT feels telecom operators can segregate their revenues on the basis of traffic generated.         
	The volume of traffic for each service type is available from billing systems or other network elements on a cellular level. It is possible to sum all service traffic from 2G cells and 3G cells independently and return a traffic ratio for the network as a whole, officials said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Seshasayee: Moving ahead                                  
	Mumbai, May 8: Ashok Leyland will invest around Rs 3,000 crore over the next three years to nearly double its current capacity of 84,000 vehicles annually.        
	The flagship company of the Hinduja group today said the investment would enable it to add 100,000 vehicles per annum to its capacity by 2010.         
	Leyland is planning to roll out iBus, the low-floor model for the metros, this year at a time when the domestic truck market is reeling under high interest rates.        
	The company is also extending its range of tractors. In the current year, 4,921 tractors and 3,121 multi-axle vehicles have been taken up for full scale production and all-India marketing, the company said while declaring the results for the period ended March 31, 2008 today.        
	It registered a sales turnover of Rs 7,729.12 crore in 2007-08 compared with Rs 7,168.17 crore in the previous fiscal. With other income of Rs 73.99 crore, the total income was Rs 7,803.12 crore against Rs 7,238.97 crore in the previous fiscal. Net profit rose 6.4 per cent to Rs 469.31 crore from Rs 441.28 crore.        
	Net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008 rose to Rs 181 crore from Rs 172 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	Managing director R. Seshasayee said the company compensated for the slowdown in the trucks division by improving its share in the bus segment, which registered high growth. He added that international operations and the engines and spares businesses, too, contributed to the companys performance.         
	Our bottomline was benefited by some aggressive value engineering, sourcing initiatives and higher productivity. Despite rising input costs, we improved our operating margin by 60 basis points to 10.40 per cent, he said.        
	Hind Motors profit        
	Hindustan Motors today reported a 79.37 per cent drop in standalone net profit for the quarter ended March 31 at Rs 10.95 crore compared with Rs 53.07 crore in the same period last year.        
	The companys total income during the quarter, however, increased 23.06 per cent to Rs 194.22 crore from Rs 157.82 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The standalone net profit for the year ended March 31 was at Rs 30.84 crore against Rs 13.30 crore last fiscal, an over two-fold jump. Total income for 2007-08 also increased 6.70 per cent to Rs 677.89 crore.

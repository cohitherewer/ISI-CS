          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ahluwalia: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Planning Commission is preparing a strategy for investment in infrastructure projects to boost the Indian economy.        
	It has identified three focus areas  roads, irrigation and housing. The panel will present an action plan to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who heads the apex committee on economic slowdown.         
	A huge spend on infrastructure is expected to create demand for steel, cement and construction, and create jobs.         
	We anticipate private sector investments to come down. The government will have to walk in with higher investment spreads, officials said.         
	There are few takers for public-private partnerships in upcoming infrastructure projects. The government, therefore, needs to bring a second supplementary demand for grants before Parliament to pay the extra cash needed, the officials said.        
	Ahluwalia also said there was no need to alter the growth rate target of 9 per cent for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.         
	The plan panel deputy chairman said he hoped inflation, which has come down to 8.9 per cent, would decline further, giving the RBI leeway to lower interest rates.         
	OECD projection        
	Indias growth rate will slip to 7 per cent during the current year before rising to 7.3 per cent in 2009-10, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the 30-member group of industrialised nations, said in its economic outlook.

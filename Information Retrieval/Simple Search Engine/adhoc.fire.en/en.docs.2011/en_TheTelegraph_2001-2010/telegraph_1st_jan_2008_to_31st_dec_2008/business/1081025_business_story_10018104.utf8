          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Khelil in Vienna on Friday. (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) today decided to cut production by at least 1.5 million barrels a day. The reduction, announced at an emergency meeting in Vienna, will come into effect on November 1.         
	Oil prices have more than halved since peaking at $147 a barrel in July. After the Opec statement, the price for Brent crude immediately dropped below $63 a barrel  a fall of more than $4.         
	Analysts said the cut might not be enough to reduce the slide in prices because the global economic crisis had already reduced demand.        
	Opec president Chakib Khelil said the cuts could reach 1.8 million barrels per day before the end of the year but denied that the reduction would jeopardise global economies.        
	The Indian government said the Opecs decision had failed to halt the slide in crude prices and said this was a welcome sign.         
	However, the free fall of the rupee against the dollar would make it difficult for the government to reduce petrol and diesel prices.        
	Any decision to cut the prices of diesel and petrol will have to take into consideration not only the fall in global crude price but also the rupee-dollar exchange rate, petroleum ministry officials said.

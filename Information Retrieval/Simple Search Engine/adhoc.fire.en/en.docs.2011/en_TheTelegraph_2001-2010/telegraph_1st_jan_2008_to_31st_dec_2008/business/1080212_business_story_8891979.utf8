The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms see big gains in shipbuilding
                                                                                                               Firms see big gains in shipbuilding
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: Indian companies are investing heavily in the shipbuilding business.        
	According to Shipping Corporation of India managing director S. Hajara, Shipyards all over the world are booked until 2011-2012. More than 45 per cent of the Indian fleet are single-hull.        
	These will not be allowed to sail after 2010 under maritime law. Therefore, there is a need to replace the vessels, which gives Indian yards a tremendous opportunity, he said. JSW Infrastructure and Logistics Ltd is the latest to join the string of firms venturing into the segment.        
	The company will invest Rs 5,000 crore in its marine infrastructure over the next five years. It plans to build two shipyards, which will also be special economic zones, in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.        
	JSW said the move was primarily to meet its own requirements but it would also look at commercial ventures in the long run.        
	Shipbuilding is essentially a cyclical business and many European yards have opted out of it. Indian companies, however, are upbeat on the sector.         
	ABG Shipyard, an established player in the field, has its hands full with an order book of Rs 8,270 crore. Shipping Corporation of India, too, is venturing into shipbuilding in collaboration with a partner.        
	Larsen amp; Toubro, which decided to venture into shipbuilding last year, is constructing eight ships at its Hazira yard. The company plans to invest Rs 2,500 crore in a new yard and an SEZ in Tamil Nadu over the next two years.        
	In shipbuilding, we find a natural synergy with our capability to absorb technology. This industry needs engineering manpower and the ability to execute, which were doing all the time while competing with the Koreans and the Japanese, said A.M. Naik, managing director and chief executive officer of Larsen amp; Toubro.         
	Since Korean and Japanese yards are overbooked, orders are naturally flowing into India, he added.        
	L amp;T is betting big on ship repairing and dry docking to garner sustained business in the long run.        
	Gujarat Adani Ports is also making its foray into shipbuilding. It plans to set up a yard near the Mundra port.         
	Offshore service provider Dolphin Offshore Ltd is forging alliances with domestic companies for a Rs 400-crore shipyard.        
	A shipping analyst said on a global scale, over 70 per cent of the anchor handling tug supply vessels and 60 per cent of the platform supply vessels were more than 20 years old and needed to be replaced.         
	It will lead to a demand for more vessels, which can be met by the low-cost manufacturers in China and India.         
	As for Indian yards, they barely meet 30 per cent of the countrys shipbuilding requirements, the analyst said.        
	Korea, Japan and China together account for over 80 per cent of the $500-billion global shipbuilding industry, while the combined capacity of all the 28 Indian shipyards is $6 billion, accounting for 1.2 per cent of the global market.         
	However, market watchers believe that the Indian yards have grown more than 10 times since 2002.        
	Mumbai-based consultants i-maritime Consultancy Pvt Ltd has predicted that Indias share in global shipbuilding could go up to 15 per cent of the world market by 2020, riding mainly on cost competitiveness and supply of skilled manpower.        
	An i-maritime consultant said the outlook remained bullish for the next four years and the company did not see a lull immediately, but saturation might happen over time.

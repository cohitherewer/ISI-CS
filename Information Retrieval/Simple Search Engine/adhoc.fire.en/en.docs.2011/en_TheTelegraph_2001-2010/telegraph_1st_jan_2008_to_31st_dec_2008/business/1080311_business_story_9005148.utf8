The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hedge loss lashes L amp;T
                                                                                                               Hedge loss lashes L amp;T
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 10: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) stunned the markets today by announcing a Rs 200-crore loss on commodity hedging deals transacted by its Sharjah-based subsidiary.        
	The Rs 18,000-crore engineering giant said the losses at its subsidiary  Larsen amp; Toubro International FZE  would not impact the parents balance sheet in the last quarter of 2007-08 but pundits remain sceptical.        
	The company argued that the losses would be more than offset by the 12 per cent increase in its margins during the year. However, analysts predict that the subsidiarys losses will trim its fourth quarter profits by 8 to 10 per cent.        
	The L amp;T stock, which opened at Rs 2,980 on the BSE, was battered today after the announcement. It plunged to an intra-day low of Rs 2,615.05, before closing at Rs 2,728.80, a sharp decline of 8.7 per cent.        
	The company clarified that the commodity hedging deals were not speculative but part of normal business transactions. It said it had pared its hedging exposures to almost nil and was reviewing this aspect of its business. Sharjah-based L amp;T FZE had been trading on the London Metal Exchange over the past two years.        
	Commodity transactions, mainly metals, account for almost 40 per cent of our $6-billion order book. Our hedging exposure was less than 10 per cent of our metals business. In view of the volatility in the metals market, we are going to review this business, said L amp;Ts chief financial officer Y.M. Deosthalee.        
	The company denied that it had concealed the losses on its hedging deals until the third quarter. It claimed the losses showed up only towards the end of the quarter.        
	In 2006-07, we earned a profit of Rs 150 crore on our commodities trading. But this year, the markets have been extremely volatile, Deosthalee said.         
	The losses emerged in a conference call with a brokerage where L amp;T gave out the figures to correct analysts who were projecting high profits for the company.        
	In the short term, there is some more pain for L amp;T. But in the medium and long term, it is expected to grow at 30 per cent, said an analyst at India Infoline

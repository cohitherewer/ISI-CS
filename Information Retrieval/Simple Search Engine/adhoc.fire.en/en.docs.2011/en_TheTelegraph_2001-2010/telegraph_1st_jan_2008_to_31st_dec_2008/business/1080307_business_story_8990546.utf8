	New Delhi, March 6: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today made a pitch for cutting the interest rate on home loans up to Rs 20 lakh.        
	With the general election next year and many states going to the polls this year, the finance ministers call for the cut is expected to go down well with the rank and file of home loan borrowers.         
	As much as 80 per cent of home loans are below Rs 20 lakh.        
	Addressing an Assocham meeting on the budget, Chidambaram said, I made a number of efforts to impress upon bankers in this regard. It is a constant effort that I will have to make. Bankers will have to take a call, the RBI will have to take a call.         
	I shall certainly bear in mind that there is a public demand that interest rates for borrowers, who take housing loans of up to Rs 20 lakh, must be lowered, he said.        
	These loans have less risk weight than those above Rs 20 lakh and, therefore, bankers have incentives to lend at lower interest rates, Chidambaram said.        
	Any cut in lending rates may disturb RBIs growth and inflation projections.         
	However, Chidambaram said RBI governor Y.V. Reddy, can never please everyone. It is his judgement call what should be the interest rates in order to contain inflation and promote growth.         
	He said the government wanted to promote growth without stoking inflation. Though Chidambaram held a meeting with the RBI board later in the day, sources said the rate cut did not come up for discussion.        
	Bank stand         
	A senior official, who looks after retail finance at a public sector bank, said there was a case for bringing down interest rates on home loans below Rs 20 lakh, but each bank would have to look at its loan liabilities before taking a decision.        
	It all depends on the cost of funds that hasnt fallen significantly till now, he said.         
	However, he added, the be ginning of the next fiscal could see some banks bringing down interest rates on these loans as deposit rates might inch downwards.        
	Private sector banks feel interest rates are likely to remain stable for some time now.        
	Dividend tax        
	On the need to avoid double taxation of dividend distribution tax for all types of firms, Chidambaram said companies were trying to promote tax shelters when they were making such an argument.        
	If you search your hearts, you know you are not speaking for multi-layer operation companies, your plea is on behalf of multi-layer shell companies, which are simply created and operated from one desk by one man for tax shelters, the finance minister said.        
	Chidambaram said the increase in the short-term capital gains tax rate to 15 per cent from 10 per cent would encourage investors to hold on to their investments for a longer period.

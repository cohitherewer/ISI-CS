          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, May 29: Indias economic growth in 2007-08 may be higher at 9 per cent on the back of government claims of 3.5 per cent farm growth against an earlier estimate of 2.6 per cent.        
	Based on the 2.6 per cent farm growth  agriculture has a weight of 24 per cent in the calculation of the gross domestic product (GDP)  the economy was expected to grow 8.6 per cent against 9.4 per cent growth in 2006-07.        
	The final estimates in agriculture are much higher. It could be 3.5 per cent in the revised estimates, statistics and programme implementation secretary Pronab Sen said here today. The government will release tomorrow growth rates of the economy, calculated on the basis of GDP, in the last fiscal.        
	The agriculture ministry had in April revised upwards foodgrain output figures for 2007-08 by 10 million tonnes to 227.32mt, which was disputed by several top farm economists, including the then chairman of the agricultural costs and prices commission.        
	Economists in the Planning Commission had said the upward revision was a statistical exercise. It was dependant on the reporting by the agricultural ministry which may not be totally reliable.         
	With inflation at a four-year high of nearly 8 per cent, the better farm and GDP growth figures could help the UPA score some brownie points over the Opposition.        
	In the revised estimates, the agriculture growth rate could be higher by 0.7 to 0.8 per cent, Sen said while speaking on the sidelines of a function to release the final results of the fifth economic census.        
	The government claimed that the output of wheat, rice, coarse grains, pulses, oilseeds and cotton had touched a record level in 2007-08.

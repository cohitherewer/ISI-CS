	London, July 6: Lloyds of London, the worlds largest reinsurance market, is withdrawing its main representative in India amid growing frustration at the lacklustre pace at which the country is opening up its financial services industry to foreign investors.        
	The move underlines the difficulties faced by overseas companies that want to capture a slice of Indias fast growing economy even as Indian companies invest overseas in record numbers.        
	Lloyds has decided to mothball its Mumbai office because it has so far been unable to secure a licence to write insurance business locally and believes it has little prospect of doing so in the near future.        
	Although it will retain the services of two junior employees on the ground in Mumbai, Lloyds has suggested that its senior representative should seek alternative employment.        
	Lord Levene of Portsoken, the chairman of Lloyds, has visited India to lobby for the liberalisation of its foreign investment rules on several occasions and is unhappy that India is now the only major market in the world to block overseas companies from participating in the domestic reinsurance market.        
	Lloyds is estimated to write $400 million in business for the Indian market from London every year but believes it could gain a much greater share of the reinsurance sector if it were allowed to write business locally.        
	We were very heartened by the discussions between the then Chancellor and the Indian government in early 2007 that the Indian reinsurance market would be opened up to foreign reinsurers, said Levene.         
	On the basis of that we appointed a senior representative, but despite the promises that were made it is now clear that there is absolutely no progress in sight. We are very disappointed, he added.

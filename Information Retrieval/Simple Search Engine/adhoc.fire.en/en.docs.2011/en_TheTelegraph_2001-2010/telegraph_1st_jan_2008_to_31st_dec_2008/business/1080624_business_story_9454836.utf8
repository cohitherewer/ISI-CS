          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 23: Bankers believe Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy is sending out a coded signal to them that they should raise lending rates to tamp down on rising demand.        
	On June 11, the RBI had raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8 per cent but most banks hadnt responded by raising rates. Reddy seems to be nudging them to take a cue from the repo rate hike.         
	Bankers also reckon that Reddys latest statement indicates that there will be some monetary tightening but it wont be as aggressive as many had feared when the startling inflation numbers came out last Friday.        
	Reddys comments have certainly soothed nervous market players who had expected a knee-jerk reaction to the inflation numbers. While it indicates that the RBI will not be impulsive, there is a clear indication to banks from the central bank that it wants them to hike lending rates, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda (BoB).        
	Until now, HDFC Bank is the only one that has raised its prime lending rate (PLR) by a quarter of a percentage point to 15.25 per cent. Elsewhere, Punjab National Bank has indicated that it will revise its lending and deposit rates by the end of this month.        
	I call upon all market participants, in particular the financial market participants, to appreciate the problem with the analysis at their command, participate with us in managing demand, Reddy said today.        
	Bankers say that this is a strong call from him asking them to increase lending rates that will manage demand and thereby curb inflationary expectations.         
	Some bankers interpreted Reddys statement to mean that the RBI would wait for banks to raise their lending rate in response to its June 11 move before coming out with further monetary measures. Many banks are likely to wait for a few days more before revising their lending rates.        
	After inflation hit a 13-year high last Friday, there were fears in some quarters that the RBI might raise the repo rate by another 50 basis points. Others speculated that the cash reserve ratio would also be raised by 25 basis points.        
	The easing of tensions was reflected at the bond markets where yields on the benchmark 10 year security initially hit a high of 8.76 per cent on fears of an aggressive action by the RBI. It, however, ended at 8.63 per cent, the same closing as on Friday after the markets analysed Reddys comments.

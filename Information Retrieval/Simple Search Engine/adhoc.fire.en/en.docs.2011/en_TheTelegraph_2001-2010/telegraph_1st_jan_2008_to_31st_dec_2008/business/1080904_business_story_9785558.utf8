	Hong Kong, Sept.3 (Reuters): Coca-Cola will pay $2.5 billion for Chinese juice maker Huiyuan, strengthening the worlds leading drinks makers hold on a booming market, in the biggest foreign takeover in China.        
	The US firm will pay HK$12.20 a share in cash  43 times Huiyuans forecast 2008 earnings and nearly three times its Friday close of HK$4.14, sending the Chinese firms shares up 170 per cent.        
	Major acquisitions have slowed to a trickle in past years in a fragmented Chinese consumer industry as companies struggle with competition and a slide in margins. Local brand names also resist foreign control.        
	Coca-Cola dominates the Chinese diluted-juice market and hopes to make inroads into the pure-juice sector, analysts say.        
	Coca-Cola is looking to tap the pure juice market where Huiyuan is the market leader, said Emma Liu, an analyst with Nomura Securities.        
	Though its a relatively small market in the beverages space, its potential is high because of the growing personal income in China and increased health awareness, she said.        
	The Chinese juice market  encompassing pure juice, diluted juices and nectars  is expected by analysts to grow at above 10 per cent in coming years alongside rising incomes, benefiting Huiyuan, Tingyi, Uni-president and others.        
	Huiyuan controls about 43 per cent of the pure-juice market, according to AC Nielsen figures cited by the company.         
	They are in the same industry and it will take a lot of effort to build a brand name, especially in China, said Andrew To, sales director at Tai Fook Securities Co Ltd. The premium is being paid for Huiyuans brand name and sales network, he said.

                                I am 70-years-old. I would like to deposit Rs 4 lakh in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme with a post office. Can I open a joint account with my wife who is 58-years-old? How long is the tenure of the scheme? What will happen if the first account holder dies before the term of the deposit? Will the deposit continue to earn interest or the second holder will have to withdraw the money? Will there be any tax liability?          K.K. Mitra, Calcutta
                    You can open a joint account with your wife. There is no age limit for the second account holder. If the first holder dies before the maturity of the account, the spouse may continue with the account. An account can be opened for a minimum of 5 years. Though premature withdrawal is allowed in the scheme, any such withdrawal will attract a penalty. There is no income tax exemption and the interest accruing to the account is taxable. TDS is also applicable.                                   House warming      I am a salaried person and my income is not taxable. I want to purchase a flat worth about Rs 8 lakh. My father is above 65 years of age. His income is also not taxable. If he bears the entire cost or part of it for buying the flat in my name, what will be the income tax implications? What documents are required for the registration of the flat?        Sudipta Ghosh, Habra
                    If your father buys the flat in your name, it amounts to gifting you the flat by your father. You can also buy the flat jointly with a bank loan. Both of you can claim tax deductions under Section 24 and Section 80C on repayment of the housing loan. The sale deed and blueprint of the property are required for registration.                                   Senior worry      I am 68-years-old. I have deposited Rs 5 lakh in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. I have been submitting Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source. I have a monthly pension of Rs 7,500 per month. Do I have to pay income tax?        Nanda Dulal Bhadra, Gobardanga
                    Your total annual income is Rs 1,35,000, including Rs 45,000 as annual interest income from the SCSS scheme, which is far less than the basic exemption limit of Rs 2,25,000 for senior citizens. You dont have to pay any tax. However, youll have to submit Form 15H every year for non-deduction of tax on interest.

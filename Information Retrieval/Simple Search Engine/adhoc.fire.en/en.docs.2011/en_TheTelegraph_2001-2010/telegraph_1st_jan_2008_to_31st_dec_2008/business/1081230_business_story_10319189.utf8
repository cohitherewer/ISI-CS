	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Hyundai Motors India will hike car prices from January because of rising input costs.         
	Raw material prices, labour costs and other input costs have increased. We are looking to hike prices by less than 2 per cent some time in January, said H.S. Lheem, managing director, Hyundai Motors.         
	The company today launched its premium hatchback  the i20.        
	Launching of a car requires at least 3-4 months of preparation, which we had already done. So, we decided to go ahead with the launch, Lheem said.        
	Available at an introductory price range of Rs 4.80-Rs 5.82 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the i20 has a 1.2-litre Kappa engine and will compete with Marutis Swift and General Motors U-VA.        
	According to Lheem, Hyundai aims to sell 1.2 lakh units of the i20 in the overseas markets and 20,000 units in the domestic market next year. He said the company would launch a Sonata variant by the middle of next month.        
	The i20 will be manufactured at the companys Chennai facility and exported worldwide.         
	The company has already started exporting to Europe from November.        
	Falling demand has forced the Korean company to reduce its 2008 sales target to 4.9 lakh cars from 5.3 lakh.         
	Hyundai has asked the government to provide special incentives for exports.         
	The government should provide all support to us, like widening the scope of the focus market scheme to cover more countries where we export, Lheem said.

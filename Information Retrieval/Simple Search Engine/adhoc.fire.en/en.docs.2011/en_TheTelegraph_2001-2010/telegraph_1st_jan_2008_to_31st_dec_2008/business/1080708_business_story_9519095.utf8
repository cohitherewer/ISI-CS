          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Tanti: Widening reach		      
	Mumbai, July 7: Suzlon Energy promoter, the Tanti group, and Bahrains Arcapita Bank will jointly invest $2 billion in Chinese wind farms.         
	For this purpose, the duo have acquired Honiton Energy Holdings, which will create a capacity of 1650MW in the inner Mongolia region.         
	Colossus Holdings, a Singapore-based holding company of the Tanti group, will form the joint venture with Arcapita to implement the project.        
	The JV (joint venture) partners have signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Honiton, a Chinese wind energy generation company, which will build the portfolio, the Tanti group said in a statement.        
	According to Tulsi R. Tanti, director of Colossus Holdings and chairman and managing director of Suzlon Energy, This investment reinforces our commitment towards the renewable energy sector and belief in the exponential growth potential of wind energy in developing markets such as China and India.         
	Honiton, having developed a pipeline of projects and backed by a strong management team, provides us with a good opportunity to further our interests in the wind energy sector along with Arcapita, Tanti said.        
	Suzlon had recently raised its stake in German firm REpower Systems to 66 per cent. Last year, the company was engaged in a bitter battle for REpower with Paris-based Areva.         
	Suzlon is the fifth largest wind power company in the world, with a market share of over 10.5 per cent in 2007.        
	Honiton was established in 2005 to develop and operate wind power generation facilities within China. It has 50MW of installed capacity and is developing 100 MW more.         
	In addition, has entered into agreements to develop five more wind farms in China, which will take its capacity to 1,650 MW by 2012.         
	Installed wind power capacity in China at the end of 2007 was 6,000MW.

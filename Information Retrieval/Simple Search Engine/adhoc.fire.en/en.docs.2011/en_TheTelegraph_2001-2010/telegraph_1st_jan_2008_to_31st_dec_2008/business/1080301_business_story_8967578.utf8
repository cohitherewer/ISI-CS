The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Smart card to plug PDS leak
                                                                                                               Smart card to plug PDS leak
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: The public distribution system is being prepared for an overhaul long overdue.         
	P. Chidambaram said the government would launch a pilot project to try out a smart card-based delivery system to plug the leaks in the PDS and other welfare programmes this year.        
	The smart cards will initially be tested in Haryana and Chandigarh. They will be issued to a target group -- people below the poverty line (BPL families).         
	The government has often spoken about revolutionising the PDS system with two distinct groups of beneficiaries: BPL families and those above the poverty line. The smart card system marks the first step towards a directed rationing system.        
	The government has allotted Rs 32,667 crore next year for food subsidy under the PDS and other welfare programmes, Chidambaram said. The food subsidy bill has been put at Rs 31,545.59 crore in 2007-08. The finance minister also mentioned ways to strengthen the PDS system through adequate supplies, reasonable subsidies and efficient delivery of the subsidised food.         
	The Planning Commission had constituted a working group to look into smart cards. The group was formed following the findings of a study in 2005 which revealed that about 57 per cent of subsidised grains do not reach the target group, out of which over 36 per cent was siphoned off the supply chain.        
	As the Centre spends about Rs 25,000 crore a year on grain subsidies (the budget amount for 2006-07 was Rs 24,200 crore), Rs 13,000 crore is wasted and diverted every year.                                 
	Taking into account the inefficiencies of the PDS, the study said the government spends Rs 3.65 to transfer Re 1 to the poor. Implementation is also plagued by errors of exclusion and inclusion, the study added.  
	INDUSTRY SPEAK  
	The budget is positive from the perspective of demand for steel products. The other encouraging aspects of the budget include a general reduction in cenvat rate and cut in customs duty on project imports, decisions regarding skill development programmes and introduction of health insurance schemes for unorganised sectors. Reduction in personal income tax will leave more disposable income in the hands of consumers. However, inflation still remains a cause for concern

  chairman, SAIL  
	Demand for paper will get a fillip from increased allocation for education and excise duty reduction. No change in customs duty will help domestic industry in facing competition from imports, reduction in excise duty and changes in income tax slab will boost consumer demand. However, increase in short-term capital gains tax will have a negative 
  effect. The cement industry will also be affected by a change in excise duty.

  Managing Director, JK Paper Ltd  
	We realise that it was an election budget. However, a lot of aspects of it have confirmed that the finance minister has done a remarkable job. He has ensured that the growth momentum will continue... And we, as an industry, are completely sure that we will be able to maintain the 9 per cent growth 
  mdash; Rajeev Chandrasekhar, 
  president, Ficci   Corporate taxes are at fair levels. An increase of 5 per cent on short-term capital gains will make people hold for medium term

  Managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank 
    The budget will promote inclusive growth in the country through its focus on agriculture and social sector. However, the issue of incentivising industry by giving it more benefits could have been addressed more strongly to promote growth

  This is a mixed budget and the FM has not touched upon the corporate tax, which we were anticipating. The focus is on agriculture and education sector. There is a little disappointment on not meeting the concerns on iron ore conservation and the taxes imposed on chrome ore export are also a long-pending demand of ours, which is a welcome step 
  mdash; Sajjan Jindal, Vice-chairman and Managing director of JSW Steel
  This budget will propel all round growth in the country and positively impact both the urban and rural sections. It also gives an impetus to significant improvement in healthcare. The budget provides the healthcare industry an incentive to take quality healthcare to semi-urban and rural areas. Tax holiday for hospitals outside major cities is a revolutionary step towards making quality healthcare accessible to the common man. The finance minister has paved the way for universal health insurance by exempting income tax on the premium paid for health insurance of parents
  mdash; Prathap C Reddy, Chairman, Apollo Group of Hospitals  The excise duty cut on two and three-wheelers to 12 per cent from 16 per cent is a welcome move. Although, this is only half of what we had asked, we are happy with that

  I am not worried (about the impact of budget on stock markets)... Market will stabilise and budget would prove to be a non-event

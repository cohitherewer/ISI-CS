                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Game plan to keep airlines airborne
          R. SURYAMURTHY AMP; JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Murli Deora in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The government may allow the beleaguered airline companies to repay their outstanding jet fuel bills  over Rs 1,600 crore  in a phased manner.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is believed to have intervened in the stand-off between the state-run oil companies and the airlines over the issue of unpaid fuel bills.         
	According to official sources, Singh has spoken to petroleum minister Murli Deora and asked the ministries concerned to resolve the deadlock at the earliest.         
	Deora has called a meeting of the oil companies and the airlines tomorrow. Civil aviation minister Praful Patel will also be present.        
	We are trying to help them...We dont want airlines to shut down operations. The airlines as well as the oil companies are facing a credit crunch and a way has to be found out to ease their liquidity problem, Deora told reporters on the sidelines of a conference here.        
	Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal had met finance minister P. Chidambaram yesterday to get his ministrys help to restructure the terms of arrear payments to the oil companies.        
	While Jet has an outstanding fuel bill of Rs 890 crore, Kingfisher Airlines owes Rs 110 crore. Dues of state-run Air India stand at Rs 600 crore.        
	There have been instances where airlines have defaulted in the payment of bills even after the expiry of the 60-day credit period, Deora said.        
	Finance ministry officials feel the solution lies in recasting the dues whereby the oil companies will receive the payment over a longer period of time.        
	If this compromise plan is accepted, it means a kind of interest free credit line for the airlines, officials said.         
	However, to help the cash-strapped oil firms, the government will seek a time-bound commitment from the airlines on fuel bill payment.        
	Deora, who had held private meetings with Goyal and Kingfisher head Vijay Mallya in the last two days, said the airlines needed to cut costs.         
	They have to tighten their belts and reduce expenditure. One of the solutions could be to share passengers instead of running empty flights, he said.         
	Hit by rising costs and declining passengers, airlines have sought a cut in the central and state taxes on jet fuel.        
	According to the civil aviation ministry, the airline industry had lost about Rs 4,000 crore in 2007-08 and was likely to double its losses to Rs 8,000 crore during the current fiscal.        
	Jet and Kingfisher have also asked for a Rs 5,000-crore soft loan from the finance ministry. Airlines are complaining that banks have virtually stopped lending to them.         
	Officials, however, have ruled out the possibility of such a bailout.              
	The three oil companies also are projected to lose Rs 1,47,592 crore in revenue this fiscal for selling petrol, diesel, domestic LPG cylinder and Kerosene below cost.        
	They have not yet not received oil bonds, which is used to compensate for half of the losses they make on fuel sales, for past three quarters.        
	The combined borrowings of the three, which stood at Rs 48,400 crore in March 2007 and Rs 66,900 crore in March 2008, has increased to Rs 1,10,000 crore in October.

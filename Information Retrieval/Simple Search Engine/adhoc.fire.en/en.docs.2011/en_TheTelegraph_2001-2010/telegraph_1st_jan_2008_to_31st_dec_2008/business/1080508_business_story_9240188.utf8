          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 7: Toshiba Corporation of Japan and the JSW group are joining hands to manufacture and market super-critical steam turbines and generators for thermal power plants in India.        
	The yet-to-be-named joint venture will have an initial capital of $50 million with Toshiba picking up 75 per cent equity. Of the remaining 25 per cent equity that the JSW group will hold, around 5 per cent will be owned by JSW Steel and the remaining 20 per cent by JSW Energy.        
	According to a JSW statement, the two companies are now looking at possible sites for headquarters and manufacturing facilities. Manufacturing is expected to start in September 2009.        
	Toshiba is already present here and, in August last year, won a contract to supply five large super-critical steam turbines and generators to Tata Power.        
	The joint venture is, therefore, expected to enhance Toshibas presence.        
	JSW said the scope of the joint venture included designing, manufacturing, marketing and maintaining medium and large steam turbines and generators, ranging from 500MW to 1,000MW.         
	These turbines will be deployed in thermal power plants.        
	Announcing the joint venture, S. S. Rao, joint managing director and CEO of JSW Energy, said, This alliance will give us an advantage in the Indian energy sector.        
	Atsuhiko Izumi, executive vice-president of Toshibas power systems division, said the investment would give Toshiba a firm foothold in the rapidly growing Indian market.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Slowdown triggers layoffs in textiles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Slowdown triggers layoffs in textiles
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Trim trouble                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Textile mills are laying off workers and curtailing shifts following a decline in demand for their products in the US and Europe.         
	There has been a reduction in demand for textiles, and about 30 per cent of the units in Tirupur have reduced the number of shifts and working days to tide over the crisis, A. Sakthivel, chairman and managing director of Poppys Knitwear Pvt Ltd, said.        
	The firm has reduced the number of shifts from three to one.         
	If the trend continues, Tirupur could see a loss of 5,000 to 6,000 jobs, Sakthivel, who is also the president of the Tirupur Exporters Association, said.        
	The situation in north India is much the same.        
	Sunil Kumar Jain, chairman and managing director of Delhi-based IC Textiles Ltd, said, I have closed my mill and some 1,100 workers have lost jobs. Most of the units in north India are working at just 40 per cent of their capacity. If there is not much help from the government, one lakh jobs may be lost in the next six months.         
	The slowdown in exports has sparked fears of huge layoffs in labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and leather. Exporters are planning to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh later this week to press for relaxations.        
	There is at least a 25 per cent drop in orders for winter apparel from India this year, an official of the Apparel Export Promotion Council said.        
	Exports grew at a meagre 10.4 per cent rate in September compared with 27 per cent in August.

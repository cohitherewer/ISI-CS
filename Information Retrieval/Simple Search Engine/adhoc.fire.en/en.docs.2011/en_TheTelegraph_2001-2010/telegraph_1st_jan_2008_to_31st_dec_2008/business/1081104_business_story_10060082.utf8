          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: Indias exports grew 10.4 per cent in September compared with 26 per cent in August.        
	According to analysts, growth was likely to fall further as the global economic outlook looked grim till the end of this fiscal.        
	Imports jumped 43.3 per cent in September to $24.38 billion, more than one-third of which was accounted for by oil.        
	Exports in the first six months of the current fiscal rose 30.9 per cent to $94.97 billion, while imports climbed 38.5 per cent to $154.74 billion.        
	Trade deficit for April-September widened to $59.77 billion from $39.09 billion in the same period last year.        
	Export growth is likely to fall further from the current level as it is linked to external factors. However, imports, especially of oil, could soften because of the fall in international crude prices, said N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.

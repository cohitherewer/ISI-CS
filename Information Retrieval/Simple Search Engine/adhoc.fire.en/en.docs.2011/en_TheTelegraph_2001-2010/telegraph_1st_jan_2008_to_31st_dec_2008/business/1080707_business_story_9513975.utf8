          SOHINI MOOKHEJREA                       Ramesh: Stringent measure                          
	Mejia (Bankura), July 6: The commerce ministry has asked the Tea Board to issue showcause notices to five companies for failing to comply with quality norms and meet the export target vis-a-vis the Iraqi market.        
	Among the five companies are Balmer Lawrie and .P. Agarwals Ambo Exports, a leading tea export house. India had only recently solved a payment problem with Iraq.        
	I was very distressed to learn about this alarming development in what is the largest export market for Indian tea  Iraq, the Union minister of state for commerce and power, Jairam Ramesh, said here today.        
	On the one hand, I must appreciate the co-operation shown by the Iraqi trade ministry to whom I had personally written to resolve the earlier payment crisis but this act on the part of the Indian exporters need to be dealt with and hence the showcause notice, the minister said during a visit to a plant of the Damodar Valley Corporation at Mejia, which is 200 kilometre from Calcutta. Before the payment crisis started in 2006, India exported 40 million kg to Iraq, which fell drastically to two million kg last year.         
	Ramesh said the resolution of the payment problem should increase export this year to 15-20 million kg.         
	Egypt market        
	The Egyptian market has responded well to the marketing initiatives. Exports are likely to go up to 15 million kg this year from three-four million kg. A tea marketing centre will open in Egypt by the middle of August.         
	Efforts are on to increase exports to Iran, which accounts for five-six million kg annually.         
	However, Ramesh said exports would not significantly increase in quantity, hovering around 180-190 million kg, the same as last year. In 2006, exports stood at 219 million kg.         
	He said the Pakistan market had not taken off as per expectations with India making headway only when the Kenyan market is down.         
	The only way to increase the value of our export is to step up the production of orthodox tea which fetches higher value and is in great demand in the European and the Russian markets, he said.

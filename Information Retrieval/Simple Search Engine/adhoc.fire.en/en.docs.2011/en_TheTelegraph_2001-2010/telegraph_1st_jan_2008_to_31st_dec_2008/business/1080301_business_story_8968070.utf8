                                                                                                               Room for clarity on mortgages
        Guest Column - RENU SUD KARNAD                        
	The Indian economy continues to have strong fundamentals and the emphasis to control inflation will be appreciated by the masses. However, there should have been more focus on infrastructure, as this will boost the GDP growth rate beyond the current 8.7%.        
	Reverse mortgages were announced last year to ensure the security of senior citizens.         
	However, it is estimated that only a small number of loans have been availed so far through reverse mortgages.         
	The reason for low demand for this scheme was because of the lack of clarity on the tax treatment. The amendments proposed in the budget are a welcome move wherein a reverse mortgage will not be regarded as a transfer of a capital asset and therefore not attract capital gains tax.         
	Secondly, the loan amount will be exempt from income tax for the borrower.         
	Unfortunately, no tax benefits have been extended to housing finance lenders as regards reverse mortgages.        
	Some relief has been announced for the salaried class. The re-alignment of the individual income tax slabs will translate into more disposable income in the hands of middle and lower middle classer. Further, the increase in deduction of health insurance premium paid for parents will encourage more people to take medical insurance.         
	Even though there were no changes in corporate tax, the proposed changes to the dividend distribution tax will be hailed favourably by the industry.        
	The focus on education is a step in the right direction if India wants to maintain its economic progress.         
	Particularly impressive was the stress on creating a knowledge society.         
	The proposal to open two new schools for planning and agriculture was needed.         
	Other positives include welfare programmes, especially targeting women, children and the economically weaker sections of the society.         
	Overall, the finance minister did a fine balancing act and presented a fair budget.                    THE AUTHOR IS JOINT MANAGING DIRECTOR OF HDFC

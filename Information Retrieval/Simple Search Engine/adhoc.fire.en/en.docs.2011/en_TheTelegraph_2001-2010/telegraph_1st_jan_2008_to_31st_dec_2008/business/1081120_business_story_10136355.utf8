	New Delhi, Nov. 19: Maruti Suzuki India today launched a hatchback  the A-Star  at an introductory price of Rs 3.47-4.12 lakh.        
	The A-Star, which is the fifth global model from the Maruti stable, is currently being manufactured only in India. The five-door car has a one-litre petrol engine.         
	It will be available in three variants and will compete with Hyundais i10, Santro, and the Chevrolet Spark from General Motors.         
	The company plans to sell 50,000 units of the A- Star in the domestic market and export another one lakh units. The car will be manufactured at Marutis Manesar facility.         
	The A-Star will be sold in roughly 150 countries across Europe, West Asia, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa.         
	Maruti expects the car to contribute to half of its export target of two lakh units by 2010-11.        
	However, Maruti has not decided upon the number of units of the A-Star it will sell to Nissan. Earlier, it had said it would sell about 50,000 units.        
	We have not finalised the export volume for Nissan. No final order has been set. The figures given earlier were only indicative, said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India.                     
	According to the Automotive Research Association of India, the A-Star has a mileage of 19.59 km per litre.         
	Indigenous car        
	The countrys largest car maker plans to roll out its first indigenous car  conceived, designed and developed fully in India  in the next four years.        
	We have started the groundwork for the car, said I.V. Rao, managing executive officer (engineering) of Maruti Suzuki India. Rao, however, declined to comment on whether it would be a small car or a sedan. We are discussing it (the car) internally, said Rao.         
	In October, Marutis sales fell 6.42 per cent to 52,153 units compared with 55,731 units in the same month last year, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.

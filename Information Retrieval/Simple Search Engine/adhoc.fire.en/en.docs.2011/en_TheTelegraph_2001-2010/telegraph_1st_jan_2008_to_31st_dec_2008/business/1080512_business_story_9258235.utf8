	Calcutta, May 11: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) appear to have more faith in the growth prospects of information technology (IT), fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs) and pharmaceutical companies than in infrastructure and telecom companies.        
	An analysis of companies that are part of the sensex shows that FIIs have increased their stakes in IT, FMCG and pharmaceutical companies, while they have, in general, reduced their holdings in other segments.         
	In IT companies, the stake of FIIs in Tata Consultancy Services has gone up to 10.79 per cent at the end of March 2008 from 7.06 per cent in March 31, 2007.         
	They jacked up their holding in Infosys Technologies to 33.36 per cent from 31.82 per cent in June last year, while their stake in Satyam Computer Services went up to 48.22 per cent from 47.22 per cent in the beginning of 2007-08.        
	The IT companies, dependent on exports, were expected to put up poor financial results because of an appreciating rupee against the dollar.         
	There were also apprehensions of their results getting affected by the economic slowdown in the US and Europe.         
	However, the FIIs kept on increasing their exposure in IT companies, while they reduced their holdings in sensex heavyweights such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries, Larsen amp; Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals and ACC.         
	The two FMCG companies in the sensex, Hindustan Unilever and ITC, however, remained favourites with FIIs throughout the year. FII holding in Hindustan Unilever increased steadily from 12.28 per cent to 15.15 per cent during the financial year. In ITC, FIIs increased their stakes to 14.02 per cent from 12.79 per cent.        
	Pharmaceutical was another segment that started finding favour with FIIs from the last two quarters of 2007-08, primarily because the share prices of the pharma companies in the sensex, Cipla and Ranbaxy, were beaten down.         
	Besides these three sectors, FIIs were selective in increasing their stakes in other sensex companies. For example, among cement companies in the sensex, FIIs increased their stakes only in Gujarat Ambuja Cement during the financial year.         
	Among banking and finance companies, FIIs increased their holdings only in the State Bank of India, to 12.82 per cent from 11.9 per cent.         
	HDFC lost the most in terms of FII investment  FIIs reduced their shareholding in the company to 60.62 per cent from 79.28 per cent during 2007-08. HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank also witnessed a large-scale outflow of FII investment. In HDFC Bank, FII investment dropped from 32.27 per cent to 25.89 per cent, while in ICICI Bank it came down to 40.32 per cent from 45.02 per cent.

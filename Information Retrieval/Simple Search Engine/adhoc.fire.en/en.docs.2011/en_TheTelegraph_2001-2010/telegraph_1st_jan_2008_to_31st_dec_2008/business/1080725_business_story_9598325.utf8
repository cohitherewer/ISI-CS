          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The cabinet today approved the merger of the State Bank of Saurashtra (SBS) with its parent, the State Bank of India (SBI).        
	To bring about the merger, the government will first repeal the State Bank of Saurashtra Act, 1950 and then amend the SBI Subsidiary Act, 1959 to remove any reference to the SBS Act in the latter. The new bill, to be introduced in Parliament soon, will be called the SBI Subsidiary Bank Amendment Bill, 2008.         
	Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the merger would enable the SBI to scale up in terms of footprint, manpower and resources.        
	The boards of the SBI and the State Bank of Saurashtra had given their approval to the proposed merger last year. The merger will be the first of its kind among public sector banks.         
	The government has been looking at merging the four unlisted subsidiaries of the SBI  the State Bank of Hyderabad, the State Bank of Indore, the State Bank of Patiala and the State Bank of Saurashtra  with their parent.         
	It wants the listed subsidiaries  the State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur, the State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of Mysore  to remain standalone banks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 18: Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd has decided to double its capacity on the back of an unprecedented rise in the prices of coking coal.        
	The company plans to set up a 1-million-tonne (mt) metallurgical coal plant in Andhra Pradesh for Rs 450 crore.        
	Arun Jagatramka, vice-chairman and managing director of the company, said land for the plant had already been acquired.         
	The plant is expected to be commissioned within two years and will expand the companys capacity to 2.25mt.        
	At present, Gujarat NRE runs a 1mt plant in Gujarat. It is in the process of setting up another 0.25mt plant there. We hope to fund the project through internal generation and a little borrowing, he said.        
	The company is also setting up a waste heat recovery power plant with an aggregate capacity of 60MW at an investment of Rs 300 crore. Jagatramka said coke prices were expected to remain strong in the coming months.         
	Spot coking coal price is now ruling at $400 a tonne compared with an annual contract of $300 a tonne. Spot metcoke price is now hovering at $700 a tonne compared with $250 a year ago.        
	Bonus offer        
	Gujarat NRE has decided to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 2:5, that is two shares for every five shares held by the shareholders.         
	This is the companys sixth bonus issue in the last 10 years.        
	The company today announced a net profit of Rs 94.4 crore for the quarter ended June 30, a more than two-fold rise over the corresponding period last year.        
	The company had a net profit of Rs 42.8 crore in the same period last year.

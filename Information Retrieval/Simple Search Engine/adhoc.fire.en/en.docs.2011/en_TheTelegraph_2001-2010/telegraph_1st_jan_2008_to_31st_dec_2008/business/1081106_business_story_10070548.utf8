                              Hard times                            
	London, Nov. 5 (PTI): Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will axe 400 more jobs because of the current global economic downturn.        
	The company was considering laying off between 300 and 400 jobs by the end of January, JLR spokesperson Mark Foster said.        
	JLR has already curtailed working hours and closed some facilities. It had earlier announced 198 job losses as part of its annual efficiency drive.        
	According to Foster, the situation remains volatile, but the fall in the cost of raw materials is a positive outcome.         
	David Smith, JLR chief executive, said, While regrettable, this is a necessary action to manage our business through a very challenging period.        
	Jamshedpur closure        
	Tata Motors will shut down its Jamshedpur unit, the mother plant for its commercial vehicles, for three days because of a slump in demand.        
	Tata Motors is taking a block closure at Jamshedpur from November 6-8 to match production with demand for vehicles produced at the plant to avoid a build up of inventory, a company spokesperson said.

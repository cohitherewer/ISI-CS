The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel imports to stay high
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel imports to stay high
                              Paswan in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): The country may continue to be a net importer of steel in the current fiscal because of the huge demand-supply mismatch, Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today said.        
	The demand for steel continues to be at around 11.2 per cent, while production growth in the first half of the year has been only 5.2 per cent, Paswan told reporters at the 22nd Steel Consumer Council meeting her today.        
	In the last six months, the countrys steel imports have shot up 50 per cent to about 3 million tonnes compared with the corresponding period last fiscal. In 2007-08, the country imported about 6 million tonnes of steel.        
	Paswan said the demand for steel was expected to reach 109 million tonnes by 2012-13, whereas the government had envisaged a production of 124 million tonnes, excluding the proposed greenfield projects of Posco and ArcelorMittal.        
	We should be able to achieve the production target. SAIL has placed work orders worth Rs 30,000 crore to increase its capacity to 26 million tonnes, he said.        
	While rejecting the idea that the global economic slowdown might affect domestic consumption, he said demand would be strong because of the booming infrastructure sector.        
	As the steel companies plan to expand their production capacities, Paswan said it was essential for them to secure raw material resources, including iron ore and coking coal.         
	He said private and public sector steel firms had proposed to form a consortium along with Coal India to develop the Jharia coal mines and use its coking coal reserves on a sharing basis.         
	The Jharia coalfields, which have valuable coking coal reserves, have been burning for decades as the state government and Coal India failed to douse the fire.

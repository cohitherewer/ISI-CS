          OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          NEW AVENUES                                  
	Mumbai, March 8: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the flagship company of the Mukesh Ambani group, is keen to set up a petrochemical complex in Qatar for production of polymers.        
	According to R.P. Sharma, president (LNG business) of RIL, The company is interested in establishing a world-scale petrochemical complex here with Qatar Petroleum.        
	Sharma, who was attending a gas summit in Qatar, hinted that the petrochemical complex will not only serve markets close by, but also India where the demand for polymer is strong.        
	Earlier, making a presentation on the emerging trends in India and China, Sharma said domestic gas production in the two countries was expected to increase rapidly over the next 15 years.        
	Consumption was expected to grow even faster, making gas imports necessary for both the countries. India plans to import around 22.5 million tonnes to meet its demand in 2011 and 2012.        
	The development of gas transmission and distribution networks in China and India is opening up greater opportunities for gas export to Russia and West Asia, he said.        
	Although RIL has been exporting petroleum products overseas, the company has, over the past few years, been consolidating its international presence.         
	Last year, it acquired a majority stake and management control of Gulf Africa Petroleum Corporation for an undisclosed sum. Gulf Africa Petroleum has retail distribution network in east African countries.

	Calcutta, May 5: Kesoram Industries Ltd, the Basant Kumar Birla groups flagship, is planning to float corporate bonds worth Rs 500 crore to finance its expansion plans in tyre and cement.        
	In a board meet on Saturday, the company had decided to set up two more tyre units in Uttarakhand at an investment of Rs 840 crore.        
	The bond issue will partly finance the tyre projects, which are expected to be commissioned by the end of 2009, to get the tax breaks in the state.        
	We have decided to issue corporate bonds to get a better rate. This is the first time Kesoram is doing so, S. K. Parik, director of the company, said while announcing last years financial results today.        
	While Kesoram would have to pay around 11 per cent interest on loan from banks and institutions, it would pay 10 per cent on bonds for at least three years.        
	The bonds can be subscribed by financial institutions and corporate houses.        
	At present, the company is executing a Rs 550-crore plan to expand the capacity of its cement plant in Karnataka by 1.65 million tonnes.        
	Kesoram is also setting up a 257-tonne-per-day nylon tyre plant involving Rs 750 crore investment in Uttarakhand.        
	This unit is almost ready and the product will roll out by next week.        
	To take advantage of the tax breaks in Uttarakhand, which is available till 2010, it is setting up two more units in the state.        
	A 125-tonne nylon tyre plant will come up at an investment of Rs 345 crore.         
	Another 100-tonne radial truck tyre plant will come up there at an investment of Rs 495 crore.        
	We have the requisite technology for the same. Moreover, Kesoram enjoys a good relation with Pirelli. If required, we can take their help, Parik said.        
	Sales grow        
	Kesorams sales went up by 37 per cent to Rs 3,440.32 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 2,516.46 crore in the previous year. Net profit went up 44 per cent to Rs 383.35 crore in the same period. The companys spun pipe business in Hooghly is now closed.         
	The heavy chemicals or rayon businesses do not make any significant contribution. Cement and tyre makes up almost entire sales of Kesoram.

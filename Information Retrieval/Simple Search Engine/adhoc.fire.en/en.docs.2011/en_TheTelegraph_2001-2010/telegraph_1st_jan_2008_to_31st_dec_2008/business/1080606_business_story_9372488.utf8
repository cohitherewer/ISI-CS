          JAYATI GHOSE                          Modi: Looking forward                                  
	New Delhi, June 5: Spice Communications prefers to take on board a foreign partner to meet its financial needs before venturing into any merger talk with domestic telecom operators.         
	Apart from Etisalat of the UEA and Japans NTT DoCoMo, two US based wireless service providers  AT amp;T and Verizon Communications  have shown interest in acquiring a shareholding in Spice.        
	In the ongoing discussions with various telecom operators, foreign players have emerged as more forthcoming in paying the asking price per share, said sources.         
	The B.K. Modi-promoted telecom firm has demanded Rs 60-65 per share, against the Rs 46 at which the shares were listed last year. The shares are now trading at Rs 53.50 on speculation of a buyout followed by an open offer.        
	The price being asked (by the Modis) is way above the true value osf shares now, said analysts.        
	Reports also suggest that Spice is in talks with Idea Cellular for a possible merger. However, share price valuation has again cropped up as the main roadblock in the discussions, with Idea not willing to go as high as Rs 60 per share, said sources.        
	Last year in June, merger talks between the companies broke down over valuation differences. According to sources, Idea had put the enterprise value of Spice at $700 million and was willing to go up to $1 billion, but Spice wanted the value to be upped to $1.3 billion.         
	Spice Communications chairman B.K. Modi declined to comment on the specifics but added that the company was exploring all options.         
	Spice has recently announced an investment of around Rs 1,200 crore in 2008 to expand operations in the Punjab and Karnataka circles.        
	In the two existing telecom circles  Punjab and Karnataka  we will invest $200-$300 million. As we get start-up spectrum for the additional four circles we have licence for, we will invest more, said Dilip Modi, vice-chairman, Spice Communications.        
	Spice requires further investments to expand its network and diluting its shareholding is the only way of pumping money into the company, which reported Rs 1,200-crore debt at the time of listing last July.

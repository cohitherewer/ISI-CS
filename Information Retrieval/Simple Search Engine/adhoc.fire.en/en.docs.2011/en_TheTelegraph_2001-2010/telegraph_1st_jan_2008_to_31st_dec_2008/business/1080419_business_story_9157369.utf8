          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 18: The 111-year-old Godrej group is looking to revitalise its master brand to cater to the youth and compete with global brands.        
	The master brand will be built around the promise of brighter living and will be an aspirational and contemporary brand to meet the needs of the youthful consumer who is more demanding, said Tanya Dubash, executive director and president (marketing), Godrej Industries.         
	The company will spend Rs 100 crore on the brand building exercise over the next 12 months.        
	Godrej has decided to focus on its four hero businesses that have best potential for growth. These include personal grooming, furniture, properties and appliances.         
	Over the next six to 12 months, the company will introduce new products in all the four categories.        
	Our property business has grown almost 100 per cent in the last two years and we continue to see it growing. We want to list Godrej Properties depending on the market conditions. We need to raise public funding for its expansion, said group chairman Adi Godrej.        
	The company had earlier indicated that it wanted to raise Rs 600 crore from the market by diluting a 10 per cent stake in Godrej Properties.         
	Since the property business has grown explosively, we plan to tie up our furniture and appliances business along with it, said Dubash.         
	Godrej is also looking to triple revenues from the FMCG business in the next four years. It hopes to attain revenues of Rs 8,000 crore by 2012.        
	The FMCG businesses, which comprise Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), Godrej Sara Lee and Godrej Hersheys, grossed Rs 2,300 crore in 2007-2008.        
	To power its FMCG business, the company is looking at inorganic growth in the developing markets of South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and China.        
	In the last four years, GCPL has acquired four companies, the latest being Kinky, a hair brand from South Africa for $33 million.        
	At present 25 per cent of GCPLs revenue comes from its international business.               
	It is hoping to raise that level to 50 per cent in the next three years, primarily through acquisitions.

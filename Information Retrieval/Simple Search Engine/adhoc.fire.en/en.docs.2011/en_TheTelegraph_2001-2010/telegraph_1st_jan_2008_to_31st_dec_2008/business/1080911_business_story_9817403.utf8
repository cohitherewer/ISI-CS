          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Core infrastructure of the country grew at a sluggish pace of 3.7 per cent in the first four months of the current fiscal (April-July) against 6.6 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	In July, the six core infrastructure industries, with a combined weight of 26.7 per cent in the index of industrial production, grew 4.3 per cent against 7.2 per cent last year, according to official data released today.        
	The six core industries are: crude oil, electricity, petroleum refinery products, coal, finished steel and cement.        
	The industrial growth is in a downward cycle and has not bottomed out yet, N. R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said .        
	The main reasons for the slide are a slowdown in the global economy and a decline in domestic demand because of high inflation, he said.        
	D. K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil, said the slowdown in economic growth was a matter of concern. We expect core growth to be around this level for the next three quarters.        
	He said there were expectations of the Reserve Bank of India hiking the repo rate by 25 basis points in October.         
	Bhanumurthy, however, said any further rise in interest rates would hurt growth.

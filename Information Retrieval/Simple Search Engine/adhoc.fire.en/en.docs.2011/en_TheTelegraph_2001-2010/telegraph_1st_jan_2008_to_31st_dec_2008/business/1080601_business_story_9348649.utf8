The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sterlite to buy Asarco assets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sterlite to buy Asarco assets
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Agarwal: Upbeat                                  
	Mumbai, May 31: Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd will acquire the operating assets of Asarco LLC, a Tucson-based mining, smelting and refining company, for $ 2.6 billion.        
	Asarco, formerly known as American Smelting and Refining Company, is the third largest copper producer in the US. It produced 235,000 tonnes of refined copper in 2007. Asarcos mines have estimated reserves of 5 million tonnes of copper.         
	For the year ended December 31, 2007, Asarcos total revenues stood at $1.9 billion.        
	Sterlite, the subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc, said the asset acquisition would be financed through a mix of debt and cash.        
	The metals major stated that the integrated assets to be acquired included three open-pit copper mines and a copper smelter in Arizona and a copper refinery, rod and cake plant and precious metals plant in Texas.         
	The asset acquisition is on a cash-free and debt-free basis. Sterlite will assume operating liabilities but not legacy liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims for ceased operations.        
	Asarco had filed for bankruptcy and it faces environment-related liabilities.         
	However, Sterlite would not be subject to these liabilities, sources said, adding that the company was only buying its assets.        
	We are delighted to have reached an agreement on this important acquisition, which is a significant milestone for our group. This is in line with our stated strategy of leveraging our established skills, Anil Agarwal, chairman of Sterlite, said.        
	Justifying the acquisition, Sterlite said Asarco was a logical and strategic fit with its existing copper business and was expected to create significant long-term value for the stakeholders by leveraging its operational and project skills to develop and optimise Asarcos mines and plants.        
	Sterlite will have access to long-lasting mining assets and it will enable geographic diversification in the North American market.        
	Sterlite was pitted against other bidders who submitted offers in late April and the selection of the highest and best bid occurred on May 23.        
	The selection process followed a procedure supported by Asarcos creditors and approved by the US Bankruptcy Court. An independent court-appointed examiner closely observed the bidding process.        
	Earlier this year, Agarwal had said the group would enhance existing capacities across various non-ferrous metals that include copper, aluminium and zinc to one million tonnes annually.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Life insurers find the going tough
                                                                                                               Life insurers find the going tough
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 13: The life insurance industry has entered the slow lane this fiscal. The state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and 16 private sector players underwrote Rs 53,576.72 crore new business during the first nine months ended December 2007, a growth of only 9.61 per cent over the same period a year ago.         
	During April-December 2006, the life insurers underwrote new business worth Rs 48,878.81 crore, which was 145.70 per cent more than their total first-year premium income (Rs 19,893.39 crore) in the first three quarters of 2005-06.        
	The slowdown came on the back of a decline in the LICs premium income from new policy sales. The LICs first-year premium income up to December was Rs 34,595.59 crore, a 9.56 per cent decline from Rs 38,253.79 crore in the previous corresponding period.        
	Private sector players did not fare as well as they did in the previous two financial years. First-year premium incomes of private sector insurers stood at Rs 18,981.13 crore in the April-December period in the current financial year, up 78.64 per cent from Rs 10,625.02 crore in the same period a year ago.         
	The rate of business growth for private sector players in the first nine months this fiscal at 90 per cent was also significantly lower than 2006-07 (95.88 per cent) and 2005-06 (91.16 per cent). Private sector insurers argue that slow growth was the effect of a higher business base.         
	In fact, life insurers recorded a hefty increase in first-year premium income from sales of single-premium policies to individuals in 2006-07.         
	Apart from Reliance Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Max New York Life, others witnessed a decline or stagnation in single-premium policy sales during the current financial year.         
	Premium incomes of private insurers from individual single-premium policies were Rs 395.13 crore during the April-December period in 2004-05. It shot up to Rs 1,106.16 crore (179.95 per cent) in 2005-06 and Rs 1,735.87 crore (56.93 per cent) in 2006-07. Till December 2007, premium incomes of the private sector insurers from individual single-premium plans were Rs 2156.97 crore, or growth of 24.26 per cent over 2006-07.        
	Individual policy buyers lapped up single-premium unit-linked plans as these offered a income tax deduction under Section 80C as well as a tax-free return on the sale of investment in units. But since 2006, when the insurance regulator slapped a three-year lock-in on investment in Ulips and stipulated that the minimum sum assured in a single-premium policy should be 125 per cent of the premium, many policyholders discovered that they could not claim the income tax deduction under Section 80C.         
	Under Subsection 3 of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, a deduction is available up to a premium amount, which is not in excess of 20 per cent of the sum assured.         
	Suppose one has bought a single-premium policy by paying Rs 1 lakh.

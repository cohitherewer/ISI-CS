	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today described Indias economic growth rate of 7.8 per cent during the first half of 2008-09 as healthy and satisfactory.        
	He said the government was planning to boost output and address the bottlenecks in the economy.        
	Manufacturing growth, the minister said, has slowed down. The government is taking a sector-specific approach. In the next few days, we will be able to address their problems, he said.

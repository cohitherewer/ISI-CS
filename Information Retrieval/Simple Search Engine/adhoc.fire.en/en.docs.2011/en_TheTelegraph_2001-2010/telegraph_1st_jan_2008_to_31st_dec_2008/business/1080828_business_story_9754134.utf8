The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre eyes mega investment hubs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Centre eyes mega investment hubs

	New Delhi, Aug. 27: Undaunted by the controversies that have enmeshed special economic zones (SEZs), car projects and chemical hubs, the Centre is working on proposals to establish mega manufacturing investment regions and textile enclaves modelled on those in China.        
	While the department of industrial policy is lobbying for giant manufacturing regions, the textile ministry wants the government to approve a policy to create textile investment regions.        
	A group of non-resident Indian CEOs had floated the concept of creating investment regions soon after the UPA government came to power, but the idea was cropped and moulded into a policy to establish a string of petrochemicals and chemical investment regions  or chemical hubs  in coastal states. This policy was embroiled in controversy after farmers battled a bid to take over land near Haldia in Bengal for the proposed chemical hub.         
	Another policy seeking to establish a series of special economic zones that came loaded with tax breaks and the promise of labour law relaxations also came under fire for creating tax havens to the detriment of other investors.         
	The new proposals for investment regions  which would be larger than the SEZs and in line with the size of the chemical hubs  are not laden with tax breaks and generous labour laws.        
	The idea is to create hubs that will house manufacturers who can feed off each other, share facilities and trim costs.         
	These investment regions, modelled on the lines of the Chinese concept of economic regions, will have full global connectivity in terms of international airports, sea and land ports, networked cities and high-speed data access, claim officials who support the concept.         
	However, the Planning Commission is less enthusiastic about the plan and has reservations about its ability to spur investment.        
	On the other hand, the proponents argue that the investments regions can spur development in the states that host them. There can be single window approval for companies in the investment region.        
	In 2004, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had invited Victor Menezes, former CEO of Citibank and currently vice-chairman of Citigroup, Indra Nooyi, currently CEO of Pepsi, and multi-billionaire venture capital czar Vinod Khosla to suggest ways to ramp up foreign direct investment (FDI). It was this group that first floated the concept of large investment regions.        
	Infrastructure development in building world class townships, roads, malls, expressways and airports would make these areas attractive to investors, just as development of southern China has made the economic region the most sought after investment destination in the world.         
	Officials say that the investment regions in China helped create jobs for about some 9.8 million people in 2004 and re-employed 5.1 million workers who had been laid off earlier, reducing the unemployment rate to 4.2 per cent in urban areas.

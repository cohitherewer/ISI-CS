The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Microsoft ultimatum to Yahoo
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Microsoft ultimatum to Yahoo
                            
	Seattle/San Francisco, April 6 (Reuters): Yahoo has three weeks to accept Microsofts $31-a-share cash-and-stock offer or Microsoft may lower its bid and take its offer to Yahoo investors, Microsoft said.        
	Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said in a letter dated April 5 and addressed to Yahoos board of directors that now is the time to negotiate final terms of a deal, which valued at more than $40 billion, would mark the biggest takeover in the infotech industry.        
	If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks, we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders, including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors, Ballmer wrote.        
	Then he threatened to reduce Microsofts offer if Yahoo failed to meet the deadline: That action will have an undesirable impact on the value of your company from our perspective which will be reflected in the terms of our proposal.

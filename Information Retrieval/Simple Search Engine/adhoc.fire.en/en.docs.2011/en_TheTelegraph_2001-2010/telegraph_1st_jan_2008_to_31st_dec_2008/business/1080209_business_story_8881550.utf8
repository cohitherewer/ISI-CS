The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bids drop, Emaar calls off issue
                                                                                                            Bids drop, Emaar calls off issue
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 8: The IPO market cratered today with Emaar MGF forced to call off its issue after investors scrambled to withdraw their bids, sending subscriptions tumbling from over 84 per cent to a piffling 39.67 per cent.        
	The ignominious end to the realty firms much-trumpeted issue came just a day after Wockhardt Hospitals scrapped its public issue.        
	The company decided to take this step as a result of the prevailing adverse market sentiment, fuelled by renewed indications of a US recession and a global meltdown. We have decided to postpone the issue despite receiving applications worth Rs 5,779.36 crore in the light of discouraging market dynamics, a company statement read.        
	Emaar MGF, which had extended its public issue till Monday, saw little point in keeping it open after the large-scale withdrawal of bids by institutions and other investors. The company had been planning to raise about Rs 6,000 crore through its offer of 10.25 crore shares to the public.        
	At the end of the day, Emaar MGF received 1.3 crore bids at the cut-off price. The issue was subscribed 0.9923 times by qualified institutional buyers, largely foreign institutional investors, almost 0.9811 times by non-institutional investors comprising high net worth individuals and companies, and about 0.4693 times by retail investors.        
	The capitulation was sudden and surprising after the brave talk by the bookrunnners to the issue who had said just two days ago that they would easily raise the money.        
	It also raised a lot of questions about the prospects of the primary market. At the start of the year, Prime Database had projected that companies would raise about Rs 75,000 crore this year  almost 66 per cent more than the 45,176 crore that issuers raised in 2007.        
	Experts seemed to think that the Wockardt and Emaar MGF issues failed because they were overpriced.        
	Investors will definitely put their money in IPOs as long as they are reasonably priced. Pricing was the main reason why some of the recent IPOs were withdrawn. Forthcoming issues should not face any such problem as they do not look overvalued, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking.        
	The crash in the secondary markets in the middle of last month had sent many investors scurrying out of stocks and created uncertainty about the gains that the new issues would yield on listing.        
	Given the prevailing sentiments in the markets, it was unclear how well the stock would trade post listing; it has been considered wiser to revisit the markets only when the demand and sentiment is stable and better providing greater value to the investor, Emaar MGF said.

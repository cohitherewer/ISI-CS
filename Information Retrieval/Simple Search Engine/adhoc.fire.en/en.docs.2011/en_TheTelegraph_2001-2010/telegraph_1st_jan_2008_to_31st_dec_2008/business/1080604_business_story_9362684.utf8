          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhave in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 3: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will permit exchange-traded currency futures in three months to enable investors manage volatility in the currency markets.        
	Sebi will next work on interest rate futures and the creation of an exchange for small and medium enterprises, chairman C.B. Bhave said at the annual general meeting of Assocham here.        
	Today, regulators have to see that our markets are as complete as it could be. In the next three months, you will see the start of exchange-traded currency futures in this country, he said.        
	On whether the Indian markets are prepared for currency futures, Bhave said, I think our market is ready for it. He said currency futures had already been allowed in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.        
	It is not that we are not exposed to it at all. The attempt of Sebi and the Reserve Bank is to create exchange-traded currency futures as they are far easier to be regulated and far easier to contain risks than the OTC market, he added.        
	According to an RBI-Sebi panels report on currency futures, exchange-traded futures compared with OTC forwards serve the same economic purpose, yet differ in fundamental ways. The panel had suggested the introduction of currency futures markets, initially for a dollar-rupee contract.        
	PN curbs        
	Sebi today ruled out relaxing curbs imposed last year on participatory notes (PN), a derivative tool that enables unregistered foreign investors to invest in the Indian stock markets.        
	No. Sebi has already notified the regulations which arose out of October decisions, Bhave told reporters when asked if there was any proposal to amend the regulations on PNs.        
	In October 2007, Sebi had imposed restrictions on foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to issue participatory notes.        
	FIIs and their sub-accounts were asked not to issue fresh PNs against underlying derivatives and wind up their existing position in 18 months during which the market regulator will review the situation from time to time.        
	Various curbs were also imposed on their exposure to these instruments in the cash segment. The decision was taken after a prolonged discussion among the finance ministry, the RBI and Sebi.        
	In August last year, there were 34 FIIs/sub-accounts issuing offshore derivative instruments and the notional value of PNs outstanding stood at Rs 3,53,484 crore.

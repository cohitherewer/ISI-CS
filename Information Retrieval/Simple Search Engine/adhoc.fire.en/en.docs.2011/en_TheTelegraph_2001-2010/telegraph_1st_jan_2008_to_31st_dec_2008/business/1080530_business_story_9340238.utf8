          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 29: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries today threatened legal action against Israels Taro Pharmaceuticals, which yesterday unilaterally terminated the $454-million merger deal with the Indian firm.        
	Rebuffing some of the allegations made by the Israeli firm, Sun Pharma chairman Dilip Shanghvi has written a letter to Taro managing director Barrie Levitt where he questioned the Israeli firms move to terminate the merger.        
	Sun Pharma holds around 34.4 per cent in Taro and, sources say, the company has no plans to sell its stake in the Israeli firm.        
	In his letter Shanghvi said, According to the agreement, Taro is not entitled to terminate the merger. We remain sceptical about Taros turnaround.        
	Taro had only $47 million in cash as of March 31, 2008. This meant, without Suns cash injection of approximately $60 million last year, Taro would have run out of cash, he said.        
	While Sun Pharma made every effort to fulfil its obligations under the merger agreement, Shanghvi said, Taro had failed to honour the deal.

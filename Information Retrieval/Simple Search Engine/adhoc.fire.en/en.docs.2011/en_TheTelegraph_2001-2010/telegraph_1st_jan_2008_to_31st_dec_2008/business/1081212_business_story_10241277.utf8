          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 11: Anil Ambani is likely to get a foreign partner for Reliance Communications (R-Com)  and he has found a way to work around the tripwire posed by the right of first refusal (RoFR) in the non-compete agreement with brother Mukesh.        
	The foreign company  many speculate it could be either AT amp;T or Telecom Italia  will hold close to 26 per cent in the company. The partner will buy just short of 15 per cent from the open market. R-Com will then make a preferential issue of fresh shares, amounting to roughly another 11 per cent, to the potential partner.        
	Back in August, Reliance Industries had used the RoFR to scuttle Anil Ambanis attempts to forge a deal with MTN of South Africa and create a giant telecom player.        
	The RoFR wont kick in this time because it is triggered only if there is a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the holding along with control.        
	Anil Ambani and his close associates hold over 66 per cent in the company. Domestic financial institutions hold 12 per cent, while foreign institutional investors have about 9 per cent. The rest is held by the public.        
	A spokesperson for the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group refused to confirm the mounting speculation about such a deal.         
	However, R-Com told the bourses that it had been receiving several proposals from international companies that had expressed interest in picking up a stake in the company. R-Com said it evaluated all such proposals in line with its policy to constantly endeavour to enhance overall shareholder value in the best interests of over 2 million shareholders, the notice said.        
	An RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the latest development.

	Mumbai, April 15: Tyre manufacturer Ceat will shed jobs at its Bhandup plant in Mumbai by 25 per cent to rein in costs.        
	The company is also relocating the plant to Ambernath and will offer VRS to employees over the age of 56 before the relocation.        
	The Bhandup plant has 2,000 employees. Ceat has stopped hiring at the plant in the last two years.         
	About 175 employees retire every year at the plant.        
	We can save costs by relocating to Ambernath. The company will save an annual octroi duty of Rs 17 crore it has to pay at Bhandup. The costs of operating the plant here are also higher. The company will also unlock value by selling the 23 acres of Bhandup land. The money will be invested in funding our expansion plans, said Paras Chowdhary, managing director of Ceat.         
	Ceat has already sold seven acres of surplus land in Bhandup for Rs 130 crore.         
	The companys topline touched Rs 2,600 crore in the year ended March 2008. However, officials said its margins would come under pressure because of an increase in the prices of rubber and petroleum base products. The company will hike prices by 5 per cent because of the rise in raw material costs.        
	Ceat will invest around Rs 340 crore in the relocated plant at Ambernath and is planning to set up another greenfield plant in Gujarat for radial technology tyres at an investment of Rs 560 crore.        
	The two plants will provide an additional capacity of 200 tonnes per day.         
	Ceat is in talks with an international partner for a technology tieup for radials and will make an announcement in a few months.        
	At present, only 6 per cent of our revenue comes from radials. However, we feel this technology is going to dictate the future of the Indian tyre market, said Chowdhary.        
	The company also unveiled a contemporary logo today.        
	During our survey, some people said the Rhino (our logo) was a sloth creature and others felt it was almost extinct. After several months of introspection, we decided to build a contemporary brand and the new logo is designed for the aspirational next generation market, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of the RPG group.        
	Ceats investment arm CHI Investments will be listed next week, Chowdhary added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Union for Ford stake in Jaguar post sale
                                                                                                            Union for Ford stake in Jaguar post sale
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: The workers union of both the Jaguar and Land Rover has sought detailed discussions with Tata Motors and Ford Motor over crucial issues relating to the buyout of the marques by the Indian car maker.        
	We have made it clear that Ford should retain a stake in the company even after the sale. This will effectively tie Ford and Tata Motors into a long-term contract, mainly in terms of supply of engines and gear boxes, said Andrew Dodgshon, spokesperson for Unite, Britains largest car union, which also represents Jaguar and Land Rover.         
	Although the union is insisting on Ford retaining a stake, it hasnt specified a number.        
	The employee union is ensuring that it remains involved in the discussions between Tata Motors and Ford.        
	This is the most important decision being made in the UK car industry and we want to make sure that we will be involved in the discussions that will unfold over the next two to three months. We also want the government to remain informed about day-to-day events, said Dodgshon.         
	After months of silence, Ford announced yesterday that it would start detailed discussions with Tata Motors for the sale of its marquee brands.        
	The union had said yesterday that job security and maintenance of plant were the key issues. It said it wanted no change in the terms and conditions relating to the pension fund as well as wages after the highest bidder takes over.         
	Rating move        
	Global credit rating agency Moodys today said that it has placed Tata Motors on review for possible downgrade following Ford naming the firm as the preferred buyer for Jaguar and Land Rover.

	Mumbai, Jan. 17: OnMobile will be the first incubated baby of software giant Infosys to hit the capital market.
    
	OnMobile, a telecommunications value-added software products and services company, plans to raise close to Rs 490 crore through an initial public offering.
    
	The company is offering 1.09 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each through a book building process in the price band of Rs 425 to Rs 450 per share.
    
	It intends to use the funds to expand its research and development team, foray into international markets and finance its merger and acquisition plans. 
    
	The company provides software and value-added services to the telecom industry. Infosys has an indirect stake of about 8 per cent in the company.
    
	The company was started within the Infosys campus in 2000 with an initial investment by Infosys of close to $2 million. 
    
	We work on a revenue-sharing model with our clients. Our clients are all the major telecom operators in the country. Unlike others in this segment, we are not just a products company, we are a products and services company, said Mouli Raman, co-founder and CTO of OnMobile.

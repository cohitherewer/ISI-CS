The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti-MTN talks get stuck
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bharti-MTN talks get stuck
                            
	New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Talks between Bharti and MTN on a possible merger remained inconclusive today as the latter is believed to have asked for a $500-million break-up fee for agreeing to an exclusivity pact with Bharti.        
	Bharti has offered $200 million, investment banking sources said. The Indian company wants the exclusivity contract with MTN first as it will make it binding on the latter not to talk to any other competing bidder until negotiations are concluded.        
	MTN is not in favour of signing the contract as it feels the exclusivity pact is anti-shareholder. The break-up fee is a surety amount in case the deal does not take place after signing the exclusivity pact.         
	Investment bankers said Bharti had got commitment of up to $12 million debt from bankers and it might have to raise more funds as the MTN firm was seeking a $50-billion valuation.         
	The Sunil Bharti Mittal-promoted company is looking at a $45-billion deal for MTN.        
	US banks may not be able to provide credit for this deal as MTN has operations in countries such as Sudan, Ivory Coast and Syria, which, according to the US office of foreign assets control list, are nations with terrorist bases.

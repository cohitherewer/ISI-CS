	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The survey today decried the loss of dynamism in agriculture, where it projected a slower 2.6 per cent growth this fiscal. Any deceleration in the growth of agriculture is translated into a lower overall GDP growth, the survey, which was tabled in Parliament, stated.        
	Commenting on the farm sector, the survey said the rule of law, assured irrigation, knowledge on technologies, farming practices and marketing, and all-weather road connectivity might be lacking, particularly in the poor backward regions.        
	In view of the uncertainties in global markets and hardening global prices of food, fuel and edible oils, it said domestic price stability and food security critically depended on growth in agriculture.        
	The survey said there was need for a second green revolution, mainly in rain-fed areas, to improve the income of farmers.        
	The survey voiced concern over lower farm growth vis-a-vis non-agricultural sectors.

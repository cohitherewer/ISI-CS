	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Inflation remained unchanged at 12.14 per cent for the week ended September 13, with the countrys chief statistician Pronab Sen saying it will rule at the double-digit level till January before cooling off.        
	Analysts said the RBI might ease its tight monetary policy in the backdrop of a changed global situation. The RBI has raised the overnight lending rate to 9 per cent, forcing banks to increase their prime lending rates to 14 per cent.         
	Inflation was 3.51 per cent during the corresponding week of the previous year.        
	Power and fuel prices did not change, and non-food prices fell. Food prices moved up slightly.

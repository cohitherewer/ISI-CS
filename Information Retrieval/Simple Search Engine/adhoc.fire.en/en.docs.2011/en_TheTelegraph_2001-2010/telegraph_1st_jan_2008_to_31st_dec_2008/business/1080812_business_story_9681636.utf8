          OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                          Khatua: Freedom call                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 11: Commodities market regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) today said the government might lift the ban on futures trading in four commodities next month.        
	In May, the government, under pressure from its allies to control soaring inflation, had suspended the futures trading in soyaoil, potato, rubber and chickpea for four months.        
	It has already been established that there is no link between futures trade and price rise. The ban on the four commodities is likely to be lifted in September, FMC chairman B.C. Khatua told reporters on the sidelines of a conference to launch futures trading in coriander by the National Commodity amp; Derivatives Exchange Ltd here.        
	I do hope that it will lapse. The order for suspension itself mentions the clause of suspension (that it would be lifted by September). I would like to believe that nothing has changed in the market to allow the extension of the ban, he said.        
	Licence curbs        
	The FMC today directed the commodity exchanges not give multiple trading licences to a single client from January 2009.         
	Analysts said the objective of this move was to prevent the rigging of commodity prices in the futures market.        
	The national exchanges were directed on July 23 to ensure that multiple client codes are not given to a single client, a commission statement said. A separate suffix may be provided after the unique client code to represent different characteristics and branches of the client. The rules will come into force from January 2009.         
	Money laundering        
	The FMC has sought government approval to include commodity brokers under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Khatua said.        
	Passed in 2002, the act included stock brokers but not commodity brokers as commodity trading was very small at that time.

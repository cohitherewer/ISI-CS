	Remember the famous soundtrack from Who Wants to be a Millionaire by Billy Ocean? When the going gets tough, the tough get going Well, the going has really got tough in the world of investment with prices of all asset classes crumbling and investors scampering for safe haven options. No one dares to dream to be a millionaire very soon.         
	Stock prices have tumbled by more than 55 per cent. Gold and real estate prices are also falling as the threat of a global economic recession intensifies. Governments are easing their monetary policies through interest rate cuts to bolster consumer demand. Inflation rates are coming down and the falling commodity prices have paved the way for further cuts in interest rates and increased demand for goods and services.         
	Investor choice        
	In such a situation, investments in bank fixed deposits and bond/debt schemes of mutual funds find favour with investors who are scared of losing their principal.         
	Bonds and other fixed income instruments provide an element of stability that offsets the volatility of equities to a certain extent. However, they too are susceptible to economic change. Bond and other debt instrument prices fluctuate with the changes in the interest, inflation and currency exchange rates.         
	This means return on your investment in bond/debt instruments will depend on the maturity of the underlying bond/debt papers. Short-term debt papers are less affected by the changes in interest or inflation rates than those with long-term maturity. Hence, short-term debt papers offer lower returns but are less volatile in terms of prices.         
	Long-term debt instruments can generate a higher capital appreciation when inflation and interest rates are going down.         
	However, if you plan to hold a debt instrument till maturity, there is no question of capital appreciation or depreciation.         
	In such an investment, you will get only the interest rate payable on the debt paper. You stand to make a capital gain or loss only if you sell the investment before maturity of the underlying debt instrument.         
	The right move        
	Before investing in a debt scheme of a mutual fund, lets see how the return on a bond works.         
	To understand this, one has to look into the yield of a bond which is the return that an investor will get annually if the instrument is held till maturity. The yield is a complex function of the price of a bond, the interest it fetches and the existing rate of inflation.         
	As inflation rate dips, the real interest rate payable on the bond/debt instrument rises. This in turn increases the demand for bonds and nudges up prices of these papers. A higher price of bonds lowers the yield on these instruments.         
	Lets illustrate this with the help of an example. After the inflation rate came down to single digit last Thursday, the yield on a 10-year government security (due on April 2018) at an interest rate of 8.24 per cent fell to 7.48 per cent as the price of the debt paper (face value is Rs 100) rose 86 paise to Rs 105.10. On the other hand, the yield on the 3-year government security bearing an 8 per cent coupon rate and maturing in April 2011 stood at 7.27 per cent.         
	For the medium term, the Reserve Bank of India has set an inflation target of 5 per cent, while in the long run it sees the rate coming down to 3.5 per cent.         
	So, if you invest in a 3-year bond now, your money will fetch a paltry 2.27 per cent (7.27 per cent minus 5 per cent) return over and above the inflation rate.         
	On the other hand, if you lock your money for 10 years in a debt instrument, youll get a 4 per cent (7.48 per cent minus 3.5 per cent) inflation-adjusted return.         
	From this example, its clear that bonds with longer maturity promises better return than short-term debt instruments.         
	The bedrock of the whole argument is that bonds are tradable instruments whose prices and yields fluctuate.         
	Allocation logic        
	While picking a debt scheme of a mutual fund, one must, therefore, look at the yield and go for those plans whose underlying bond instruments have a long-term maturity.         
	Any investment in debt funds should be for two to three years because the general belief is equity is still the king in the long run.         
	The investment should be made in long-term, open-ended debt funds rather than in medium-term, close-ended schemes.         
	This is because the scope of capital appreciation when interest and inflation rates are falling is limited in close-ended, fixed maturity plans.         
	For long-term investment goals, one should invest in equities. Shares of the bluest of blue chip companies are now available at throwaway prices. Many of these shares are now trading at a very low price premium.         
	As an investor, you should regularly monitor whether there is any imbalance in the asset allocation ratio following any increase or decline in asset prices.         
	If there is any, you should restore the balance by shifting investments from one asset to the other.                                       
	Returns watch        
	Equities have historically given a compounded annual return of 17.61 per cent in the last 28 years. This takes into account the bear markets between 2000 and 2003 when equities yielded zero returns. Even if we consider the period between 2000 and now, the sensex has given a compounded annual return of 7.61 per cent.         
	However, between 2000 and 2003, debt investments gave far superior returns, even 30 per cent in some cases, on the back of falling interest and inflation rates. But from 2004 onwards, with economic activities picking up pace and inflation and interest rates hardening, returns from debt funds dropped sharply.         
	It is clear that any investment in debt funds now should be made for two to three years. The investment should be made in long-term, open-ended debt funds rather than in medium-term, close-ended schemes. This is because the scope of capital appreciation during falling interest and inflation rates is limited in close-ended, fixed maturity plans.        
	For long-term investment goals, one should invest in equities. Shares of the bluest of blue chip companies are now available at throwaway prices. Many of these shares are now trading at a very low price premium.         
	As an investor, you should regularly monitor whether there is any imbalance in the asset allocation ratio following any increase or decline in asset prices. If there is any, you should restore the balance by shifting investments from one asset to the other.                                   
	Equity allocation        
	Even the net asset values (NAVs) of some good equity mutual funds have come down significantly. Thus your equity investments at current levels have the potential for hefty capital appreciation when these companies return to their historic PE levels. PE or the price-earning ratio measures the premium investors are willing to pay for per share profitability of Re 1 of a company.         
	There is a thumb rule on how much one should allocate to equities and how much in debt. If you are 40-years-old, you should allocate 60 per cent (100-40) of your total investments in equities and the rest in debt instruments. As you grow older, your allocation in equities comes down and the debt component goes up.

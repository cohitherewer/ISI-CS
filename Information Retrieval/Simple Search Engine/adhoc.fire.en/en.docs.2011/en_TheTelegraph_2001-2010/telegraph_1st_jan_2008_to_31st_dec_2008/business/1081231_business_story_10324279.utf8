	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The governments second stimulus package may have a combination of tax sops and interest subsidies to select industries such as textiles, engineering, steel and automobiles along with interest rate cuts by the RBI and a protective wall against cheap Chinese imports.         
	It has asked several industries to specifically explain their complaints about goods being dumped.         
	An inter-ministerial committee will decide on imposing higher import taxes or countervailing duties in such cases.        
	Officials said the government would order the state-run banks to lend to certain specific industries which are either crucial to growth or ailing such as infrastructure, textiles, engineering and auto ancillaries.         
	For the labour-intensive textile industry, the government is considering an increase in the interest subsidy to 4 per cent from 2 per cent.         
	It is likely to give mill owners working capital loan for cotton purchase at 7 per cent instead of the current rate of around 12 to 13 per cent.        
	The steel ministry has sought an increase in import duties and a countervailing duty on construction steel.        
	In automobiles, the government could provide for the refinancing of vehicle loans at a relief rate of 7-9 per cent, relax the norms for commercial vehicle loans and ease the regulations on asset financing NBFCs to enhance their access to long-term funds.         
	The government could reimpose the countervailing duty on cement and steel and impose a safeguard duty on chemical products from China, Taiwan, Korea and Israel.        
	However, most of these measures will not make much headway unless interest rates come down to more realistic levels.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and RBI governor D. Subbarao have already held several rounds of talks on monetary issues. Officials in the finance ministry say the central bank may cut the repo rate  the interest rate for short-term loans to banks  by around 1 per cent.        
	Deficit woes        
	The stimulus packages are expected to push up the budget deficit. But the Manmohan Singh government, which desperately wants to give a boost to the economy before it goes to the polls, is not averse to giving fiscal prudence a miss, at least for this year.

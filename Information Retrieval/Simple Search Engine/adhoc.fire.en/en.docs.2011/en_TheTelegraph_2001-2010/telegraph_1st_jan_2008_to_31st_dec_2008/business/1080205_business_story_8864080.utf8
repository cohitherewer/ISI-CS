     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: Mobile phone users are spoilt for choice, with a slew of low-cost schemes on offer. 
    
	The latest to join the fray is Reliance Communications (R-Com) with its lifetime validity scheme of Rs 199 for pre-paid customers. 
    
	Under the new service, pre-paid subscribers will be able to make a call at 99 paise per minute. 
    
	We received a good response when we reduced the outgoing call charge to 99 paise per minute in our previous pre-paid scheme. Earlier, the pre-paid segment had a complex tariff structure. Hence, efforts are on to rationalise the tariffs, said Nilanjan Mukherjee, chief marketing officer of R-Com.
    
	Both GSM and CDMA mobile service providers are bringing down charges to woo pre-paid customers who account for the bulk of the subscriber base.
    
	Pre-paid customers constitute 75 per cent of R-Coms subscriber base, while for Bharti Airtel, it is as high as 91 per cent. 
    
	Airtel and Vodafone have both slashed the charges for outgoing calls to Re 1 in the pre-paid segment. 
    
	Such tariff cuts are also necessary to retain subscribers in the pre-paid segment where the churn rate is very high. 
    
	Bharti, for instance, has a churn rate of 3.9 per cent in the pre-paid segment compared with 0.9 per cent for post-paid subscribers. 
    
	This is because customers do not avail themselves of the lifetime validity scheme to make outgoing calls because of the higher tariffs. 
    
	We hope to have more than half of our customers under the lifetime fold, said S.P. Shukla, president (wireless) of R-Com. 
    
	The offer will also help the company to increase its topline. 
    
	The offer will not have any link with handsets and subscribers can use any handset to enjoy the offer, Shukla added.

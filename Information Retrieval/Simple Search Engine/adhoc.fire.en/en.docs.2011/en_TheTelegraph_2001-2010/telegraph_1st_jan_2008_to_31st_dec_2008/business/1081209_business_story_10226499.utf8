                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet, travel agents bury hatchet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Meeting point                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Jet Airways has agreed to pay travel agents a commission of 3 per cent on the gross price of a ticket, both for domestic and international routes. Gross price comprises of basic fare and fuel surcharge.        
	After a month-long tiff with the agents over the scrapping of the commission, Jet agreed to blink at a meeting today with the representatives of travel agents, which was also attended by the officials of Air India and Kingfisher Airlines.         
	Sources said Air India and Kingfisher Airlines were expected to renew the commission system in the next few days. Spokespersons for the two airlines, however, refused to comment.         
	Earlier, the airlines had cancelled a transaction fee on the ticket price, which was introduced in place of commissions.         
	It was a decision taken by all the agents organisations on the one hand and the major airlines on the other. It will solve our problems, said Sarabjit Singh, director of Delhi-based Incentive Travels Ltd.         
	A Jet Airways statement said it recognised the difficult economic environment for the travel industry and had engaged in an intensive dialogue with travel agencies.        
	The commission will come into effect immediately, Jet officials said.        
	Jets low-cost airline, JetLite, will continue to pay a transaction fee.        
	From November, some airlines had scrapped the commission fee of 5 per cent on the ticket price and replaced it with a transaction fee on all tickets including those bought from the companys own websites.         
	The decision evoked a mixed response from travel agents. Some accepted it, while others, mostly in south India, joined hands to boycott the airlines.         
	The buyers had to pay a transaction fee  ranging between Rs 350 for domestic and Rs 10,000 for international passengers  with the ticket price.        
	Six associations, representing 3,200 travel agents, had protested the move. They considered the move a ploy to get them out of business.         
	About 65 per cent of bookings in India are done through travel agents, while online transactions make up another 15 per cent. The rest of the tickets are purchased directly from the airlines.

	Calcutta, April 9: Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) has asked Steel Authority of India (SAIL) to pay a higher price of Rs 6,300 per tonne for the coking coal it delivers under a long-term agreement or else it will reduce its supply.        
	In 2007-08, BCCL, a Coal India subsidiary, supplied coking coal to SAIL at Rs 4,500 per tonne, while the cost of production was between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,000 per tonne.         
	The price of coking coal in the international market during the last financial year went up 210 per cent to around Rs 14,000 per tonne.        
	BCCL produces around 3.5-4.5mt of coking coal, which it supplies primarily to state-owned SAIL and Rastriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL).         
	A.K. Paul, managing director of BCCL, said, RINL and Durgapur Projects (DPL) have agreed to pay the higher price for coking coal. RINL is willing to buy 50,000 tonnes per month. If SAIL declines to pay the higher price, we shall increase the coal supply to RINL.         
	BCCL supplied 16.82 lakh tonnes of coking coal to SAIL in 2007-08.         
	According to SAILs corporate plan, the company will require 21-22mt of coking coal by 2011-12. At present, 80 per cent of its coking coal requirement is met by BCCL.         
	BCCL has agreed to supply 20,000 tonnes per month to RINL and one lakh tonne per annum to DPL at the new price.         
	BCCLs agreement with SAIL expired last month.         
	We have a long standing association with SAIL and we would like to give it priority over others when it comes to supplying coking coal, Paul said.         
	However, we will not be able to supply coking coal at last years price because the cost of production has increased.        
	In 2007-08, BCCL produced 3.54mt of coking coal against a targeted 4.40mt.         
	BCCL, however, surpassed its total coal production target of 25.20mt in 2007-08.         
	The company posted a net profit of Rs 85.17 crore against a target of Rs 55 crore in 2007-08.

	Calcutta, Nov. 7: JSW Steel today said it would lower production by 20 per cent, indicating a slowdown in manufacturing. The Sajjan Jindal outfit became the first Indian steel company to cut output to cope with a slump in sales.        
	The company operates a 4-million-tonne (mt) plant at Vijaynagar in Karnataka and another at Salem which has a capacity of 1 million tonnes.         
	In a notice sent to the Bombay Stock Exchange, JSW Steel said it would rationalise the product mix according to the current market condition and appropriately modify the production programme to reduce total output by around 20 per cent from November. The JSW Steel stock slumped 5.18 per cent to Rs 285.35 today.         
	It is learnt that two more integrated players  Ispat and Essar Steel  are operating below full capacity.        
	Essars Hazira plant of 3.8mt capacity is operating 25 per cent below its peak level. Ispat, too, is not utilising its Dolvi plant in Maharashtra fully.

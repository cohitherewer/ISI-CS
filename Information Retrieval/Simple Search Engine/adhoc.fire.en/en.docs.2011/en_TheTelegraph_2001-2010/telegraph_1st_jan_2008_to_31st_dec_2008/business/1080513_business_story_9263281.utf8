          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 12: Telecom service provider Bharti Airtel has entered into a deal with US-based Apple Inc to launch the iPhone in India by October this year.        
	Last week, UK-based Vodafone had announced that it would distribute the popular smartphone worldwide, including India, later this year. iPhone, the touch-screen-based handset with music, video and Internet capabilities, is a huge success. It is now legally available in the US, Germany, Ireland, the UK, France and Austria.        
	Sources said Bharti Airtel could start offering the iPhone around Diwali to its over 65 million GSM-based subscribers.         
	While Bharti did not disclose the price at which the iPhone would be sold in India, sources said the price could range between Rs 25,000 to Rs 28,000.         
	The multimedia smartphone is already available in the local grey market for Rs 20,000-22,000.        
	Analysts said with two companies offering the same device, the pricing and bundling of services along with marketing would be key factors in determining who would capture the market.

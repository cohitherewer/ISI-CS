          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 13: Varun Shipping has earmarked a capital expenditure of $400 million in the current financial year to expand its fleet.        
	The emphasis will be on the offshore sector as well as on tankers and gas carriers, company officials said.        
	Around $300 million will be used to purchase four vessels, including anchor handling towing and supply vessels (AHTS), platform supply vessels and multi-purpose supply vessels.         
	The company already acquired an AHTS for $100 million earlier this year.        
	We plan to fund our capital expenditure through internal resources as well as debt. Our first option is external commercial borrowings or else, we can go for foreign currency convertible bonds, said Yudhishthir D. Khatau, managing director of Varun Shipping. The company has five AHTS, of which two are chartered by Reliance Industries.         
	The companys revenues from offshore operations jumped to Rs 16.55 crore in financial year 2007-08 from Rs 2.39 crore in the previous fiscal. The company, which has 12 LPG carriers, transports around 72 per cent of the LPG imported into the country by public sector companies.        
	In the last financial year, it made a provision of Rs 62 crore on account of the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar.

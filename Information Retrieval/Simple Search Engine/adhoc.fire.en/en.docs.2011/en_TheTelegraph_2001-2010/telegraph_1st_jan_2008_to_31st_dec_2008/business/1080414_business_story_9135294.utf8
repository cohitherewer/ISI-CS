                                        Chidambaram:Strict      
	Washington, April 13 (PTI): India today warned that high food and oil prices in several countries would escalate into global contagion and sought international consensus to tackle the issue.        
	Unless we act fast for a global consensus on the price spiral, the social unrest induced by food prices in several countries will conflagrate into global contagion leaving no country developed or otherwise unscathed, finance minister P. Chidambaram told the development committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).        
	The global community must collectively deliberate on immediate steps to reverse the unconscionable increase in the price of food which threatens to negate the benefits to the poor nations from aid, trade and debt relief, the minister told the 77th meeting of the committee.        
	Describing the rise in global oil prices as unjustified, Chidambaram urged the oil producing countries to rethink their pricing policy.         
	The prices of crude oil that have shot up to around $110 a barrel do not reflect either the cost of producing the oil or the risks inherent in the market and, in fact, not even the inter-play of demand and supply. These runaway prices require producer nations to seriously contemplate the management of production and pricing policy, he said.        
	Food prices, which hit the poor the hardest, are expected to remain firm in the medium term unless we make serious interventions, he added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 17: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) today invited bids from fund managers to manage the corpus of its over four crore subscribers. The State Bank of India (SBI) is now the sole manager of all funds with the EPFO.        
	In an advertisement published today, the state-run EPFO said portfolio or fund managers have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Fund managers have to send their applications to the EPFO by end-April. In January, the EPFO had said it would pay an 8.5 per cent interest to its subscribers for the year ended March 31, 2008.         
	The EPFO feels the short-term deposits the SBI invests the funds in give lower returns than those of other banks.        
	It added that the bank had violated rules set by the provident fund board on investment in term-deposit receipts of the SBI and other banks.         
	Some 80 per cent of the EPFOs corpus is parked in the governments special deposit scheme, which gives a low but guaranteed fixed rate of return.         
	Fund managers are supposed to squeeze out extra income by investing the remaining corpus elsewhere.

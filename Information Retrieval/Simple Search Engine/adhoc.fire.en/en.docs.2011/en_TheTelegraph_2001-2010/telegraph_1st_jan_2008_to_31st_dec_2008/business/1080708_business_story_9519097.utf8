	Calcutta, July 7: Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee today exhorted the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) to explore the possibility of forming a joint venture with West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL) to acquire coal mines abroad.        
	While big public sector units such as Coal India, NTPC, Steel Authority of India Ltd and others as well as some private sector companies are acquiring coal blocks and mines overseas, DVC should also consider this (acquisition of coal mines overseas), Banerjee said.        
	West Bengal Power Development Corporation can join hands with DVC as a smaller joint venture partner, he said.        
	The minister mooted this proposal at a function organised to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the DVC.        
	According to Banerjee, the high ash content of domestic coal is hampering the generation at thermal power plants.         
	The availability of coal with the power generating units is going down, he said.        
	Banerjee said a joint venture between the DVC and the WBPDCL would ensure fuel supply to thermal power plants of both the entities.        
	Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister of state for power, who was also present at the function, welcomed the state governments proposal.         
	It is an interesting proposal and well consider it. Ill ask the DVC chairman to look into it, he said.        
	We can look at Indonesia, Australia, Africa and perhaps Myanmar from where coal is imported at present. Now that a proposal has come from the Bengal government, well definitely look into it, Ramesh added.        
	The DVC, which generates 2,400MW of power at present, aims to produce 11,000MW by the end of the Eleventh Plan period (2007-12), becoming the second largest power producer in the country.         
	By the end of the Twelfth Five Year Plan, the DVC will generate 17,000MW. All the orders for plant and equipment for the proposed capacity addition in the current plan period have already been placed, the Union minister said.        
	A feasibility study for capacity addition in the Twelfth Plan will be prepared within the next one year and project orders will be placed after that, Ramesh added.        
	R amp;D centre        
	The DVC will invest Rs 120 crore to set up a research and development centre at Rajarhat.        
	Ramesh laid the foundation stone for the new centre, coming up on a three-acre plot, here today.        
	The DVC will collaborate with IIT-Kharagpur to carry out research and development activities.        
	Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, which already has a research centre in Hyderabad, and Tata Power have agreed to join hands with the DVC in its initiative to develop the proposed R amp;D centre at Rajarhat into a centre for excellence, Ramesh said.        
	The research centre, which will work on special areas such as clean coal and coal-bed methane technology, is expected to provide the much needed skilled manpower to the power sector that is supposed to add 20,000MW generation capacity every year for the remaining four years of the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the Union minister added.

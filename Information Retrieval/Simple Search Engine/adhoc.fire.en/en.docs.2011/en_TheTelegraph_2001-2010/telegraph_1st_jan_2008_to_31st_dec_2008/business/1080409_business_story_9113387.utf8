          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 8: Companies that have a non-executive chairman, who is either a promoter or a relative of the promoters, must ensure that at least half of the board consists of independent directors.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today tightened the compliance norms linked to Clause 49 of the listing agreement which is designed to bring about greater transparency in corporate governance.        
	The regulator also ordered firms to reveal the relationships among directors in all their filings with the bourses. It specified 21 years as the minimum age to qualify as an independent director.        
	If the non-executive chairman is a promoter or is related to promoters or persons occupying management positions at the board level or at one level below the board, at least one-half of the board of the company should consist of independent directors, Sebi said.         
	At present, a firm must ensure that one-third of the board comprises independent directors if the chairman is a non-executive director. The current rules set no conditions with respect to either the filial connections of the non-executive chairman or his status as a promoter.        
	Under the existing rules, if the chairman is an executive director, at least half of the board should comprise independent directors.         
	About 30 per cent of the companies have misused the rights provided through this particular sub clause till now, Prithvi Haldea, the founder-managing director of Prime Database, told The Telegraph.        
	We had recommended this proviso to Sebi in 2006. We hope that the new guidelines will help bring greater transparency. About 839 companies have a non-executive chairman, of whom 431 are promoter-directors, Haldea added.        
	Sebi also mandated that companies disclose the relationships among directors in their annual report. This initiative will ensure that the company is following the new norms sincerely, and will keep the shareholders abreast with the modifications done at the board level, Haldea said.         
	The market regulator also specified that a company would have to appoint a new independent director within 180 days if an existing director resigned or was removed from the board.

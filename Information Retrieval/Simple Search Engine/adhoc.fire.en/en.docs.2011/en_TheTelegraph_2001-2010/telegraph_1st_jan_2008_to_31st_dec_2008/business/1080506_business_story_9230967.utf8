          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 5: mjunction, the largest e-commerce portal in the country, aims to increase its sales five times in five years, backed by overseas forays and a new portal for online sale to retail customers.         
	The Calcutta-based company, a 50:50 joint venture between Steel Authority of India Ltd and Tata Steel, closed the last fiscal with Rs 10,400 crore of transactions via its portals.        
	Viresh Oberoi, managing director of mjunction, said the company wanted to touch Rs 50,000 crore in transactions by the next five years.        
	He believed that 30 per cent of the business would come from overseas even though it had forayed into the UK and Europe only four months ago.        
	It has started procurement of non-strategic material for Corus, Tata Steels wholly owned subsidiary.        
	Oberoi said it was looking at acquisitions in the UK and Europe for portals having technology and expertise in procurement. We have set aside Rs 200 crore for the same, he said.        
	Meanwhile, the company is closing in another acquisition for its publication business. It is likely to make an announcement within a month.        
	Oberoi said the business to consumer portals such as straightline and buyjunction would be big growth drivers.        
	Our portals will sale everything, from books to music to clothes to FMCG. It will be platform for both big and small companies, he said. Straightline was selling construction material online. But it has not been a success. As a result, the company has decided to re-focus.        
	It has allocated Rs 10 crore for technology upgrade and Rs 15 crore for marketing during the year.

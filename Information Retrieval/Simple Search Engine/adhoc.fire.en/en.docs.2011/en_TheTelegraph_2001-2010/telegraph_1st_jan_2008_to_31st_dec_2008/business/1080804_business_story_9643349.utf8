                                At the time of hiring a locker, banks make an agreement with customers. Is a customer who hires a locker entitled to get a copy of the agreement?          P. Chaudhuri, Shibpur
                      Since its a bipartite agreement between a customer and a bank, the customer is entitled to a copy of the agreement. You can ask for a photocopy of the agreement duly attested by the bank. The bank has no reason not to give it to you.                                      Share transfer       I have two demat accounts  one in my name and         the other jointly with my wife. Im the first holder in the joint account. I now want to transfer the shares held in the single demat account to a joint one. Do I have to pay securities transaction tax (STT) on the notional value of the shares transferred? Will the transfer of shares attract any capital gains tax?         Asit Chowdhury, Calcutta
                    For the tax purpose, the first holder in a demat account will be considered as the owner of the shares if it cannot be proved that both the holders of the demat account have contributed to acquire those shares. Thus, the transfer of shares from single account to a joint account will have no tax implications. Since it will be an off-market transfer, no STT has to be paid.                      Tax refund      I am more than 75 years in age. I have PAN and GIR No. I have been filing tax returns since 1980. From 2001-06, I didnt have any taxable income but still I filed my returns. My present income is less than Rs 1 lakh. Should I submit tax return for assessment year 2008-09? Should I have to apply for refund of excess tax paid in the financial year 2006-07?        D.P. Ghosh, Calcutta
                      Since your annual income in 2007-08 is less than the threshold limit for income tax purposes, you need not file income tax return. However, for refund of excess tax paid in previous years, you will have to contact your assessment officer. Income tax office has recently revved up its refund processes and you may get it soon.

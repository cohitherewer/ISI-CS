                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STD at 50p a minute
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Welcome call                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Virgin Mobile today said it would charge 50 paise per minute for local and STD calls in the pre-paid category, which could be the cheapest rates in the country.        
	Though there are some schemes of other operators which charge lower rates, they have other costs such as monthly rentals or come with conditions such as calls to be made within the network of the same operator.        
	The offer of Virgin, which operates under a franchisee agreement with CDMA firm Tata Teleservices, has no such conditions.        
	In STD, a Virgin user will pay 50 paise from the third minute of a call up to 30 minutes. In the first three minutes, the rate is Rs 1.50 per minute. For the local call, the charge is 50 paise from the third minute till the rest of the day. In the first three minutes, the rate will be a rupee per minute.        
	Against the industry norm of STD tariff of Re 1 per minute at an additional monthly commitment, the new 50 paise STD-local rates will provide the lowest all-India STD base tariff offer with no extra cost, said M.A. Madhusudan, CEO of Virgin Mobile India.        
	Analysts said the move to reduce STD tariffs had been triggered by the abolition of a levy on private operators and regulator freeing the market for long-distance calling cards.

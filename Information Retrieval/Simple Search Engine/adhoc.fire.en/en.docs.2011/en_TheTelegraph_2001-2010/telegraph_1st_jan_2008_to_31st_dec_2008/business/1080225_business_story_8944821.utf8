The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 2-day bank strike cloud on cheque clearance
                                                                                                               2-day bank strike cloud on cheque clearance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: Around 10 lakh employees and officers under the United Forum of Bank Unions will go on a two-day nationwide strike from tomorrow to press for their charter of demands that include higher wages.        
	Customers of public sector banks will suffer as the employees associated with the forum may not turn up for work. However, private sector banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are unlikely to be affected.        
	An official of a private sector bank said his banks branches would function as usual as most of the banks employees were not affiliated to any of the unions. The forum is the apex body of nine all-India banking industry unions.         
	An official from the Reserve Bank of India said cheque clearing was likely to be affected. Employees of the central bank are, however, not part of the strike. It is seen that cheques cleared in certain circles are around one-third of the normal volumes during strike days, a bank official said. Forum officials said the Indian Banks Association (IBA) did not give any concrete offer to them in response to their demands but wanted them to defer the strike.         
	The union body also threatened to go on an indefinite strike from March 24 if its demands were not met. After the failure of the conciliatory meeting, called by chief labour commissioner S. K. Mukopadhyay on Friday, another meeting was held on Saturday between the IBA and the union leaders, but failed to throw up a solution.         
	Demand list        
	The unions are protesting the proposed merger among public sector banks and are demanding an early settlement of their claims for higher wages. They have demanded the pension option for those who had opted for provident funds earlier. The unions also want restoration of the system of appointments on compassionate grounds.         
	A major dispute between the unions and the management of the banks is over giving employees another chance to opt for pension. Earlier, employees were given the option to choose between provident fund and pension. Many of them opted for provident fund as interest rates on it were higher.         
	However, with the interest rates on provident funds coming down to 8 per cent, the unions are wanting the other option.         
	Consolidation at stake        
	The unions are against consolidation as they feel the mergers will lead to the closure of a large number of branches and put the jobs of many workers at stake. Finance minister P. Chidambaram has been asking banks to look at consolidation. He had, however, asked them to go ahead only after getting the approval of the employees.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PNB cuts lending rate
          OUR BUREAU                      Chakrabarty: Chain reaction                          
	Delhi/Mumbai, Nov. 26: Punjab National Bank today slashed the benchmark prime lending rate by 100 basis points, a decision that will make auto, home and other commercial loans cheaper.        
	In response to the monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India, we have reduced the benchmark PLR from 13.50 per cent to 12.50 per cent, said PNB chairman K. C. Chakrabarty.        
	The reduced rates, which will be applicable to both existing and new borrowers, will come into effect from December 1.        
	The move will also benefit corporate houses and small and medium enterprises whose accounts are linked to the PLR.        
	The rate-cut measure has been taken to ensure credit to borrowers at a lower rate during the busy season, said Chakrabarty.        
	The bank will also bring down its peak deposit rate to 9.50 per cent from 10.50 per cent for deposits of one year to less than three years.         
	Bankers said with this cut, the benchmark rate at PNB would be the lowest among nationalised banks. Sources added that the reduction in the benchmark rate by PNB could be an attempt by the bank to push its growth in advances .         
	Last month, the bank had slashed its prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 13.5 per cent, following the 100-basis-point reduction in RBIs repurchase or repo rate.

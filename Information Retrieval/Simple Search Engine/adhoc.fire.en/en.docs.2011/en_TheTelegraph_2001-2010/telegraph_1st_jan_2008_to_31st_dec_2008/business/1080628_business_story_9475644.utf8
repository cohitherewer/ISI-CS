          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chandra: Room for more                                  
	New Delhi, June 27: Real estate giant Unitech Limited today said it was planning to sell a 26 per cent stake in its telecom arm.        
	We are planning to sell a 26 per cent stake in the telecom operations, said Sanjay Chandra, managing director of Unitech. However, he did not elaborate on the potential buyer.        
	Unitech is also planning to raise $1 billion from private equity funds over the next 12 months, including $350 million for hotels and additional funds for its Mumbai projects, Chandra said.        
	Earlier this month, Unitech sold a 50 per cent stake in a Mumbai project to Lehman Brothers Holdings Incs real estate fund for $175 million.        
	The countrys second largest real estate developer by market capitalisation has been awarded start-up spectrum in five telecom circles. It has already invited the first round of financial bids from international mobile operators.        
	Unitech has been in talks with telecom companies such as the US-based AT amp;T, South Africas MTN, Italys Telecom Italia, Norways Telenor Group, and Spains Telefonica SA.        
	Unitech, which has no previous experience in running a telecom business, is looking to partner foreign telecom firms to tap their technical expertise and financial strength, said analysts. They estimated the total investment required for Unitechs telecom venture to be around Rs 20,000 crore over the next three years.        
	In January, Unitechs received a pan-India telecom licence to offer mobile services across all the 22 telecom circles.         
	The real estate firm has received 4.4 megahertz of initial spectrum, or radio waves, in the 1,800 megahertz GSM band for five circles.         
	The five circles are Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The firm plans to roll out services in Tamil Nadu in the next six months.        
	Chandra said Unitech would invest Rs 4,000 crore in the hospitality business over the next five years        
	We have planned to develop 35 hotels, comprising about 6,000 rooms, in the next five years across the country, Chandra said.        
	For the financial year ended March 31, 2008, Unitechs net profit rose 27 per cent to Rs 1,661.86 crore from Rs 1,305.83 crore in the previous fiscal.         
	Total income grew 26 per cent to Rs 4,280.11 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 3,388.09 crore in the previous fiscal. The board, in its meeting held today, recommended a dividend of 12.5 per cent for the 2007-08 fiscal.

                                                                                                            Pig iron plants on NMDC menu
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Som: Big plans                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 7: NMDC Ltd, the countrys largest producer of iron ore, is planning to set up two pig iron plants at an estimated investment of Rs 2,500-3,000 crore.        
	The company will use Rio Tintos technology to use slime  which is waste material generated while extracting iron from iron ore  and make 1 million tonne (mt) of pig iron.        
	The plants will come up in Chhattisgarh and Karnataka where NMDC owns ore mines.        
	Our team will go to Australia at the end of this month to see the technology, Rana Som, chairman and managing director of NMDC, said.        
	The company, which will produce about 30mt iron ore this year, faces a huge environmental problem while disposing of slime.        
	Som said NMDC would raise production by another 7mt by the middle of 2009, when the company would be in a position to exploit the new deposits at Bailadila, Chhattisgarh.        
	The company has also been approached by a Canadian entity to participate in a 2-billion-tonne iron ore project.        
	Som said NMDC would step up exploration in a big way. We have created a centre, taken people and bought equipment for exploration. NMDC will offer its service to state governments free of cost. We dont even seek a licence, he said.        
	Diamond, gold foray        
	NMDC is in talks with an Australian company for diamond exploration in India.         
	It has received eight blocks in Andhra Pradesh and applied for five more in Madhya Pradesh.

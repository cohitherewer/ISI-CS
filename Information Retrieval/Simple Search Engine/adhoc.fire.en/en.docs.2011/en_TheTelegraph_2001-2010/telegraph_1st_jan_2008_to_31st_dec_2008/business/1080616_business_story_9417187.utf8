                                I am a woman taxpayer having income from pension, interest on deposits and commission. Which income tax return form should I use for filing my income return in 2008-09?          Pritilata Debi, Calcutta
                    You can use ITR 2 for filing income tax return since part of your income is from commissions. ITR 1 is meant for individual taxpayers or Hindu Undivided Family having income only from salaries, interests and pension.                                  Ancestral property      I had to give power of attorney to my younger brother for succession certificate because I understand that the law permits only one successor to a person who had died intestate. Now that my brother has received the succession certificate and declared heir to my late fathers assets and cash, he is refusing to part with any portion of that. What should I do?         J. Shome, Salt Lake
                      When a Hindu male, who has an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, dies, his interest in the property shall be passed on to the other members of the coparcenary. So, you can lay your claims on any such ancestral property. The general rules of succession is that the property of a male Hindu dying intestate shall devolve firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives; if there is no heir, then upon their heirs, being relatives specified in Class II of the Schedule of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956; thirdly, if there is no heir of any of the two classes, then upon the agnates (relatives on the male side) of the deceased; and lastly, if there is no agnate, then upon the cognates (related by blood) of the deceased.                                      Senior query      I am 65-years-old. I have no income except interest from post office deposits. My total annual income is also not taxable. Shall I have to file income return every year?        Sunil Kumar Sarcar, Calcutta
                    If your total annual income is less than Rs 2,25,000, you dont have to file income tax return. Filing income tax return for individuals who are 65 years or more and having an annual income of less than Rs 2,25,000 is voluntary and not compulsory.

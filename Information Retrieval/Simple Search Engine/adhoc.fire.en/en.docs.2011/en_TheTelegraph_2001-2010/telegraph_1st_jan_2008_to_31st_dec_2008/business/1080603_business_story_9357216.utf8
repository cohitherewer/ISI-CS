The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Upaid battle with Satyam intensifies 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Upaid battle with Satyam intensifies 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          Troubled times                                  
	Mumbai, June 2: The battle between Upaid Systems, an online and mobile payments company based in the British Virgin Islands, and Satyam Computers has snowballed into a claim for damages that could exceed $1 billion.        
	In the latest twist to a legal battle that began in 2005 with a patent infringement case, Upaid spokesperson Joanne Hunter said, There is no limitation on damages in this case, neither for the frauds nor the breaches of contract. In the new complaint, Upaid has indicated that our damages are likely to exceed $1 billion. We have also asked for punitive damages to be awarded against Satyam.        
	Upaid had employed Satyam in 1997 to develop a software needed for the commercial deployment of Upaids advanced intelligent payment processing framework.        
	The legal battle arose over Upaids charge that Satyam deliberately and systematically misled Upaid about the existence of internal assignments of intellectual property by Satyams employees. Upaids new complaint in Texas alleges a continuing pattern of fraudulent behaviour by Satyam.        
	Upaid had filed a case against Satyam in Texas, US, in 2007 to declare its patent valid and sought damages from Satyam for any possible losses arising out of an impairment of its patent.        
	Satyam, in turn, filed a petition in London contending that the jurisdiction was in line with the terms of the agreement signed between the two parties earlier on.        
	The courts in London decided that the case in Texas could continue and be heard based on an earlier agreement signed by Satyams then subsidiary and Upaid.         
	We have clarified our points in this matter in our earlier statement, Satyam said today. We believe there are no material developments that merit a consideration, since then. It is for the designated court to take up the matter.         
	It is Satyams policy to refrain from commenting on any ongoing litigation involving the company or comment on speculation by the interested parties, Hari Thalapalli, Satyams head (global marketing and communications), said in a statement.        
	The company refused to comment on any other issues including the damages sought.         
	Satyam had lost its effort to block the Texas fraud case in a UK high court in January, and again on appeal in April.        
	Upaids revised claims in the US case are a direct result of the UK courts revelations. The UK courts confirmed Upaids contention that an earlier settlement did not excuse fraud. The appellate victory allows Upaid to pursue its substantial damages through the US judicial system.

	New Delhi, Nov. 6: Renault today said it would soon finalise a marketing and distribution pact with Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) to roll out more cars in India.        
	We will try to finalise the distribution agreement with M amp;M in the coming months. The agreement will be for every passenger car distributed in India, whether imported or produced from the Chennai facility, said Sylvain Bilaine, managing director, Renault India.        
	Under the terms of the current Mahindra-Renault joint venture, the company produces the mid-sized sedan, Logan, in India.        
	On Renaults low-cost car project with Bajaj and Nissan, Bilaine said it was on track and the first car would be rolled out in 2011. He said the company had completed its draft on the final shape of the car in September.

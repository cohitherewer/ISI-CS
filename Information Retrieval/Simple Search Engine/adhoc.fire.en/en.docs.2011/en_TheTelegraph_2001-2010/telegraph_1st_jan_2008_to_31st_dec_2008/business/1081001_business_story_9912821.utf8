          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Ambani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: Reliance Communications (R-Com) today said it expected its capital expenditure (capex) intensity to decline significantly from next year.         
	The company had earmarked an investment of over Rs 50,000 crore over 2007-08 and 2008-09.        
	Telecom is a capital-intensive business. The company currently is at the peak of the capex cycle, R-Com chairman Anil Ambani said on the sidelines of the companys fourth annual general meeting today.         
	He said the company would witness strong cash flows and higher stakeholder value once the projects gets implemented.        
	At the meeting, Ambani said that R-Com would participate in the auctions for 3G and WiMAX spectrums.         
	Our state-of-the-art GSM network is 3G ready. This gives us a significant competitive advantage in terms of time to market and incremental capex as we begin to offer vastly enhanced data and multimedia services, he said.         
	Ambani said that by 2009-10 the company would have 70,000 telecom towers, each capable of supporting four or more operators.

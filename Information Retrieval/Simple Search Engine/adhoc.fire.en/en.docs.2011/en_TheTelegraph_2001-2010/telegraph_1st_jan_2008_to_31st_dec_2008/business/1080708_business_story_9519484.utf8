          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 7: The warring Ambani camps continued to shadow box today after officials from Reliance Communications (R-Com) failed to turn up for a conciliatory meeting with Reliance Industries (RIL) to discuss a welter of issues that has enveloped the controversial stake sale in the Rs 19,068-crore telecom giant.        
	Anil Ambani-owned R-Com is looking to forge an alliance with MTN of South Africa and create the worlds fifth largest telecom company. The two sides started talks on May 26, opening a 45-day exclusivity period that ends on Tuesday.        
	RIL had scheduled the meeting today at 11 am at the business centre of The Oberoi in Mumbai where three of its senior officials  K. G Ramanathan, K. Sethuraman and K. R. Raja  waited for over an hour for their counterparts from R-Com.        
	RIL then sent a tersely worded letter addressed to Anil Ambani seeking to place on record that his officials hadnt turned up for the meeting.        
	The meeting would have marked the start of a conciliation process that had been spelt out under the dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the non-compete agreement between the two sides.        
	Recriminations flew soon after the RIL letter.         
	R-Com wrote back suggesting a meeting sometime after July 14 in order to clear the air and establish that there was neither any dispute nor occasion for a conciliation process.         
	It added that this meeting shall in no way be considered part of any conciliation or dispute resolution mechanism.        
	An R-Com spokesperson said, RIL had written asking us to attend a meeting this morning to initiate the process of conciliation. However, we will not attend any meeting for dispute resolution. We do not recognise any dispute in this matter. We can only meet RIL in order to clear their misconceptions.         
	Reliance Industries fired off another letter in which it said that R-Coms refusal to participate in the conciliation process left it with no alternative but to initiate appropriate proceedings against R-Com, as advised.         
	R-Com is misleading the media, an RIL official said. We invited them to commence the process of mutual conciliation under the non-compete agreement. But they refused to participate.        
	RIL has spurned the R-Com offer of talks anytime after July 14. R-Com officials said that this clearly displayed RILs malafide intentions.        
	RIL has spurned our offer to meet in week of July 14 and has threatened legal action. RIL is not interested in understanding the factual position or clarifying its doubts. Its sole objective is to derail talks with MTN and frustrate a possible combination, said R-Com officials.        
	The Anil Ambani-controlled company maintained that RIL claims of a right of first refusal to any stake sale in R-Com was legally and factually untenable and misconceived.

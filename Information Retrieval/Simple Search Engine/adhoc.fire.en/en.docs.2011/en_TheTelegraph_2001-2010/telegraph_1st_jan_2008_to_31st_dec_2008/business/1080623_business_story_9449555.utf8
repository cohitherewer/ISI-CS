          SAMBIT SAHA                                           
	Calcutta , June 22: JSW Steel may be forced to scale back the size of its steel plant in Bengal in the first phase because of an imminent interest rate hike that threatens to undermine its borrowing programme.         
	The steel giant hasnt taken a decision yet but has issued a cautionary note to shareholders in which it has indicated it plans to go ahead with the 10-million-tonne-steel plant at Salboni in West Midnapur this year with or without modifications.         
	The note of caution has been sounded in the annual report of JSW Steel, which plans to invest Rs 35,000 crore to set up the steel plant and a captive power plant. The JSW Steel project is being touted as the biggest investment in Bengal.         
	The company had originally planned to build a 3 million tonne (mt) steel plant and then expand it to 10mt in suitable phases over 12 years. After various evaluations, the company decided to double the first phase, expected to be ready by 2012, to 6mt to achieve economies of scale.         
	Seshagiri Rao, director (finance) of JSW Steel, said the company was still pursuing a 6mt project in the first phase and the finances would be tied up as soon as possible.         
	However, the annual report says, The project will be taken up for implementation during the fiscal 2008-09 with or without modification in the scope of project taking into account the current prevailing volatile conditions in financial markets in achieving the financial closure.         
	Rao said the statement was issued to the shareholders as part of good corporate governance providing ample disclosure.         
	When we expanded the project scope in the first phase, the financial market was robust. The situation has changed now. We are telling the shareholders in advance should we need to make any changes in the light of present circumstances. It is a cautionary statement, he added.         
	Rao said JSW Bengal  in which two state agencies hold 11 per cent  would fulfil its commitment to build a 10mt plant here.         
	With inflation surging to a 13-year high at 11.05 per cent, there is a growing feeling that the Reserve Bank of India will raise its benchmark interest rates to deal with a difficult situation. If that happens, companies such as JSW may have to contend with a tightening of money supply and higher borrowing costs.         
	If it is able to ride out the storm, Bengal will see an investment of Rs 15,000 crore in the steel plant alone and another Rs 2,500-3,000 crore in the 600 mega watt plant over the next four years. JSW Bengal hopes to raise Rs 10,000 crore as debt from local as well overseas markets. The rest of the money will be raised through promoter contribution and an initial public offering.        
	The company is already in talks with banks and financial institutions for the loan. The State Bank of India is the lead bank in the mission to secure funds.         
	Once the funds are tied up, work on the project will start.         
	Since the plant will come up in a special economic zone  which means 60 to 70 per cent of the product will be exported  the company intends to raise overseas loans.         
	One of the options is to take loans from export credit agencies in Germany, the US and the UK to finance equipment imports.         
	Rao admitted that the borrowing cost had gone up from the level of 8 to 10 per cent to 10 to 12 per cent in the last two years. Experts blame worsening credit scenario unleashed by the sub-prime crisis in the US and inflation fuelled by high crude oil prices.         
	If the borrowing costs rise dramatically, the company may have to scale back the initial project size.         
	JSW has already obtained the land for the project and a boundary wall is being erected. Construction is expected to start after monsoon.

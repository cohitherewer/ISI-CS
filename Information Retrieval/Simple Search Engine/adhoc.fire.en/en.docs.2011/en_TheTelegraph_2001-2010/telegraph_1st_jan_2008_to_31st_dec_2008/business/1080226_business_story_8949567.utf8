The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Priority to high growth, low prices 
                                                                                                               Priority to high growth, low prices 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patil: High hopes                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Congress-led government will attempt to maintain high growth without fuelling a price spiral.        
	It will continue to be the endeavour of the government to sustain economic growth while keeping prices in check, President Pratibha Patil said in a traditional address to parliamentarians at the beginning of the budget session.         
	The Indian economy grew by 9.6 per cent in 2006-07 and is expected to grow by almost 9 per cent this fiscal.         
	This performance is all the more creditable against the background of high international oil prices and rising commodity prices, including food, Patil said.        
	The President said historically high investment rates of over 35 per cent of the gross domestic product and savings rates of over 34 per cent symbolised a new dynamism in the economy.         
	I am confident that the creativity, enterprise and hard work of our young people will be able to sustain these high rates in the years to come, she said.        
	Economists, however, project that growth may slow in the year ahead because of an economic downturn in the West which has hit Indian exports of software, call centre work, textiles and gems and jewellery.        
	Growth in the last one year had been marginally compromised by the RBI, which had constricted money supply by keeping interest rates high to suck excess liquidity out of the economy and dampen price rise.         
	The central banker refrained from cutting interest rates at a monetary policy meeting held last month on fears that rising oil and food prices could stoke inflation.        
	Patil said the government had taken measures to reduce poverty, increase health care and reduce the disparity between rural and urban India. It is committed to economic growth that is socially inclusive, regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable, she said.         
	The President told MPs that the Congress-led coalition government would expand its flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which offers 100 days of paid work a year to rural households, to all rural districts from this budget onwards.        
	The move, which was widely expected, will help boost the Congress-led alliances electoral chances as is a spate of other measures meant to alleviate farmers, minorities, scheduled castes and tribes.         
	Critics of the government have tried to pick holes in these poverty combating measures and have often pointed to corruption and bureaucratic red tape killing these well meaning measures.

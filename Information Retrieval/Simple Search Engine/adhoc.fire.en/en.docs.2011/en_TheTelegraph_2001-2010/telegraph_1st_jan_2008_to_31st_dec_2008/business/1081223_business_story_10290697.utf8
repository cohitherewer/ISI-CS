          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Taxing times                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Indian manufacturers want the government to impose a countervailing duty on cement from Pakistan.         
	The government must impose countervailing duties on cement from Pakistan as imports are hurting the domestic industry, which is now operating below capacity, H.M. Bangur, president of the Cement Manufacturers Association, told The Telegraph.        
	As part of the stimulus package, the government should announce measures to protect the domestic industry, which is affected by cheap imports, Bangur said.        
	Cement plants operated at 85 per cent of their capacity in April-November 2008 against 93 per cent in the same period last year.        
	The government had allowed imports from Pakistan to stem inflation. However, with the rate of inflation coming down to 6.84 per cent, Bangur said the Centre should not provide tax concessions to imported cement at the expense of the domestic industry.         
	Cement prices currently range between Rs 195 and Rs 250 per 50kg bag. Imported cement from Pakistan is cheaper by about Rs 20 per bag.        
	Meanwhile, the government has lifted a ban on cement exports. The decision is of low importance as the government had allowed export from Gujarat in May. About 80 per cent of the cement manufactured in Gujarat is exported. The decision will allow exports to Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.        
	Cement exports in the April-November period stood at 1.79 million tonnes, down 29.5 per cent from 2.54 million tonnes in the year-ago period. Production in the period increased 6.63 per cent and stood at 115.38 million tonnes against 108.2 million tonnes in the same period last year.        
	The government lifted the ban after data with the Cement Manufacturers Association showed that during November, production was 14.34 million tonnes, up 9.05 per cent over 13.15 million tonnes a year ago.                    
	The country had an installed capacity of 198.30 million tonnes at the beginning of the current fiscal. Taking into account capacity additions and new projects, the cement capacity has now gone up to 206.46 million tonnes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Microsoft drops Yahoo takeover bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Microsoft drops Yahoo takeover bid
                                      Steve Ballmer      
	San Francisco, May 4 (Reuters): Microsoft walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc after the latter turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.         
	Microsoft had made an offer of $33 per share, but Yahoo would not lower its demand below $37, Microsoft chief executive, Steve Ballmer, said. The software company initially bid $31 per share for Yahoo, more than three months ago.        
	We believe the economics demanded by Yahoo do not make sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal, Ballmer said in a statement.        
	According to analysts, Yahoo has overplayed its hand, and they expect the web pioneers shares to fall as much as 30 per cent to $20 when Nasdaq trading resumes on Monday. The stock rose nearly 7 per cent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo.        
	Im shocked Yahoo wasnt more reasonable. The stock will probably go down by at least $5 on Monday. It is surprising that Ballmer walked away instead of trying a hostile bid at $33, said Walter Price, a senior portfolio manager at RCM fund management company in San Francisco.        
	 Some Wall Street analysts were of the view that Microsoft could pull its bid as a negotiating strategy to put pressure on Yahoo to eventually accept a future offer.        
	Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock said the company believed from the beginning that Microsofts offer undervalued it and the board was pleased that so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view. He said Yahoo was pursuing strategic opportunities but gave no details.        
	Google deal        
	Yahoo has courted possible deals with Time Warner Incs AOL Internet division and News Corps MySpace online social network and tested a search advertising partnership with Google Inc. A partnership with Google may be announced as early as next week.        
	 With the distraction of Microsofts unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history so that we can maximise our potential to the benefit of our shareholders, employees, partners and users, Yahoo co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang said.        
	Ballmer cited Yahoos Google plans as one reason Microsoft was walking away rather than mounting a hostile offer. We regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a hostile bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo today, Ballmer said in a letter to Yang. In our view, such an arrangement would make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us, he said.

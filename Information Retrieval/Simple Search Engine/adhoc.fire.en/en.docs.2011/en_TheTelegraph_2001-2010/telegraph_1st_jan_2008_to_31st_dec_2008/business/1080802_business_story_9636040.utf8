                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Baring opens retail tie-up talks
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): Baring Private Equity Partners, which is looking to invest in Indian retail, is in talks with some major players for alliances. We want to provide long-term value addition and expertise for high growth to retail players in the apparel, beauty, entertainment and beauty health segments, Baring India head (retail practice) Aakash Moondhra said.        
	He said Baring India was in talks with some leading players of the retail industry and some kind of partnership is expected in the coming months.         
	On being asked about the amount of money the company is willing to put into the retail sector, Moondhra said: Capital is not a constraint for us. We are just seeking out the right retail firm having the correct business model.        
	Initially, we would be confined to a single-brand format because of government regulations prohibiting FDI in multi-brand retail, Moondhra said.        
	Baring is looking at players from all categories, including top-end premium majors, mid-cap players and value retailers, for its investments.        
	Moondhra, however, did not provide any details on the retail players with whom Baring is in talks.         
	He said private equity players such as Baring see a lot of opportunity for such ventures in Indian retail in the coming years.        
	The frenzy that gripped the market has calmed down and we are likely to see a fall in the high retail rental rates. There is also a possibility of consolidation in the industry after about a year or a 18 month period and all this brings potential in the sector, he said.

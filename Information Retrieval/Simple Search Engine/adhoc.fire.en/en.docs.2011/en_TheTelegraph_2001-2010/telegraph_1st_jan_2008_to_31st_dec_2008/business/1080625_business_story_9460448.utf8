                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asean to call the shots at next meet
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Nath: Seeking solutions                                  
	New Delhi, June 24: Price pressure and slowdown fear could force India to offer the Association of Southeast Nations (Asean) greater concessions on tea, coffee, pepper and palm oil imports from the region.        
	Commerce minister Kamal Nath is expected to meet the trade ministers of the 10-member economic bloc in August to resolve differences in the proposed free trade agreement.        
	We hope to break the deadlock in the next meeting, scheduled to take place in August of Asean trade ministers. The agreement is expected by the end of the year, officials said.         
	Asean comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.         
	Import duties on the four items has been hotly debated by the two sides, with Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, on the Asean side, demanding a higher reduction.        
	Negotiations had even come to a halt when India said it was willing to cut the duties to 50 per cent, while Asean insisted on a reduction to at least 40 per cent.        
	Sources said that India could compromise further and lower duties to about 45 per cent. But it remained to be seen whether this would be acceptable to the Asean members.        
	They said India could agree to the duties coming down within 10 years of the signing of the agreement, whereas in an earlier proposal, the country said the duties would come down in 10 years but the exercise would start five years after the signing of the agreement.        
	India, too, will be looking forward to greater market access for its products in the Asean region. Officials said while New Delhi had been very accommodative of Aseans demands vis-- vis palm oil (both crude and refined), pepper, tea amp; coffee, the economic grouping had not reciprocated to the same extent.         
	We want better market access for products such as automobile components and some agriculture products, they said.        
	India-Asean trade has already reached $30 billion, and the free trade agreement might see the trade climbing to $50 billion by 2012, analysts said.

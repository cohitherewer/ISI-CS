        Get, set go... choose your shots carefully while building your tax innings, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                             
	Financial year 2008-09 has just set in. Talking about tax planning right now is bound to raise eyebrows.         
	In fact, most taxpayers sleep over this important exercise till the last quarter of the financial year.         
	But it always pays if you plan your tax-saving investments early.        
	Tax planning is not just about reducing the tax burden, but to do it in such a way that there is no unwarranted pressure on household finances. Moreover, the aggregate yield from tax-saving investments should meet some future financial goals of the family. Before making any such investments, you have to consider various factors:        
	Liquidity        
	If you want your investment to meet future expenses such as education or marriage of children, construction of a house or savings for post-retirement years, you have to consider its lock-in period.         
	Different tax-saving instruments have different lock-in periods during which you cannot withdraw the money. For example, PPF has a lock-in of 15 years, bank fixed deposit five years, Ulips and ELSS cannot be redeemed within three years. The lock-in period in NSC is six years.         
	Security        
	How comfortable are you with the risk-return profile of a particular investment? This should depend on the financial and physical assets and liabilities of your family.         
	Return, tax impact        
	Some investment instruments may be more secured but less tax efficient than others. For example, life insurance and PPF are tax exempt at all stages  contribution, accumulation and withdrawal. But bank fixed deposits, NSC, post office term deposits are taxable on maturity. There is no capital gains tax on ELSS after one year of their purchase.         
	One must take into account the lock-in period of the investment while calculating its risk-return profile. The longer the lock-in, the higher is the liquidity risk.        
	Individual preference        
	All these considerations will vary from individual to individual. Besides, ones income and expenditure determines how much one can save. For example, if your income falls in the 20 per cent tax bracket, you will have to invest Rs 100 in specified instruments to save a maximum of Rs 20.60 in tax payment. However, if you are in the 30 per cent tax bracket, you can save a maximum of Rs 30.90 by investing the same amount of Rs 100.         
	If you have a lower income, ask yourself, do you need to invest Rs 100 to save Rs 20.60 or rather pay Rs 20.60 as tax and have Rs 79.40 at your disposal to meet expenses.        
	Saving plan        
	Budget 2008-09 provides a significant reduction in tax liability for individual income taxpayers. The hike in the basic exemption limit and realignment of income brackets lead to tax saving between Rs 4,120 and Rs 45,320 for men below 65 years, between Rs 515 and Rs 44,805 for women below 65 years and between Rs 6,180 and Rs 39,655 for people above 65 years.         
	You can use this saving to buy a pension plan of a life insurance company or build your own retirement kitty by investing in a systematic investment plan (SIP) of a mutual fund.         
	If you go for an SIP in a equity-linked savings scheme of a mutual fund, the tax benefit will be more because your contributions, that is the monthly investments, will qualify for deduction under section 80C of the income tax act and the maturity value of the fund after the lock-in period of three years will be tax-free.        
	Medical insurance        
	You should also take the benefit of the additional deduction of Rs 15,000 available to individuals for buying a medical insurance for parents. This benefit was not available till the 2007-08 financial year. The question is should you buy two mediclaims  one for you and your family and the other for your parents  or some other health insurance plans.         
	Under mediclaims sold by general insurance companies, any hospitalisation and medical treatment cost, up to the sum assured, is paid by the insurer to the hospital via the third party administrator. The policyholder enjoys cashless hospitalisation and treatment.         
	Recently, life insurance companies such as LIC, Tata AIG and Reliance Life Insurance have come up with defined benefit health insurance plans in which the annual premium remains unchanged over the years and the insurer reimburses a fixed amount in case of hospitalisation or medical expense. These policies are unit-linked. So, at the end of the policy term you may get back the money accumulated in the fund. A policyholder can claim benefits of this plan and mediclaim simultaneously.

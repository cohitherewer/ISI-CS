          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Dhamra Port CEO Santosh K. Mohapatra in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)                                   
	Mumbai, May 26: Steel makers setting up factories in Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa have shown interest in the upcoming Dhamra Port through which they plan to route imports and exports.        
	Were in the final stages of negotiations with some interested steel companies and the agreements will be signed shortly, said Santosh K. Mohapatra, CEO of Dhamra Port.         
	The companies want to use the port to import coking coal, limestone and export finished steel. Dhamra Port, a joint venture between Tata Steel and Larsen amp; Toubro, is coming up north of the river Dhamra in Doshinga, Orissa.        
	Conceived as a deep draft port capable of accommodating super cape-sized vessels, the port will start operations by April 2010.         
	The project is estimated to cost Rs 2,463 crore in the first phase, which includes development of the water channel, building two berths and adding rail and road connectivity.        
	It also involves construction of a 62km rail link between Dhamra and Bhadrak on the Howrah-Chennai main line and a jetty of 700 metre in the first phase with fully mechanised facilities for loading and unloading.         
	Officials said 25 per cent of the work under the first phase had been completed at an investment of Rs 600 crore.        
	The project capacity in the first phase is 25 tonnes. We estimate that Tata Steel will use 30-40 per cent of this capacity. The rest will be available for interested parties from whom well charge freight. When we find more takers, we will keep adding to the number of berths, said Mohapatra, adding that the port can take up to 13 berths.        
	In the first phase, the port will provide direct employment to around 1,000 people.        
	On concerns raised by environmental organisations on the impact of the project on olive ridley turtles in the area, Mohapatra said the project was located 15km away from the turtle nesting sites and dredging and port operations wouldnt harm the animals.        
	Mohapatra said BNP Paribas did not pull out of the Dhamra project because of environmental reasons but because of the RBIs restrictions on external commercial borrowings of more than $25 million. Since then, weve attained financial closure. Eight banks led by IDBI are funding our project, which will have 30 per cent equity, including subordinate debt, and 70 per cent debt, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 20: Stocks sank as inflation worries spooked the markets, sending the sensex tumbling to its lowest closing level in 2008 at 14571.29 and wiping out Rs 1,68,007 crore of investor wealth.         
	The unexpectedly high inflation number of 11.05 per cent triggered an avalanche of selling on the bourses at noon and left even blue-chip stocks such as Reliance Industries badly battered. The stock fell to a six-month low of Rs 2,079.10, down 6.6 per cent.        
	The sensex, which fell 517.60 points, or 3.42 per cent, is at its lowest level since August 2007 when the sub-prime credit crisis walloped markets around the world.        
	Like others, market observers had expected the inflation number to be close to 10 per cent. However, the 13-year high figure left them rattled and deeply worried about the monetary measures that the Reserve Bank of India would take to tame what Ronald Reagan once called the Mugger.        
	Analysts fear that monetary measures can hurt sectors such as banks, automobiles, and real estate  and may precipitate an economic slowdown. They add that the underlying sentiment in the market is already weak on account of the fresh political uncertainty brewing over the India-US nuclear deal at a time when foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been selling stocks.                    
	Provisional figures show that the FIIs sold stocks worth Rs 999 crore today. While the markets were prepared for higher inflation, they were not prepared for the 11.05 per cent, which was ultimately reported. The markets, therefore, had to fall in tandem with the numbers, said V. K. Sharma, wholetime director and head of research at Anagram Stock Broking. On the BSE, all the indices were in the red, though it was the BSE oil and gas index, realty and metal that led the declines.        
	ICICI Bank plummeted 2.5 per cent, State Bank of India by over 4 per cent and Reliance Communication by 6.65 per cent to Rs 489.00, its lowest close in two months. Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, reckoned that there would be more pain for investors next week.        
	But there are a few contrarians who see this as a great time to scoop up low-priced stocks with strong fundamentals. Considering that the current scenario is transitory in nature, investors should take advantage of the opportunities available to build a long-term portfolio, said Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking.         
	Agrawal said investors could start buying shares of non-interest rate sensitive sectors such as FMCG, pharmaceuticals and IT, but advised investors not to take fresh exposures to sectors such as cement, metal, power and real estate. This is a good time to buy in small lots and make systematic investments. The best profits are made in the worst of times, he adds.        
	Stocks were not the only ones affected by the inflation numbers. Bond prices also fell and bond yields rose to their highest in nearly seven years.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Union Bank of India will soon take a decision on increasing its lending and deposit rates following the 50 basis points hike in the repo rate and a 25 basis points increase in the cash reserve ratio by the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday.         
	Our asset-liability committee will review the situation and take a decision on the rate hike when it meets next time, said R.S. Reddy, executive director, Union Bank of India.         
	The bank last raised its lending rates by 50 basis points in June-end along with the State Bank of India.        
	It increased its deposit rates with effect from July 9.         
	Union Bank had signed a joint venture agreement last month with KBC Asset Management NV of Belgium to get into the mutual fund business. Well hold a majority stake of 51 per cent in the asset management company, while KBC will hold the remaining 49 per cent, Reddy said.         
	The asset management company will commence operation in the current fiscal.         
	Last year, the bank entered the life insurance business through a joint venture with the Bank of India and Dai-ichi Mutual Life of Japan. We are looking at diversifying into different financial services business to bolster the growth of the bank, Reddy said.        
	Union Bank reported a net profit of Rs 228 crore for the April-June quarter this year, marginally up from Rs 225 crore from the same period last year. The banks profitability suffered because it had to make provisioning of Rs 339 crore for mark-to-market depreciation in investment.         
	However, in the face of a rising interest rate scenario, the bank has been able to improve its asset quality through reduced slippage in fresh loans and increased recoveries.         
	Both gross and net non-performing assets of the bank stood reduced at 2.08 per cent and 0.15 per cent, respectively, at the end of June from 2.78 per cent and 0.78 per cent in the previous year.         
	The banks total business grew 21.48 per cent to Rs 1,83,058 crore at the end of June this year from Rs 1,50,692 crore a year ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Doha draft deals a blow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Doha draft deals a blow
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 20: India today expressed its disappointment over the World Trade Organisations revised draft on agriculture and industrial products, to facilitate the Doha trade deal, as there is little to protect the interests of farmers and industry.        
	If our core national interests are not protected, we will not have a deal, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) released new drafts of the proposed agriculture and non-agricultural market access agreements.        
	The drafts, released in Geneva on Monday, give developing countries little room to shield their farmers and industries from cheap imports.        
	Though differences on agriculture have come down, the total neglect of the livelihood concerns of poor farmers is unacceptable to India.        
	Pillai said rich nations were keen to push for a ministerial meeting in June, but a deal was unlikely.         
	The draft has lowered the number of farm items that can be protected from unrestricted imports and set a band of three to eight products. WTO calls such items special products.         
	There is a special safeguard mechanism (SSM) on such products that allows developing countries raise duties to ensure domestic prices are not depressed because of cheap imports.        
	We have such a large number of farm and horticulture products under different agro-climatic zones. We do not want any limit on the products. We want flexibility so that we can use the SSM on a product which witnesses a plunge in prices due to global factors, Pillai said.        
	The draft allows member states to raise import duties only if world prices are lower than domestic prices by over 30 per cent.        
	A price trigger of 30 per cent is completely unacceptable to us. If we accept this condition, how will we face Parliament, Pillai said. India wants triggers at 5-10 per cent level.        
	Industry tariff        
	On trade in industrial goods, referred to as non-agricultural market access (Nama), Indias trade negotiators said there was a clear attempt to have a divide and rule policy.        
	Indias plea for greater flexibility in protecting its industries, including small and medium units, has not found favour in the draft proposals for duty cuts.        
	The flexibility to cut duties, under the less-than-reciprocal clause, has been curtailed.         
	On the other hand, more leeway has been given to the developed nations.        
	The text clearly attempts to divide and rule the developing group of nations. There is a special set of rules for countries such as South Africa, Venezuela and Mexico, and clearly India and China seem to be targeted, Pillai said.        
	Industry, too, expressed its disappointment with the drafts.

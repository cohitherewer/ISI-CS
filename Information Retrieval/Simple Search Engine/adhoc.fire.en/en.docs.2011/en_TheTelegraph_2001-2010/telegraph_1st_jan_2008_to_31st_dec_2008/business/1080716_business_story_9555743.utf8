          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 15: Walden International Group, the US-based venture capital firm, today said it planned to increase its focus on emerging markets such as India.         
	Over the next 12 to 18 months, the company will invest $150 million in companies in India. We are looking at banking and financial services, education, healthcare and mobile telephony sectors, said Walden International chairman Lip-Bu Tan.        
	The company said it aimed to enhance its investment portfolio as well as its executive team in the country.         
	India is poised for phenomenal growth. The vibrancy and strong economic fundamentals of India as a country are key reasons for the reverse brain drain from around the world, especially the Silicon Valley, said Tan.        
	This situation provides the right mix of global managerial and entrepreneurial talent required for the vibrant local market to grow. This also presents us the opportune moment to invest in this fledgling market, slated for long term growth, he added.         
	Walden International currently manages assets of over $1.9 billion worldwide out of which $1.6 billion is invested across Asia and the US. The company has focussed on sectors such as education, banking and financial services, healthcare, telecom and media, IT, BPO and consumer Internet.         
	I am excited with my current role at Walden and the opportunities it presents. India offers phenomenal opportunity for growth. Our endeavour will be to cross-pollinate best practices from partner organisations across the globe to help build world class companies, in India, said Rajesh Subramanian on his appointment as managing director of Waldens India operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Uco finds ally for non-life insurance 
                            
	Calcutta, June 8 (PTI): Uco Bank will enter into a joint venture with the US-based Liberty to foray into the non-life insurance business during the current fiscal, a bank official said.        
	After the decision to enter the non-life insurance business, the bank was in talks with several foreign players such as Liberty, Engine of Italy and a few Japanese firms.         
	The negotiations were aimed at tying up with foreign partners, according to the regulations laid down by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, the bank official said. We have zeroed in on Liberty as the overseas partner, the official said.         
	While Uco Bank will have a minimum stake of 30 per cent in the joint venture, there will be another nationalised bank as a partner. The foreign company will hold a 26 per cent stake, according to the regulatory norms. The official, however, declined to divulge the name of the nationalised bank.         
	The bank would take at least three months to ink an agreement among the three partners. A subsidiary firm will then be formed, the official added.

	Uco Bank will raise Rs 325 crore in the form of perpetual preference cumulative shares during the last week of June. Although the bank has obtained the finance ministrys clearance to restructure its capital, it is awaiting the approval of the Union cabinet.        
	On getting the cabinet nod and depending upon the capital market conditions, Uco Bank will go for a follow-on public issue to raise Rs 450-500 crore from the market. We expect the market to improve by September, the official said.        
	After the follow-on offer, the government holding in the bank will come down to 54 per cent. The bank had approached the government for restructuring its capital. It wants to reduce its Rs 800-crore equity base to enhance the earnings per share.        
	On plans to enter the derivatives market, the official said considering the experience of other banks, it was not advisable to venture into this area.

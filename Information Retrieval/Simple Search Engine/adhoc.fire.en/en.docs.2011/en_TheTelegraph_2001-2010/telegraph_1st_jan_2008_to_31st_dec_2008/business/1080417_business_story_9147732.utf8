          A STAFF REPORTER                          Guha: Big plans                                  
	Calcutta, April 16: Rasna Private Limited is planning to enter the ready-to-drink beverage market next year.         
	The company is also planning to launch snack brand Toink, both in the Indian and international market.         
	We are looking at the ready-to-drink market. Plans are currently being finalised, and research and development is taking place to launch the brand in 2009, said Subhasish Guha, president and chief executive officer of Rasna Pvt Ltd.        
	Rasna is also keen on an energy drink.        
	The soft drink concentrate market is worth Rs 300 crore in the country, where Rasna has a market share of 96 per cent.        
	Soft drink concentrates are a cheaper alternative to fruit drinks. A 200ml of Rasnas recently launched Fruitplus costs Rs 3 compared with Rs 10-Rs 15 per 200ml of Frooti, Tropicana or Real.        
	Rasna is also looking at joint ventures abroad, especially markets in West Asia.        
	The company has a manufacturing and distribution arrangement with a local firm in Bangladesh and is looking for one in Saudi Arabia.

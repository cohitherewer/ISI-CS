The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance gas for Dabhol 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Reliance gas for Dabhol 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Green signal                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The beleaguered Dabhol power project will get a top priority in the allocation of natural gas from Reliance Industries Dhirubhai-6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	Reliance will sell gas for $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) from the prolific block to all consumers, the petroleum ministry said today.        
	It said Reliance would supply 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas to Ratnagiri Gas and Power Limited  which runs the Dabhol plant  between January and March 2009. The Mukesh Ambani firm would supply 2.7 mscmd between April and September 2009. This is subject to Reliance starting production from Dhirubhai-6 and within the overall allocation of 18 mscmd to power firms. The move may help in easing a power shortage in Maharshtra.        
	Earlier in May, the empowered group of ministers had said fertiliser makers would get priority in the supply of gas.        
	In addition to fertiliser firms, the petroleum ministry today said the Dabhol plant and power producers of Andhra Pradesh would be on the priority list.        
	Reliance will begin production from Dhirubhai-6 from January with an initial output of 5 mscmd. This will rise to 25 mscmd by March and 55 mscmd by July 2009.        
	Price factor        
	Analysts said the ministrys decision to fix the price of gas at $4.2 per mBtu would benefit Reliance.         
	The gas price has two components  a fixed value of $2.5 per mBtu and a variable portion of $1.7. The empowered group of ministers had linked the price to the crude oil price of $60 per barrel. It was decided that the gas price would not be changed if crude exceeded $60; if crude fell below $60, the ministers had left open the option of reducing the gas price.        
	We had expected the government to adjust the variable component with the fall in the crude price to below $50 a barrel. Since they (the government) have fixed $4.2 per mBtu for all consumers, when the crude prices are low, it appears to be beneficial to Reliance Industries, the analysts said.        
	The ministry said it would wait for a court verdict to decide on the price of gas to NTPC.        
	Power projects        
	Private power developers are keen to invest in new projects despite the global financial crisis, power secretary Anil Razdan said here today.        
	At the moment, the enthusiasm among the private power developers has not died down. We had a meeting with them and the response was encouraging, Razdan said.

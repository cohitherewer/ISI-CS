	Along with our current operation at Nanchang, we will build our business in China on a larger scale. We will have a product range going up to 125HP. The combined distribution network of our operations will give us a much larger presence in the market, he said.

	Id like to categorically state that we are not pursuing Hummer, Mahindra said, adding that the company was pursuing its own products, which are eco-friendly.        
	General Motors has decided to sell off the Hummer brand as the sales of the vehicle reported a sharp decline.

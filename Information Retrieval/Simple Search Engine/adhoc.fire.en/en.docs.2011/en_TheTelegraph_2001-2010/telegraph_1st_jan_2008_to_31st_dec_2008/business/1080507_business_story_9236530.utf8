The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude touches $122 per barrel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crude touches $122 per barrel
                                        
	London, May 6 (Reuters): Oil shot to a fresh record of over $122 a barrel today on supply worries and the weak dollar, extending a rally that has doubled prices over the past year and has some experts forecasting a potential spike to $200.        
	The US crude surged to $122.49 a barrel after touching a record $122.73 earlier. London Brent crude gained $2.50 to $120.49 a barrel, after hitting a record $120.99.        
	Supply disruptions in Nigeria, where a strike and attacks by militants has hit production, have helped boost a market that is nervous about any threats to supply.        
	Tensions with Iran racheted higher when the worlds fourth-biggest oil producer refused to accept intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme that the West fears could be linked to weapons.        
	Gold was also strong as oils advance helped spur a rebound from a four-month low last week. But gold is still some way below a record of $1,030.80 an ounce reached on March 17.        
	The downward move in oil last week now seems like only a correction, said Christopher Bellew, senior vice-president at Bache Commodities.        
	The effect of the credit crisis in the US is reducing peoples disposable incomes and youd expect this to have an impact on the oil price, but its not having any impact, Bellew added.        
	Demand from emerging markets such as India and China is more than compensating for the US downturn, he said. Oil prices further into the future have also risen sharply.        
	Oil has nearly doubled in the past year and is up by a quarter since the start of 2008 partly because of the problems in Nigeria and weakness in the dollar, which has boosted the price of commodities denominated in the US currency.        
	Last week, oil retreated almost $10 a barrel, partly because of a reduction in speculative positions and as strikes affecting Nigeria and the North Sea came to an end.        
	Exxon Mobil today said it had returned oil output in Nigeria to normal levels after an eight-day strike, but Shell said its production there was still down by about 164,000 barrels a day because of the recent militant attacks.

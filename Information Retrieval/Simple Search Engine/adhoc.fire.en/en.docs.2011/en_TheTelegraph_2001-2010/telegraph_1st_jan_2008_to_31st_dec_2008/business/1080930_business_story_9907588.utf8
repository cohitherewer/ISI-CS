The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Europe in bank rescue act
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Europe in bank rescue act
                            
	Brussels/Amsterdam, Sept. 29 (Reuters): European governments scrambled to shore up banks on Monday, carving up firms and committing billions of euros as the credit crisis tore through Germany, Britain, Belgium and beyond.        
	The moves came as a $700-billion bailout plan for US financial firms faced a vote by the House of Representatives on Monday and Citigroup said it would buy the bulk of fourth-largest US bank, Wachovia Corp.        
	Lawmakers hope to unfreeze global markets gripped by the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.        
	In the biggest European bank bailout since the credit crisis began, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments took a 49 per cent stake in Fortis with a 11.2-billion-euro ($16.4 billion) injection.        
	The rescue of Fortis, the biggest private employer in Belgium, followed emergency talks with European Central Bank (ECB) president Jean-Claude Trichet on Sunday. The bank employs 85,000 staff globally.        
	The question was whether Fortis would have survived on Monday, Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos told reporters. The firms chairman, Maurice Lippens, resigned.        
	The German government and a consortium of banks said they would provide 35 billion euros ($51.2 billion) in credit guarantees to lender Hypo Real Estate, whose shares plunged more than 60 per cent in morning trade.        
	The purpose of the whole operation is to allow an orderly winding down of Hypo Real Estate, a German finance ministry spokesperson said.        
	In Britain, the government was forced to buy up 50 billion of loans, mostly mortgages, held by Bradford amp; Bingley.         
	The government brokered a takeover of lender HBOS earlier this month and nationalised Northern Rock in February.        
	B amp;Bs 200 branches and deposit portfolio were bought up by Spains Santander for some 400 million.        
	Bank deals emerged in Russia and Denmark, too, while shares in Italys UniCredit, once Italys top bank, were suspended.        
	Iceland was also forced into action as emergency measures to cope with the credit crisis spread across Europe, forcing the government to take a 75 per cent stake in third-biggest bank Glitnir in a move that sent the Icelandic crown to a fresh record low against the euro.        
	World stock markets fell, with the MSCI main world equity index down 2 per cent to its weakest in more than a week. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top companies was down 3 per cent, while bank stocks shed 5.4 per cent.        
	Despite the ECBank injecting extra billions hoping to spur lending, banks continued to hoard cash but not lend, sending the interbank rate for borrowing euros for three months to a lifetime high.        
	The euro fell nearly 2 per cent at one point, while the dollar and safe-haven government bonds surged.        
	Fed action        
	The US Federal Reserve announced a $330-billion expansion of arrangements to boost dollar liquidity. The action increases the reciprocal swap lines with the ECB and eight other central banks to $620 billion from $290 billion previously.        
	They are throwing billions around, but things seem to be getting worse. They are throwing everything they can at the problem but nothing seems to be working, said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

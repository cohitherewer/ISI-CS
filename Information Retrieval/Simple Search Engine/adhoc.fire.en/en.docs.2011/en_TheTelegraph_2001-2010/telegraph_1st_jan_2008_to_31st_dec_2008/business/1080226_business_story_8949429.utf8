The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Montek for cut in fuel duty
                                                                                                               Montek for cut in fuel duty
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 25 (PTI): Days before the budget, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today made out a strong case for cut in taxes on petrol and diesel, while indicating a substantial increase in social sector allocations.        
	We have said in the integrated energy policy ... Please decide on a rational tax policy and once you have a rational tax policy in place, on a medium term basis, under-recoveries of petroleum companies are not feasible, he said.        
	According to him, consumers would have to bear the burden of increasing crude oil prices.         
	I think the consumer will ultimately have to bear the burden. Otherwise you kill your oil companies and I dont think the government wants to do that, Ahluwalia said, adding that he did not anticipate any easing of prices in the short run. So we have to live with the oil prices we have got, he said. World oil prices rose again to near $100-a-barrel in Asian trade today.        
	The government decided this month to partly pass on the burden to the consumer by raising petrol prices by Rs 2 and diesel prices by Re 1 per litre.

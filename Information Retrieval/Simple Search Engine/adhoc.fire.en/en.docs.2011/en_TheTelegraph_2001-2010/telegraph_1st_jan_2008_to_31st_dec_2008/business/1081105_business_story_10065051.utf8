          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The average asset under management of the 35 mutual funds has fallen below the Rs 4,50,000-crore mark in October, the first time in more than a year.         
	Assets fell more than 18 per cent to Rs 4,32,788 crore in October from Rs 5,30,155 crore in September, an erosion of Rs 97,367 crore.         
	While equity funds saw a sharp decline in the value of assets because of a steep fall in share prices last month, the liquidity crisis hit fixed income funds that witnessed large-scale redemption, said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer of Value Research Online.         
	At the end of September, income funds accounted for 51 per cent of the assets of the mutual fund industry.         
	Liquid and income funds together accounted for 65 per cent of the assets of mutual funds, while equity funds, balance funds and ELSS made up another 33 per cent.        
	The five largest fund houses  Reliance Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund  lost assets of over Rs 45,000 crore in October.         
	Reliance Mutual suffered the most with average assets under its management declining by Rs 15,400.75 crore in October from September.

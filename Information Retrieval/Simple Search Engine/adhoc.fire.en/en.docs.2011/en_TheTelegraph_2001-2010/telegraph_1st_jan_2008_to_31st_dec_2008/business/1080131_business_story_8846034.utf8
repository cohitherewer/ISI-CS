     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
           Damodaran: Economical
             
	Mumbai, Jan. 30: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today decided to scrap the amortisation of initial expenses in close-ended mutual funds. 
    
	This means funds will have to meet the sales, marketing and other related expenses associated with the distribution of close-ended funds from their entry load.
    
	Sebi also framed the final guidelines for securitised debts that would enable the public listing of such instruments on the stock exchanges.
    
	Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said, It has been our constant endeavour to make investments in mutual funds cheaper and maintain transparency. We have already done this with open-ended schemes and have got a positive response from the industry.
    
	He told reporters that this step should allow first-time investors to have clear knowledge about the position of their investments and the hidden expenses that were attached as distribution costs. 
    
	In April 2006, Sebi barred mutual funds from amortising initial expenses in open-ended schemes. 
    
	Till then, all funds  closed or open  could amortise 6 per cent of their collections from new fund offers as initial issue expenses. 
    
	In its norms on securitised debt, Sebi said the listing procedure would be done on the basis of market needs, cost of transactions, disclosures and professional expertise of credit rating agencies. 
    
	An issuer of a securitised debt will be called a trust, and all the trustees will have to be registered with Sebi.
    
	The regulations allow for securitisation of both existing as well as future receivables. In public issues of debt papers, a listing is compulsory, Sebi said. 
    
	On disclosures, Damo-daran said entities that were already listed publicly and wanted to issue debt instruments, would have to make minimum revelations.
    
	Detailed disclosures were necessary for firms which were not listed.

	New Delhi, April 28: Banking solutions provider Nucleus Software plans to invest around Rs 28-30 crore in the current fiscal to set up a development centre and come up with new software products.        
	We are planning to invest around 8-10 per cent of our revenues from financial year 2007-08, which is around Rs 288 crore, to develop new products and set up a development centre in Jaipur, Vishnu R. Dusad, CEO and managing director of Nucleus Software Exports Ltd, told The Telegraph.        
	The Delhi-based company, which offers products and solutions for the banking and financial services industry, will invest Rs 20 crore in the next one year to set up a 17-acre development centre at a special economic zone in Jaipur.         
	We will also launch an upgraded version of our flagship product FinnOne by early 2009, said Dusad.         
	The company is banking on internal accruals to fund its expansion plans.         
	Nucleus also plans to increase its headcount to 2,500 in the current fiscal from 1,936 in March end. The 1,000-seater Jaipur facility will be operational in the first quarter of next financial year, said Dusad.         
	Nucleus has three product development centres in Singapore, Noida and Chennai.        
	The company expects a strong demand for its FinnOne product from Southeast Asia, West East, Africa, Europe, Australia and Japan. Almost 50 per cent of the companys business comes from Japan and the rest from India, the US, West Asia and Africa.        
	Banks and financial institutions are looking at increased operational efficiency in their lending business through automated solutions ... this is where products like FinnOne come into the picture, said Dusad. The FinnOne banking software provides automated services such as loan origination system, lending and collections.        
	The IT company reported an 11.95 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 61.74 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008, compared with Rs 55.15 crore in the previous year.        
	Consolidated revenue rose 30.5 per cent to Rs 288.72 crore against Rs 221.19 crore a year ago. The company has also recommended a final dividend of 30 per cent, that is Rs 3 apiece, on post-bonus capital.

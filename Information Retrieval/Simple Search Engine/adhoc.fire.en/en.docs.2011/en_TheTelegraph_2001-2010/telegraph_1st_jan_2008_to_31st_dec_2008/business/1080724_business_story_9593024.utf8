                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stocks gain confidence, rupee rises
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 23: Stock markets today broke into a jig and pushed the sensex up by 838 points, bringing the Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether within a sniffing distance of the 15000 -mark.        
	Not to be outdone, the rupee jumped 64 paise against the dollar to end at a two- month high of Rs 42.10.        
	The markets were ecstatic over the trust vote verdict and were hoping for the government to dish out a wide range of reform measures, now that the Left is out of the picture in policy-making.        
	Observers feel the signs are now of a strong run on the bourses  political uncertainty was over, crude oil prices continued to dip, while global stock markets were on the rise.        
	For the sensex, which closed at 14942.28, the 838-point gain was its biggest since March 25.        
	Though analysts expected a rally, the extent of the rise in shares surprised many.         
	Buying was witnessed virtually across the board, with banking and few equipment makers hogging the limelight.        
	Bank shares attracted heavy buying as the segment is likely to gain the most from reforms. While ICICI Bank spurted 11.6 per cent to Rs 738.25, HDFC Bank gained nearly 10 per cent to Rs 1,205.75. The ripple effect was also felt in public sector banks resulting in the BSE Bankex leading the sectoral indices with a gain of nearly 10 per cent.        
	The sensex opened strong at 14568.22 and consolidated its gains as the day progressed. After hitting an intra-day high of 14979.90, it settled at 14942.28.        
	The government will now have an opportunity to pursue stalled reforms, given the departure of the Left parties. We expect a number of administrative reforms to accelerate, such as the divestment of government stakes in public sector companies. The government may also propose contentious bills for Parliamentary approval, including pensions, insurance and banking, Tushar Poddar, vice-president Asia Economic Research, Goldman Sachs, said in a note today.        
	However, there are experts who feel that stocks can also face certain risks in the days ahead, including high inflation and the possibility of the Reserve Bank of India raising interest rates again on July 29.         
	Some analysts feel the government may not bring about major reforms.        
	The room for tough reforms is likely to be limited. With elections no more than 10 months away, there is an inevitable propensity in any administration to lean towards populist policy decisions rather than tough and potentially unpopular measures, Sonal Varma, economist at Lehman Brothers said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ruia pockets UK auto parts maker
          SAMBIT SAHA                                          
	Calcutta, July 6: Takeover tycoon Pawan K. Ruia may have made his biggest catch.        
	The city-based businessman, who shot to prominence when he bought the Dunlop tyre company in India from the Chhabrias, has now bought a British auto-component maker, which has Bentley and BMW among its customers.         
	Global Finvest Ltd, a special purpose vehicle based in the UK and owned by the Ruia group, has acquired Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems UK Ltd for an undisclosed sum.         
	The Coalville, Leicestershire-based company has around 500 people on its rolls. After the acquisition by Ruia, the company has reverted to its original name  Schlegel Automotive Europe Ltd.         
	Ruia completed the acquisition in just three weeks  one of the fastest in recent times  but had kept it under wraps.         
	A formal announcement by the group is expected soon, with the management of the UK firm likely to come down in Calcutta.         
	Founded in 1952, Schlegel is the second largest supplier of rubber-based sealing systems to original equipment manufacturers and suppliers in the UK. Its products are used in the doors, windows, hoods (bonnets), trunks (boots) and sunroofs of cars.         
	Apart from Bentley and BMW, the company also supplies to Land Rover, Jaguar, Renault, Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan.         
	Schlegel had posted a turnover of Rs 275 crore and a minor profit last year. But the Ruia group sees immense possibility in expanding Schlegels business over the next two to three years.         
	The Indian market holds tremendous potential for the company. Information trickling in suggests that the group is already charting a development plan to grow Schlegels Europe business as well as bring the company to India .         
	Most of the passenger and commercial vehicle makers Schlegel supplies to have either set up base in India or will do so soon. There is a ready market for the products, sources said.         
	The Ruia group, which had acquired Dunlop and Falcon Tyres at the end of 2005, also expects the latest acquisition to provide synergy to its existing operations.         
	Rubber is the key raw material for tyre as well as for the sealing systems manufactured by Schlegel. The group can save on input cost by adopting a joint procurement strategy.         
	Schlegel also owns the now defunct British Tyre amp; Rubber Company, which was the owner of Dunlop. British Tyre amp; Rubber had sold Dunlop in different countries as separate entities.        
	In deference to the Dunlop brand, which he owns in India, Ruia has decided to keep the defunct company.         
	He also plans to reorganise the workforce at the plant, which is based centrally in the UK. The manufacturing site is located over a 17.8-acre plot, but the factory takes up only 5.5 acres.         
	It is learnt that Ruia has already visited the plant and addressed the workforce. The new owner has the support of the union, which will be crucial if Ruia plans to redeploy the workforce since the present operation does not require 500 people.         
	Schlegel is the second overseas acquisition of the Ruia group, which has interests in tyre, engineering (Jessop amp; Co) and sugar, after it bought electronics maker Industronics Berhad of Malaysia in 2007.

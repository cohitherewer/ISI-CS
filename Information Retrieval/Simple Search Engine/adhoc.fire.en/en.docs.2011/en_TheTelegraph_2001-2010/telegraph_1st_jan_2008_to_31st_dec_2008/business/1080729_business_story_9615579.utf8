	New Delhi, July 28: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, which posted a 44 per cent jump in profit in the first quarter of the current fiscal, plans to foray into uranium mining to take advantage of opportunities arising from the India-US civilian nuclear deal.        
	The companys net profit rose to Rs 6,636 crore in the first quarter of 2008-09 from Rs 4,611 crore a year ago.        
	The company had to bear a subsidy payout of Rs 9,811 crore, almost a three-fold increase from Rs 3,649 crore during the April-June quarter last year.         
	Gross realisation on crude oil was $125.85 per barrel but net realisation stood at $69.14 per barrel after taking into account the subsidy payout.        
	ONGC has earmarked Rs 18,000 crore in the current financial year to increase its capacity and meet the energy needs of the country, company chairman R.S. Sharma said.        
	The board has approved the proposed memorandum of understanding with Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL) for the exploration of the mineral in India and abroad. The collaboration will leverage ONGCs expertise in the exploration of hydrocarbons.

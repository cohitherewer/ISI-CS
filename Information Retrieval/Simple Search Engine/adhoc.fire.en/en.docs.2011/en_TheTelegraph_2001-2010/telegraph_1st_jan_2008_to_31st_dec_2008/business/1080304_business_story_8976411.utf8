The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MRTPC check on cement price hike
                                                                                                               MRTPC check on cement price hike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Softening up        
	New Delhi, March 3: The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) today issued notices to nine cement firms, including ACC, Lafarge and AV Birla groups Grasim, for raising prices by forming a cartel.        
	Besides the three, the others in the line of fire are Parisim Cement, Larsen and Toubro, Satna Cement, Jaypee Cement, Diamond Cement and Maihar Cement.        
	The director general of investigations and registration  the investigative arm of the MRTPC  found that the producers, through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA), acted in concert to raise prices in Jabalpur.        
	The commission also slammed the lobby group CMA, after finding the association guilty of price rigging. It said, The CMA provided a common platform to these manufacturers for the purpose.        
	However, the CMA denied the existence of the cartel. A cement manufacturing company official said an informal exchange of prices among cement companies could not be construed as price fixing.        
	This move by the commission is one among a series of measures taken by the government and the commission to rein in cement prices.        
	In its order, the commission asked the manufacturers to desist from such practices, while letting off another major manufacturer, Gujarat Ambuja Cements.         
	Issuing a cease and desist order to the erring manufacturers, the commission asked them to refrain from indulging in any sort of arrangement through the instrumentality of the CMA or otherwise fixing the selling price of the cement in the market.         
	It said there were ample evidences to show that the prices in December 2000 and January 2001 were Rs 30 more than the rates in November 2000.        
	Rejecting the CMA and the producers contention, the commission said, Cartels need not to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. If the material on record indicates that in all probability prices were raised simultaneously in concert, the inference of such companies forming a cartel could be easily drawn.

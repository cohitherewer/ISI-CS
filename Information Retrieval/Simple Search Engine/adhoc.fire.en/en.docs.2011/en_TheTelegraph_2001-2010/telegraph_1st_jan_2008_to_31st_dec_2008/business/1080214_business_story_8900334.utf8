          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: A search committee set up to find a successor to Sebi chairman M. Damodaran has shortlisted two names  U. K. Sinha, former joint secretary of the finance ministrys capital markets division and now the head of UTI Asset Management Company, and C. B. Bhave, who heads National Stock Depository Ltd.        
	If the government does not agree with either of these two names, Damodaran will be considered for an extension.        
	Though Damodaran did not appear for an interaction with the search committee last month, officials said his name was being considered for a six- month extension.        
	Damodaran was grilled yesterday by the standing committee on finance on the stock market imbroglio.         
	With questions being asked about the stock market crash and the way high-priced IPOs were cleared, Damodaran may not finally get the extension.         
	Many think that the current Sebi chiefs style is too ponderous. Sinha, on the other hand, is considered to be more suitable for the job. He is seen as a conservative, who, with his experience in a giant state-run mutual fund, will be better able to manage the volatile stock markets.         
	The search committee, which is headed by cabinet secretary K. Chandrashekhar and has finance secretary Subba Rao and financial markets secretary A. Ramanathan as members, is believed to have submitted the two names to the government.         
	Others who have been in the race include Jamini Bhagwati, an IFS officer who has also been joint secretary (capital markets), and Canara Bank chief M.B.N. Rao.         
	Commenting on the selection of the new Sebi chief and his possible extension, Damodaran had recently told journalists that he was not a job seeker. He even quoted Q. Humphry to say, I have never refused any job that I have not been offered.        
	Damodaran had recently taken steps to check the inflow of foreign funds through participatory notes, which analysts consider as non-transparent.

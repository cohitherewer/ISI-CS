The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AOL unit comes under the Aegis of Essar 
                                                                                                               AOL unit comes under the Aegis of Essar 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 31: Aegis BPO Services, an Essar group company, has entered into an agreement to acquire AOLs call centre in Bangalore, which has 1,000 employees.        
	Though the company refused to reveal the financial details of the transaction, market sources believe the deal can be in the $100-million-plus bracket.        
	AOL wanted to get out of its non-core businesses in India and for us it makes sense since we are getting a prestigious client like AOL, Aparup Sengupta, managing director and CEO of Aegis, told The Telegraph.         
	This centre was AOLs No.1 in terms of operational excellence, Sengupta added.         
	Under the agreement, Aegis will provide customer service and technical support to AOL customers. The acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of April, will enable Aegis to enhance its voice and non-voice offerings in the technology support space.         
	Aegis can now demonstrate its customer management for a renowned American brand. This will also enable Aegis to extend its horizontal services in similar areas for a new set of clients, Sengupta said.         
	Research firm Forrester has forecast that many Indian call centres and software development subsidiaries of multinational companies will sell out as it is now more cost effective for foreign companies to outsource to a service provider than run its own operations.         
	The valuation of call centres is done by a different method now. Previously, it was based on a per seat, per hour basis, which was more an output-based pricing. However, now a percentage of total savings that a centre makes for the parent company is considered as part of the valuation. Hence, its a more output-based pricing, which is lower than the input-based valuation, an industry analyst said while explaining the reason behind the lower valuations.        
	According to reports, AOLs decision to sell its Indian call centre is linked to the companys plan to withdraw from the Internet access business, and instead emphasise on its Web section, as it needs less staff support.        
	This is a historic moment for Aegis that catapults us to a new level of competence, especially in the tech support area, covering both voice and non-voice processes, said Maneesh Dhir, executive vice-president of AOL International.

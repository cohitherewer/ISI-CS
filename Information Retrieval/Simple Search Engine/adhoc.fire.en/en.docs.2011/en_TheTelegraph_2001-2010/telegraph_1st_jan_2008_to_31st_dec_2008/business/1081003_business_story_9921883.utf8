          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Healthy signs                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 2: The bravehearts are back. Close to 10 months after the bottom fell out of the market for maiden flotations, a couple of companies are looking to test the waters.         
	Two companies  Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd and Mahindra Holidays amp; Resorts India Ltd (MHRIL)  have submitted their plans to the capital market regulator seeking approvals to come out with their first public issues.         
	The submission of a draft red herring prospectus  a document that provides details about the promoters, the project and the risk factors but often doesnt spell out the number of shares to be floated or the issue price  is the first step companies take when they prepare for a stock flotation. The price is determined later through a bookbuilding process where investors indicate how much they are ready to pay for the stock after the company sets a price band.         
	The timing is a little odd. The stock markets have been badly roiled by the turbulence in the global financial markets over the past few months. Over the past week, the stock indices have rallied a little though mavens remain sceptical about the markets ability to remain firm.         
	Gujarat Pipavav Port  the developer and operator of Indias first private sector port  filed plans for an initial public offering (IPO) that sought to raise Rs 500 crore.         
	MHRIL, part of the Mahindra group, resubmitted on Tuesday its IPO draft papers with the regulator. The company plans to sell 9.2 million shares through a book-built issue.         
	The fate of new issues is closely linked to the secondary markets, which have been caught in a massive bear hug this year. As a result, several companies have scrapped plans for new issues after securing approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.         
	Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database says 30 companies allowed their issues to lapse this year. The list includes big names such as Jaiprakash Ventures, Reliance Infratel, UTI Asset Management and Acme Telepower.         
	Experts say it is too early to say whether companies, which had secured approvals earlier, will revive their issue plans.         
	They (MHRIL and Gujarat Pipavav Port) must have filed the documents in the hope that the markets would revive in two to three months, Haldea said.

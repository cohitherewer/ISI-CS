          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 7: The government plans to cut customs duty on steel, consider demands for lower freight charges from mining companies, and import cement from Pakistan as part of its efforts to combat inflation. It may even import more foodgrains, if necessary.        
	Steel prices are a matter of concern. I have suggested that import duties be lowered or export duty be imposed to ensure availability of steel for all, minister of state for steel Jitin Prasada said.        
	Steel prices have gone up 55 per cent globally and 25-30 per cent in India in the last three months. This has led to demands for a regulator, a call to abolish import duty on steel, an imposition of a 10 per cent export duty on the alloy, withdrawal of duty entitlement pass book scheme benefits and reclassification of steel as an essential commodity.        
	The mining industry, reacting to the hike in freight rates by the railways, has demanded a long-term freight policy so that miners can stabilise their prices.        
	Any kind of increase in logistic cost is unjustified as it will result in an increase in the of cost of steel, which will further lead to inflationary pressure, the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the apex body of Indian miners, said in a letter to the Railway Board.        
	We are looking at importing more cement from Pakistan through the north-western border. We are watching the situation very carefully, Ajay Shankar, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, said.        
	Capacity expansion is taking place and we expect the demand-supply situation to balance this year, he said, referring to the plan to increase cement capacity by 118 million tonnes over the next four years to touch 298 million tonnes.        
	The miners demand comes within days of reports of a 46 per cent rise in iron ore prices. The mineral sector has contributed 38.2 per cent to the rise in inflation to 7 per cent.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said the government was not averse to importing farm commodities if the situation warranted.         
	He said the government did not want a situation where it would have to import agricultural commodities but added it would not hesitate (to import) when it came to protecting consumers interest.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Bitter Pill		    
	Mumbai, May 28: Taro Pharmaceuticals of Israel today terminated its merger agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries.        
	Last year, Sun Pharma had agreed to acquire Taro Pharma, a generic drug manufacturer, in an all-cash deal worth $ 455 million. Sun Pharma currently has a 34.4 per cent stake in Taro.         
	Taro today announced that its board of directors unanimously voted to terminate the merger agreement with Aditya Acquisition Company Ltd, a subsidiary of Sun Pharma, which it had entered last May.        
	The agreement provided for the acquisition of Taro by Sun for $7.75 per share and allowed either party to terminate the agreement after December 31, 2007.        
	Sources said though Sun Pharma had offered to raise the merger price to $10.25 per share, Taro wanted more and this led the Israeli company to terminate the merger agreement.        
	The board determined that the merger agreement had become stale and does not reflect the dramatic operational and financial turnaround that the company has achieved since last year, the future value that the company expects to achieve from the changes made in its business model and the value in its new product pipeline, Taro explained in a detailed press statement.        
	Pointing out that permitting the agreement to remain in force is no longer in the best interest of the company, Taro also said that certain operational constraints in the merger agreement were also interfering with its ability to manage its business for the benefit of all its stakeholders.        
	Sun Pharma offered to raise the merger price to $10.25 per share, but it predicated this offer on the elimination of a voting threshold required by Israeli law to implement the merger, details of which were not provided by Taro.        
	In a letter Taro chief Barrie Levitt told Sun Pharma chairman Dilip Shanghvi that its efforts over several months to negotiate a revised merger agreement acceptable to both companies had been rejected by Sun, which refused to consider a price above $10.25.        
	Sun is unwilling to permit its investment bankers to meet Taros investment bankers to discuss valuation and attempt to resolve the parties differences, the letter said.        
	Taro indicated that it was open to consider transactions with third parties that reflect the companys present operational financial strength.

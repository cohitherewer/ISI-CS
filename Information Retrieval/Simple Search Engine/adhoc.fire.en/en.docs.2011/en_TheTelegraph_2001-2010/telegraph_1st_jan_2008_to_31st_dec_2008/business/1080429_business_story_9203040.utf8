          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Protecting purses                                  
	New Delhi, April 28: The Manmohan Singh government is unlikely to increase prices of petrol and diesel, though global crude rates have touched an all-time high of nearly $120 a barrel.        
	Senior officials said that the government was not planning to pass on the crude price hike to consumers because it would reinforce inflationary trends.         
	The Congress-led coalition faces assembly polls in several states this year and general elections next year. Keeping inflation under check is an important goal ahead of the polls. Higher crude prices also led to the rupee falling by as much as 0.1 per cent to Rs 40.16 per dollar from Rs 40.12 on Friday.        
	India imports more than two-thirds of its oil, and refiners usually increase their dollar purchases at the end of each month to meet import commitments.        
	However, there are indications that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), concerned about runaway inflation, may allow the rupee to appreciate against the dollar to lower the prices of imports.        
	In its quarterly assessment of the economy ahead of the monetary policy tomorrow, the RBI said that the price of the Indian basket of crude had increased almost 76 per cent to $99.3 a barrel in March 2008 from $56.6 a barrel in February 2007.        
	The increase in the Indian basket of crude will cost oil companies a daily loss of about Rs 500 crore, officials said.         
	Only 42.7 per cent of the loss are met through the issue of oil bonds by the government, while one-third of the deficit is met by upstream firms such as ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India) Limited.

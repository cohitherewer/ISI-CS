          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 10: Bajaj Auto Ltd, the countrys second largest two-wheeler manufacturer, today reported a 4.37 per cent decline in net profit for the first quarter of the current year ended June 30. Net profit came down to Rs 175 crore from Rs 183 crore in the same period last year.        
	At a time when automobile manufacturers have been facing challenging times on account of high interest rates, Bajaj Auto saw its turnover rise to Rs 2,340 crore in the first quarter from Rs 2,142 crore last year.         
	Two wheeler sales rose 12 per cent to 5,61,977 units from 5,00,255 units a year ago, an increase of 12 per cent. Three-wheeler sales fell 19 per cent during the quarter.        
	Exports also showed a strong growth rate of 33 per cent, rising to 1,98,717 units from 1,49,804 units a year ago.        
	Bajaj Auto said that rising interest rates and a lack of finance options continued to restrain industry growth. Maximum growth was in the 125cc+ category of bikes, where Bajaj grew 21 per cent against industry growth of 14 per cent.         
	In this category, Bajaj Auto maintained its market leadership with a share of around 50 per cent.

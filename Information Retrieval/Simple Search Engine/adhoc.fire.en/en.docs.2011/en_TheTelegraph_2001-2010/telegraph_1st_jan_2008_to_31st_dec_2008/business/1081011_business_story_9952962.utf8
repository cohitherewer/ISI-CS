                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Panic grips world markets
                                          
	New York/London, Oct. 10 (Reuters): US stocks plunged in early Friday trading in line with markets in Europe and Asia as investors pinned hopes on an imminent G7 finance ministers meeting in Washington for a further policy response to the deepening global credit crisis.        
	The MSCI world equity index fell more than 4 per cent at one point to a five-year low, losing a fifth of its value this month alone. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8 per cent minutes after the opening bell and the S amp;P 500 was off more than 7 per cent.         
	Japans Nikkei sank 9.6 per cent, while the major indices in Europe traded down more than 8 per cent.        
	Equity trading in Russia, Iceland, Romania, Ukraine and Indonesia had to be halted, while nearly half the stocks in Milan were suspended for excessive losses.        
	Coordinated rate cut moves, so far, have failed to relieve investor fears that the freeze in credit markets will damage banks further and provoke a deep recession around the world.

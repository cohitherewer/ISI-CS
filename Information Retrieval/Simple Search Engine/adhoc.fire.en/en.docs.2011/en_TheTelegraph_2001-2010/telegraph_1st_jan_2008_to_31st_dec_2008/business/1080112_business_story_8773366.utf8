	New Delhi, Jan. 11: The Dhoom bike  Hayabusa  that caught the imagination of movie aficionados will hit the Indian road as early as September.
    
	Suzuki Motorcycle Indias 1,340-cc Hayabusa will be imported by July-end.
    
	Company officials said the bike, which actor John Abraham rode in the Bollywood blockbuster Dhoom, would be priced at around Rs 8 lakh. 
    
	In the international market, the bike is priced at $10,000 (Rs 4 lakh) but will cost more here because of import duties.
    
	Vice-president Atul Gupta said the company also planned to launch the GS500, GSR600 and RMZ-450 from its international stable in India. The company displayed a few models of its 1,300-cc Hayabusa at the ninth Auto Expo.
    
	These big bikes are really a fashion statement and they do not compete with other motorcycles. They are not good business proposition bikes, but they set the benchmarks for brand building for the company, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.
    
	For those who swear by power and performance, the Hayabusa, with its four-stroke engine and four cylinders, could be the first choice. 
    
	The bike has an overall length of 2,195mm, width of 740mm and height of 1,170mm. With a wide wheelbase of 1,485 mm, it will have great speed along with good manoeuvrability to take sharp turns.
    
	The government recently relaxed import norms for all bikes of over 800cc. 
    
	Company officials said the change in government norms had boosted their confidence.
    
	Since it is a premium bike, import will be on the basis of bookings only.

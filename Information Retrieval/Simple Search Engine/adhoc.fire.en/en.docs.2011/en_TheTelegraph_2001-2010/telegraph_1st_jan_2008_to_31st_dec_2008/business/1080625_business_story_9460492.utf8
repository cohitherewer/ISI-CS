          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nigel E. Wark in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, June 24: Ford India plans to increase its sourcing of local components to 90 per cent once the engine manufacturing facility in Chennai takes off.        
	Earlier, Ford had announced an investment of $500 million for its capacity expansion and the launch of small cars in India.        
	We think component suppliers from India are very competent and we have a very capable supplier base. The Chennai facility will have a capacity of 250,000 engines once the plant is up and running by 2010, said Nigel E. Wark, executive director (marketing, sales and services) of Ford India.        
	Wark was in the city to launch the new version of the Ford Fiesta.        
	The auto major, which has already increased the price of its SUV Ford Endeavour by around Rs 30,000 after the government imposed excise duty on models above 1500cc and 2000cc, will review the prices of the new Fiesta after the 90-day introductory offer towards the end of the September.        
	The price of the new Fiesta starts at Rs 6.27 lakh for the petrol version and Rs 7.10 lakh onwards for the turbo-diesel models.        
	On small car plans, Wark said the Ford model would not compete with the Nano.        
	We welcome the Nano and it will prompt manufacturers to review the scenario because it would change the dynamics of the market. Our model is not looking at the Rs 1-2 lakh segment, he said.        
	On Fords plans to make India an export hub, Wark said it was very much on the future agenda of the auto maker.        
	Fords India sales fell 19 per cent to 33,880 vehicles during the fiscal ending March 31, 2008. In the first five months of this year, the company sold 12,800 units.

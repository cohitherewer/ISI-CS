	Calcutta, May 18: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has decided to focus more on selling traditional products than unit-linked plans (Ulips).        
	Our current product portfolio is highly skewed in favour of Ulips. At present, 82 per cent to 83 per cent of our business from new policy sales comes from Ulips. We want to bring this down to 70 per cent by shifting to conventional plans, said LIC managing director D.K. Mehrotra.        
	The No.1 life insurer in the country, which enjoys a more than 57 per cent market share in new business premium, has witnessed a significant slowdown in premium income.         
	The LICs premium income from new policy sales in 2007-08 grew only 5.8 per cent to Rs 59,182.20 crore.        
	People were wary of buying Ulips because of the volatility in the stock markets in 2007-08, particularly in the last quarter. As a result, our new policy sales in terms of Ulips grew at a very slow pace. Moreover, the premium size in a Ulip is on an average much higher than in a conventional plan. Both these factors brought down our business from new policy sales, Mehrotra said.         
	The number of individual, non-single premium policies sold by the LIC in 2007-08 was lower at 3,00,59,686 compared with 3,21,43,891 in 2006-07.        
	The insurer, however, is planning to launch four to five plans, both conventional and unit-linked, during this fiscal.         
	We have already submitted proposals for two to three plans with the insurance regulator. These will be pension and other individual products, Mehrotra said.         
	Among group products, the LIC will launch two unit-linked gratuity plans.         
	The company is also planning to launch a few standalone health insurance plans.         
	The insurer had launched its first standalone, unit-linked health insurance plan in February this year.         
	We sold more than one lakh policies of this plan until March, entailing a premium income of Rs 100 crore, the LIC managing director said.         
	He, however, admitted that after a directive from the Central Board of Direct Taxes, buyers of the unit-linked health insurance would not get the tax benefit under Section 80D of the income tax act on the entire premium amount.

	New Delhi, June 26 (PTI): A day ahead of the release of official data, finance minister P. Chidambaram today said double digit inflation would be there for some more weeks and the government as well as the Reserve Bank of India would not hesitate to take more steps to rein in soaring prices.        
	It (inflation) will remain in double digits for some more weeks, Chidambaram said.        
	He admitted that the UPA might be on the defensive over high inflation in elections. We will be on defensive on inflation, but as I have said politics is all about communication. We must communicate to the people why prices are high and the efforts we are taking to moderate it.        
	The finance minister also ruled out any further hike in fuel prices. He said it was only the oil prices that had catapulted inflation to 11.05 per cent for the first week of June from 8.75 a week ago.

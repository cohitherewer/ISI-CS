     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                      
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The government today allotted more spectrum to some existing telecom operators and issued letters of intent (LoIs) to many new firms to start telecom service.
    
	Those who received LoIs today would get spectrum only after the existing operators.
    
	The spectrum is for GSM services, and among those to get radio waves is Reliance Communications (R-Com), which now offers CDMA service.
    
	Telecom minister A. Raja, who signed the order for the approvals today, also gave three GSM players  Idea Cellular, Vodafone Essar and Aircel  start-up spectrum for mobile services in some circles. 
    
	Their applications had been pending since December 2006.
    
	The department of telecom (DoT) today issued LoIs to nine applicants, including Unitech, Shyam Telelink, Datacom Solutions, Shipping Stop Dot Com of the Ruias, and S Tel. 
    
	All the five have got LoIs for 22 circles, meaning they will have a pan-India footprint.
    
	Start-up spectrum would be first granted to the three existing GSM players and then to R-Com, said officials of the DoT. 
    
	Idea has been waiting for spectrum for two circles, Vodafone Essar for six and Aircel for 14. 
    
	Todays move ends the ban on the issue of spectrum, in effect since November.
    
	LoIs were also given to Idea Cellular for nine circles, Swan Communications, promoted by R-Com, for 14 and Tata Teleservices for three.
    
	Spice Telecom was given LoIs for only four circles because of its inability to meet net worth requirements to qualify as a pan-India player, said the officials. 
    
	Spice, which operates in two circles, Punjab and Karnataka, had applied for all the remaining 20 circles. 
    
	The officials said the applications of ByCell and Indiabulls-promoted Selena Infrastructure were put on hold as they required approvals from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. 
    
	The DoT rejected the applications of CDMA player HFCL, real estate firm Parsvnath Developers and Allianz Infratech, which is promoted by SpiceJets Ajay Singh.
    
	Each company, after getting the LoI, will be given 15 days to pay Rs 1,650 crore as a pan-India licence fee. The payment is less if an entity has applied for some circles.
    
	Spectrum would be awarded according to the order in which the companies make payments, the officials said. 
    
	On paying the licence fee, the companies will have to apply to the wireless and planning co-ordination wing of the DoT for a wireless licence. 
    
	This wireless licence, which grants companies the authority to provide mobile services, would be given on a first come, first served basis, the officials said.
    
	Each licence holder is entitled to 4.4 MHz of GSM spectrum and 2.5 MHz of CDMA spectrum per circle, subject to availability.
    
	The officials said the DoT had over 60 MHz of spectrum for new operators after meeting the demands of the existing GSM players and R-Com. 
    
	Tatas into GSM
    
	The DoT has given in-principle approval to two Tata group firms for starting GSM service across the country.
    
	The applications of Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd have been approved for providing GSM services under new dual technology norms, sources said.
    
	Both the companies offer mobile services under the CDMA platform. 
    
	While Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd operates in Maharashtra, the other entity provides the service in the rest of the country.
    
	The two firms had sought approval late last year from the DoT after the department allowed companies to offer mobile services under dual technology norms.

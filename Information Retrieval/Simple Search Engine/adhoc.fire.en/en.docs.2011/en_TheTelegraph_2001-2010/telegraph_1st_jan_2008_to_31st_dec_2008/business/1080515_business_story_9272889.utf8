The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti bid to block rival MTN bids
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bharti bid to block rival MTN bids
          JAYATI GHOSE AMP; SIMI KAMBOJ                           Mittal: Upbeat                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, May 14: Negotiations between telecom firms Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN group to create a combined entity are proceeding at a brisk pace.         
	Led by chairman Sunil Mittal, the top management of Delhi-based Bharti Airtel met MTN group president and CEO Phuthuma Nhleko in London this afternoon. The duo are also working on a non-disclosure agreement that is likely to be signed within the next 10 days.        
	A non-disclosure agreement will precede a due diligence which, sources said, was likely to take around three months.         
	The agreement is aimed at preventing other firms from gaining information on the bid. The firms may use the information to make their own takeover bid for MTN.         
	Bharti wants to complete its due diligence to arrive at a fair market value before it approaches the Johannesburg-listed MTN with a final offer.        
	It is now felt that both the sides are pushing for a merger, and Bharti can issue shares worth $25 billion to the MTN shareholders, while the rest of the amount of around $20 billion will be paid in cash raised through debt and internal accruals.        
	Sources said Mittal along with joint managing director Akhil Gupta met Nhleko in London this afternoon. Rob Nesbitt, the MTN group chief financial officer, and bankers from Standard Chartered, who are advising Bharti Airtel, were also present at the meeting.        
	Mittal is learnt to have chartered an aircraft for three months for his frequent trips abroad for holding talks with the MTN leadership until the deal is through.        
	Yesterday, Bharti said it did not need to submit a bid to acquire a stake in MTN, indicating that it was looking for a merger with the African telecom major.        
	If the merger is finalised, the final shareholding structure of the merged entity could see Bharti and Singtel which holds around 30 per cent in Bharti  together holding about 34 per cent, some big shareholders of MTN holding 36 per cent, while the rest would be with the public, another source said.

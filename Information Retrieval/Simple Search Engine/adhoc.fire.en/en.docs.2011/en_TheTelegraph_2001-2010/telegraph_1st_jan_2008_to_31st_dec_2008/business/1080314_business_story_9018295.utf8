The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mediclaim relief for seniors
                                                                                                               Mediclaim relief for seniors
          A STAFF REPORTER                          HELP AT HAND                                  
	Calcutta, March 13: The insurance regulator has asked public sector general insurers not to increase the renewal premium for mediclaim to senior citizens by more than 75 per cent.         
	Also, insurers cannot force existing policyholders more than 60 years of age to migrate to other health insurance products.         
	In a notification, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) said, The authority had received several complaints from senior citizens that renewal premiums charged to them were exorbitant.         
	The authority, therefore, advised all public sector general insurance companies that the loading of premiums (if justified for renewals) of mediclaim policies issued to senior citizens shall not exceed 50 to 75 per cent of the premium charged prior to the revision, the notification stated.        
	State-owned general insurance companies had revised upwards their premiums for mediclaim to senior citizens from the beginning of the current financial year.         
	Irda also said senior citizens should not be compelled by the insurance companies to migrate to other health insurance products, if they were to the disadvantage of senior citizens.        
	However, the above instructions are for renewals only. This means insurers can charge a higher premium from a senior citizen buying a mediclaim policy for the first time.         
	From October 2006, state-owned insurers, led by Oriental Insurance, had jacked up the premium even for existing policyholders who were above 30 years. For policyholders aged above 55, the increase was more than 100 per cent.         
	Insurance companies argued that the claim ratio was highest in the above-55 age bracket. There was no increase in the premium rates during the preceding 10 years, though medical costs had gone up at a compounded annual growth rate of 10 per cent, said a senior official at National Insurance Company.

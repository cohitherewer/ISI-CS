	Calcutta, April 20: Mikuni Corporation of Japan has decided to exit from its Chennai-based auto ancillary joint venture with Carburettors  Ucal Fuel Systems Ltd.         
	Mikuni holds a 26 per cent stake in Ucal Fuel Systems, set up in 1985. The Japanese auto fuel systems manufacturer was considering to sell off its entire holding in Ucal Fuel Systems for some time. A final decision was reached at a board meeting on April 16.         
	Carburettors promoters agreed to buy Mikunis 3,612,960 equity shares in Ucal Fuel Systems at a price of Rs 20 each. On Thursday, the stock closed at Rs 81.45 on the BSE, up 9.33 per cent from its previous close, after hitting an intra-day high of Rs 84.45. The total traded quantity of the stock also increased to 44,435 compared with the two-week average of 10,019.        
	The Indian promoter, which owns 23.32 per cent in Ucal Fuel, will acquire Mikunis stake by way of interse transfer. Post-acquisition, Carburettors shareholding in Ucal Fuel will go up to 49.32 per cent. Public shareholding (non-institution) in the company stands at 48.88 per cent, FIIs hold 1.42 per cent and domestic financial institutions jointly own 0.32 per cent.         
	Ucal Fuel manufactures carburettors and mechanical fuel pumps for passenger cars, air valves for two-wheelers and multi-point fuel injection hardware products for passenger cars. The company is an original equipment manufacturer for many frontline automotive companies, including Maruti Udyog, Hyundai, General Motors, Cummins, Bosch, TVS Motor Company, Bajaj Auto, Suzuki, Yamaha and Hero Honda.         
	Institutional holding in Ucal Fuel was as high as 20.73 per cent, with FIIs owning a 15.63 per cent stake as on March 2001. But by March 2004, the FII holding fell to 2.77 per cent. Ucal Fuel shares, however, found favour with domestic mutual funds, such as UTI, Templeton, HDFC Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, which kept on increasing their stake to 18.38 per cent. At the end of March 2008, shareholding by domestic mutual funds was 0.05 per cent and that of FIIs was 1.42 per cent.         
	Ucal Fuels cash flow has decreased significantly over the last four years. Profit before tax declined to Rs 19.71 crore at the end of March 2007 from Rs 40.94 crore in 2002-03. Cash flow from operating activities deteriorated to Rs 13.41 crore by 2006-07 from Rs 44.87 crore in 2003-04.

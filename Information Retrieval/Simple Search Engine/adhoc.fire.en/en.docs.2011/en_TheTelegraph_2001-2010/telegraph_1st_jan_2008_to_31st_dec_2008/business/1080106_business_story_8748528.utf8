The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cognizant bets big on Europe
                                                                                                            Cognizant bets big on Europe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 5: Spooked by the sub-prime crisis in the US, Cognizant Technology Solutions is now zeroing in on European countries. The company will soon start its operations in Hungary.         
	Europe used to contribute 13 per cent to our revenues, which has risen to around 17 per cent in the past few quarters, said R. Chandrasekaran, president and managing director of Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), on the sidelines of Intaglio, the IIM Calcutta business school meet organised in the city.        
	Infosys and Wipro generate more than 25 per cent of their revenues from the European market.        
	Cognizant had earlier said its exposure to the sub-prime crisis was minimal and had raised its revenue outlook for 2007 to $2.11 billion.         
	The company has over 55,000 employees in the country and plans to invest $200 million in 2007-08.                     
	Chandrasekaran had earlier said for every 1 per cent appreciation of the rupee, Cognizants operating margin was affected by 20bps.        
	Rupee expenditure amounts to around 30 per cent of Cognizants total expenses because of its strong onsite presence, which is part of its customer focus business model.         
	The company can also leverage recently acquired New Jersey-based firm marketRx to strengthen its analytical services across industry segments.        
	We are constantly looking for inorganic growth either to penetrate new geographies or acquire new skills. We had very strong presence in life sciences but acquired marketRx for specialised analytical skills, Chandrasekaran said.        
	The company had planned to invest $200 million in 2007-08 to add over 30 lakh sq ft of real estate in the country. It required the additional space for over 30,000 new recruitment by 2008.        
	As part of this programme, Cognizant will developing techno-complexes and expand infrastructure in five cities including Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Calcutta and Pune.         
	Over the past 16 quarters, Cognizants quarterly revenue has been growing by over 50 per cent.        
	The company also plans to start its operations in the Philippines after opening its Hungary office.

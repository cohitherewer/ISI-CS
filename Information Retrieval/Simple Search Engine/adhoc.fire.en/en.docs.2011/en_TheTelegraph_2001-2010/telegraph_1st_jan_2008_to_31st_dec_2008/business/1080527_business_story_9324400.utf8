          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Building dreams                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: Realty firm Omaxe today reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 494.87 crore for the year ended March 31 against Rs 243.96 crore a year ago.        
	Consolidated revenue rose 60.26 per cent to Rs 2,307.75 crore from Rs 1,439.92 crore in the previous year.        
	The company announced a 25 per cent dividend for 2007-08. The steady demand in the real estate sector is reflected in our results, Omaxe chairman and managing director Rohtas Goel said.        
	Goel added that the company planned to raise $500 million through private equity placements that may involve a divestment of up to 20 per cent to fund its existing and future projects.        
	Goel said he expected the markets to stabilise by the end of this fiscal.        
	Talks are going on with domestic and global merchant bankers for the placement, the CMD said.        
	Executive director Vipin Aggarwal said, We are planning to dilute up to 20 per cent of our equity on a project-to-project basis.        
	The company recently announced that it would develop 10 lakh affordable housings in five years at an estimated investment of Rs 80,000 crore.        
	We are focussing on affordable housing now, Goel said. He, however, admitted that margins were not very high in this category. We intend to churn out volumes to maintain a profitable margin, he said.        
	The real estate firm is also planning to build more luxurious homes. The margin for this type of housing is around 20 per cent, Goel said.         
	Omaxe is present in 10 states and 31 cities and has 54 projects in almost all the verticals of real estate.

	New Delhi, April 11: Japanese car maker Toyota Motor Corporation will invest around Rs 1,400 crore to set up its second plant near Bangalore. The company plans to foray into the small car segment by 2010.        
	We have decided to build the plant at Bidadi at an investment of $350 million, said K.K. Swamy, deputy managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor.        
	The company in a release said the plant would have a production capacity of 1,00,000 units and would become operational by 2010. Toyotas existing plant has a capacity of 63,000 units a year.        
	From this plant, we will manufacture a small car which is now being developed at our research and development facility in Japan, Swamy said.        
	The car, which will have a high level of localisation, is primarily aimed at the Indian market. However, it will also be exported, Swamy added.        
	Toyota had earlier said it aimed to capture 10 per cent of the Indian market by 2010. The new car is expected to help the company reach the target.        
	About the pricing and positioning of the car, Swamy said it would neither be as cheap as the Nano, nor would it be too expensive. He, however, refused to divulge whether the company was developing both petrol and diesel variants of the model.        
	The car is under development and it is difficult to talk about pricing. But we are considering excise duty benefits, said Swamy.        
	He said Toyota Kirloskar would also invest in support facilities. The capacity of the new plant will be flexible. It has been kept open-ended as to how much the capacity can be scaled up.        
	The company will also expand its dealer network when it firms up plans for the small car, he added.        
	The Indian small car market has attracted many global players. Another Japanese auto manufacturer Honda has set up its second manufacturing plant in Rajasthan to launch a small car by 2009.        
	American company General Motors will also roll out a small car in India within two years.        
	The Indian small car market is dominated by Maruti Suzuki, which controls over 50 per cent of the market. In 2007-08, the passenger car market saw a total sale of 12,03,531 units against 10,76,582 units in the previous fiscal, a growth rate of 11.79 per cent.        
	Toyota leads the utility vehicle segment in India with its compact multi-utility vehicle Innova.

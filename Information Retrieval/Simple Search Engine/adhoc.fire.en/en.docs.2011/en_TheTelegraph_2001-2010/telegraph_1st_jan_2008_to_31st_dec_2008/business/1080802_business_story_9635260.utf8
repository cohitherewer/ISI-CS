          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: The oil import bill surged 53.4 per cent because of a global oil price spike and widened the trade deficit to $9.78 billion despite the countrys export growing 23.5 per cent in June, from a year earlier, to $14.66 billion.         
	While overall imports grew 25.9 per cent to $24.45 billion, oil imports shot up to $9.03 billion in June this year from $5.89 billion in the same month last year        
	Trade deficit increased 41.7 per cent to $30.42 billion during the first quarter this fiscal from $21.4 billion during the corresponding period last year, according to latest government data released today.        
	The trade deficit was at $9.78 billion in June, lower than $10.77 billion in May. It was $7.55 billion in June 2007.        
	Data showed that the non-oil imports were up 13.9 per cent to $15.42 billion.        
	Analysts said the growing trade deficit was worrying and would put pressure on the rupee.        
	Oil prices are the key risk to Indias balance of payments surplus this year and further increase in oil prices can easily tip this balance, they said.        
	The increase in exports is primarily due to diversification of countrys trade. But much of the exports have been of petroleum products. The exporters are now focussing on new markets in Africa and Asia, said Shubhada M. Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank.        
	Rao, however, stated that the global slowdown could affect the exports in the later part of the year.        
	The weakening of the rupee against the dollar and improved competitiveness have helped in boosting exports, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with the credit rating agency Crisil.        
	Diversification of exports from the traditional markets is the main reason for growth, he said.

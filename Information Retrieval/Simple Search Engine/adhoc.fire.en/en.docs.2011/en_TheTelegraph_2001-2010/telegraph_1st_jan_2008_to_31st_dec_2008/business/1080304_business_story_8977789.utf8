	Jamshedpur, March 3: It was a homecoming of sorts for Russi Mody, the former chairman and managing director of Tata Steel. 
    
	Mody, who was at the helm of Indias largest private sector steel company for eight years, today attended the Founders Day celebrations after one-and-a-half decade. 
    
	I last attended in 1993. I feel good, Mody said. 
    
	He paid floral tribute to the statue of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata at the Tata Steel Works this morning, helped by managing director B. Muthuraman, and Tata Sons director J.J. Irani. 
    
	Mody left the organisation in 1993 after a difference of opinion with Ratan Tata, the present chairman of Tata Sons. 
    
	Mody was followed by J.J. Irani as the managing director of Tata Steel in 1993 before Muthuraman took over in 2001. 
    
	Though Mody kept coming back to Jamshedpur after his exit from Tata Steel, he never attended the Founders Day celebrations. 
    
	Mody, 90, enjoyed todays parades and tableaux but voted for the good old days when asked to compare. 
    
	It is more organised now. But then it had more charm.

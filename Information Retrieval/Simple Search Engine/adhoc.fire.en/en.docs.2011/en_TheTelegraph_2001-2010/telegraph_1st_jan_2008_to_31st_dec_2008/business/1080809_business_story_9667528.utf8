                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BSE boss steps down
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Exit mode                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 8: The top-level exodus from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) continues.         
	Rajnikant Patel, managing director and CEO of the exchange, has put in his papers less than two months after the resignations of Shekhar Datta and Jamshyd Godrej.        
	On June 18, Datta resigned as chairman of the exchange along with Godrej, who was a director. Though the reasons for their resignations were not known, unconfirmed reports said the duo had quit because of differences within the board.         
	Rajnikant Patel has tendered his resignation as managing director and CEO of the Bombay Stock Exchange for personal reasons and the same has been accepted. Mahesh L. Soneji, the chief operating officer, will be looking after the interests of the exchange till a new appointment is made to fill up the vacancy, a BSE statement said today.        
	Patel could not be reached for comments. Last year, the BSE completed the process of demutualisation following which it announced the appointment of Datta as chairman. Godrej was appointed director last year.        
	Meanwhile, the exchange has applied to the Securities and Exchange Board of India to set up a currency derivatives segment in line with the recommendations of the standing committee on exchange traded currency futures.         
	A BSE statement said it was awaiting Sebis approval. The exchange said it was exploring strategic arrangements with some established entities in the foreign market.         
	Daily turnover in exchange-traded currency derivatives, globally, has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of about 23.2 per cent.

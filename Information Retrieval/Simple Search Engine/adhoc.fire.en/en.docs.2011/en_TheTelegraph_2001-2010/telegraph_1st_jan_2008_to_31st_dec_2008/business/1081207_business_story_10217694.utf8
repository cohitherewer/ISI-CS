          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RBI governor D. Subbarao (centre) with deputy governors V. Leeladhar (left) and Rakesh Mohan in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                                         
	Mumbai, Dec. 6: The Reserve Bank of India today came to the aid of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) when it announced a Rs 7,000-crore refinance facility for the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi).         
	It also relaxed norms relating to the classification of non-performing assets (NPAs) in the case of companies whose loans are being restructured by banks.        
	Bankers say the measures would improve credit flow to the sector and also help those units which are now facing problems because of the current economic downturn.        
	With a view to enhancing credit delivery to small units, the RBI said it would provide refinance of Rs 7,000 crore to Sidbi which is the principal financial institution responsible for the promotion, financing and development of the industry.         
	The central bank added that this refinance would be available against Sidbis incremental direct lending to the sector and its loans to banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and state financial corporations (SFCs) against the latters incremental loans and advances to the sector.        
	While the incremental loans and advances will be computed with reference to outstandings as on September 30, the facility will be available at the repo rate of 6.5 per cent.         
	This refinance facility will be available up to March 31, 2010.        
	Small and medium units have been complaining that bankers are reluctant to fund them because of fear that NPAs could surge.        
	In another measure that could help the sector, the central bank said if a bank went in for a second restructuring of an asset, it would become eligible for exceptional regulatory treatment.        
	This means that if a bank is in the process of restructuring the loan of a viable unit, even if it is an NPA, it will be treated as a standard asset in the books of the bank.         
	A standard asset means an asset in respect of which, no default in repayment of principal or payment of interest is perceived.         
	The facility will be applicable to exposures of banks other than to commercial real estate, capital market and personal or consumer loans. It will be available till June 30 next year.        
	The RBI also said loans granted by banks to housing finance companies (HFCs) for on-lending to individuals for purchase of houses may be classified as priority sector credit, provided the loan does not exceed Rs 20 lakh per unit.         
	However, the eligibility under the measure will be restricted to 5 per cent of the individual banks total priority sector lending. The measure is expected to improve the flow of credit to the housing sector.

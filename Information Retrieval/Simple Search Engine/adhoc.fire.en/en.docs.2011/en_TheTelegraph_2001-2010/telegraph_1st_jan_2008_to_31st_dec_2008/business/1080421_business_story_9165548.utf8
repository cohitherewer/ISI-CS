The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | The good, better and best of Ulips 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The good, better and best of Ulips 
                            
	UNIT-LINKED INSURANCE plans (Ulips) are selling like hot cakes since their launch in the domestic market by private life insurers. However, not every insurer is yielding equivalent returns to policyholders.         
	An analysis of returns yielded by Ulips floated by different life insurance companies reveals wide differences across various fund categories. For example, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company has given the highest return to its policyholders who had opted for equity or growth funds. The Tata AIG Equity Fund has generated a 44.48 per cent return in one year, the best among all insurers. The insurers growth fund had a one-year return of 34.15 per cent        
	ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Companys Maximiser II plan comes next with an annualised return of 25.68 per cent and Kotak Life Insurance Companys Aggressive Growth Plan ranks third with a one-year return of 25.51 per cent.        
	But when it comes to balanced funds in which risks are moderate and investments are spread equally between equities and debt instruments, SBI Life Insurance led the pack with a 22.83 per cent return followed by Kotak Dynamic Balance Fund (20.15 per cent).        
	In the more conservative funds that have greater allocation in debt instruments than equities, Aviva Secured Fund beat others with a one-year return of 18.64 per cent. ICICI Prudential Lifes Protector II fund gave a return of 16.12 per cent. The same performance pattern is reflected in shorter terms, too.        
	So, before you sign the dotted lines for a Ulip, check out the performance of various funds offered by life insurance companies. Fund managers of some insurance firms may be good at equities but not so good at debt or money market instruments.

          SAMBIT SAHA                                                Manmohan Singh with Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman in Jamshedpur on Tuesday. Picture by Bhola Prasad      
	Jamshedpur, April 22: Steel producers have decided to hold prices at current levels for the next two to three months in response to an impassioned request by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose government is battling inflation that has topped 7 per cent.        
	At a centenary celebration programme organised by Tata Steel in Jamshedpur, the Prime Minister urged steel makers not to focus on short-term profits and instead take a hard look at future opportunities.         
	He said the steel industry would continue to grow for many years to come.        
	I would advise our steel industry, therefore, to take a long-term view and not fall prey to the temptation of seeking windfall gains from market manipulation in a period of excess demand, Singh said.        
	Industry and trade must eschew short-term gains that hurt consumers and disrupt the stability of the economic growth process, he added.        
	Singhs statement  his first since soaring steel prices sent headline inflation to a 3-year high  sent the honchos of steel companies into a huddle.        
	The major steel makers  Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL)  came out with statements almost immediately after Singhs speech that said they would hold prices. The smaller steel makers, who have resisted threats and blandishments to check prices, took a little more time to respond.        
	We will hold at current price levels for next two to three months in response to the PMs suggestion here, B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, said after Singh left the steel city.        
	A SAIL spokesperson said the company had given an assurance to Singh that despite rising input costs, the steel giant would hold prices for at least three months.        
	These two companies have captive iron ore mines, insulating them from volatility in the price of a key input.         
	They also have adequate access to coking coal, the other important raw material needed for steel making.        
	Earlier this month, JSW Steel, Ispat Industries and Essar Steel were forced to impose a raw material surcharge of Rs 5,000 a tonne. Tata Steel and SAIL did not do so.        
	The smaller steel makers do not have either coal or iron ore mines and depend on market purchase.        
	While SAIL and Tata Steel are selling benchmark hot-rolled coil at Rs 35,000 a tonne, others are selling it at Rs 40,000 a tonne.        
	Hot-rolled steel prices have gained Rs 6,000-10,000 a tonne this year while steel companies said costs have gone up by Rs 14,000 a tonne.         
	An Essar spokesperson later said, We share the governments concern and, though our domestic prices are lower than international prices, we can consider maintaining this price and request the government to allot gas and iron ore on a priority basis.         
	On Monday, JSW Steel managing director Sajjan Jindal had said his company could hold on to the current level for three to four months.        
	The Prime Minister attended two programmes in Jharkhand  flagging off the modernisation and expansion of SAILs Bokaro plant and participating in Tata Steels centenary celebration.        
	New capacities        
	Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said the only way to contain steel prices was to create new capacities in India.         
	This would be possible if the government helped to remove the hurdles to land acquisition and the allotment of captive iron ore mines and coal blocks, thereby enabling the industry to establish new plants.        
	We need to step up the pace of creating new steel-making capacity in the country, Muthuraman said in his speech at todays function.

	New Delhi, Jan. 16: Maruti Suzuki will revamp its automobile research and development centre and increase the number of design engineers to 1,000 from 300 now. The design engineers will not only work on the Swift sedan, A-Star and the Splash but will also be involved in developing Suzukis global car Kizashi. 
    
	Suzuki wants to reposition itself as a top-end car maker. It does not want to be seen as a maker of small cars and family sedans. The Kizashi will be in the highest priced D segment, sources said. 
    
	Kizashi means prelude in Japanese. It could be Suzukis first independently produced D-segment car. Apart from the two-litre turbo diesel engine that powers the Kizashi, Suzuki is also contemplating a hybrid version of its big car. The Kizashi is expected to be launched in India at the same time as its global debut. 
    
	We need more designers ... the existing strength is a little less than 300. It will go up to 1,000 in three years, a top company official said.
    
	Maruti has an aggressive plan in the next few years. This will require plenty of design and development work for which we have to step up capability, the official added. In the next few years, the company expects a rapid flow of models, including the Swift sedan, A-Star, Splash and in the medium term, the Kizashi. 
    
	Marutis designers have played a key role in designing the A-Star concept car. Suzuki chief . Suzuki wants Marutis research facilities to be on a par with Suzukis R amp;D centres in Japan. 
    
	Maruti Suzuki plans to invest close to Rs 7,000 crore in research and marketing. This is in addition to the Rs 9,000 crore for expanding its manufacturing facilities. 
    
	The company is in talks with the Haryana government to acquire 400 acres near its Manesar plant for the R amp;D facility. Suzuki will also invest Rs 2,000 crore in marketing infrastructure.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subbarao: New role                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Finance secretary Duvvuri Subbarao will be the new Reserve Bank governor.         
	He will succeed Yaga Venugopal Reddy whose term ends on September 5. Reddy, it is learnt, refused an extension on health ground.        
	Announcing the decision, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, The order of appointment has been issued. He will assume office when Reddy demits office on September 5.        
	Subbarao would be appointed for a period of three years, Chidambaram said, adding the act allowed appointment for up to five years. The finance minister said Subbarao would be eligible for reappointment.        
	Following Subbaraos appointment, RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan, who was a strong contender for the top job, may move to the World Bank as a director.         
	Subbarao is believed to have had the backing of C. Rangarajan, a former RBI governor and a close confidant of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Before being the finance secretary, Subbarao was the secretary in the department of economic affairs. He had also been the lead economist with the World Bank and worked on various issues of public finance in Africa and East Asia.        
	Subbarao belongs to the 1972 batch of the Indian Administrative Service.        
	An alumnus of IIT Kanpur, Subbarao did his MS in economics from Ohio State University (1978) and was a Humphrey Fellow at MIT during 1982-83. He completed his doctorate in economics from Andhra University.         
	The new RBI governor will have an uphill task of controlling inflation while ensuring economic growth. Subbarao is likely to continue with a tight money policy for some time before gradually relaxing interest rates.         
	During his tenure, Reddy managed to keep money supply under check, though his way of controlling it through interest rate hikes had not been very popular with the finance ministry.         
	Officials said Reddy had been offered a years extension, but he declined because of health reasons and, instead, suggested the appointment of a new governor for a full three-year term.

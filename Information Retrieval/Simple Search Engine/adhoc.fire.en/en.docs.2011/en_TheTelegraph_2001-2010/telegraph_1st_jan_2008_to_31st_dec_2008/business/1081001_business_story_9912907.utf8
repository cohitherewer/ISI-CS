          A STAFF REPORTER                          Saha in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Whirlpool will invest $20 million in product launches.        
	The company expects its revenues to touch Rs 2,500 crore in 2008-09 compared with around Rs 1,800 crore in the previous fiscal.        
	The investment will be made in our three facilities. Our net profit in the first quarter leapt 198 per cent to Rs 44.57 crore. This is an indication of the possibilities in the coming festive season, said Tamal Kanti Saha, vice-president (sales) of Whirlpool India.        
	Around 22 per cent of Whirlpool Indias total revenue comes in the festive season. This year festive sales are expected to grow 20 per cent over last year.        
	Saha said the company had undertaken a cost-cutting exercise and improved efficiencies so that the impact of inflation was not passed on to customers.         
	We had hiked prices in July by 12-13 per cent, except for air conditioners and microwave ovens. Input cost is expected to soften in the coming months. We are much better equipped to handle any kind of circumstances, said Saha.

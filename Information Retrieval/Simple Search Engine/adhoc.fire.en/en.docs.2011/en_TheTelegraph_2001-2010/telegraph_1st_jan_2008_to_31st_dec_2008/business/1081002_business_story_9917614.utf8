          A STAFF REPORTER                          Davison in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph                                   
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The global financial crisis may impact US investment in Indian infrastructure projects.        
	Infrastructure financing will be an issue. With the current global liquidity scenario we cannot say the same thing about financing in India and other countries as we did last year, said John Davison, minister-counselor for economic affairs, US Embassy, New Delhi, at an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	According to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, investment in infrastructure is expected to go up to $47 billion in 2009 from $24 billion in 2005. The government believes the sector has the potential to absorb $150 billion of FDI over the next five years.         
	In 2007-08, the countrys total FDI increased 56 per cent to $25 billion from $15.7 billion a year ago.        
	India has been rated as the fourth most attractive investment destination in the world, according to a global survey by Ernst and Young in June. India, with 30 per cent votes among the respondents to the survey, beat the US, which received 21 per cent votes. Indias trade gap with the US is lower following higher Indian investments to the US.         
	Last year till September, Indian investments to the US was higher than US investments in India, Davison said.         
	The development is quite significant for sectors such as steel where the American people realise that they have proper jobs because of Indian companies, he said.        
	Nano praise        
	The Nano project of the Tatas is much more than just another investment.        
	The project says something about India not said before. It symbolises the aspiration of the Indian middle class, Davison said .        
	The American automobile industry is also retooling itself as people are going in for smaller and fuel-efficient cars.

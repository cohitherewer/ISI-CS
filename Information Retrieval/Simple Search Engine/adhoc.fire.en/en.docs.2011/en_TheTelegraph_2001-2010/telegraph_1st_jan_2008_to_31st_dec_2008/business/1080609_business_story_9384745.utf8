                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WTO talks to bridge tariff divide
                            
	New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): Eleven key nations, including India, are returning to Geneva tomorrow at the behest of the US to narrow the gaps on tariff cuts in industrial goods under the Doha negotiations.        
	As the US and the European Union have been rebuffed by the developing countries for being asked to make greater concessions, American negotiators are making renewed attempts to bring the level of differences down to a reasonable level, an official associated with the WTO talks said.        
	India and several other developing countries had rejected the negotiating draft released by the chairman of the group on non-agriculture market access, Don Stephenson, on May 19. Unable to find convergence among members, Stephenson suspended the group talks last week asking them to evolve a working consensus before he can pick up the threads again.        
	The Indian negotiating team, comprising senior commerce ministry officials, had raised strong objections to the negotiating draft seeking to divide the developing countries by treating them differently.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sensex tumbles on RBI double whammy
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 29: The 30-share sensitive index of the Bombay Stock Exchange today plunged 557.57 points to end the day at 13791.54 after the RBI stunned the market with a repo rate and CRR hike.        
	The market wasnt expecting the double whammy, which now raises the scary prospect of another increase in consumer lending rates at a time when industrial growth in the first two months of this fiscal has started to stutter at 5 per cent.        
	A few bellwether stocks, however, bucked the trend such as Hindustan Unilever, which rose 2.86 per cent, followed by Sterlite industries at 1.68 per cent and the two tech biggies, TCS at 0.27 per cent and Infosys at 0.06 per cent.        
	To start with, there was already negative news from the global market in the morning, the US as well as the Asian markets were down. The market tanked after the RBIs monetary policy announcement, said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan.         
	We had been expecting a 25 basis points increase in the CRR rate, but the repo rate hike was totally unexpected. As a result, interest rate sensitive sectors such as auto, banks and real estate plunged, he said.        
	The Bankex today fell the highest at 8.31 per cent from the opening of 6548.59. The realty index fell 5.54 per cent and the auto index fell 4.04 per cent.        
	HDFC Bank fell 8.71 per cent, ICICI Bank dipped 8.45 per cent and the State Bank of India sank 6.84 per cent.        
	Among others, Reliance Infrastructure plunged 7.99 per cent down, while Maruti Suzuki lost 7.03 per cent.        
	Asian stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the International Monetary Fund said there was no end in sight to the correction in the US housing sector even as energy costs were spiralling.        
	The Nikkei in Tokyo was down 2.15 per cent at 13066, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 2.5 per cent.        
	Interest rates are headed further up. Given the scenario, the market will remain range bound with negative bias, said Hitesh Agarwal, head of research at Angel Broking.        
	Meanwhile, government security yields headed north after the policy announcement. The bond markets were largely anticipating a 25 basis point increase either in CRR or in the repo rate.        
	Yields on the benchmark 10-year security hit an intra-day high of 9.50 per cent after beginning at 9.03 per cent earlier in the day.         
	Treasury circles say it can soon inch up to 9.75 per cent, though a few even talk of it touching the 10 per cent mark as the RBI is not done with its rate hikes.        
	As prices of government securities are inversely related to yields, their jump is not good news for banks as they can suffer losses in their investment portfolio when marked to market.

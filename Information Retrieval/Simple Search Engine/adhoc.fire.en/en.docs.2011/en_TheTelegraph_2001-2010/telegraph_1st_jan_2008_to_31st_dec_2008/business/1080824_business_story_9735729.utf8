                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coal energiser for NTPC
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bhattacharyya: Power-packed                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: Coal India Ltd (CIL) will increase its supply to National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) to help the power company tide over the shortfall in fuel linkage for its various projects.        
	The decision to increase the coal supply to NTPC was taken at a recent meeting between the two public sector behemoths.        
	We will supply 10 per cent additional coal to NTPC, CIL chairman Partha Bhattacharyya said today on the sidelines of an energy summit organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here.        
	The additional supply will be mainly for Farakka, Kahalgaon and Talcher projects, he added.        
	Around 80 per cent of Coal Indias production goes to power companies with NTPC being a major customer. Bhattacharyya said for additional coal requirements companies must also look at import.        
	During 2006-07, coal production from underground mines accounted for only about 11 per cent of the total output. Out of the 361 million tonnes produced, open cast mines contributed 339 million tonnes, while 43.32 million tonnes came from underground mines.        
	During the Eleventh Plan Period, CIL has identified 120 projects from which it plans to excavate 292 million tonnes of coal. The government has fixed a target of 520.5 million tonnes for CIL by the terminal year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2011-12).        
	NTPC badly needs coal as it strives to reach a production target of 30,000MW by the end of this year.

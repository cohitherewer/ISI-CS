	Calcutta, Jan. 14: You may soon be able to get rid of the hassle of renewing health, car and other personal insurance policies every year.
    
	General insurance companies are in discussions with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority to introduce long-term plans in health, accident, motor and other personal covers. 
    
	We are working on long-term products in the general insurance business, but nothing has been finalised yet, said K.N. Bhandari, secretary general of the General Insurance Council  a representative body of non-life insurance companies in the country. 
    
	At present, general insurance products are mostly on an annual contract basis, which means policyholders have to renew covers every year. 
    
	Health insurance is one product that is currently sold both by general insurance companies and life insurance companies. 
    
	Bhandari said life insurers sold medical covers with renewals after every three or five years, but non-life companies do so on an annual basis.
    
	This disparity has to go if we want to bring in portability of health insurance policies across issuers. General insurance companies also need a level-playing field with life insurers in underwriting health insurance products, Bhandari said. 
    
	The General Insurance Council has raised these issues with the insurance regulator. However, we have to sort out issues such as the accounting of premium for a long-term policy, Bhandari said. 
    
	The structure of commission fees to agents will also have to be different in case of a long-term policy. 
    
	In motor insurance, too, the insurance regulator is in favour of general insurance companies underwriting long-term policies once they are allowed to design products on their own from April 1 this year. 
    
	But long-term motor insurance policies may not be available soon given the short-term pattern in the ownership of vehicles, Bhandari said. 
    
	Premium rates for long-term products also come at a discount to that of an annual contract, while premium amounts remain fixed for the term of the policy (before renewal). 
    
	The cost of acquisition of a customer is higher in case of a policy that is renewable every year than for a long-term plan.

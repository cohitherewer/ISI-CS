The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Promoters get a boost

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money muscle                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 27: Promoters can now increase stakes in their companies up to 75 per cent through the creeping acquisition route.        
	Sebis decision today to relax the limit on creeping acquisition from the current 55 per cent may improve market sentiments. Through a creeping acquisition, promoters can raise stakes by five per cent every year.        
	In a late evening announcement, the capital market regulator said, The Sebi board has decided that henceforth consolidation through creeping acquisition up to five per cent be allowed to persons holding 55 per cent and above but below 75 per cent, subject to the condition that such acquisition can only be via open market purchases in the normal segment.         
	Observers said the move would also benefit promoters whose holdings in their companies were now close to 55 per cent.        
	With stocks available at low prices, promoters are expected to ramp up their holdings through creeping acquisitions. In the past, the Tatas, Kumar Mangalam Birla and Anil Ambani have used the route. Observers, however, cautioned that only cash-rich promoters could go in for creeping acquisition.        
	Sebi also said companies would no longer require its green signal if promoters holding in them went up five per cent following a buyback of shares.        
	Further, hitherto for any increase in the holding of promoters pursuant to buyback, exemption under the Sebi (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations was required to be sought. It has now been decided to automatically exempt increase/consolidation up to five per cent per annum as a result of buyback by a company, the market regulator said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 22: Tata Tea is looking at more strategic acquisitions.        
	At the companys 45th annual general meeting here today, chairman Ratan Tata said, We will be looking at strategic acquisitions to strengthen the product range.        
	At present, Tata Tea owns 42 brands and operates in 45 countries.        
	Replying to the shareholders demand for an issue of bonus shares, Tata said it had to be a trade-off between higher dividend and bonus shares.        
	During 2007-08, the company declared a total dividend of 350 per cent. If we declare a bonus, then the dividend payout will go down substantially, he said.

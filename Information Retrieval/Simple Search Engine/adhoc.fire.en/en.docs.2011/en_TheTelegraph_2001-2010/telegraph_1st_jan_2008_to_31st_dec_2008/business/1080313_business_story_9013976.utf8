	New Delhi, March 12: Industry grew just 5.3 per cent in January compared with 10.9 per cent a year ago.        
	Measured on the basis of the index of industrial production (IIP), the growth slipped on the back of a discouraging performance by manufacturing, electricity and mining, coupled with negative growth in consumer durables.        
	According to C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, A slowdown in industrial production could be cyclical and budget steps could boost industrial production. What has happened to the consumer durable sector can reverse itself if a cyclical upturn begins. he said.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had recently said that interest rates on housing and consumer durables needed to be cut as they were the prime drivers of the economy.        
	D. Joshi, principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil, said he did not expect the growth figures to be so low. With inflation increasing and growth declining, it will become difficult for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take a decision on the interest rate cut.        
	The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said the adverse impact of high interest rate had brought down the growth of consumer durables which had restricted manufacturing growth.         
	Lehman Brothers economist Sonal Varma said, As inflation rises and growth softens, the Reserve Bank of India and the government face a complicated task ahead.

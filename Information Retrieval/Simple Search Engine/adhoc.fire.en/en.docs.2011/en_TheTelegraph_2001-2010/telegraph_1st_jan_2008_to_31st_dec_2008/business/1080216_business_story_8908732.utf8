	Calcutta, Feb. 15: Big power projects catering to more than one state are likely to get more tax sops.         
	The Union power ministry has finalised a cabinet note proposing additional fiscal benefits such as income tax sops and deemed export status for setting up generating units with minimum installed capacity of 1000MW in thermal and 500MW or more in hydroelectric projects.         
	We are changing the policy to attract more investors to set up power projects so that the five-year plan targets are met. We have proposed tax incentives for private power producers setting up mega projects, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said while addressing a seminar, Electricity East 2008, organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	The proposal, which is awaiting the power ministers approval, will be forwarded to the cabinet for its clearance.        
	Under the existing norms framed in 1995, the seven thermal and four hydroelectric projects by state-owned companies and catering to more than one state enjoy customs duty exemption because of their mega power project status.         
	Equipment suppliers to these projects also enjoy a 15 per cent price preference.         
	However, irrespective of their size, projects catering only to one state do not qualify for this category.         
	According to sources, the revised policy proposal also envisages lowering the threshold limit on generation capacity and involving large transmission projects as well.         
	Last November, the Planning Commission had turned down the ministrys proposal to extend the mega status to projects with a minimum generation capacity of 250MW.

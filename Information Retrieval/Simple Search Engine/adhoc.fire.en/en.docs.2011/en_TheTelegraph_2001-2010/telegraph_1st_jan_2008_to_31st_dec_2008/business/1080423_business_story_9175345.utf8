The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exide profit takes big leap
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Exide profit takes big leap
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ramanathan: Charged up                                  
	Calcutta, April 22: Lead acid battery manufacturer Exide Industries clocked a consolidated net profit of Rs 263.09 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008, compared with Rs 158.04 crore for the year-ago period.        
	The companys gross sales stood at Rs 3,757.59 crore in the reporting period against Rs 2,496.7 crore a year ago.        
	Exides net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31 was Rs 62.82 crore against Rs 38.51 crore a year ago, an increase of 63.1 per cent.        
	The Exide board today declared a dividend of 40 per cent, maintaining its record of uninterrupted dividend payment for 60 years.        
	The wildly fluctuating cost of lead in the international markets remains a cause for concern. However, we can introduce the concept of price escalation clause this year for most of our institutional customers in industrial batteries. The clause is already there in the automobile original equipment manufacturing segment. This protected us from the fluctuation in lead prices to a large extent, said T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and CEO, Exide Industries Ltd.        
	Hindustan Zinc recently dropped lead prices to Rs 131,200 a tonne in March.        
	Automobile batteries comprise 62 per cent of the companys business.         
	Exide made its foray into lead smeltering in 2007-08. It has acquired a smeltering unit in Maharashtra.        
	With our own lead smelting unit in place, we now have better control on recycling of used batteries. It gives us a major edge over the unorganised sector, Ramanathan said.        
	He added that with the economy growing at 8 per cent, the future of lead acid storage battery industry looked promising.        
	However, he expressed concern over the rising inflation rate.         
	Hopefully the concerted efforts of the government to rein in the price rise will bear fruit soon, he said.        
	Exide grew at 71 per cent in the telecom sector.        
	The production of batteries for industrial applications rose from around one billion ampere to 1.2 billion ampere during the year.        
	Automotive battery production crossed 608 million plates in the reporting period .        
	Shares of the firm closed at Rs 76.40, up 0.73 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

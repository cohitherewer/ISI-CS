                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Emami buys 24% of Zandu
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 30: The Rs 600-crore Emami Ltd has acquired a 24 per cent stake in Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd, increasing its holding in the company to 27.5 per cent.         
	Herbal firm Zandu Pharmaceuticals has a turnover of Rs 150 crore with a net profit of Rs 15 crore in 2006-07. Emami plans to make an open offer next week to acquire another 20 per cent stake in Zandu.        
	Zandu is an ayurvedic herbal and healthcare products company and owns brands such as Zandu Balm, Zandu Special Chyawanprash and Kesri Jeevan.         
	This is the first time in the last few years that we have gone for a stake buyout. Zandu has tremendous business potential that can be exploited with strong marketing, R amp;D and other operating efficiencies along with a long-term entrepreneurial vision. Emami will be leveraging its distribution network to market these household brands, said Harsh Agarwal, director of Emami Group.         
	While Zandu Balm commands a market share of 45 per cent, the chyawanprash brand enjoys around 10 per cent of the market share.        
	Emami is in talks with three to four companies for similar strategic investments.        
	We are on the lookout for similar stake buyouts. The companies with whom we are in talks are from segments such as personal care, healthcare and household products, Agarwal said.

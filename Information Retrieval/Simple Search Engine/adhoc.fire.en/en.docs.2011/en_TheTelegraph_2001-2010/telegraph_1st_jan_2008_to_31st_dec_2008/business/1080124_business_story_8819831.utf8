     A STAFF REPORTER
             YOUTH APPEAL
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: Tata Tea today forayed into the out-of-home beverage segment with the launch of its first Chai Unchai outlet at IIM Bangalore. Another outlet will come up inside a mall in the same city in the next few days. 
    
	According to Sangeeta Talwar, executive director of Tata Tea, new tea-based drinks will be available at these retail outlets.
    
	These outlets will be a point of convergence and will enable us to try out different beverage formats. If a certain flavour or a certain format proves to be a hit with consumers, we can start manufacturing it and create a brand around it, Talwar said.
    
	Tata Tea may also explore the possibility of tieups with retail majors. 
    
	Many retailers are keen to leverage this format, Talwar said. But any such tieup will be over and above the companys own chain of outlets.
    
	The Chai Unchai outlets will be opened on office premises, university campuses, shopping malls and other public places.
    
	The company will start with south India and move to other parts of the country over the next five to seven years to attain market leadership in the segment. 
    
	Targeted at the youth, the outlets are neither kiosks nor parlours but have prefabricated setups.
    
	We cannot comment on the number of such company-owned outlets as the prefabricated structures can be dismantled and set up where the market is favourable, unlike a caf rooted to a spot, Talwar added.

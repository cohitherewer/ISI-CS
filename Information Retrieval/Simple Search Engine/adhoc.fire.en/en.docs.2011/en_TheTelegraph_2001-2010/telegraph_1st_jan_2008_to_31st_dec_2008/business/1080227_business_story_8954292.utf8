	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Bharti Airtel will set up a high-speed undersea cable system to carry Internet and other traffic between Asia and the United States. 
    
	The company will undertake the project, named Unity, in partnership with five international companies. 
    
	The cable system will cost an estimated $300 million and will take care of broadband demand by providing capacity to sustain growth in data and Internet traffic between Asia and the US.
    
	Apart from Bharti, the consortium includes Singapores SingTel and Pacnet, Japanese telecom company KDDI Corporation, Internet search company Google and Malaysia-based Global Transit Ltd.
    
	The cable system will link Japanese town Chikura to Los Angeles, a distance of 10,000 kilometres, Bharti Airtel said in a statement. The cable will become operational in the first quarter of 2010. 
    
	The investment in the Unity consortium is in line with our strategy to extend our international footprint to provide seamless connectivity to our customers through partnerships with leading global companies, said David Nishball, president of Airtel Enterprise Services.
    
	The consortium has selected NEC Corporation and Tyco Telecommunications to construct and install the system.
    
	Mark Chong, SingTels executive vice-president for networks, said, As the new submarine cable network is connected to other cable systems in Asia, it will also provide access to other parts of the continent and serve as an important cable diversity route. 
    
	Internet service in Asia was disrupted in December 2006 after an earthquake hit Taiwan. The quake disturbed several offshore submarine cables that linked the Asian countries with the US. 
    
	Industry observers said the incident was a pointer to the fragility of the regions cable network and the fact that it was overtly reliant on connections to the United States. 
    
	The Unity cable system will complement Bharti Airtels high bandwidth cable systems in the region.
    
	The company has two international landing stations in Chennai that connect two submarine cable systems  i2i to Singapore and SEA-ME-WE-4 to Singapore and Europe.
    
	Earlier this month, Bharti announced the laying of the IMEWE cable system  a high-capacity fibre-optic submarine cable that stretches from India to France via West Asia.

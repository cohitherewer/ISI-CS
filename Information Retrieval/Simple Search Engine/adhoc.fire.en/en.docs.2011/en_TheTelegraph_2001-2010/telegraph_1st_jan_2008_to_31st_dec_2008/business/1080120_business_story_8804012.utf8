     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Dunlop India Ltds shares, suspended from trading for the past six years, are expected to be re-listed on the bourses. 
    
	The company has 35,000 shareholders.
    
	Yesterday, Cuttack High Court lifted a suspension imposed by the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR), which thwarted a rights issue of the company and dematerialisation and relisting of its shares.
    
	A division bench comprising Justice I.N. Qudusi and Justice S.C. Oarija acted upon a petition filed by a shareholder, who moved against the company and stock exchanges to allow demat, listing and the completion of rights issue.
    
	Dunlop chairman Pawan K. Ruia welcomed the move and said the interim court order would pave the way for relisting.
    
	We have written to all exchanges and received good responses from all of them. I do not see any impediment anymore, he added.
    
	Dunlop shares used to be listed on the stock exchanges of Calcutta, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Bombay.

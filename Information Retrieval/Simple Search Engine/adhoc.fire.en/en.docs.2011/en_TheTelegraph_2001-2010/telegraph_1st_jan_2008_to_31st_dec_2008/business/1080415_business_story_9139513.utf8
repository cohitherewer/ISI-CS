The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Overseas investors bullish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Overseas investors bullish
          
	Mumbai, April 14 (PTI): They are blamed for the meltdown on Dalal Street, but if market activity patterns are to be believed, overseas investors seem to be more than three times confident than India Inc regarding the markets future growth.        
	According to an analysis of the changes in the listed companies shareholding patterns since the beginning of this year, the number of companies where foreign institutional investors have raised their holding is bigger than those where FII holding has gone down.        
	Local promoters, on the other hand, have cut their holdings in more number of companies compared with those where they have raised their stakes during the same period.        
	According to the latest shareholding pattern (January-March quarter), at least one in three firms have seen an increase in FII holding. In comparison, only about one in nine has seen its promoters raise their shareholding in the company.        
	However, indicating a relatively less bullish stand on large-cap companies, overseas investors have mostly cut their exposure to the firms with high market values, while accumulating more shares in those with lesser valuations. So far, around 900 companies have released their shareholding patterns as on March 31, 2008.

	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Cairn India expects to pump over 30 per cent more oil from its Rajasthan fields than the earlier estimate and contribute one-fifth to the countrys domestic oil output when it starts production in the second half of 2009.        
	A revised development plan for the Mangala oil field envisages a 25 per cent increase in peak production at 125,000 barrels per day (bpd), a company statement said.        
	Cairn India is on track to deliver crude oil from Rajasthan in the second half of 2009 and significant progress has been made towards optimising and sustaining plateau production levels in this core asset, Sir Bill Gammell, chief executive officer of Cairn India, said in a statement.        
	Cairn has also got investment approval for Bhagyam, the second largest block in Rajasthan.

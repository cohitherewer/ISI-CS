The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude collapses on Opec status quo hint
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crude collapses on Opec status quo hint
                            
	London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Oil dropped to a new five-month low on Tuesday on expectations that Opec would leave formal output targets steady and with the threat of Hurricane Ike receding.        
	Opec ministers meeting in Vienna were expected to keep output targets steady with calls from some to trim excess supply above agreed limits, about 790,000 barrels per day (bpd) according to some estimates.        
	Officials said oil prices, which had tumbled nearly 30 per cent from record highs over $147 a barrel in July, are now more reflective of fundamentals.        
	I think everything is in balance  inventories are in a healthy position, said Ali al Naimi, oil minister of Saudi Arabia.        
	US crude fell $2.50 to $103.84 by 1340 GMT after hitting a fresh five-month low of $103.72 a barrel earlier. London Brent crude traded down $2.11 to $101.33.        
	Opec leaving quotas unchanged is a little disappointing for the market and Ike looks more like a downstream threat at the current track, said UBS oil strategist Thomas Stenvoll.        
	Hurricane Ike approached western Cuba as a Category 1 storm before heading towards South Texas later in the week, but was expected to miss the bulk of the US offshore oil and natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

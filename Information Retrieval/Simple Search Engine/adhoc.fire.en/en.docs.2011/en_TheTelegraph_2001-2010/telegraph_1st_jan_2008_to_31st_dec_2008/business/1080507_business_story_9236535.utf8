          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, May 6: The rupee today tumbled to an eight-month low against the dollar as crude oil hit a new high.         
	After nearly touching the Rs 41-per-dollar mark in intra-day trading, the currency ended at Rs 40.95 against the dollar, a sharp fall of 34 paise over its previous close.        
	This drop was spurred by a sudden increase in dollar demand from oil companies as global crude prices surged to a new record of over $120 per barrel. Importers also joined in, accelerating the Indian currencys fall.        
	At the inter-bank foreign exchange market, the Indian currency resumed weak at 40.68 per dollar from its last close of 40.61 and gradually moved down to near 41-level during the day.         
	The rupee had last reached this level on September 4, 2007 when it closed at 40.98.        
	It was the news of crude oil prices touching $120 per barrel that was the prime reason behind the rupees fall today. If crude continues to stay above this level, the rupee will remain under pressure, an analyst with a private sector bank said. He added that the currency could even hit the 41.2-mark if oil prices remained firm.        
	Dealers said though crude prices would play a key role, much would depend on inflows into the country.

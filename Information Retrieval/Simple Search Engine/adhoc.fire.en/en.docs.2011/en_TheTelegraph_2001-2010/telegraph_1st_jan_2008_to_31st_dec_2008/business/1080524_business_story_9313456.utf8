                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Geojit exits commodities
          OUR CORRESPONDENT,                               
	Mumbai, May 23: Geojit Financial Services today exited its commodities trading subsidiary, Geojit Commodities Ltd (GCL), to pave the way for the proposed open offer by its joint venture partner BNP Paribas Securities Asia.        
	The subsidiary of the French banking giant BNP Paribas will pay Rs 40 crore to Geojit as compensation for pulling out of the commodities business.         
	On July 12, 2007, Geojit Financial Services formed a 50:50 joint venture with BNP Paribas Securities Asia to cater to foreign institutional clients in India. The company said it would invest up to $2 million in this project. Following this, BNP Paribas approached the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to seek regulatory approvals for an open offer.         
	GCL is mainly engaged in the business of commodities futures trading. The present regulatory norms do not allow foreign investments in commodities trading in India.         
	Since BNPs joint venture partner Geojit was engaged in the commodities trading business, the application for an open offer could not fulfil the regulatory criteria. When BNP Paribas approached Sebi for the open offer, the application was forwarded to the RBI. The application is pending with RBI for the past one year. We need to shut the commodities business to enable BNP Paribas to come out with its open offer, C. J. George, managing director of Geojit Financial Services told The Telegraph.        
	Going by the current valuations of our commodities business a compensation of Rs 40 crore is required.         
	Next week, BNP Paribas will write to the RBI for an open offer. The transaction of the compensation amount will be completed within a month. The schedule and structure of the open offer will also be announced next week, George added.

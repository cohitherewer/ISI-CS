                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hoteliers hooked on Bengal hills
          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                           Beauty beckons                                  
	Calcutta, May 25: Hospitality companies are developing the tourism potential of north Bengal by investing both in the established destinations and in lesser known spots.        
	Companies such as Sinclairs Hotels and Ambuja Realty are creating tourism circuits through properties in the lesser known spots.         
	Tourism in the region suffers from poor infrastructure facilities  the roads are not up to the mark, the regions Bagdogra airport is open for a limited period to civilian flights and there are government restrictions on tea gardens engaged in alternative activities.         
	We have acquired 4.5 acre for our Kalimpong property and work will start soon. It is not easy to get contiguous land in hilly areas. Even domestic tourists who come here from other states would want a complete package comprising different destinations. Therefore, we want to build our own tourist circuit in north Bengal with various properties and market packages, said Navin Suchanti, CEO and managing director of Sinclairs Hotels.         
	Sinclairs already has properties at Chalsa, Siliguri and Darjeeling. It is scouting for land in Gangtok and at Peling and Yumthang in Sikkim.         
	Each of these properties will have about 50 rooms and be equipped with modern amenities, including conference facilities.         
	We are also in the process of discussing with gardens for alliances in marketing and tea tourism activities. When tourists come to these places, we will promote the chosen gardens with various activities and also look at other activities in the region, be it wildlife, river rafting or golf, Suchanti said.         
	Calcutta-based Sinclairs will invest Rs 200 crore in Bengal in the next five years, of which a significant portion will go into its properties in north Bengal. Each of them will require an investment of Rs 10-15 crore.        
	Ambuja plans        
	Ambuja Realty, on the other hand, is looking at a good mix of properties to provide guests with varied experience.         
	The hospitality major has tied up with the oldest tea estate, Makaibari, in Darjeeling for a premium resort.         
	The company might look at similar projects in other tea gardens in the future. Ambuja will acquire 24 acres from Makaibari, the most that can be used for tourism by a garden, according to state government regulations.        
	The other locations where the company is looking for land is at Ghum, which has the highest railway station in the country, and at Gorumara.         
	Each project has a requirement of 10 acres. Each resort will have the distinctiveness of the Ambuja brand, Harsh Neotia, chairman of Ambuja Realty, said.         
	Ambuja too, like Sinclairs, plans to allocate a significant portion of its Rs 1,000-crore investment in Bengal to north Bengal in the next five years.         
	The Union tourism ministry had initially given a grant of Rs 7.6 crore to develop an integrated tea tourism circuit in Bengal. It was subsequently slashed to Rs 3.89 crore.

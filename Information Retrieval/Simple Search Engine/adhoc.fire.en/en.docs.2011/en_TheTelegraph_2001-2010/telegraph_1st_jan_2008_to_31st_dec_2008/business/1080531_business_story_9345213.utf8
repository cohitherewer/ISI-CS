          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          MONEY MATTERS                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: A government panel has recommended that the basic salary of the chiefs of state-owned public sector companies can go up to Rs 1 lakh per month, along with benefits such as employee stock options and performance-linked variable pay.        
	The second pay revision committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice M. Jagannadha Rao submitted the report to heavy industry minister Santosh Mohan Dev here today.        
	According to the suggestions of the committee, the compensation package for executives of PSUs should be decided independent of what has been proposed by the Sixth Central Pay Commission for government servants. Executive compensations in central public sector enterprises should be aligned with their counterparts in the private sector.        
	A pay panel for civil servants had earlier recommended a salary of Rs 90,000 for the cabinet secretary, the top civil servant of the country. A similar salary for chief executives of PSUs may face opposition from civil servants.         
	The PSU panel recommended that the effective dates for new scales and allowances be fixed as January 1, 2007. Allowances and perks will be up to 50 per cent of revised basic pay. House rent allowance and retirement benefits will, however, be outside the basic pay limit, the report said.        
	The committee observed that performance-related pay be made an integral part of the compensation package and should progressively become a major component of the pay packet.         
	The variable pay should be directly linked to the profits of the PSUs and the performance of the executives. The percentage ceiling of the performance pay should increase from junior- to senior-level executives, the report said.        
	The panel also recommended that all state-owned units should have an employee stock option plan (Esop), and 10 to 25 per cent of the performance-related pay should be paid as Esops. The report also said the government should encourage companies to get listed on the stock exchanges for the PSUs to carry out the Esop schemes.         
	The committee also wants a companys board of directors to be allowed to decide on the allowances and perks that are to be given to the different categories of executives, subject to a maximum ceiling of 50 per cent of the basic pay.        
	Over 16 lakh employees in over 240 central PSUs are expected to benefit from the salary revision. The committee was set up in November 2006 and was given 18 months to submit its report.

   Profession tax

                Can the work of an agent of the Life Insurance Corporation of India be regarded as a profession and do I have to pay professional tax?
     N. Majumder, Thakurpukur

          What is often called professional tax, and is actually profession tax, is levied by individual state governments. Everybody whose income is more than Rs 1,500 a month, whether it is a salaried individual or an agent, will have to pay profession tax in this state. The basic salary limit varies from one state to another. Therefore, if your monthly salary or commission income is more than Rs 1,500, you will have to pay profession tax.
                 Cheque trouble 
   The State Bank of India has made a system under which account holders willing to deposit a cheque will have to put it in a drop-box without an acknowledged pay-in slip. The deposited cheque may be inadvertently lost by the bank. In such a case, we cannot lodge an FIR without having an acknowledgement slip. Is this a right system?
    Salil Kumar Chatterjee, Sinthee

        According to a Reserve Bank circular, banks will have to give their customers both the options  the drop-box facility as well as receiving cheques at the teller counter. If you are suspicious about the drop-box system, you can tender your cheque at the teller counter. The bank branch is bound to acknowledge the receipt. If it declines, you can approach the banking ombudsman at the regional Reserve Bank office.
                 Lock and key
   My mother gifted me a house, which is registered in my name. One of my close relatives used to stay there without paying me any rent. The relative, who is away, has kept his portion of the residence under lock and key. The house needs immediate repair. What shall I do?
    Ujjwal Ganguly, Calcutta

           Since the house is in your name and the person is your relative, you can simply break open his/her rooms and carry on with the repair work. For safety, you can inform the nearest police station about the incident and take their help to break open the rooms.

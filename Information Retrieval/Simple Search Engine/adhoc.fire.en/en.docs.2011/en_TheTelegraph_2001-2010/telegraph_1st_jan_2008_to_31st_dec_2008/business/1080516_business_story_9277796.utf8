                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel duty rollback hangs in balance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Standby mode                                  
	New Delhi, May 15: The government today said it had not received any proposal to cut the export duty on steel, a day after secondary steel producers agreed to cut prices on all flat products and galvanised sheets by Rs 4,000 per tonne.        
	I have not received any formal proposal from the ministry of steel. If there is rethinking, I suppose the ministry of steel will send me a proposal, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters. He said the export duty was imposed on the recommendations of the ministry of steel.        
	Cement prices        
	According to Chidambaram, there was scope for a further reduction in cement prices.         
	Cement manufacturers yesterday agreed to cut prices by Rs 7.5 per 50-kg-bag. I do think that there is scope for a significant reduction in cement prices, the finance minister said.        
	Chidambaram, however, ruled out any cut in the import duty on crude oil, which is trading around $125 a barrel in the global futures market.        
	A mere reduction in the import duty on crude oil has no impact on administered prices, he said.

	Mumbai, Dec. 16: Wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon Energy has drawn up the payment schedule for the acquisition of an additional 22.4 per cent stake in Germanys REpower Systems.         
	In an agreement with Martifer SGPS SA in September, Suzlon had decided to acquire Martifers stake of 22.48 per cent in REpower for 270 million euros.         
	According to the payment schedule worked out, Suzlon will pay Martifer 65 million euros this month, 30 million euros in April 2009 and 175 million euros in May. Upon completion of the transaction, Suzlon will own 91 per cent of REpower.         
	The announcement led to Suzlon shares flaring up. The scrip ended 6.5 per cent higher at Rs 57.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	In June, Suzlon had acquired around 30 per cent in REpower from Areva of France.        
	The Martifer Group is the holding company in Portugal engaged in metallic construction, energy equipment and electricity generation. REpower is one of the leading producers of wind turbines in Germany.         
	Based in Hamburg, REpower reported a net profit margin of 2.82 per cent for the September quarter.        
	Last month, Suzlon had said it was in talks with Martifer on the payment schedule.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bosses go into a huddle 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Top policy-makers today met finance minister P. Chidambaram to review the impact of the global financial crisis on India and discuss measures to tackle it.         
	The meeting was attended by RBI governor D. Subbarao and deputy governor Rakesh Mohan, plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Sebi chief C.B. Bhave, among others. This was followed by a meeting in the evening between Subbarao and Chidambaram.        
	According to officials, the meeting discussed ways to infuse money into the system to cut interest rates.         
	To ease the liquidity crisis, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government have already taken many measures, including a 250-basis-point cut in the cash reserve ratio, which is the proportion of a bank deposit that must mandatorily lie with the central bank.        
	During October, the Reserve Bank of India pumped Rs 1,85,000 crore into the banking system.        
	However, bankers expect the Reserve Bank to slash rates further, taking cues from the US Federal Reserve. Earlier this year, the RBI had opted for a tight money policy, with interest rates at a seven-year high, to stem demand and cool rising prices.         
	Indias stance at the G20 summit to be held on November 15 was also discussed at the meeting. The leaders of G20 nations are expected to examine ways to overhaul the financial system following the global credit crisis.         
	Share short sale        
	Short-selling of shares is no longer an area of concern, a finance ministry official said. Bhave, however, refused to make any comment.         
	Sebi had recently expressed its disapproval over stock lending by FIIs to overseas entities, which could in turn use them for short selling.         
	It has also asked FIIs to submit data in this regard regularly.        
	According to a report released by Sebi today, disclosures made by 34 FIIs do not indicate any short selling between October 23 and October 27.

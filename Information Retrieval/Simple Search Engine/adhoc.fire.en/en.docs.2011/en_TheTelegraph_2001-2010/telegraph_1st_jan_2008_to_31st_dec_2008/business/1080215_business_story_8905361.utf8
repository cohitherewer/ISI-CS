	Calcutta, Feb. 14: Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC) will give a soft loan of Rs 30.9 crore to West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Ltd to set up a 2 mega watt solar power facility at Dishergarh near Asansol.         
	West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation is promoted by the West Bengal Power Development Corporation (45 per cent stake), West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company (30 per cent) and the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (25 per cent).        
	The project will be the countrys largest solar power plant, said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, managing director of West Bengal Green Energy.         
	It is also the first solar power project funded by PFC.         
	According to V.K. Garg, chairman and managing director of PFC, the company has previously funded wind power projects but not solar projects in the non-conventional energy category.         
	This will be a pilot project for us and the rate of interest for financing will be much less than the market rates, Garg said. The total cost of the project is Rs 41.2 crore, excluding land costs. Dishergarh Power will buy the entire output of the plant, which will be set up on an 8-acre plot. The plot belongs to Dishergarh Power.         
	Though the price of the electricity has not been decided, the Union government will give an incentive - a maximum of Rs 12 per unit for 10 years - to subsidise the generation cost that is expected to be Rs 15 per unit.         
	West Bengal Green Energy has drawn up an action plan to generate 400 mega watt power from renewable energy sources during the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012). It is estimated that the state has potential to add 10,000 mega watt from renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, tides and biomass.

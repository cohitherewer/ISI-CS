          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 16: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today clarified that mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) entering the domestic telecom sector will not be allowed to own spectrum or radiowaves.        
	MVNOs entering India will be able to foray into the mobile space without owning any infrastructure or spectrum but by buying air time from existing telecom operators, said Nripendra Misra, chairman of Trai, after an open house discussion with operators.        
	Misra said there would have to be a lock-in period for the MVNOs along with a security amount, which they would forfeit in case the company planned to exit business before the stipulated lock-in period.         
	Globally, under an MVNO model, telecom operators buy talk time on wholesale rates from existing operators and then sell it to subscribers under their own brand. Trai wants the same model to be followed in India.        
	An MVNO offers mobile voice and data services without actually owning any radiowaves or network infrastructure such as telecom towers or transmission equipment. The model enables new players to enter the telecom sector without the government having to dole out fresh spectrum or radiowaves.         
	Trai issued the clarification on spectrum ownership by MVNOs to dispel doubts raised by existing operators over the definition of an MVNO as stated in the consultation paper issued by the regulator.        
	Last month, Trai had issued a consultation paper on MVNOs where it stated that MVNO licensee is an entity that does not have an assignment of spectrum for access services (2G/3G/BWA) but can provide wireless (mobile) access services to customers by sharing the spectrum of the access provider.

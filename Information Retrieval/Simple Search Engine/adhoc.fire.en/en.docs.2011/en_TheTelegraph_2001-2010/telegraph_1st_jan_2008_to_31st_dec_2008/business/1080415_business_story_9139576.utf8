                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infosys keeps all on tenterhooks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, April 14: Infosys kicks off the fourth quarter earnings season tomorrow when it unveils its financial results  an event that assumes more than usual importance since the market should get some indications about how the widely anticipated US recession will impact Indias technology titans in the near term.        
	Infosys is seen as an oracle for the market as it is one of the few companies that gives guidance on topline and bottomline performance for the next quarter and the year as a whole based on current understanding of global currents.        
	The tech titan has been a bellwether for the market but, over the past few quarters, its prominence had waned a bit as the technology pack lost favour with the market mavens.        
	A large part of Infosys revenues comes from North America led by the US.        
	During the third quarter of the current fiscal that ended on December 31, 2007, the region accounted for over 62 per cent of its revenues.        
	The entire global market has been reeling due to concerns over US recession. Therefore, the Infosys results will be very important since it will be a vital indicator of what is happening there, says Dhiraj Sachdev, head of equity (PMS) at HSBC.        
	Harendra Kumar, head of research at ICICI Direct, encores that view.         
	The numbers will tell us how good or bad the situation in the US is.        
	Kumar adds that if Infosys comes out with a good guidance, the stock will get rerated and it will also bode well for the equity markets.        
	While declaring its third quarter numbers, Infosys had projected that income for the quarter ending March 31, 2008 would be in the range of Rs 4,477 crore and Rs 4,501 crore, a year on year growth of 18.7 to 19.3 per cent.        
	It added that for the year as a whole, income is expected to be between Rs 16,627 crore and Rs 16,651 crore, a growth rate of 19.7 to 19.9 per cent.        
	Analysts largely expect the company to beat its own forecast. But the key will be its guidance for this year.         
	The market is expecting a dollar revenue growth guidance of 17 to 20 per cent for the first quarter of the next fiscal. Anything above 20 per cent will be highly positive, sources said.        
	Infosys will declare its results at a time when mood across global stock markets has sagged after GE trimmed its earnings estimates.        
	 Analysts point out that with moderation in the Indian economys growth, the fourth quarter is unlikely to see strong numbers as witnessed earlier.         
	The estimated earnings growth is expected to be relatively much slower than the growth witnessed in the previous few quarters and indicates moderation in overall growth momentum, Sharekhan said in its fourth quarter earnings preview.        
	Kumar of ICICI Direct added that the quarter could be relatively subdued and it could see companies taking a hit on their margins because of high commodity or input prices.        
	Religare, another brokerage, has already lowered its 2007-08 estimates to factor in rising commodity prices, weak IIP numbers, growing inflation and forex derivative losses that some Indian companies are expected to report on their exposure to structured derivative contracts.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lead unit in Exide fold
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 18: Exide Industries Ltd has acquired a 51 per cent stake in Leadage Alloys India Ltd, a lead smelting company based in Bangalore.        
	The acquisition is part of Exides strategy to become self-sufficient in lead.        
	Prices of lead, which comprises up to 70 per cent of the input cost of a battery, have been very volatile in the last three years.         
	The Exide board had approved an investment of Rs 35 crore earlier this month for the acquisition.        
	A lead smelting unit of our own will not only give us better self sufficiency in this critical raw material in the long run but also help us have better control over the recycling of used batteries, said T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and chief executive officer of Exide Industries Ltd.         
	This is the second such acquisition by Exide after it bought Tandon Metals Ltd in October last year.        
	This investment in our own smelters is not just a backward integration project for Exide. It is part of our commitment to the environment, whereby we will have better control over the disposal of used batteries and plastics, said P.K. Kataky, director (automotive) of Exide Industries.        
	Lead prices are currently ruling at $1,801 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange. On May 14, 2008, its price was as high as $2,283 per tonne.         
	Lead is increasingly being used for auto and truck batteries, solders, bullets, paints and glazes in countries such as India and China.         
	Green signal        
	Exide has recently kicked off a nationwide green campaign for safe disposal of used batteries.        
	A large quantity of used and scrap batteries find their way to unauthorised smelters which have no pollution control measures and pose serious threat to the environment.

	 Chicago, April 27: The US Federal Reserve is expected to put an exclamation point on its string of interest rate cuts with a small reduction this week and may signal that its rate-cutting cycle is done for now.

	 Calcutta, April 27: The Tea Board will invite fresh bids from private parties for taking over closed tea gardens across the country.

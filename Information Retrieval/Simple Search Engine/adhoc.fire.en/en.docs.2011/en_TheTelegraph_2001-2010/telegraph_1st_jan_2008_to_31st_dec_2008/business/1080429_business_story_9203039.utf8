          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Looking ahead                                  
	Calcutta, April 28: Spencers Retail will announce international tie-ups in food and apparel shortly.        
	The retail arm of RPG Enterprises will form joint ventures with single brand food and garment retailers to set up stores across the country.        
	I can say with some degree of certainty that we will have more than two such joint ventures. Talks are at final stages, Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, said.        
	The government has allowed foreign direct investment up to 51 per cent in single brand retail.        
	Goenka did not clarify if Spencers will have a majority stake in these ventures, but added that the target audience would be that of Spencers.        
	Its going to be aimed at the upper middle-class, he said.        
	Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Retail recently tied up with Marks amp; Spencer. Italian fashion house Armani has formed a joint venture with DLF to launch its brands in India, while Raymond has an agreement with GAS for denim wear.        
	RPG has been scouting for foreign partners for quite sometime now. There were rumours it would bring in coffee retail chain Starbucks.        
	However, Goenka declined to give names.        
	Spencers will also sell toys through a tieup with UK brand Chad Valley. The Woolworths of the UK own the brand.

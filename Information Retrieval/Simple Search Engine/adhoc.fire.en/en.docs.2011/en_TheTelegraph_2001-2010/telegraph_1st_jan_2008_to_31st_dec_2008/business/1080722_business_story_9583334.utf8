          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, July 21: Shares of Reliance Communications (R-Com) sizzled today on the aftermath of Fridays break-up of its talks with South Africas MTN. The stock surged Rs 11.40, or 2.62 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange to close at Rs 446.60.         
	On Friday, R-Com and MTN had said that they were ending their talks because of certain legal and regulatory issues.         
	The R-Com stock had been tumbling on the bourses since May 26  the day Anil Ambani company announced that it was opening talks with MTN for a possible merger.         
	The stock plunged further after Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shot off letters on June 12 threatening legal action against R-Com and MTN if they went ahead with the deal.        
	This was followed by Anil Ambani accusing RIL of hammering the R-Com stock and demanding a probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India into the 19 per cent slide in R-Com shares.         
	On the other hand, MTN shares plunged nearly 4 per cent today. Shares of the company saw high fluctuations, touching an intra-day high of 128.75 rands and an intra-day low of 120.50 rands.        
	Meanwhile, R-Com today announced that it added 1.74 million mobile subscribers in June, which is being claimed as the highest ever monthly subscriber addition.         
	According to an R-Com statement, the telecom firm is now the worlds youngest and Asias fifth mobile operator to serve 50 million mobile customers. The encouraging trends make us confident of accelerating the growth momentum and serving the telephony needs of many more millions, said S.P. Shukla, president (personal business) of R-Com.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citigroup shuts down hedge fund
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citigroup shuts down hedge fund
                            
	New York, June 12 (PTI): Citigroup is closing Old Lane Partners, a hedge fund co-founded by chief executive Vikram Pandit, 11 months after the bank bought the firm for more than $800 million.        
	Mediocre returns and the loss of top managers have dogged Old Lane Partners, which Citigroup plans to shut and buy what is left of its assets, the Wall Street Journal reported today. Pandit, it said, personally reaped at least $165 million when Citigroup bought Old Lane in July 2007, following its founding the previous year.         
	At the time, many large banks and brokerages saw hedge funds as a lucrative new business. But as the fund struggled, Citigroup was forced to choose between pumping new money into it or shutting it down. That created an awkward situation for the new CEO, the journal said.         
	Pandit removed himself from the deliberations to avoid a conflict of interest, it added. Citigroup officials, the journal said, considered a plan to replenish Old Lane with anywhere between $1 billion and $3 billion of the banks own capital.

	New Delhi, June 17: The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has awarded contracts to Zoom Developers to set up hotels in Mangalore, Puducherry, Chennai (Egmore) and Coimbatore.        
	These locations were among the six left for bidding out of the 30 sites which IRCTC had selected for its Rail Ratna hotel project.         
	These budget hotels will cater to the growing demand of railway travellers, including tourists and business travellers, said Rameet Trehan, director of Zoom Developers.        
	Last year, Zoom Developers in a consortium with Royal Orchid Hotels had bagged deals for 11 sites, and later won the bid for Bhubaneswar in a tie-up with the Toshali Sands group.         
	The total tally of Zoom Developers now stands at 19 sites, with Essel and Signet Corporation having five and four, respectively, out of the total bids on offer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fed cuts key rate to 1%
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fed cuts key rate to 1%
                            
	Washington, Oct. 29 (Reuters): The US Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a hefty half-percentage point on Wednesday to prevent a widening credit crisis from tipping the United States into a deep and prolonged recession.        
	The Feds decision takes its target for overnight bank lending to 1 per cent, the lowest since June 2004. Wall Street was united in the opinion the Fed would lower rates, although views were split on the likely size of the move.        
	The US central bank has cut benchmark overnight rates from 5.25 per cent in nine steps over the past 13 months to counter a financial storm that started with the collapse of the US mortgage market and spread around the world.        
	Earlier in the day, China and Norway kicked off the latest round of global interest rate cuts as policy-makers tried to soften the worlds economic downturn.        
	Japan may cut rates on Friday and the European Central Bank and Britain are expected to add to the monetary easing next week as authorities remain fearful that the worst financial crisis in 80 years will cause a long global recession.        
	I think this is also part of a co-ordinated move of global central banks to bail out the financial markets, said Zhao Qingming, senior economist at China Construction Bank in Beijing.        
	Though other central banks have not announced rate cuts yet, we can see that, they are on the way, he said.

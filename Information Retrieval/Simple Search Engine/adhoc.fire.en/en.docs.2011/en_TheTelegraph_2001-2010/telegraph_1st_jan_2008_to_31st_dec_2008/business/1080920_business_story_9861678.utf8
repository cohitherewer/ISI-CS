	Sept. 19: Stocks worldwide soared on Friday as news of a sweeping US government plan to halt widespread turmoil in capital markets bolstered investor confidence and sent safe-haven bets sharply lower.        
	US market regulators issued an emergency ban on the short-selling of financial stocks on Friday, igniting big rallies in the sector that has been targeted by sellers as the credit crisis gathered pace.        
	The US ban came a day after the UK Financial Services Authority imposed its own temporary four-month ban on the short-selling of financial stocks. National market watchdogs in France, Portugal, and Ireland took similar steps.        
	In addition, the US treasury said it would establish a programme to guarantee money market fund holdings, aiming to prevent Wall Streets losses from spilling over into the wider economy.        
	Led by US treasury secretary Henry Paulson, officials are working on a solution to take over hundreds of billions of dollars worth of soured bank assets that have crippled the global financial system.        
	The rally, spurred by a surge in financial stocks, added to gains on Thursday, the best day on Wall Street in six years. All the major US indices were up around 4 per cent by 16:00 GMT. New York crude oil, too, crossed the $100-mark, while London gold was trading higher.         
	Leading European shares surged more than 7 per cent, Britains top share index soared more than 8 per cent and MSCIs leading emerging market index jumped almost 10 per cent.        
	Back home, stocks joined the party and the Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether index (sensex) jumped 727 points to close above the 14000-mark.        
	The rupee too gained 59 paise to Rs 45.83 per dollar. Observers said the sentiment was boosted by the strong rally in stocks, while exporters were seen selling dollars. The dollar also slipped against the euro. The sensex today opened firm on strong global cues and consolidated its gains.         
	There were fears that investors may resort to profit booking at higher levels and that the gains could be wiped out. But that did not happen, an analyst said.

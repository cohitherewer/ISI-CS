          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                          RUSH HOUR                                  
	Calcutta, April 28: A number of middle-level companies such as apparel brand Turtle and mobile phone maker GeePee are setting up manufacturing units in Calcutta.         
	Pune-based Dhariwal Industries, a Rs 800-crore diversified company, is also looking for a partner to set up a bottling plant for Manikchand Oxyrich, a brand of bottled water.        
	Turtle unit        
	Amit Ladsaria, director of Turtle, said: We have a capacity of 0.8 million pieces per year. The new facility will entail an investment of Rs 20 crore and have a capacity of two million pieces per year. We are looking for land and are ready to start work as soon as something is finalised.        
	Turtle manufactures mens clothing and accessories and has a turnover of Rs 60 crore. The company plans to double its owned stores in the country from the existing 25 by 2010.        
	Turtle also retails through stores and malls other than its own shops and has 383 points of sales in the country. It has also expanded to Kuwait, Muscat and Saudi Arabia.        
	GeePee mobiles        
	GeePee Infotech, which is into mobile handsets, textiles and television programming, is planning to invest Rs 60 crore to set up a plant with a capacity of four million handsets per annum spread over 100,000 sq ft.        
	We used to import phones from China and package them here. We will now form a joint venture with a mobile phone manufacturer in China for the plant in Calcutta, said G.S Agarwal, managing director of GeePee Infotech.        
	The plant will provide direct and indirect employment to 1,000 people. GeePee branded phones were launched last year, including a dual SIM card model.        
	Manikchand Oxyrich        
	Launched in 2003, the Manikchand Oxyrich brand claims to be a 300 per cent oxygenated mineral water and commands a premium pricing (Rs 15 for 1 litre) in the market.         
	The company plans to set up a bottling facility in Calcutta or take over an existing plant.        
	We want to expand our presence in the east and are, therefore, looking at Calcutta to set up a bottling unit. We have Oxyrich plants in Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Hardwar, Aurangabad and Kolhapur.

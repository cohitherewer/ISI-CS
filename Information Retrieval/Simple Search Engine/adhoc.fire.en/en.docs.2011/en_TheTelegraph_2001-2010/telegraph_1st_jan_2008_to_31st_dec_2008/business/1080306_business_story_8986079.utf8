                                                                                                               Mitsui goes for a bike ride with Yamaha
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NEW JOURNEY                                  
	New Delhi, March 5: Mitsui of Japan will pick up a 30 per cent stake in India Yamaha Motor Private Ltd, which will replace the existing Yamaha Motor India Ltd.        
	The joint venture, India Yamaha Motor (IYM), will take over the existing manufacturing facilities and business operations of Yamaha Motor from April.         
	Yamaha, which has so far invested Rs 160 crore in the Indian operations, said it planned to eventually take it to Rs 560 crore to strengthen its position.        
	After the restructuring, the company hoped its sales would touch Rs 1,000 crore in the first year of operations (nine-month period starting April).        
	Mitsui, which last year acquired a 3 per cent stake in Yamaha, will pick up a 30 per cent stake in IYM, Yamaha said in a statement.        
	In this way, IYM will increase its total capital to the planned Rs 560 crore (approximately 14.6 billion yen) and utilise the same factory and office facilities used by its predecessor, Yamaha Motor India beginning from April, it added.        
	Based on this, Yamaha Motor India will promptly begin the closing of its books and corporate liquidation, it said. At present, Yamaha employs about 2,000 people in India.         
	Yamaha had entered into a joint venture with the Escorts group in 1996 to manufacture motorcycles in India. Since 2001, the company had been operating as a 100 per cent subsidiary of Yamaha Motor Corporation.        
	In 2005, a separate company, Yamaha Motor India Sales Private Ltd, was set up to take care of the marketing activity.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, July 15: Fitch Ratings today trimmed its credit outlook for India to negative  sending stocks, bonds and the rupee into a deep nosedive.        
	Fitch expressed concern that government finances would come under strain because of mounting subsidies, interest payments and wages. The rating agency ranks Indias local currency debt at BBB-, its lowest investment grade.        
	Last week, Standard amp; Poors warned that it could slash Indias credit rating to junk bond status if the government was unable to rein in inflation and control its widening current account and fiscal deficits.        
	The revision to the local currency outlook is based on a considerable deterioration in the central governments fiscal position, combined with a notable increase in government debt issuance to finance subsidies not captured in the budget, James McCormack, Fitchs head of Asia sovereign ratings, said in a statement today.        
	The Fitch comment spooked the markets with the sensex  the bellwether index  tumbling to a 15-month low at 12676.19 points, down 654.32 points from its previous close.        
	The National Stock Exchanges Nifty plunged 178.60 points, or 4.42 per cent, to close the day at 3861.10 points.        
	Fitch said bonds issued to oil and fertiliser companies would soar to at least 2 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this fiscal year, implying an underlying deficit of 6.5 per cent.         
	It said the Reserve Bank of India might have to further raise borrowing costs as inflation approaches 12 per cent. Fitch cut its GDP forecast to 7.7 per cent for the current fiscal year from 8 per cent.         
	Weaker economic growth and higher real interest rates would affect the fiscal out-turn and further undermine international capital flows, todays statement said.        
	In January 2007, S amp;P had raised Indias debt rating to investment grade for the first time in 14 years. S amp;P increased the rating by one level to BBB- from BB+.         
	ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank were the worst hit by the talk of rating downgrades, the slide exacerbated by fears of greater credit turmoil in the worlds financial markets. ICICI dropped 8.6 per cent to Rs 529.15, its lowest level since July 24, 2006. HDFC Bank fell 11 per cent to Rs 918.15, the sharpest drop since it listed in 1995.        
	The 10-year bonds declined sharply with the yield on the 8.24 per cent note rising to as high as 9.47 per cent. At the same time, the rupee sank as much as 0.7 per cent to 42.23 to the dollar.        
	Ranbaxy Laboratories  roiled by charges in the US that it had sold adulterated drugs  remained the top loser among the sensex stocks. It dropped Rs 66.10, or 14 per cent, to Rs 409.20, its most since April 28, 1993.         
	Crude plunge        
	Oil dropped more than $9 on Tuesday, the largest drop in dollar terms in 17 years, as growing concern about the economic health of top energy consumer the United States stirred demand worries. US crude tumbled $7.30 to $137.88 a barrel at 1:17 p.m

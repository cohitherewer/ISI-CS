          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          (From right) Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath, defence minister A.K. Antony and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government plans to unwrap a series of measures to boost the economy, beginning tomorrow, and take steps to prevent the dumping of goods from countries such as China.        
	This will not be a single package. There will be a first package, a second and a third part to it, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said here today.        
	The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut rates, and the Manmohan Singh government is likely to announce fiscal incentives and a reduction in duties for some industries.        
	Officials said a number of measures to protect domestic industry is on the cards, including the prevention of the dumping of goods, a rise in import duties and restrictions on imports. Besides these, the government is reviewing the quality control norms for imports.        
	Steps to help exporters sell their goods in the domestic market may also be announced.        
	Infrastructure may get budgetary support of Rs 15,000 crore, while commercial vehicles could get excise relief.        
	Non-banking financial companies along with automobiles and housing are expected to get special credit facilities. Also under consideration is an incentive package worth Rs 2,000 crore for exporters. Exports had declined by over 12 per cent in October.         
	According to Sonal Varma, an economist with Nomura, The demand from the OECD countries has slackened considerably and is likely to remain anaemic through 2009. We expect year-on-year export growth to remain negative until mid-2009. OECD is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and comprises the developed countries and some medium-income nations.         
	In the package for exporters, an interest relief of 2.5 per cent is on the cards, while for leather, textile, gems and jewellery the relief can be 4.5 per cent. Incentives on the duty drawback scheme and norms for easier access to long-term credit are also being worked out.                          
	Sources said the guidelines for foreign loans might be relaxed to let real estate companies tide themselves over a funds crunch. Under consideration is a debt recast plan for real estate.

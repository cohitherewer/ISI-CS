The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel price gives headache
                                                                                                               Steel price gives headache
          SAMBIT SAHA                                                PASWAN:SHARING CONCERN      
	Burnpur, March 18: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has expressed concern about the steady rise of steel prices in the country.        
	Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Prime Minister had spoken to him about the recent spurt in prices. I received a call from the Prime Minister today. He is concerned, Paswan said in Burnpur. The minister said he would consult the Prime Ministers Office to address the problem.        
	One of the options being contemplated by the ministry is to set up an independent regulator to monitor prices.        
	I have done that in the past in telecom. I will again do it in steel if private players failed to take note of the circumstances, he said.         
	The steel ministry has set up a monitoring committee under joint secretary J. Elias for steel prices.        
	Paswan said private players were raising prices without taking the committee into confidence.        
	Steel prices have risen Rs 5,000-6,000 a tonne in the last three months as companies passed on a hike in raw material prices to users. Another round of hike is in the offing in April when global iron ore mining majors Vale and Rio Tinto raise prices by 65 per cent.        
	Benchmark hot-rolled coil prices are now hovering at Rs 35,000 a tonne in the domestic market. Paswan admitted that there had been a rise in the cost of inputs  iron ore and coking coal  but doubted whether it could push up steel prices to the extent it had.        
	In February, Paswan forced steel companies to roll back by Rs 500 the price hike they had effected that month.        
	However, this is for the first time that the Prime Minister is intervening.         
	Only last month Paswan had said that the government would not like to be seen as meddling in the affairs of steel companies. Now it looks poll politics is weighing more on the government than economic reason.

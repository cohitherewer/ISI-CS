          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Indian Railways today raised the freight rates on cement, coal and coke by 100 basis points.        
	The move, which a railways spokesperson described as routine and minor, was severely opposed by industry which said it went against the spirit of a stimulus package announced by the government yesterday.        
	The freight rates  which will take effect from today  for these products now stand at 8 per cent per tonne against 7 per cent previously.         
	Railway officials said that the hike meant an addition of just a rupee to the cost of a bag of cement. After the 4 per cent value-added tax rebate, this is but a minor increase. We were suffering lower rates but had made no changes as we did not want the economy to suffer higher prices, the officials said.         
	However, analysts said coal and coke users  such as power and steel firms  would have to shell out about Rs 3 lakh more for a rake, which has a capacity of nearly 3,800 tonnes.         
	Coal and coke users said they would approach the government seeking a rollback. Assocham secretary-general, D.S. Rawat said he was surprised by the move. With this increased levy, the bulk consumers would be worst affected.         
	In a statement, Assocham said the increase in freight rates had serious implications and would undo the relief measures of the RBI and government and push up inflation, which has ebbed.         
	If coal and coke cost goes up, our cost goes up, JSW group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao said. The move will put pressure on all the companies operating in the infrastructure sector, he said.        
	Ispat Industries vice-chairman and managing director Vinod Mittal said, This is the time to stimulate the customer and the demand (and) not hurt the sentiments and the prevailing cost. The railways should reduce the freight rate.        
	SAIL officials said it would take up the increase through the steel ministry and try to get the railways revoke its decision.A notification of the railways said the hike came as part of its revision for classification of cement from class 140 to class 150 and coal and coke from class 140 to class 150 for trainload movement.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dhoot: Upbeat                                  
	Calcutta, June 12: Videocon plans to set up a 20 mega watt solar power plant in Purulia at an investment of Rs 500 crore.        
	After meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings today, Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot announced the groups latest initiative in Bengal. Dhoots business interests range from consumer electronics to oil and gas.        
	Videocon, which took over the Philips factory at Salt Lake some years back, is one of the early investors in the state. The group has already announced a number of projects for Bengal.         
	Significant among them are a Rs 15000-crore steel and power plant near Asansol, an infotech SEZ in Siliguri, a large infotech park at Salt Lake and two knowledge parks  one each at Kalyani and in Siliguri.        
	According to a company official, 100 acres of land for the solar power plant will be acquired soon.        
	I have told the chief minister that all the projects are progressing well. He asked me if there is any problem. I said no, Dhoot told reporters at Writers Buildings.        
	The construction of the infotech special economic zone (SEZ), over a 25-acre plot in Siliguri, is on and is expected to be operational by March next year.        
	Land acquisition for the steel plant near Asnasol is in full swing. Dhoot hoped that construction would start later this year.        
	The company has proposed to acquire 4,000 acres of land, mostly on its own, through direct negotiations with owners. It plans to build a 6-million-tonne steel plant and a 1600MW coal-based power plant.        
	We are awaiting coal linkage from the government, Dhoot said.        
	Company sources indicated that the knowledge parks would come up on over 500 acres each. They would require a cumulative investment of Rs 6,000 crore.

                                                                                                               Bengal plans social survey
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: The Bengal government is going to undertake a socio-economic survey of districts that have received huge private investments. The survey will study the impact of industrialisation on the people of such areas.        
	The Indian Statistical Institute, Jadavpur University and Calcutta University are among those appointed by the government to carry out the survey.        
	We are doing this survey to understand the issues concerning local people in areas where they are selling their land to pave the way for industrial development. The prime concern of the state is to ensure that these people do not suffer. The survey will also highlight problems in these areas, including available social infrastructure, said Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen.        
	He was speaking at an interactive session at Infocom 2007-08.        
	The survey will be conducted in Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore and be funded by the corporate houses who are setting up big projects in the state.        
	The state government is also in talks with the CII to set up an institute that will act as a finishing school and a skill upgradation centre for workers. The certification will be provided by an international organisation.        
	Highlighting the problem of scarcity of land in the state, Sen said a lot of land was locked in liquidation problems or with companies that had been referred to the BIFR.

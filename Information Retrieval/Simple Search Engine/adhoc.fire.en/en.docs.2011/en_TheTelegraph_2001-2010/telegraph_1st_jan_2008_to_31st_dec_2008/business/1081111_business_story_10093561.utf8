          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 10: McNally Bharat, Brij Mohan Khaitan groups engineering firm, today approved the transfer of its products division to McNally Sayaji Engineering. The division makes equipment for infrastructure and engineering projects.        
	McNally Bharat Engineering (MBE) had acquired Gujarat-based Sayaji Iron amp; Engineering earlier this year and renamed it McNally Sayaji Engineering Ltd (MSEL). Sayaji Iron amp; Engineering used to make infrastructure equipment, too.        
	The transfer of the division will help align products business and enhance shareholders value in the days ahead, chairman Deepak Khaitan said.        
	The boards of MBE and McNally Sayaji have approved the plan today. The restructuring process will take another four months to complete.        
	Four factories under the products division will be transferred to MSEL, including a new one in Asansol where the group has invested Rs 40 crore.        
	MSEL in its new avatar is expected to close the year with a turnover of Rs 210 crore.        
	I am expecting 35 per cent compounded annual growth for this company in the next few years, Khaitan said.        
	The business is expected to touch Rs 1,000 crore by 2014-15.

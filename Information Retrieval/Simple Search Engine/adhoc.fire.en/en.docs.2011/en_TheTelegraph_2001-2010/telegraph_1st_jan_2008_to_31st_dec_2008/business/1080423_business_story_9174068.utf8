                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Corporate India to go slow on hiring 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Calcutta, April 22: The slowdown in the global economy and strong rupee are expected to throw a spanner in India Incs recruitment plans, with the hiring outlook for the April-June period declining 6 per cent over the previous quarter, a latest survey says.        
	According to TeamLease Services, a staffing firm, the net employment outlook index has dipped 6 per cent from the previous quarter to 74 points, while there is a 9 per cent fall in the business outlook index to 70 points over the corresponding period last year.        
	The not so positive pointers in the market, right from dollar depreciation, sub-prime fiasco followed by the US recession and finally the turmoil in stock markets, have definitely impacted the employment growth in the last few months. said Sampath Shetty, vice-president of TeamLease Services.        
	The IT amp; ITeS sector is the worst hit.        
	The current financial market has influenced the not-so-optimistic business outlook over the next quarter, which has had implications in the engineering sector.         
	But with the India growth story fundamentally well grounded, it has resulted in encouraging hiring plans by the retail, FMCG, telecom and insurance sectors, Shetty added.        
	The employment outlook index  the difference between the percentage of respondents who report an increase in hiring needs and the percentage who report a decline over the next three months  is 74 on a national basis for this quarter, a drop from 80 last quarter.        
	The survey said there was an increase in the employment outlook in Mumbai, Delhi and Pune.         
	The decrease is in Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.         
	The index points for Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad have fallen steeply, while the index for Calcutta is on a steady decline.        
	The business outlook index, computed by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say business in the next three months is likely to increase from the percentage who say it will decrease, stands at 70, a drop of nine points from the previous quarter.        
	There has been a decrease in business outlook points across all cities, except Delhi.         
	A major decrease has been seen in Chennai (34 points). There was a decline in the last four quarters in Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.         
	Business confidence looks grim especially in IT amp; ITeS in the new financial year.        
	At this stage, the challenge for organisations would be to consolidate their resources for optimal productivity, the report said.

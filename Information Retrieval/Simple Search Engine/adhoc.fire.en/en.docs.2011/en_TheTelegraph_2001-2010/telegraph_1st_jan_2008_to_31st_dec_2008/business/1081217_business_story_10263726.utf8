          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: BK Birla group flagship Kesoram Industries has decided to close its tyre unit in Orissa for 14 days because of low sales.        
	The companys plant at Balasore has a capacity of 252 tonnes per day and caters to Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Mahindra amp; Mahindra.        
	The company has notified the share markets that it would stop production from tomorrow till the end of this month.        
	The tyre division of Kesoram  Birla Tyres  has another plant in Uttarakhand. While the older plant in Orissa supplies to the original equipment manufacturers, the new plant at Hardwar caters to the retail market.        
	Shiv Kumar Parik, director of Kesoram, said production at the Uttarakhand plant was on. There is no problem. It is doing well. But in Balasore, the original equipment manufacturers are not picking up tyres, he said.        
	A number of auto firms have resorted to production cuts to prevent the piling up of inventories. Kesoram has also warned of a further cut in production if the situation does not improve.        
	The company said the decision was taken to avoid increase in working capital particularly the inventory and debtors due to shutdown of operations by major auto manufacturers.

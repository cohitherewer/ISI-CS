	Berlin, Jan. 27 (AFP): The Tatas are planning to buy a stake in a high-tech unit of German company Deutsche Telekom.         
	The acquisition will see thousands of jobs outsourced, according to a German weekly newsmagazine.        
	In a report, the German magazine, Focus, said the Tata group was on the verge of acquiring the systems integration business of Deutsche Telekom unit T-Systems.        
	It said there were only a few final legal issues to resolve.        
	The Deutsche Telekom unit employs about 13,000 IT specialists.         
	The magazine said about half of those jobs would now be sent to India.        
	A Deutsche Telekom spokesman declined to comment.

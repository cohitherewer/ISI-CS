                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Idea sets date for Spice open offer
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 30: Idea Cellular along with Telekom Malaysia International will make an open offer for an additional 20 per cent stake in Spice Communications.        
	The Aditya Birla group firm has made the open offer to buy up to 138 million shares at Rs 77.30 each for about $250 million. The offer opens on August 22 and will close on September 11, Idea said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The mandatory open offer follows a three-way deal struck last week, under which Idea Cellular acquired a 40.8 per cent stake in Spice Communications for Rs 2,700 crore.        
	Idea will also make a preferential allotment of 464.73 million shares to Telekom Malaysia at Rs 156.96 apiece, representing 14.99 per cent of Ideas equity capital after the allotment.         
	The Rs 2700-crore payout for Modis stake includes a non-compete fee of Rs 544 crore to ensure that Spice does not venture into the mobile communication business for at least the next three years.         
	After the merger and the preferential allotment, the promoters stake in Idea will go down to 4648 per cent, while Telekom Malaysia will hold between 18 per cent and 20 per cent of the merged entity, depending on the response to the open offer. The public will hold the rest.        
	The swap ratio has been worked out at 49 shares of Idea for every 100 shares held in Spice Communciations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BlackBerry safe for now, talks next week
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BlackBerry safe for now, talks next week
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          JARRING NOTE                                  
	New Delhi, April 17: BlackBerry services are unlikely to be affected just now even as the government sent letters to telecom operators saying that certain services can be curtailed by security agencies when needed.        
	According to sources, security agencies will hold a meeting with Research In Motion (RIM), the maker of BlackBerry, and telecom department officials early next week to sort out the concerns.         
	Earlier in the day, minister of state for communications Jyotiraditya Scindia told Parliament, in a written reply, that instructions have been issued to all mobile service providers, inter alia, asking them not to connect or provide/run certain BlackBerry services unless the required monitoring systems are in place.        
	The junior telecom ministers observation gave rise to apprehension that BlackBerry services might get affected in the near future.        
	However, on Wednesday, minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal had said the government was not restricting the use of BlackBerry services in India. Security agencies have raised concerns that the use of BlackBerry posed a risk as emails sent using it could not be traced or intercepted. The government is in talks with RIM and the four telecom operators which provide the services in India. Security agencies have access to emails sent through a normal Internet-based mail account to a Blackberry number or vice-versa.         
	However, they do not have access to emails sent from one Blackberry mobile to another as it is in a code form. Moreover, the servers are located in Canada and other foreign locations. They, therefore, feel the service can pose a threat to the nations safety as terror groups could misuse the device.        
	DoT officials said RIM could be asked to store email traffic in a server in India that could be accessed by the agencies under special circumstances. The other solution could be the security agencies getting decryption keys. That would need an agreement between the governments of India and Canada, where RIMs headquarters are located.

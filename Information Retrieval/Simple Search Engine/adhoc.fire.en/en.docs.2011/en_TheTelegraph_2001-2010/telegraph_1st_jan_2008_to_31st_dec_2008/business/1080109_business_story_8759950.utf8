	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Industry representatives today asked the government to cut personal and corporate tax rates in the coming budget.        
	They also demanded the removal of the minimum alternate tax and dividend distribution tax, and a cut in excise duty on most manufactured goods to 14 per cent from 16 per cent to sustain high economic growth.         
	The industry placed these demands in a pre-budget meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram here today.        
	The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Assocham recommended that the basic exemption limit for individuals should be raised to Rs 1,50,000, and the peak income tax rate should be reduced to 25 per cent from 30 per cent.

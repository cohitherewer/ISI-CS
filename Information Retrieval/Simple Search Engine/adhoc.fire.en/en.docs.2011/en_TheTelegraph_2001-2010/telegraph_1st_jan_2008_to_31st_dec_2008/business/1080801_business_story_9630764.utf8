                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nath holds out hope for trade deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, July 31: The WTO talks, which collapsed in Geneva this week, with India and China accusing the US for the failure, could resume around the middle of next year.        
	I told the WTO directorgeneral that India was ready to be on the table without compromising on issues which concern poor farmers, Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath told reporters here today.        
	Nath said the collapse should be treated as a pause rather than a breakdown. I am hopeful that the process will start again. India stands ready whenever the process resumes, he said.        
	Commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said the talks were more likely to restart around the middle of next year.         
	The nine-day WTO ministerial meet broke down on July 29 after the US refused to agree to proposals from India and China that they should be allowed to impose extra 25 per cent duties if imports were up 15 per cent on farm products.        
	The US said the trigger for the extra duty should be given only after imports surge 40 per cent over the average of the preceeding three years.         
	By the time we have a 40 per cent surge in imports, our farmers would have committed suicides, Nath said, adding that this trigger was not acceptable.         
	Nath said the US created the deadlock on an issue which was not linked to trade but related to the livelihood of farmers. The US thought it fit to create an impasse on a safeguard mechanism, not on commercial interest but livelihood, he said.        
	FDI in retail         
	Nath today said the government had no plans to relax the existing foreign direct investment rules in retail.        
	At present, the fdi limit for retail is fixed at 51 per cent for single brands, while multi-brand retailers are allowed to operate through franchisees.        
	However, the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations had said in a report that organised retail had no major impact on small grocery stores.         
	The study recommended a nationwide uniform licensing policy to facilitate modern retailing in the country.

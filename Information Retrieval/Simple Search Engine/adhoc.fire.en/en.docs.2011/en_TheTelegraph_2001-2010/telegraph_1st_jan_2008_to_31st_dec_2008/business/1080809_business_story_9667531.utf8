          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The government today approved the capital restructuring of Punjab amp; Sind Bank (P amp;S Bank) to enable it to raise money through an initial public offering (IPO).        
	Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the cabinet committee on economic affairs had approved P amp;S Banks restructuring plan that involved the conversion of a major portion of its equity into bonds and preference shares.         
	The government will convert Rs 160 crore of equity into tier I debt and another Rs 200 crore into preference shares under tier II debt, Sibal told reporters after the cabinet meeting.         
	The Delhi-based public sector lender will have an equity capital of Rs 183 crore after the restructuring, Sibal said.         
	The capital restructuring will help the bank comply with Basel-II requirements and get a reasonable premium in an initial public offering, he said.         
	P amp;S Bank has an equity capital of Rs 743 crore, of which it has proposed to convert Rs 500 crore into preference shares. The bank reported a 60 per cent rise in profit at Rs 51.5 lakh for the year ended March 2008. The government is considering diluting a 10 per cent stake in the bank through the proposed IPO. P amp;S Bank and Calcutta-based United Bank of India are the only two banks which are now 100 per cent owned by the government.         
	Urea policy        
	The government today announced a policy to encourage investment in urea and reduce subsidies, which have touched Rs 70,000 crore.        
	According to the new norms, domestic manufacturers will get 85-95 per cent of the international price subject to a price band of $250-425 per tonne.        
	The new policy will encourage investment in the urea sector and also lead to saving subsidy because of import substitution at prices below import price parity, Sibal said.

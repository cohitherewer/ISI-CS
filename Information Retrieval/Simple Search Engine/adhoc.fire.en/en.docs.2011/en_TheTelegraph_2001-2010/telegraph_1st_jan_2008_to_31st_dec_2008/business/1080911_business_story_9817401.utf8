          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept. 10: The rupee tumbled below the psychological level of 45 against the dollar for the first time in 22 months and ended distinctly weak at 45.12.         
	The fall came amid concerns about equity sales by global funds and a sharp increase in the value of the greenback against other global currencies.         
	Analysts are worried that the burgeoning current account deficit would lead to a sharp increase in capital outflows. The rupee fell 28 paise from its previous close of Rs 44.83 to a dollar.         
	The cassandras fear the rupee will soon dip to 46 against the dollar in the next few days because of the widening gulf between dollar demand and supply. Others, however, reckon that the Reserve Bank will intervene to stem the slide.         
	The rupee came under pressure right from the start of trading when it resumed nine paise lower at Rs 44.94 per dollar. Dealing room circles said that the 45-mark was breached in late morning deals itself.         
	Reports indicated that the central bank made a mild intervention when the rupee dipped to Rs 45.15. However, sentiment was against the local currency throughout the day.         
	Several factors have been responsible for the weakening of the rupee: oil companies are swarming to buy dollars to finance crude purchases, while dollar supplies have been depressed because exporters are hanging on to their dollar remittances.         
	Gold also fell $8.9 an ounce, touching the lowest price since October, on speculation that a drop in commodity prices and a stronger dollar will reduce demand for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.

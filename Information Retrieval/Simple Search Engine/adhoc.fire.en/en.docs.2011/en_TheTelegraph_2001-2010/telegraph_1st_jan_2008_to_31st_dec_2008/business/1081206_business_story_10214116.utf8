          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Dec. 5: The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut both the repo and the reverse repo rates tomorrow and send a strong signal to banks that they should trim both their deposit and lending rates.        
	Bankers feel that the RBI is likely to bring down the repo rate by at least 100 basis points and the reverse repo rate by 50 basis points.         
	The repo is the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity to banks. The reverse repo is the rate at which it mops up funds from banks against securities. At present, the repo rate stands at 7.50 per cent and the reverse repo rate at 6 per cent.        
	We will definitely look at our asset liability position soon after the RBIs decision on a rate cut, State Bank of India chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.         
	Last month, the SBI reduced its benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points to 13 per cent.        
	Several bankers said the RBI was unlikely to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) as the system is flush with cash. CRR, which is that portion of bank deposits that must be compulsorily placed with the RBI, is now at 5.50 per cent.        
	Most bankers expect a 100 basis point cut in the repo rate, but there are a few who are expecting the central bank to slash it by 150 basis points.        
	Harihar Krishnamurthy, country treasurer at Development Credit Bank, expects RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao to go in for a 100 basis point reduction in the repo rate and a 50 basis point cut in the reverse repo rate.        
	He reckons that a CRR cut is unlikely as the system has a current surplus of over Rs 56,000 crore.        
	The strong speculation about a cut in the two benchmark rates comes at a time when inflation has started declining rapidly. With petrol and diesel prices cut, inflation is set to fall further in the coming weeks.        
	The cut in repo and reverse repo could complement the stimulus package that the government might also announce. Through the cuts, the RBI will be sending a message to banks that they must not only cut lending rates but also bring down their deposit rates, said Krishnamurthy.

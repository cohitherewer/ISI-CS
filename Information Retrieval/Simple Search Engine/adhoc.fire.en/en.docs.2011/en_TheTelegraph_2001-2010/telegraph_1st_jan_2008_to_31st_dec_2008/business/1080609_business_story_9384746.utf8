                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Foreign stake in ONGC block 
          VIVEK NAIR                          Strategic move                                  
	Mumbai, June 8: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will sell stakes in its block in the Krishna-Godavari basin to Petrobras of Brazil and Norways StatoilHydro.         
	At present, ONGC holds a 90 per cent stake in the block, while Cairn Energy India has the remaining 10 per cent.         
	According to the new structure proposed, ONGCs interest in the block will come down to 65 per cent. Cairn will continue to have a 10 per cent stake. Of the rest, Petrobras will have 15 per cent and StatoilHydro another 10 per cent.        
	ONGCs proposal was okayed by the directorate general of hydrocarbons, which forwarded it to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for approval.         
	The top management of the state-run oil firm had recently said the company was planning to join hands with leading global companies for developing blocks in the Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi basins.         
	Sources said the Krishna-Godavari basin block was adjacent to Reliance Industries KG-D6 block, off the east coast. The block was first awarded to Cairn in the first round of bidding under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp) in 1999. Cairn later sold 90 per cent in the block to ONGC.        
	According to estimates, the block has around 2 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.         
	Though ONGC officials were not available for comment, industry circles say the oil producer may have brought in the two entrants to leverage their expertise, particularly in deep sea hydrocarbon exploration.         
	They are perhaps optimistic about the prospects of the block and so the two new participants have been brought in, the source added.         
	ONGC recently got the Centres approval to conduct an appraisal of the block to help it understand the commercial viability of the project. An appraisal is prepared and submitted by the contractor within a stipulated time frame outlining a work schedule and a budget.         
	StatoilHydro came into being after the merger of Statoil and Norsk Hydros oil and gas division. Statoil and Norsk Hydro have been the most important players in the Norwegian oil industry. StatoilHydros net worth is at over $32 billion.         
	So far, the ONGC-Cairn duo have been able to exceed the minimum work programme assigned in various fronts, including 2D and 3D seismic data and exploratory wells. Present regulations stipulate that companies bidding for various blocks under Nelp will have to commit work schedules and fulfil them as well.         
	ONGC had earlier indicated that it would invest around $5 billion in the Krishna-Godavari basin along with its partners. The target is to produce around 25 million standard cubic meters per day of gas in the next five years.

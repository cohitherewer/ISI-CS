The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals limber up for Bengal steel project
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jindals limber up for Bengal steel project
          SAMBIT SAHA                           On fast track                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: JSW Bengals 10-million-tonne (mt) steel plant in the state is ready for a takeoff with the company set to roll out an iron ore beneficiation unit and a pellet plant in the first phase.         
	It has earmarked Rs 4,000 crore for the two units along with the development of two deep-pit coal blocks. JSW plans to invest Rs 3,200 crore in the 8mt beneficiation plant and the 6mt pellet plant. This will take care of the iron ore needs of the plant, which will come up at Salboni in West Midnapur district.         
	The development of the coal blocks at Sitarampur and Kuti will cost the company about Rs 800 crore. The company plans to finance the project in a debt-equity ratio of 2:1. It has achieved financial closure for the first phase, with the State Bank of India being the lead banker.         
	We have divided the project into two phases. First, the company will kick off with the raw material side. After assuring the supply, we will go into steel making, Seshagiri Rao, director (finance) of JSW Steel, told The Telegraph.        
	Work on the steel plant, which will produce semi-finished product slabs, will start later. However, the completion of the 3mt steel plant and the iron ore beneficiation and pellet plants is likely to be over at the same time, in 2012.         
	The project cost of the first phase has been estimated at Rs 9,800 crore. Earlier, JSW Steel vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal had said that he would have to scale down the size of the Salboni steel unit to 3mt from 6mt in the first phase.         
	He did not offer any explanation, but the fear of a slowdown in the economy, curbs on steel exports and rising borrowing costs were believed to have prompted the decision.         
	The Jindals have tied up with private mine owners in the Barbil area in the Bengal-Orissa border for iron ore fines. Earlier, the company had also considered building the beneficiation plant close to the mines.         
	Beneficiation is a process under which extracted ore from mining is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing, or direct use.         
	Beneficiation is generally used for low-grade iron ore. Since JSWs Bengal plant will not have access to captive iron ore mines, it will have to depend on inferior quality fines.

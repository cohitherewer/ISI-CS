	Mumbai, Sept. 20: The Ruias promoted Essar Steel Holdings will invest over $4 billion in North America, including $1.6 billion in a mine-based steel plant in Minnesota.        
	Essar remains committed to North America with investments of over $4 billion in the region, Essar group chairman Sashi Ruia said in a company release.        
	Essar will invest $500 million in the next five years to expand its Canada unit  Essar Steel Algoma  which it acquired last year. The company also plans to set up a steel plant in Trinidad amp; Tobago, for which no concrete investment commitment has been made.        
	The Minnesota plant, for which a groundbreaking ceremony was held yesterday, will have a 2.5-million-tonne capacity, a company spokesperson said.        
	Last year, Essar Steel Holdings, a subsidiary of Essar Global Ltd, acquired Minnesota Steel.         
	The Minnesota unit has more than 1.4 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves in the Mesabi region.        
	Besides iron ore mining and production, the project will include a concentration plant, a pellet plant, a direct-reduced iron plant and steel-making facilities, the release said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Maheshwari: Upbeat                                  
	Calcutta, June 16: ArcelorMittal today strengthened its foothold across continents while announcing two major acquisitions in the US and Europe.        
	The worlds largest steel maker today said it acquired Bayou Steel, a maker of structural products in the US, for $475 million.        
	In another announcement, the company said it had bought an additional 11.31 per cent stake in Turkeys Erdemir for $869.25 million to increase its holding to 24.98 per cent.        
	Bayou Steel, which has facilities in Laplace, Louisiana, Harrinman and Tennessee, produces medium and light structural steel and bar-sized products.         
	Its Louisiana unit produces billets, angles, flats, channels, standard beams and wide flange beams.        
	The Erdemir stake buy, however, came amid speculation that ArcelorMittal could be looking to buy out the entire company.        
	Ordu Yardimlasma Kurumu or Oyak, an army pension fund, is the largest shareholder in Erdemir.         
	It raised its stake in Erdemir to more than 50 per cent after buying a 49 per cent stake from the Turkish government for $3 billion in 2005.         
	At one point of time, Oyak was even looking for an international partner but it dropped the plan subsequently.        
	ArcelorMittal bought the Erdemir shares from Socit Grale, Nextgen, Capital Limited and Credit Suisse International.         
	Sudhir Maheshwari, senior executive vice-president of ArcelorMittal and a member of the companys group management board, said, We are pleased to make this strategic investment in Erdemir, which we see as a very attractive company in a rapidly growing economy with excellent prospects for further growth.         
	Erdemir has posted a 57 per cent rise in first-quarter profit. The steel maker is expected to report a profit of nearly $1 billion this year, up from $544 million in 2007.        
	Incidentally, Oyak had bought Erdemir after defeating erstwhile Mittal Steel and Arcelor and Russias Severstal in a televised auction process.

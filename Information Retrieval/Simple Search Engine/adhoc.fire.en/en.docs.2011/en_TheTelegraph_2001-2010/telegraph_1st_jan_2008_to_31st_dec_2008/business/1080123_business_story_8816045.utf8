     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Tuesday dawned with more bloodbath on the bourses, but the government was quick to hit the crisis management button, triggering a series of behind-the-scene moves which perhaps helped the stock markets regain some lost ground.
    
	The three key managers of the economy  the Prime Ministers Office, the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India  were in constant touch throughout the days massive meltdown. The secretary (financial sector) cancelled a trip out of town to stay and monitor the situation. 
    
	The market dipped more than 11 per cent in the first few minutes of trade today as panic-stricken investors dumped stocks, setting off circuit breakers that automatically halted trade for an hour.
    
	Soon after a round of consultations among the economy managers in the morning, banks, financial institutions and state-controlled mutual funds jumped into action, supporting heavy purchases by lending or even buying directly through their treasuries after trading resumed in the afternoon. 
    
	Canara Bank alone funded stock purchases worth Rs 500 crore, top finance ministry sources said. Several other key state-run financial institutions scooped up many blue-chip stocks whose prices had dipped heavily. 
    
	As a strategy, officials said, this made great market sense as all treasury chiefs felt that buying stocks, for long- or medium-term investments, was a good business decision in a falling market. 
    
	Bank chiefs are likely to meet North Block mandarins soon to chalk out a strategy for the coming weeks. 
    
	We had anticipated the market to open on a downward trend and hit the circuit breaker. My advice to investors is to stay calm, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.
    
	I have been assured by the RBI and all the banks that enough liquidity will be provided to brokers and market players. Liquidity will not be an issue, he added.
    
	Officials said what was particularly worrying this morning were rumours that Citibank may be filing for bankruptcy in the US. The rumour proved to be false but had already affected market sentiments in the morning session. 
    
	Citigroups $9.83 billion fourth-quarter net loss from its exposure to sub-prime-mortgage-related assets seemed to have triggered off the rumours. 
    
	The information channels have to ensure that this kind of misleading news do not cause further panic on Indian bourses. Thats where the challenge lies. We are quite sure the markets will start recovering ... maybe slowly but surely, officials said.

	New Delhi, March 9: Trade between India and Japan can double to $15 billion by 2010 if the two countries resolve non-tariff barrier issues at the earliest, says a study by the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	Trade between the two countries was $7.5 billion in 2006-07. Officials of the two countries are slated to meet later this month in Tokyo to exchange a preliminary negative list of items to be excluded from the comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA).        
	According to the study titled India-Japan CEPA Negotiations, import duties on most goods in Japan are low. The partnership pact can raise Indias exports to Japan. The study calls for focus on agricultural exports to Japan, whose rate of self-sufficiency in food production is 40 per cent. The share of agricultural items in Indias exports to Japan has fallen by about 22 per cent in the last 10 years.

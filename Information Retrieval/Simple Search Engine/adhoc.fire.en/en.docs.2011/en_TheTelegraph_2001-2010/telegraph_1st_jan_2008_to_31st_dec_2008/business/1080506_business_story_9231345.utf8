The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Black spot in SAILs coal bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Black spot in SAILs coal bid

	New Delhi, May 5: Steel Authority of India Ltd has drawn a blank in its bid to acquire minority stakes in coal mine projects in Australia and New Zealand.        
	The PSU is now trying to enter into long-term arrangements of up to 15 years to source coking coal and promoting a special purpose vehicle set up in collaboration with some state-run companies to acquire equity stakes in coal projects abroad.         
	Most companies have expressed their inability to offer equity to SAIL as their joint venture partners have pre-emptive rights and are not willing to reduce their stake or control over the mines as well as leases of mines taken for development, SAIL said before a parliamentary committee.        
	A majority of the Australian coal mines have as partners Japanese trading houses, who are not willing to take on board Indian steel companies.         
	SAIL did take part in the disinvestment of a 25 per cent stake in Austral Ltds Tahmoor coal mine. However, a due diligence revealed that the performance of the mine had been below par. Besides, supply commitments have been made that are much in excess of capacity.        
	The company has also not been successful in acquiring assets in Africa, Russia and Poland. Officials said SAIL had also issued an expression of interest inviting overseas coal mining companies to offer equity or ownership interest in coal assets abroad. The response to this has been lukewarm, they said.         
	Though a few offers were received for the development of greenfield properties, these had no prospecting record, making it difficult to assess the quality of coal that can come out of such mines. SAIL consequently wants these offers to be explored by the special purpose vehicle formed with Coal India, Vizag Steel, NTPC and NMDC.        
	SAIL officials indicated that the company might finalise a coal contract with BHP Billiton soon.

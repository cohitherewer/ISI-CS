                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ruia rolls out local strategy for Schlegel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 10: Ruia Group today unveiled the India strategy of UK-based auto component maker Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems, which it had acquired recently.        
	The plan is to build a cluster of plants on a hub-and-spoke model to cater to high-end car makers.        
	The locations of the units will be decided in two weeks time, Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of Ruia Group, said.        
	There will be one mother plant and some finishing units close to the customer, he said after formally announcing the acquisition. The Telegraph was the first to report the acquisition earlier this week.        
	Schlegel Automotive Europe Ltd, Metzelers name after the acquisition, makes sealing systems for doors, windows, hoods (bonnets), trunks (boots) and sunroofs of cars.        
	Schlegel managing director David Boynton and general manager Steve Landrey would travel across the country and meet all the leading car makers in the next 10 days to know their requirements.        
	Based on their firm commitments, we will select the locations since it is difficult to transport the sealing systems a long distance, Boynton said.        
	Schlegels Indian operation will initially focus on high-end cars. The UK firm supplies to leading auto firms such as the BMW, Land Rover, Jaguar Renault, Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan.        
	If we manage to reduce the cost of manufacturing, the company can cater to the mass segments as well, Ruia said.        
	Equipment and machinery for the Indian plants have already been bought in the US and are being shipped here.

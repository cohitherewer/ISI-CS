The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel industry unity in tatters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Steel industry unity in tatters
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                           Parting ways                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: The Centre, which is unhappy with the Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) and suspects its members of trying to form a cartel to jack up prices, has ordered state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd to pull out of the steel industry lobbying body.         
	SAIL officials confirmed that the company had quit the alliance but said it did so because the body was not effective.         
	Steel ministry officials, however, said the state-run companies were asked to pull out of the alliance after finance minister P. Chidambaram said there were reasons to suspect that steel makers were forming a cartel.         
	While Tata Steel, which had pulled out of the alliance earlier, and SAIL did not hike prices, responding to a call by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to keep them stable last month, other members of the alliance chose not to listen, said government officials.         
	The ISA is left with just Ispat, Essar and the Jindals. The big players are not members of this body. If its members continue to raise prices, the government will take appropriate action, they added.         
	The government may even choose to order probes against ISA members.         
	Indias top steel makers had agreed to cut prices by Rs 1,500-2,000 per tonne on long products used in construction after a tough talking session here on April 3 by steel secretary R.S. Pandey.         
	However, soon after, most steel makers, except SAIL and the Tatas, threatened to raise prices, citing higher input costs. And early last month, despite appeals from steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, most steel majors increased prices by Rs 1,500-3,000 per tonne.         
	Steel producers had hiked prices twice before that: in January by Rs 600-900 per tonne and in February by an average of Rs 2,500 per tonne.         
	The alliance had argued that high prices in India only followed global trends and were the result of a manifold rise in the costs of raw materials such as coal and iron ore over the past few years.         
	The government officials are not convinced. They said the Competition Commission of India could probe cartelisation allegations and added that the government has enough power to take effective action to reverse a price rise.         
	Since the alliance now represents a minority faction of Indias steel industry, it could not hope to have its voice heard in the same way as before, the officials said. Policy decisions will take into cognisance what the major steel makers have to say rather than just the minority voice.         
	Recently, the government did just that when it chose to go with the advice of commerce minister Kamal Nath in not imposing an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent on iron ore exports, something which the alliance had been lobbying for quite some time.         
	SAIL and the Tatas are not affected by the decision as they have captive iron ore mines, but other ISA members who do not have significant iron ore mines of their own are dependent on the open market. Ore prices would have cooled down if an ad valorem duty had been imposed on exports.

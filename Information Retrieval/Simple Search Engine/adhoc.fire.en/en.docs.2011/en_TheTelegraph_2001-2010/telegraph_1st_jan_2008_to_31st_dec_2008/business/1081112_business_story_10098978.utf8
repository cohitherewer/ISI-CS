	Calcutta, Nov. 11: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who offloaded stocks in October, have turned buyers since the beginning of this month.        
	They purchased equities on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange worth Rs 15,452 crore, while they sold shares worth Rs 13,478.50 crore, making a net investment of Rs 1,973.20 crore so far this month. Even today, when stock prices fell over 6.6 per cent, FIIs purchased equities worth Rs 135.50 crore.         
	In the last one month, announcements by various governments to infuse capital aggregating $1.5 trillion into their respective economies have calmed the extreme risk aversion of foreign institutional investors, said an analyst with Sharekhan Ltd, a leading stock brokerage.         
	Around 1,541 registered FIIs were net sellers in equities on domestic bourses in October. Last month, they took out Rs 15,347.30 crore from the markets, leading to a 25 per cent decline in the 30-share sensex.        
	Mutual funds, however, have turned net sellers in equities.         
	According to data available with the Securities amp; Exchange Board of India, mutual funds sold equities worth Rs 344.90 crore this month. In October, mutual funds bought shares worth Rs 13,177.20 crore, while they were net sellers at Rs 11,745.60 crore.        
	Many mutual fund houses have also started revising their load structures. Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund will charge an entry load of 2.25 per cent for purchases and switching among schemes, and an exit load of one per cent for the redemption of units within a year.         
	UTI Mutual Fund will charge an exit load of 1 per cent for the redemption of units before 365 days for its Master Index Fund and Nifty Index Fund with effect from November 10. Tata Mutual Fund has also revised the load structure for Tata Select Equity Fund and Tata Pure Equity Fund.

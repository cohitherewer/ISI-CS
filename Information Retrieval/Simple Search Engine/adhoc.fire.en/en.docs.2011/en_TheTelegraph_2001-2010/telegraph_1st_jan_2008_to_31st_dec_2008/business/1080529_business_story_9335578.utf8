The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Marginal rise in net profit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Marginal rise in net profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, May 28: Hobbled by high input prices and poor vehicle financing, Tata Motors today reported a 6 per cent increase in net profit for the year ended March 31 at Rs 2,028.92 crore against Rs 1,913.46 crore the previous year.        
	Revenues of the automobile major also rose by a meagre 4.56 per cent to Rs 28,730.82 crore from Rs 27,470.03 crore in the previous year.         
	Although Tata Motors did not reveal the quarterly numbers, an analyst said there was a marginal fall in net profit during the fourth quarter.        
	Tata Motors said its margins were under pressure during the year because of rising interest rates, the reluctance of banks to finance vehicles and the unprecedented surge in input prices.        
	Its probably the most difficult time that the automobile industry is going through, said Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant even as he predicted a tough outlook for the current year. Kant said Tata Motors would focus on product launches and bring out variants of existing models in both passenger cars and commercial vehicles to increase its market share this year.        
	Apart from the world truck that will be launched in India and overseas later this year, the long awaited Nano will also hit the roads.        
	We will look at doubling our customer touch points in the country and we have targeted over 100 new products and variants over the next three to four years, said chief financial officer C. Ramakrishnan.        
	Ramakrishnan added that the market share of Tata Motors in passenger vehicles declined during the year to 14 per cent from 16.4 per cent as increased competition and a mature product portfolio affected sales.        
	While commercial vehicle sales increased 4.8 per cent to 312,935 units, passenger vehicle sales at 218,055 units declined 4.5 per cent. However, total sales volume, including exports of the company, for the year was 585,649 units, the highest ever for the company.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cross-connection                                  
	Mumbai, June 18: The war of words between the Ambani brothers over Anils plan to create a global telecom giant through an alliance between Reliance Communications (R-Com) and MTN of South Africa seems headed for the courtrooms.        
	On Wednesday, Reliance Communications threatened to launch criminal proceedings against the directors of Reliance Industries (RIL) who had signed a batch of unilateral agreements with the telecom entity on January 12, 2006 when Mukesh Ambanis men controlled all the companies.         
	RIL is looking to scupper the deal between R-Com and MTN on the strength of certain provisions in the non-compete agreement.         
	R-Com officials said they intended to file suits against the RIL officials who signed the agreements even as it accused them of a fraudulent misuse of powers and criminal breach of trust.        
	When contacted, a R-Com spokesperson said: At this stage, all options including criminal proceedings against L.V. Merchant, Sandeep Tandon, K. Sethuraman and other RIL officials involved in the signing of the agreements on January 12, 2006, are open if RIL seeks to rely on the alleged agreement.        
	Reacting to R-Com, an RIL spokesperson said: There is no criminality attached to the signing of the agreement dated January 12, 2006. If any proceedings are adopted, we will not only defend them but will also consider our options for such a malicious action.        
	The Anil Ambani camp is not opposed to the concept of the non-compete agreement but will challenge its scope that includes the right of first refusal, which, it claims, was fraudulently included in the agreement.        
	The agreements between RIL and the four companies  Reliance Communications Ventures, Reliance Energy Ventures, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Capital Ventures  which were demerged from Reliance Industries and went to the ADAG (Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group) contain provisions that enjoin the two groups to stay out of businesses in which the other group operates for a period of 10 years.

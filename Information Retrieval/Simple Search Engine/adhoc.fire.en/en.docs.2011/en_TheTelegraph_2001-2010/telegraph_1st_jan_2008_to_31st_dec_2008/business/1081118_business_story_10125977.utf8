          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Dual impact                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Fluctuations in global currencies have had a mixed impact on Indian infotech firms.        
	While Infosys has suffered from cross-currency movements, Genpact has gained from the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.        
	With most of our business deals being conducted in dollars, we have not been impacted by cross-currency movements, Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO of Genpact India, told The Telegraph.         
	Analysts said the falling rupee benefited some firms. For every 1 per cent depreciation of the Indian currency against the dollar, there is a positive impact of 40-50 basis points on operating margins.         
	The rupee has depreciated about 20 per cent since April and had breached the psychological mark of Rs 50 recently.        
	Genpact, which is Indias No. 1 BPO, said its 2008 revenues were likely to grow 26-28 per cent to around $1.03 billion.         
	However for firms Infosys, the depreciation of the pound and the euro vis--vis the dollar will erode the positive impact of the fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar.        
	This is because its earnings from countries outside the US are calculated in dollars.         
	Around 40 per cent of our revenues come from countries outside the US. We will have to take the impact of the movement of the currency in those countries, said S. Gopalakrishnan, CEO, Infosys Technologies.        
	Even in this difficult environment, Infosys is keen on acquisitions in Europe and Japan. Gopalakrishnan said the company would be comfortable with a deal size of $600-$700 million.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          BUMPY RIDE                                  
	New Delhi, July 21: Maruti Suzuki India, the countrys largest car maker, today reported a 6.8 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as rising prices of raw materials such as steel and aluminium outweighed higher sales.        
	The companys net profit for the first quarter of the current fiscal fell to Rs 465 crore from Rs 499 crore in the same period last year.        
	However, net sales were up 20.9 per cent at Rs 4,731 crore during the quarter against Rs 3,930 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Total sales grew 13.5 per cent at 1,92,584 units. Domestic sales were up 12.1 per cent at 1,80,093 units, led by the Swift, Swift DZire and the Wagon R.         
	Maruti Suzuki exported 12,491 units in the first quarter of 2008-09 against 9,065 units in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, a growth rate of 37.8 per cent.        
	A weaker rupee is boosting earnings from exports, while an increase in annual capacity to 1 million units by 2009-10 is expected to yield greater economies of scale for the car maker. Maruti Suzuki India will account for about a third of Japans Suzuki Motor Corps global sales in 2010-11.        
	SAIL net        
	State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today reported a 20.32 per cent jump in net profit for the April-June quarter on better sales realisation and more production of value-added steel.        
	Net profit for the first quarter of the current financial year stood at Rs 1,835 crore against Rs 1,525 crore during the same period last year. Net sales rose over 37 per cent to Rs 11,029 crore.        
	Our thrust on value-added and special quality steel and improvement in operational efficiencies has helped the company improve profitability, in spite of holding the price line, said SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta.         
	SAIL had to bear an additional burden of Rs 1,434 crore on account of higher prices of inputs such as coal, freight, ferro alloys and fuel, and also because of a provision for higher wage revisions.        
	The companys share closed at Rs 125.65, up 2.36 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

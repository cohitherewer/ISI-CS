          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Allahabad Bank chairman K.R Kamath (right) with executive director J.P Dua in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: Allahabad Bank today reported a 82.62 per cent decline in net profit for the quarter ended September 30 to Rs 41.68 crore compared with Rs 239.78 crore in the same quarter a year ago. However, total business of the city-based public sector bank grew 15.59 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 1,25,363 crore during the same period.        
	It has been a very challenging quarter for bankers. A lot of global financial turmoil happened during the quarter. Our own economy was also affected to some extent. Domestic markets saw tremendous liquidity pressure, said K.R. Kamath, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank.        
	According to Kamath, banks also had to factor in the losses towards implementation of the farm debt waiver scheme during this quarter. However, once the money is replenished by the government, the loss will be written back in the results of the following quarter, he added.        
	The decline in profits was the result of a huge provisioning of Rs 272.53 crore made against bad loans and depreciation of investments.         
	We provided for Rs 55 crore for loss of non-performing assets and Rs 138.45 crore for investment depreciation during the quarter ended September 30, 2008. The total provisioning was Rs 272.53 crore against Rs 59.77 crore in the previous corresponding quarter, Kamath said.        
	The banks total income, however, grew 18.80 per cent to Rs 1977.19 crore. Total expenses also went up by 21.85 per cent to Rs 1662.98 crore, particularly because of a 23.64 per cent higher expenditure on interest payment on deposits.

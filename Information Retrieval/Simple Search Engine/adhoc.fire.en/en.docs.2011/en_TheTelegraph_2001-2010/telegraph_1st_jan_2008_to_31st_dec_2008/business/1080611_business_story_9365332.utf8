The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CII panel to study commodity trade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CII panel to study commodity trade
          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                               
	Calcutta, June 10: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has formed a panel to do a detailed study of the commodity market.        
	This comes in the wake of apprehensions about commodity futures fuelling inflation that have led to the ban on the trading of some items.        
	For the study, the CII has tied up with National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Limited, Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited and some financial entities involved with commodities trading.        
	We earlier had the capital market group and have recently formed the commodity market group keeping in mind the recent developments in the commodity market. The industry is concerned about steps banning futures trading in four commodities. It is, therefore, important to engage in a detailed study about the sector and its eco-system, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of the CII.         
	The report will follow the Abhijit Sen commission report on the link, if any, between inflation and commodity futures. The government has recently banned trading on four commodities  soya oil, rubber, black gram and potato  for four months. It had earlier banned the trading of rice, wheat and two kinds of pulses.        
	Our national organisations and commodity exchanges have helped foreign governments to set up their own exchanges and trading platforms. We should, therefore, utilise their expertise, Banerjee said.         
	Some experts have supported the selective ban on futures trading, stating that the commodity market is more often used for speculative gains rather than hedging risks.         
	The Sen panel has said futures trading will not work in commodities such as rice and wheat where the government itself operates as the largest buyer to procure grains and provide them at subsidised rates to the poor.         
	More offices        
	The CII is looking beyond metros and will be setting up offices in Durgapur, Burdwan and Asansol in West Bengal. There are also plans for offices in Gujarats Banaskantha district as well as in some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.         
	We will be engaging in a lot of projects such as skill development of blue collared workers as well as community development work, said Banerjee.

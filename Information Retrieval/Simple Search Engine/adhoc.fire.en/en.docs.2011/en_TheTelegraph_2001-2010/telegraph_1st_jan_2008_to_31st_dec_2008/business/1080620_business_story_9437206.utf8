	Calcutta, June 19: Shoe major Bata India plans to invest close to Rs 200 crore in the next three years to set up 240 additional stores and upgrade 60 existing ones.         
	The company, which is fighting international brands such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok as well as cheap Chinese imports, will unveil stores across the country over the next three years.         
	Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 75th annual general meeting of Bata India here today, chairman P. M. Sinha said the company could look at more stores if it got the right property.         
	The company is on a sustainable turnaround path. Going forward, we want to make the business more robust, Sinha said.        
	Bata, which returned to the black in 2005, wants to invest the generated cash in opening stores and has, therefore, paid a moderate dividend of 20 per cent to shareholders for 2007.        
	As part of retail restructuring, Bata has extended store timings, introduced contract workers and put in place a franchise model for new outlets.         
	Bata has recently sold its popular Hawaii brand to a Brazilian firm for Rs 3.9 crore.        
	At present, out of the 1,200 outlets of Bata, 143 were franchisee-owned. Many of the new stores could come up as franchisees.        
	Sinha said the company was trying to capture the institutional market, comprising entities in defence, para-military, hospitality, airlines and mining.        
	Batanagar project        
	The Batanagar project is likely to be completed by 2012-13. Out of the 262 acres earmarked, 25 acres has been kept for an IT special economic zone.        
	Bata has forged a 50:50 joint venture with Calcutta Metropolitan Group Ltd for the project to set up a five-star hotel, a hospital, a school and a mall.

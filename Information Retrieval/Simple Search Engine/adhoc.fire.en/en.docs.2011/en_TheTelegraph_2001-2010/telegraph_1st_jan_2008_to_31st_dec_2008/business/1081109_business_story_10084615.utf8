                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Many queue up for IDBI arm
                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 8 (PTI): IDBI Bank has received 10-12 proposals from potential buyers for its wholly owned subsidiary, IDBI Homefinance, a top bank official said.        
	Ten to 12 parties have approached us and we are evaluating the proposals. We will shortlist (the buyer) in the next few months, IDBI Bank deputy managing director Jitender Balakrishnan told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci and the Indian Banks Association here today.        
	The bank has decided to sell IDBI Homefinance to consolidate its home loan finance business, which is currently being run through its own housing finance division and its Pune-based wholly owned subsidiary.        
	However, with valuations under pressure because of the current downturn in the financial markets, the lender may not get what it expects. This could delay the sale process by a few more months.        
	IDBI Bank took over erstwhile Tata Home Finance in September 2003 and renamed it IDBI Homefinance to operate a separate unit for its home loans business.        
	At present, IDBI Homefinance has a portfolio of above Rs 2,700 crore and a presence in 18 centres in the country with 150 employees.         
	SME defaults        
	The current economic crisis and liquidity shortage might push up defaults in the small and medium enterprises (SME) segment, a top ICICI Bank official said.        
	The flow of money from large companies to small ones is becoming slower. Credit cycles are becoming extended. If the current market situation continues for some more time, the credit quality may get impacted, ICICI Banks senior general manager (SME) Vijay Chandok said at the seminar.

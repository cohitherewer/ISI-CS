          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Strategic plan                                  
	New Delhi, June 29: India plans to launch a major diplomatic initiative to make its proposal for a crude oil price band a reality.        
	It will try to get both oil producers and major developing world consumers such as China on board.        
	The finance ministry will take it up in the Cabinet as well with the standing committee on oil diplomacy for energy security.         
	The committee is expected to come up with a diplomacy blueprint to sell the idea.        
	However, the finance ministry warned that the process would take time.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had last week proposed at a global forum a price band mechanism, with consuming nations guaranteeing a minimum floor price for crude and producing countries ensuring a ceiling.         
	For India , the band is vital as it buys more than 70 per cent of its 129-million-tonne annual crude oil requirements from the global market.         
	Growing demand along with failure to extract sufficient oil and gas through exploration mean the dependence on import will increase every year over the next five years.        
	India is likely to use its considerable clout in the Gulf region and its new found acceptance in Latin America to lobby for the support of its proposal, which has not found much favour with the US .        
	Policy-makers hope China, which has at times emerged as a rival to India in buying oil acreages abroad, will accept the importance of the price band mechanism to stabilise and insulate it from future oil shocks.        
	Many, including finance minister P.Chidambaram, believe speculation in the futures market to be the main reason for the price spike. On Friday, crude prices had touched $143 a barrel.        
	In a tough speech last Sunday, Chidambaram told the developed nations at a meeting in Jeddah that he believed the doubling of crude prices in a year was because of unregulated over-the-counter trading and futures market speculation by hedge funds and pension funds.         
	However, the US has been blaming rising demand from fast developing countries such as India and China for the price surge.        
	India believes pushing the price band idea will not be easy and it may have to bargain hard with the US or, else, isolate the country altogether.        
	Officials said India would continue with its hunt for oil assets abroad. The on-and-off Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is being revived, while diplomatic efforts are being made to put in place the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project.         
	The global hunt for oil and gas acreages has yielded both successes and failures. Attempts to get gas from neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh have not worked out. India has lost bids in Sudan, Angola, Indonesia, Ecuador and Kazakhstan .         
	However, it has managed to gain significant stakes in Russias Sakhalin-I project and in Sudans Greater Nile project as well as in Cuba and Venezuela.

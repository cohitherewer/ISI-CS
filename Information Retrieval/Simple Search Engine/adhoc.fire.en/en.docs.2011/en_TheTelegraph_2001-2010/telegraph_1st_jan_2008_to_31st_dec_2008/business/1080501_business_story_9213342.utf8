          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, April 30: Reliance Communications (R-Com), which is gearing up to launch GSM services by the end of this year, is exploring new areas of growth.         
	The company is keen to partner mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) to foray into overseas territories.        
	Chairman Anil Ambani said the company had received a number of offers from abroad to start MVNO services in India and was waiting for the regulators decision.         
	An MVNO is a mobile operator which doesnt own network infrastructure or spectrum. Instead, the entity offers the service after buying bulk airtime from traditional mobile firms.         
	A number of companies who want to start MVNO services have approached us. The regulator is working on a consultation paper and we are awaiting the outcome. As for launching MVNO operations in other countries, we are studying the possibilities in some geographies abroad, Ambani said.        
	At present, R-Com plans to focus on its GSM operations that will take off in selective circles by the end of this year.        
	Weve got the start-up spectrum for GSM operations. Though selective operations will start by end of 2008, the pan-India rollout will happen only by mid 2009, he added.        
	Ambani said he planned to list R-Coms global arm Reliance Globalcom on the London Stock Exchange if the values are right and the markets are right.         
	Net rises 46%        
	R-Com has reported a profit of Rs 1,503 crore for the quarter ended March 31, a 46.8 per cent rise over Rs 1,024 crore recorded in the same quarter last year.         
	The strong growth came despite the company suffering forex losses of Rs 25 crore.        
	On a year-on-year basis, the profit jumped 70.8 per cent to Rs 5,401 crore.

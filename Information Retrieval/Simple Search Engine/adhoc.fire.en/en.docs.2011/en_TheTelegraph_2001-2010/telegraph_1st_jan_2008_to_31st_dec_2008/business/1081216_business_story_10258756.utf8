          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Juneja: Expand horizon                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 15: Binani Cement will set up a one-million-tonne grinding unit in Mauritius.        
	The company got land from the Mauritius government for the project, which will be the first cement unit in the island nation.        
	Involving an investment of Rs 120 crore, the project is expected to be completed in six to eight months.         
	The country (Mauritius) requires 1.8-1.9 million tonnes of cement annually. Till now, it was importing through state trading agencies, Vinod Juneja, managing director of Binani Cement, said.        
	Binani will have to export clinker from India as there are no limestone deposits in Mauritius. Clinker is made from limestone and then ground to make cement.        
	The African island is the third overseas destination for Binani, which has units in China and the United Arab Emirates. The company is also expanding its facilities at these two locations.         
	The capacity of the China plant will be ramped by up to 2mt from 0.8mt, while the Dubai units capacity will be raised to 3mt from 1mt over the next two years. Binani owns a 74 per cent stake in the China venture and 49 per cent in the Dubai unit.        
	The company aims at a capacity of 15 million tonnes by 2011, Juneja said, adding that the Mauritius unit will help Binani reach the target.        
	In India, Binani runs a 6mt plant at Sirohi in Rajasthan, the largest cement unit in the country at a single location. The company is also planning a 2.5mt plant at Kutch in Gujarat.        
	While the installed capacity of cement in India is 180mt, demand is as high as 200mt. In the next two years, the demand is expected to increase by another 50mt.        
	Juneja said there had been a slackening of demand in the last 2-3 months and prices have come down, too. Hence, profitability will also come down.        
	Bengal plans        
	Juneja said Binani was open to acquisitions in Bengal. The company, which is registered in Calcutta, would look to set up a 1mt grinding plant here.        
	If there is a deal, we will look into it. Binani Cement wants to have a pan-India presence. But we dont want to set up a greenfield unit here, Binani said.

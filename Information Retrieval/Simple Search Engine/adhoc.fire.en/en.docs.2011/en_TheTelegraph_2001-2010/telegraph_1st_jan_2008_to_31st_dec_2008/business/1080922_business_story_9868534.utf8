                                I want to invest in an equity scheme of a mutual fund through systematic investment plan. How long should I continue to invest? What will be the tax implication if I redeem the units six months after the last installment?          Swapan Ghosh, Khidderpore
                    You should keep in mind that returns from equities are very volatile and you may not be able to redeem your investment with profits in a bearish market that may last for three to five years. So, you should invest only that amount of money which you shall not require for the next three to five years. To sell units within six months from its purchase, you will have to pay a short-term capital gains tax at the rate of 15 per cent, provided your total annual income, including the short term capital gains, is more than the basic exemption limit.                                  Tax trouble      I am below 65 years and my annual income from pension, interest on bank FDs and the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme will be Rs 3,39,128 in the current financial year. After availing deduction under Section 80C, my income tax liability will be Rs 9,179. But the TDS on interest income from bank FD and SCSS (which will mature during this period) will be Rs 14,074, resulting in excess tax payment. How shall I avoid the excess payment?         Ajit Kumar Das, Agarpara
                    Calculate your income tax liability for 2008-09 taking into account the interest income from the FD and SCSS. If you see that the TDS is still higher than your total income tax liability, you can claim refund of the excess tax paid.                                  Locker logic      A PPF account has a 15-year lock-in period. Thereafter, the account can be extended for 5 years. How many times a subscriber can extend his/her PPF account?        B.K. Singh, Patuli
                    A PPF account can be renewed for five years after the completion of each five-year lock-in period. The continuation can be with or without contribution. Once an account is continued without contributions for more than a year, the subscriber will not have the option to continue the account with contributions                        If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

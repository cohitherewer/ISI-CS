The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | EEPC to take on a bigger role
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       EEPC to take on a bigger role
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: Confronted by shrinking demand, the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC) is set to expand the scope of its activities by engaging with premier industry chambers.        
	The working committee of the EEPC has proposed a change in its memorandum of association to include representatives from other apex chambers such as Ficci, Assocham, the Confederation of Indian Industry and the All India Management Organisation in its council.         
	The issue will be taken up for approval at the annual general meeting of the organisation tomorrow.        
	A top EEPC official told The Telegraph that recent surveys by its members indicated a 20 per cent drop in export from this month. A number of members had written to the EEPC about cancellation of orders from the US and the countries of the European Union.         
	Indian exporters were asked to hold on to orders not only by parties from the US and the UK but also from the Latin American countries, the official said.        
	Exports by EEPC members grew 23.3 per cent during April-August 2008 to $14.76 billion (Rs 64,452 crore) against $12.36 billion (Rs 50,650 crore) during the same period last year. Export of engineering goods in 2007-08 was $33 billion, and the EEPC had expected trade to grow by 25 per cent.         
	Exporters were happy with 23 per cent growth in the first five months of the current fiscal. But the sudden meltdown and the cancellation of orders had forced us to think differently and focus on wider bilateral trade and investment, said Rakesh Shah, chairman of the EEPC.        
	By working closely with the chambers, the EEPC hoped it would be able to devise more appropriate promotional strategies, Shah said.

	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Coca-Cola India will not set up any new plant unless the local community approves it. It will also conduct studies at existing plants to check the water resources situation and address any problem.
    
	Atul Singh, CEO and president of Coca-Cola India, said, We will get community approval before setting up new plants. The cola multinational had faced protests from tribal rights groups in Kerala over ground water use at a plant in Plachimada. The plant had to be shut down because of the protests.
    
	Singh said, Our business is booming five quarters in a row. We are in the black now and our profits are far more sustainable over a longer time frame. Five years back, Coca-Cola had slashed cola prices to Rs 5 a bottle in a costly price war with rival soft drink makers and bottled water manufacturers. Its profits were affected badly after the move. But the company seems to be making up the losses.
    
	Coca-Cola now plans to invest up to $250 million in the Indian market. It has drawn up plans to introduce new brands in both sparkling and cola drinks as well as in non-fizzy beverages such as fruit juices, tea and coffee. 
    
	I cannot name brands but we will bring in more products from our global portfolio of 400 brands in the next few years, Singh said, adding, We feel there are equal growth opportunities in both categories and we will focus on them equally. 
    
	We have emerged as the largest exporter of coffee from India and aim to encourage more sourcing out of India. We are also the largest buyers of sugar and mango pulp in the country ... we will step that up and are looking at new raw material sources for citrus-based drinks, including Bengal.
    
	Singh added, We will also study the water resources situation in existing cola plants to see that there is no resource stress ... we will work to create alternative water resources through rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation if we discern a problem.
    
	After a series of reports accused Coca-Cola of using contaminated water and overdrawing ground water, the global cola giant had asked The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), headed by nobel laureate R.K.Pachauri, to conduct an audit of its water practices in India. The Centre for Science and Environment, a reputed non-governmental organisation which also runs a specialised environmental magazine, had released a report a few years back which claimed colas sold here had pesticide residues at levels far above European Union norms. 
    
	The Teri report, which was released today, said only treated water was used to make beverages. However, the report also identified certain areas where Coca-Cola should improve its performance.

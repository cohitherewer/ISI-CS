The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop clears final hurdle 
                                                                                                               Dunlop clears final hurdle 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Profit lane      
	Calcutta, March 12: Tyre maker Dunlop India is not a sick company anymore, the Appellate Authority for Industrial amp; Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR) has said.        
	In its final order yesterday, the AAIFR said Dunlops net worth had turned positive. This is expected to clear the way for dematerialisation of the companys shares and its relisting on the stock exchanges.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) had filed an appeal with the AAIFR, questioning certain relaxations granted by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) to the company.        
	The BIFR had allowed a Rs 27-crore rights issue of Dunlop without going through various compliances and requirements laid down by Sebi and the BSE.        
	The BIFR had also directed the stock exchanges to lift the suspension of trading. It had also asked the NSDL and the CDSL to allot an International Stocks Identification Number for the companys shares so that they could be traded in a dematerialised form.        
	Dunlop shares were earlier listed on the Calcutta, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Bombay stock exchanges.        
	The AAIFR had placed an interim stay on the BIFR order putting all 35,000 shareholders in trouble. In January, Cuttack High Court lifted the suspension imposed by the AAIFR following an appeal filed by an ordinary shareholder.         
	Today, the AAIFR dismissed the appeal filed by Sebi and the BSE, which had questioned the validity of the rights issue and listing and trading of its shares on exchanges. The BIFR as well as the AAIFR ceases to have any jurisdiction in respect of the respondent company (Dunlop India Ltd), it said.        
	The development comes at a time when the tyre maker is trying to stabilise production and gain a foothold in the market. The company is hoping to make operational profit next financial year.

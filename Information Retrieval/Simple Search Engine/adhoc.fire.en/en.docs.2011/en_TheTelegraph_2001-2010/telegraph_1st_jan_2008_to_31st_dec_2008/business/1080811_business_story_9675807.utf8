	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The Congress-led-government is against a big burst of reforms, preferring to continue with low-key changes. It is following the latter strategy for almost two-and-a-half years since the time the Left stalled its ambitious plans for PSU disinvestment.         
	The reason behind this decision is apparently two-fold. Firstly, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) feels it will be difficult to get parliamentary approvals for controversial measures, on the basis of last months tense and sometimes raucous trust vote on the nuclear deal.        
	Second, the PMO feels many of the Congresss current allies may not in any case support drastic reforms. According to finance ministry officials, What we are now concentrating on are reforms which do not require much action on the political front.        
	These include tweaking FDI caps in certain sectors which do not require laws to be changed, bringing in national exception in FDI (security screening of select foreign investment), disinvestment of small packets of shares in some PSUs and consolidation of a few state-run banks, the officials said.         
	Key projects        
	With elections round the corner, instructions are also being given to remove glitches in key projects such as the rural employment guarantee scheme and the mid-day meal scheme.        
	The expenditure division of the finance ministry as well as the Planning Commission are ensuring that money needed for such projects reach on time and project schedules are maintained.         
	The administrative ministries have been asked to strictly monitor the projects not only by their own officials but also by independent evaluators. Consultants may also be engaged to sort out project flaws.         
	These will be the reforms that the government will tout. Hence, emphasis will be on them. Changes in FDI rules are meant for a select few though they have a major impact on the economy, the officials said. They said power projects would be hastened up.        
	However, all reforms requiring legislative approval will not be put on the back burner and will be taken up with utmost tact.        
	On significant issues, the government will seek consensus across the political spectrum, but if it fails to materialise then the government will not risk putting them to vote.        
	This is the case for bills that are on par with the Finance Bill such as the amendments to the insurance regulatory and development act. Finance minister P. Chidambaram has already said that he would not bring any amendment hiking foreign direct investment (FDI) in insurance as there was no consensus.         
	Even other amendments which are not particularly important from a political point of view will be introduced in Parliament after an all-clear signal from major parties.         
	Allies response        
	Though the Samajwadi Party has said that it was willing to look afresh at the stalled insurance and pension bills, several other allies of the Congress such as the RJD would seek to stick to rules that went well with their vote banks  and a hike in the FDI limit in insurance may not be one of them.         
	However, changes such as the one reducing the minimum paid-up capital of a health insurance company will be pushed. These are seen as tweaks which will help bring in investments, while not compromising the government.         
	The national exception rules, proposing security checks on FDI in specified sectors and on unnamed investors, will be introduced in the House despite objections from both finance minister P. Chidambaram and commerce minister Kamal Nath.         
	Reforms such as sugar decontrol and removing the ban on forward trading in certain commodities are almost certain to be dumped despite intense lobbying by cabinet ministers for changes. A reason for this is the government does not want to take any decisions which may boomerang on it in the publics eye.

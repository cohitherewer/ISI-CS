                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet hopes to beat global slowdown

	Hong Kong, April 14 (Reuters): Jet Airways, Indias top private carrier, expects revenue from international flights to keep growing despite a darkening global economic outlook, and it warned Boeing it would demand compensation if there were further delays to the revolutionary 787.        
	Jet, founded in 1993 and controlled by billionaire chairman Naresh Goyal, competes with rivals Kingfisher Airlines and Air India for a slice of the booming aviation market in India, where air passenger traffic almost doubled between 2004 and 2007 on the back of rising incomes and a surging economy.        
	Goyal, whose airline is fighting stiff competition, soaring jet fuel prices and a global shortage of pilots, waved off a potential US recession and a likely downturn in global air travel and sky-high jet fuel costs on Monday. In spite of sub-prime or whatever, Indias GDP has been growing at 8.5 per cent. Of course its a serious situation. But in the US, theres two-and-a-half to three million Indians there. These people have been travelling, Goyal told Reuters in an interview. Goyal was in Hong Kong to celebrate the launch of Jet Airways direct flight between Mumbai and Hong Kong. He expects the firms Mumbai-Shanghai route to be launched in June, with hopes of a Beijing route in the near future.        
	Goyal said Jet Airways would not join a growing line of carriers demanding redress for a further six-month delay  the third announced  in the Boeing Dreamliner, but warned he would if Boeing pushed back the launch again.        
	Jet, which operates 104 aircraft on roughly 380 daily flights to nearly 60 destinations, has 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order, due for delivery in 2011. Goyal said he would sell up to 10 per cent of his 80 per cent stake in the firm in a private placement to raise $400 million.         
	Number concern        
	High operating costs and surging fuel prices will cause Indian carriers to lose $700 million in 2007-08, according to Ernst amp; Young. Merrill Lynch projects Jet will book a loss of Rs 71.6 crore in the fourth quarter this year against Rs 88.1 crore profit last year.

	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The makers of luxury and high-end cars are doing brisk business in India as their cheaper brethren grapple with the downturn.        
	Sales of all cars fell nearly 7 per cent in October to 98,900 units from 1,05,877 units a year ago  the third such decline in four months, which firms blamed on high borrowing costs.        
	However, Mercedes Benz  with just a decades presence in the Indian market  has recorded an almost 47 per cent rise in sales at 3,141 units from January to October 2008 compared with the corresponding period last year. Mercedes cars sell at an average price of Rs 30 lakh per unit.        
	A Mercedes spokesperson attributed the steady growth rate to the pent-up demand for premium cars in the country.         
	In India, the sales of luxury and high-end cars are just 1.5 per cent of the numbers in this category in China. This shows that there is possibility for growth, the spokesperson said.         
	UKs Bentley had experienced 20 per cent growth in India last year and expected to clock similar growth this year.        
	India, China, West Asia and Russia are our future markets for growth, said Chris Buxton, regional director (India, Africa and West Asia), Bentley Motors.         
	Satya Bagla, managing director, Exclusive Motors, the strategic partner of Bentley, said, Since 2003, we have sold over 100 Bentleys in India. Some of our customers own 2-3 Bentleys.        
	Companies such as BMW, Audi, Porsche and Rolls-Royce have recorded good growth in recent months.        
	Porsche is more than hopeful of doubling its sales this year to 200 cars and sports utility vehicles from around 100 last year.         
	The company expects special finance initiatives through exclusive tie-ups with banks to further push sales.        
	The German firm sells models such as the Boxster, Cayman, 911 and Cayenne, which are priced between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 2 crore. The company has decided to have more dealers in Punjab and in the cities of Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai in the next few months.        
	The sales of premium cars in India are likely to move ahead of their sales in Thailand and Singapore, says JD Power Associates.        
	According to analysts, the demand has been coming from high net worth individuals to whom banks and other financial institutions are not averse to lending.         
	German car manufacturer Audi increased its sales in the country by 203 per cent between January and October this year. The company sold 884 cars compared with 292 in the corresponding period last year. Audi aims to sell about 1,000 units in the next calendar year. In October 2008, sales grew 312 per cent compared with the year-ago period.        
	A slew of new models and expansion of dealership have helped the company grow in India, according to Benoit Tiers, managing director, Audi India.         
	The company recently launched its sports car  the R8  at a price of Rs 1.17 crore.        
	The company has sold 4,000 R8s worldwide in the last 10 months. This is about 25 per cent higher than our expectations, he said.        
	In India, the most successful models in October for Audi were the newly launched Audi A4 and the Audi Q7.

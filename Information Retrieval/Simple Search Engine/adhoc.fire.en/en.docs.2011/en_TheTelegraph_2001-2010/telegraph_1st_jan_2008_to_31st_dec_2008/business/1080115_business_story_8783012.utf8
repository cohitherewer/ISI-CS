   A STAFF REPORTER
   
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: Exide Industries has reported 60 per cent growth in turnover and a 59 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter of 2007-08 compared with the year-ago period.
 
	Net sales of the company rose to Rs 721.92 crore during the quarter from Rs 451.79 crore in the year-ago period.
 
	Even though lead prices softened in December, the effect will be reflected only in the next quarter, said Exide managing director T.V. Ramanathan.
 
	Profit after tax grew to Rs 55.16 crore from Rs 34.85 crore.
 
	Battery for Nano
 
	Exide has been chosen as the preferred supplier of batteries for the Nano.
 
	While there was encouraging buoyancy in the replacement market, the offtake from both the four-wheeler and two-wheeler original equipment market was significantly below our expectations at the beginning of the year, Ramanathan said.
 
	Our in-house R amp;D centre was closely associated with the development of a suitable battery for the Nano from the very beginning. However, the offtake for such batteries will start from the next financial year, when the vehicle hits the market, he added. 
 
	In the industrial battery segment, which constitutes 40 per cent of the companys turnover, the telecom sector provided the boost.
 
	The company has also seen a significant reduction in warranty claims on products. An enhanced focus on pre-dispatch quality checks introduced in the July-December period has started paying dividends, Ramanathan said.

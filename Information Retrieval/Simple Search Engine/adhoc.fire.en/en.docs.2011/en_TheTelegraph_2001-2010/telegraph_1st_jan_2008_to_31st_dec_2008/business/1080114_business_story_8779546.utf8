	Calcutta, Jan. 13: After listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Indias IT outsourcing leader Genpact is planning to debut on the Indian bourses.
    
	The company, which grew 30-32 per cent and hired around 10,000 people last year, needs funds for domestic as well as global expansion.
    
	In August 2007, Genpact raised $494 million from the NYSE, and its scrip gained 11 per cent by the end of the year.
    
	This is the next logical step after the overseas listing, Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO, Genpact, said.
    
	The rate at which we are growing in India and overseas, we will think about it (local float) sooner. However, it has been just four to five months we have completed all the formalities of the earlier one. 
    
	Bhasin was in Calcutta to sign an agreement for an IT special economic zone in Rajarhat. He, however, said Genpact could look at other routes besides an initial public offering (IPO) in India.
    
	There could be other routes, we are yet to sit down and decide on what route will be suitable, he said.
    
	According to analysts, on revenues of $613 million in 2006, the valuation of the company is estimated at $3.5- $5 billion. This is six to eight times its sales value.
    
	The company plans to use the proceeds of the overseas IPO for working capital, general corporate purposes and repaying debt.
    
	Genpact mobilised about $247 million from the overseas IPO. In 2007, Genpact is expected to clock revenues of $797-810 million, up 30-32 per cent from $613 million in 2006.
    
	The companys projected revenues for 2008 is $1.8 billion. According to a report by McKinsey and Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies, the addressable market for offshore IT and BPO services is approximately $300 billion, of which only about 10 per cent has been penetrated. 
    
	It is expected that the market will grow to $110 billion in 2010 from $30 billion in 2005, a compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent.
    
	Acquisition plans 
    
	Genpact is keen on acquiring two to three new companies this year.
    
	It is on the lookout for captive and third-party BPOs as well as outsourcing companies in analytics, technology and BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) segments. The company is looking at a presence in Latin American countries such as Brazil. It already has a centre in Mexico.
    
	Expansion is also on the cards in China and the Philippines where it has a centre in Manila. Within the country, the company is expanding in Jaipur and Hyderabad and is looking at Indore. It will also be hiring more from the Northeast.

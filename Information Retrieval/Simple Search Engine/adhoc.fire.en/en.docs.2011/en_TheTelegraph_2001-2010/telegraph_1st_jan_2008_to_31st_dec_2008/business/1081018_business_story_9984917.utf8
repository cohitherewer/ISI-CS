The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Turmoil fails to dent ONGC confidence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Turmoil fails to dent ONGC confidence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          (From left) GAIL (India) chairman U. D. Choubey, Assocham president Sajjan Jindal and ONGC chairman R. S. Sharma in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: The ongoing global financial crisis will not deter Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) from aggressively pursuing overseas acquisitions.         
	The public sector oil major also expressed the confidence that its 1.4-billion acquisition of UKs Imperial Energy will sail through.        
	We are as aggressive as we were. Rather, we think it is a better time to go for acquisitions, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said here today.        
	Officials said ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of state-owned ONGC, had expressed interest in picking up a stake in Kazakhstan-based MangistauMunaiGas. Mangistau has oil reserves of 812 million tonnes and recoverable reserves of 194 million tonnes.        
	On whether the global credit crunch would affect the Imperial deal, Sharma said, We have enough liquidity to do two more such deals.        
	ONGC has taken a $1-billion bridge loan to partly fund its acquisition of Imperial.        
	ONGC has around $5 billion in cash and deposits, including short-term investments as on March 31, 2008.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora is visiting Moscow next week as the deal needs the Russian governments approval because the bulk of Imperials assets are in western Siberia.

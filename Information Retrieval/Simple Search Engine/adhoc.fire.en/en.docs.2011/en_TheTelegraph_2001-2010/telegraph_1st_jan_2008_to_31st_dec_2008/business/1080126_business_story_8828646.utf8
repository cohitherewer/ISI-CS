     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: The markets today bounced back with the highest single-day gain of 1139.92 points backed by heavy buying across all counters. 
    
	Domestic institutions were on a buying spree, reacting to speculations of a further 50 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on January 30. News of a relief package of $150 billion by US President George Bush lifted global sentiments. 
    
	There is a 74 per cent chance of another 50bps cut in the Fed rate to 3 per cent and the Dow futures reflects that optimism, said Amitabh Chakraborty of Religare.
    
	While the Nasdaq and the S amp;P closed on Thursday with marginal gains of just over one per cent, Japans Nikkei soared 4.1 per cent and Hong Kongs Hang Seng jumped 6.73 per cent. In India, led by ICICI Bank, which rose 11.16 per cent to Rs 1 259.25, the sensex gained throughout the day and closed at 18361.66. The 50-share Nifty rose 350 points and closed at 5383.35 in spite of weaknesses in the F amp; segment. 
    
	Realty stocks gained 10.41 per cent, while metal and bank stocks rose 9.7 and 7.5 per cent, respectively. 
    
	FIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 208 crore, while domestic institutions today chipped in with Rs 250 crore, according to NSE data. 
    
	The market is more likely to sustain its growth at these levels (17000-19000), said Manish Sonthalia of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
    
	Many, however, believe the market may see a downtrend next week as brokers will continue to cut their leveraged positions at higher levels.
    
	The Indian market is just following international trends. But, these levels hardly look to be sustainable at this point, said Ambaresh Baliga of Karvy Stock Broking.

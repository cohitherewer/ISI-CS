          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Bhatt: Strategic tie-up                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 24: The State Bank of India (SBI) today joined hands with Insurance Australia Group (IAG) to set up a joint venture for general insurance foray.         
	The SBI will hold a 74 per cent stake in the joint venture, while AIG will pick up the remaining 26 per cent.         
	The joint venture will start business in the next fiscal and aims to be among the top three players in the medium term.         
	The State Banks foray into general insurance will make it a provider of all kinds of financial products.         
	Besides banking, the SBI has a presence in mutual funds, share broking and life insurance.        
	IAG is a global player with operations in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia, China and the UK.         
	It has a presence in the automobiles, property, casualty and commercial insurance businesses and distributes products directly and through intermediaries, including brokers, financial institutions and motor dealers.         
	Sydney-based IAG underwrites a premium of more than 7.5 billion Australian dollars per annum.         
	It employs around 15,000, of which around 10,000 are in Australia.         
	SBI chairman . P. Bhatt said the venture was part of the Indian banks strategic initiative to retain its position as the pre-eminent financial services group in the country.        
	He said insurance penetration in India was very low and the general insurance industry was expected to grow at a brisk rate of 15-20 per cent over the next 10 years.         
	IAG managing director and CEO Michael Wilkins said the tie-up fitted in with the companys strategy to pursue select global opportunities. Entering the Indian general insurance market has been a priority for IAG, to support our long-term growth and profitability, he said.

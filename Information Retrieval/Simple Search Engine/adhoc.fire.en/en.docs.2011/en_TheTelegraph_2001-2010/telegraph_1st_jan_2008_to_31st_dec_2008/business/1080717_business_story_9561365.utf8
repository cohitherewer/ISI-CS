	Mumbai, July 16: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the countrys largest software exporter, today reported a 4 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in net profit for the April-June period at Rs 1,291 crore, but indicated that there were some hard times ahead.        
	Although revenues during the first quarter of 2008-09 rose by a sprightly 24 per cent year-on-year to Rs 6,411 crore, the top management was in a sombre mood while announcing the results.         
	There is still uncertainty in the environment. There are some delays in decision making and there are certain issues with some clients, but overall there is still demand for IT services, said N. Chandrasekaran, chief operating officer and executive director of the company.         
	Major markets such as North America, the UK and Europe grew 8 per cent despite a challenging external scenario, he added.        
	Last week, Infosys had also reported strong headwinds in the banking, insurance and retail segments.         
	TCSs consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 30 stood at Rs 1,290.61 crore compared with Rs 1,202.93 crore for the same quarter a year back.        
	Its international business grew seven per cent sequentially. The company has added 35 new clients this quarter and 8,982 employees.         
	However, the companys attrition rate went up a few notches to 12.8 per cent against 12.6 per cent.        
	TCS is focused on extracting greater operational efficiencies through a rigorous cost-management programme that has helped us hold operational margins steady in the first quarter, said S. Mahalingam, chief financial officer and executive director.        
	As part of the cost-management programme, the company is changing its calculation of depreciation of assets.         
	Chandrasekaran said the company had sewn up 12 deals in the first quarter.        
	TCS also reported a forex loss of Rs 75 crore during the quarter. The results were announced after the market closed. However, the stock plunged to a new two-year low of Rs 727.35 on the BSE, a fall of 2.98 per cent over the previous close.

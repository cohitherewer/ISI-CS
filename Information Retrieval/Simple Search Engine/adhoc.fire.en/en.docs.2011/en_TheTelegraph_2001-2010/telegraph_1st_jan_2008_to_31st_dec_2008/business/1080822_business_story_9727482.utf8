          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Aug. 21: Grey market operators in Mumbai are despondent, but their counterparts in Delhi remain gung-ho after Bharti Airtel and Vodafone prepared to launch the latest gizmo  Apples 3G iPhone  in India.        
	The 3G iPhone was launched in the US and a few other countries on July 11  and ever since grey market operators in Mumbais Heera Panna complex have been raking in the moolah.        
	Some dealers claim to have sold the 16GB model at prices as high as Rs 80,000 last month though prices have moderated since then. On Thursday, the 3G version was selling at Rs 42,000 for the 16GB model and Rs 31,000 for the 8GB version at Mumbais well-known grey market hub though there werent any buyers.        
	Its all over for us as far as the iPhone is concerned. When the iPhone first came here, we used to sell 5 to 10 units every day at these prices. Now that Airtel and Vodafone are going to distribute it, buyers have lost interest, said a shopkeeper at Galaxy, an outlet for mobile phones at Heera Panna.        
	Dealers at Heera Panna justified their prices saying the phones were imported from the US where they were bundled with an AT amp;T connection which they had to pay for.        
	However, at Gaffar market in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi, grey market dealers said they would be selling unlocked versions of the Apple 3G iPhone at prices that would be Rs 4,000 to Rs 8,000 cheaper than the Vodafone and Airtel price points.        
	Although Apple doesnt have an exclusive carrier agreement in India, buyers who pick up a model from Airtel wont be able to switch over to Vodafone or vice versa. This is because the telephony players will be activating a network lock on these phones.        
	The grey market operators know how to break the codes and are able to ensure that customers use the devices across networks anywhere in the world.         
	However, the companies are not terribly perturbed about the grey markets code crackers.        
	The Airtel network-locked iPhone can be hacked and used on other networks. However, the customer will lose out on Airtel applications and free offers that we plan to give our subscribers, said Sanjay Kapoor, Bharti Airtels president (mobile services).        
	Vodafone move        
	Vodafone is trying to ratchet up sales of the Apple iPhone by arranging cheap finance schemes for buyers.        
	The company said it was cutting deals with banks including Axis Bank, ICICI and Barclays to arrange 6 month and 12 month finance schemes with low EMIs.

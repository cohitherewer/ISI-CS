The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL to put Chiria plant on fast track
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SAIL to put Chiria plant on fast track
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Paswan in Ranchi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) will hasten its plans for a 12-million-tonne plant near Chiria as the problem over mining lease nears solution.        
	The Jharkhand government has promised to allocate iron ore from the Chiria area to SAIL first, after which it will consider the demands of rival steel makers.        
	This follows a series of meetings among SAIL, the Union government and the newly elected government of Shibu Soren in Jharkhand.        
	SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta was in Ranchi last week, while Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan held a meeting with the state government today.        
	Steel ministry officials interpret the Jharkhand move to mean that the lease over the 1.8 billion-tonne iron-ore-bearing land at Chiria will be renewed. Residual land at Chiria as well as surrounding Ankua will be for rivals such as ArcelorMittal, the Essar group and the Jindals.        
	I am very hopeful of our problems being sorted out soon, said Roongta.         
	SAIL will go ahead with its plans to set up the 12mt plant, once the Chiria lease is renewed. The company is looking for land for the project.        
	Previous Jharkhand governments had tried to get back the lucrative mining leases which were initially with Burnpur-based IISCO Steel Plant and got transferred to SAIL after it brought the company into its fold through a merger.        
	Chiria has deposits of 2 billion tonnes of good quality ore, whose current valuation is an astronomical $250 billion.         
	The Jharkhand governments bid to get part of the mines, given some 70 years ago, from SAIL for lease to others has till now been thwarted by court orders which have tended to favour the PSU.        
	With Soren taking over in Jharkhand, SAIL has seen a change in its fortunes. Last month, SAIL was suddenly granted vital clearances needed to expand mining at the Meghataburu and Kiriburu hills.        
	SAILs plan to expand the capacity of Bokaro Steel Plant almost four-fold to 17mt by 2020 had been stymied for some time with the Jharkhand government refusing to clear any of its mine expansion or lease renewal proposals.         
	It could not start mining in some other areas  at Kiriburu and Meghataburu  because of intransigence on part of the Jharkhand government in giving it environment and forest clearances for fresh mining.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 19: Shares of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd slid on the stock markets today on speculation that the settlement with Pfizer Inc over cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor would benefit Ranbaxy only modestly.        
	The Ranbaxy scrip fell nearly 8 per cent to Rs 552.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as the decision to push back the launch of the generic version of Lipitor to November 2011 disappointed analysts and investors.         
	The widespread expectation was that Ranbaxy would be able to launch the generic version of Lipitor as early as March 2010. It is felt that this delay of 20 months will deny Ranbaxy any incremental benefit.        
	The Ranbaxy stock plunged because of the realisation that the settlement with Pfizer meant that the US multinational would not be making a counter-bid to top Daiichi Sankyos offer of Rs 737 per share to buy out the Ranbaxy promoters.        
	Various foreign brokerages, including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and CLSA, indicated that the settlement would only be mildly positive for Ranbaxy.         
	Citigroup was the only one that came up with a buy rating.

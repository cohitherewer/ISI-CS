                                                                                                               Loud hint of monetary steps
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 28: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today dropped a broad hint that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) might come out with monetary measures to tame inflation.        
	Chidambaram said the government was prepared to sacrifice a little growth for the sake of reining in prices.        
	We will take all measures possible to moderate inflation, Chidambaram told industrialists at a function to mark the centenary of the Indian Merchants Chamber (IMC).        
	The finance minister said interest rates were the most effective instrument to contain inflation.        
	Bankers read this as a signal to the Reserve Bank of India to devise appropriate measures to put the lid on price hikes.        
	I assure you that the government is determined to take all steps and if that means we have to live with slightly lesser growth so be it Some argue that it is blunt, but interest rates is the most effective instrument to contain inflation, he said.        
	Since 2004, the central bank has raised the reverse repo rate by nearly 150 basis points to 6 per cent and the repo rate by the same margin to 7.75 per cent to control inflation.        
	Reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI soaks up liquidity from the financial system. The repo is used to inject liquidity into the system.        
	The RBI has also raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) since 2006 by 250 basis points to 7.50 per cent.         
	Chidambaram said the current rise in inflation was due to food and commodity prices apart from a rise in inflationary expectations.        
	He said the prices of commodities such as copper, iron ore, lead, nickel, zinc had either doubled or tripled since 2004. Prices of iron ore have jumped four times. Moreover, food items like rice and wheat have also jumped in the international markets.        
	This (firm international prices) is an area where we have no control. If we import some commodities, it implies importing inflation as well, he said.        
	Earlier in the day, the finance minister stressed the need to create a robust market for corporate bonds.

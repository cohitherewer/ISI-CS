	Calcutta, April 14: Novatium Solutions Pvt Ltd, a company selling desktop computers along with customised software and an Internet package for Rs 5,000, plans to set up shop in Calcutta.        
	The Nova Net PCs work on a thin client concept, that is they do not have any processor. The computer is a small box and does not contain any software or application. It is linked to a central server, which hosts all the applications. Privacy is guaranteed through encryption.         
	The Chennai-based company was formed by Rajesh Jain, Ashok Jhunjhunwala and Ray Stata to sell computers at a low price.         
	After Chennai and Delhi, the desktops will be launched in Mumbai and Calcutta in the next quarter. By the end of this fiscal we are looking at selling one lakh Nova Net PCs, said Alok Singh, CEO of Novatium Solutions Pvt Ltd. Singh said the company was in talks for a partner in Calcutta.         
	Besides the one time installation charge of Rs 5,000, customers would have to pay Rs 399 per month for 30-hour broadband access.         
	Depending on customer specifications, we can also customise the software package. If someone does not want Power Point or Excel, the package can be designed accordingly, said Singh. Users get a computing system with online software applications such as word, presentation tools, and spreadsheets.

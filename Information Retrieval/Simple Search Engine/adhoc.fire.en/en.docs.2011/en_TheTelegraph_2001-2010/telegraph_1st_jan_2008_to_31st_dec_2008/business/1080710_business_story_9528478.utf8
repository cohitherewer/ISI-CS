          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                              
	Calcutta, July 9: The National Thermal Power Corporations Rs 8,700-crore Barh thermal power project in Bihar may finally see the light of the day.         
	Officials from Technoprom Exports (TPE), one of the equipment suppliers to the project, met Union minister of state for power Jairam Ramesh last week.        
	I have had extensive discussions with TPE representatives last week. I have asked them to resume work while disputes over cost overruns and others issues will be resolved at the earliest, said Ramesh. Power Machine, the other Russian supplier, has resumed work and TPE is likely to follow suit. Ramesh had met Russian ambassador V. I. Trubnikov earlier in May to seek his intervention in resolving the dispute.        
	The (3 X 660MW) project in Bihar has been delayed by 27 months. Problems arose between National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the Russian firms when the foreign entities demanded a hike of almost Rs 600 crore for the equipment citing higher steel prices.        
	It is very important that we get on with the project without further delay. It will take around two to three months for the disputes to be resolved, said Ramesh.        
	There are accusations that instead of 70,000 tonnes of equipment only 12,000 tonnes have reached the project site.        
	Power Machine, which has already agreed to restart work, will supply turbines and generators, while TPE will provide the critical boilers.        
	The problem intensified following a CBI inquiry into allegations of a kickback of Rs 90 crore by one of the Russina firms for the purchase of equipment.        
	Ramesh said the matter had been discussed between Indian Prime Minister and the Russian president.        
	It is not possible to resolve such issues of a critical project without government intervention, said Ramesh.        
	Earlier, the Centre had considered setting up an empowered group of ministers to solve the dispute and analyse the impact of the rise in input costs on the project. Ramesh said the government was working on a revised time schedule with NTPC.

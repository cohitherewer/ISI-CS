          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 9: Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications (R-Com) and MTN of South Africa today extended till July 21 their exclusive talks to create a combine that will rank among the top 10 telecom entities in the world.        
	The announcement  which was made before the bourses opened for trading  came after a night of nervousness as officials on both sides stared at the prospect of an irretrievable breakdown in talks.        
	Both companies tried to temper expectations of a deal by stating that there is no certainty either on completion, or the timing of the proposed transaction.        
	They also advised investors to exercise care in their dealings in the companies securities. Following todays extension, R-Com and MTN stocks rose sharply.        
	R-Com shares settled nearly 6 per cent up at Rs 440.95, after an intra-day rally of over 9 per cent to as high as Rs 454 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. At the same time, MTN shares rose more than one per cent at 129.9 rand during mid-day trade on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.        
	MTN and R-Com have been locked in 45 days of exclusive talks since May 26 to try and forge a business alliance spanning 22 countries.         
	As the exclusivity period expired yesterday, there was no announcement forthcoming from both sides, fuelling speculation that they had decided against further talks.        
	Officials today said the next 13 days would be crucial as both sides try and renegotiate the deal.        
	MTN honchos are expected to meet senior R-Com officials in London in the middle of next week, sources said.        
	MTN has a very complex structure, with the Alpine Trust, a little known foreign trust dominated by the companys top management, holding the key to any deal.         
	So far, the two companies have been working on a possible reverse takeover, whereby Ambani would swap about 24 per cent of his 66 per cent stake in R-Com for a 34.9 per cent stake in MTN.         
	Ambani has been trying to swap a smaller stake in R-Com because he reportedly wants to remain a majority investor in both companies.         
	The R-ComMTN deal has also attracted the attention of Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries (RIL), which claimed a right of first refusal to any stake sale in R-Com.        
	RIL has set a 30-day deadline for R-Com to begin a conciliation process, failing which it will initiate appropriate action to press its right of first refusal to the stake sold in R-Com.

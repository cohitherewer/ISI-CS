                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Realty check on Lehman debacle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 15: The Lehman debacle has set the dovecotes aflutter with speculation starting to grow that the former investment banks tieups with a few realty companies in India could come unstuck pretty soon.        
	Lehman has tied up with HDIL for a redevelopment scheme at Dharavi in Mumbai. HDIL, part of the Wadhawan group, had formed a special purpose vehicle with Lehman in which the former held a majority stake.        
	Lehman had also joined hands with Unitech for a realty project in Mumbai. Earlier, a real estate fund managed by Lehman bought around 50 per cent in the project for around $175 million. However, officials at Unitech said they werent worried about the project as the money had already been brought in.        
	Lehman has a small operation in India with several hundred people associated with institutional broking and back office research. The captive back-office unit employs over 600 people in Mumbai.        
	Last year, Lehman had beefed up its institutional broking business after it acquired Bric Securities.        
	But the bigger fear for the markets is its equity investments in about 25 companies.        
	Market circles said the troubled investment bank had been selling these shares aggressively over the past month. The worry is that Lehmans selloff may prompt other investors to dump these stocks as well. Some experts feel that Lehmans investments have already lost about Rs 2,000 crore.        
	In late August, Lehman had sold shares in various companies, including Cranes Software, Amtek Auto, Amtek India, Fedders Lloyd, Northgate and Prajay Engineering.        
	It has small stakes in about two dozen firms at the end of the June quarter. These are Spice Communications, Spice Mobile, Anant Raj Industries, Edelweiss Capital, IVRCL Infrastructure, Tulip Telecom, Consolidated Construction, PSL, Orbit Corp, Development Credit Bank, Champagne Indage, Godawari Power, KPIT Cummins, West Coast Paper, IOL Netcom, Dhampur Sugar, Prithvi Info, Golden Tobacco, Emkay Global, Vijay Shanti Builders and Pioneer Embroidery.        
	Nearly all these shares ended deeply in the red today. Lehman may not have sold all these shares, but those who have already invested in them are selling big time on the assumption that Lehman will soon exit these counters, a market analyst said.        
	Meanwhile, Ambit Holdings Pvt Ltd said it had hired Andrew Holland from DSP Merrill Lynch as chief executive of institutional equities and equity proprietary trading.

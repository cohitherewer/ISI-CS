	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The budget is expected to provide relief to labour-intensive export units as the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar has forced them to retrench a large number of workers.
    
	Officials said the country was unlikely to meet the export target of $160 billion for the fiscal and would fall short by about $10 billion. For the April-November period of 2007-08, exports grew 22.08 per cent to $98.38 billion against $80.59 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.
    
	They said the recently constituted high-powered group under V. Krishnamurthy, the chairman of the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council, could suggest steps to boost export.
    
	The group could propose benefits to states that will enable them to offer relief on taxes such as VAT, octroi and electricity duty.
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had constituted the group to suggest measures for sustained growth of the manufacturing sector which has shown signs of a slowdown in recent months.
    
	The group could suggest measures to boost labour-intensive export units. Possible steps include tax incentives and easy term loans from financial institutions.
    
	The rupee has appreciated about 15 per cent against the dollar in this fiscal. It closed today at 39.48 to the dollar.
    
	According to official estimates, in rupee terms, exports have gone down 56 per cent in the handicraft segment, about 25 per cent in textiles, 6 per cent in leather products, 33 per cent in tea and 20 per cent in coffee.
    
	A survey carried out by the commerce ministry showed that 200,000 jobs would be lost in garments and textiles.

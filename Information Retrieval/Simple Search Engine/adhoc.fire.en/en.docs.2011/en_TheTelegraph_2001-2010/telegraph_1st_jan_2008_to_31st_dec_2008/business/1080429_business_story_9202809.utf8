          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 28: Bijoli Grill Aerated Water Company will introduce a slew of products, including packaged water. The company, which has relaunched its ice-cream soda, plans to make full use of its revamped factory.        
	Bijoli Grill director M.K. Sarkar said the company, which re-entered the market after a gap of five years, was already facing stiff competition from multinational firms.        
	We are a very small player and far from being a competitor to the multinational players. However, we had to make several changes in introductory prices and incentives to distributors, Sarkar, a retired government officer, who bought the factory and the brand recently, said.        
	The company has appointed 14 distributors in Calcutta and district towns of Bengal. We are making efforts to make full use of the upgraded factory, which is capable of producing 18,000 crates (24 bottles make a crate) per day, Sarkar added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          V. K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons, in Noida on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Huge deposits of gas hydrates have been discovered on the eastern coast of India, more than the combined known reserves of oil, gas and coal.        
	The discoveries are in the Mahanadi basin of the Bay of Bengal, the Krishna-Godavari basin and off the Andaman Islands, the government today announced at an international conference on gas hydrates in Noida.        
	The estimated reserves of gas hydrates are 2,000 trillion cubic metres. If we are able to use even 10 per cent of this, it will meet the energy needs of the country, said V. K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons.        
	Gas hydrates are crystalline substances that look like ice. They form when water and methane get combined at high pressure and low temperature.         
	Each cubic metre slab of a hydrate contains about 164 cubic metres of methane or natural gas.        
	Most of the gas hydrates have been found at shallow-water depths of 200 to 300 metres, while in some instances they reside at depths of even 800 metres.        
	Sibal said if India could utilise part of these reserves, the countrys gas requirements would be solved for a long time to come.         
	However, the technology to tap gas from gas hydrates is still at an experimental stage.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora said there were tremendous technological challenges that had to be tackled before gas hydrates were brought into commercial use.        
	But, I am sure that technological solutions will be available in the near future with the kind of efforts being made in this area by the scientific community, he said.        
	India, the US and Japan are the only three countries that have started research on gas hydrates. However, there are environmental concerns, too, as a kilogram of methane has almost 23 times the greenhouse warming potential of carbon dioxide.         
	The gas hydrates have been discovered by an international team led by the US Geological Survey and Indias directorate-general of hydrocarbons.         
	Sibal said that $37 million had been spent by the Oil Industry Development Board on research on gas hydrates.

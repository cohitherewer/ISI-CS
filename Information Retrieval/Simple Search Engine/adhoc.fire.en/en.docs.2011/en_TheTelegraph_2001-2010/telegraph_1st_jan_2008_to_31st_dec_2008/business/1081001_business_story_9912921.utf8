  Stocks rebound after plunge          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Sept. 30: Finance minister P. Chidambaram and the capital market regulator today talked up the bourses that cratered in the morning after US law-makers rejected a $700-billion rescue plan for the financial services industry.        
	Chidambaram soothed the skittish markets by assuring investors that market regulations would be tightened if required. There is no need to worry. The regulations that are in place are adequate. If they need to be tweaked, we will do so, he told reporters in Delhi.        
	Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) C.B. Bhave, who was also in the capital, said the regulator would crack down on investors who violated short-selling regulations. We are monitoring the situation closely, Bhave said, adding that there was no evidence of rampant short selling in the markets.        
	Chidambaram and finance ministry officials went into a huddle with Bhave to examine ways to deal with the situation after the sensex stepped off a cliff in the morning, tumbling 442 points to a low of 12153.55, mirroring the Dow Jones Industrial Average which recorded its biggest one-day fall on Monday after the US House of Representatives spurned the bailout package.        
	Bhave, economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla and other officials of the finance ministry were attending a seminar organised by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy early today before being summoned for the meeting at North Block.        
	Chidambaram said foreign investors continued to be drawn to India. My information is that while many FIIs are selling, others are buying as well. Perhaps, more FIIs will buy as India is still an attractive market to invest in, he said.        
	The markets rebounded after the soothing words with the sensex closing at 12860.43, a gain of 264.68 points, or 2.1 per cent, over Mondays level.         
	The rally was buttressed by the Reserve Bank of Indias comment that ICICI Bank had sufficient capital reserves to meet any eventuality  an expression of support that ignited the drooping stock.        
	The BSE Bankex  an index that encompasses all the banking scrips  rose 4.92 per cent and was the biggest gainer on the bourse.         
	Domestic institutions, particularly Life Insurance Corporation, were strong buyers in todays trade, said Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.        
	Leash on short sales        
	Regulators around the world have started tightening regulations on short sales  a legitimate market practice where investors sell shares that they do not actually possess on the assumption that the prices will go down.        
	Most investors borrow the shares and sell them on the market and later buy them back and square up their deals. Some, however, do not borrow the stocks either  a practice that is known as a naked short sale.        
	Sebi regulations do not allow naked short sales.        
	Just 10 days ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned short selling in the stocks of 799 financial institutions and asked money managers to report their daily short sales positions in other publicly traded securities.        
	Several Asian regulators took a cue from the SEC today and placed curbs on short sales in an attempt to prop up faltering markets.

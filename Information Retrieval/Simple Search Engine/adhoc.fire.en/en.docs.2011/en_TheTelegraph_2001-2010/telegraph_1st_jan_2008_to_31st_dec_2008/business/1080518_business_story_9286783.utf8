          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Choubey: Big plans                                  
	New Delhi, May 17: State-owned gas distributor GAIL (India) Ltd will invest Rs 30,000 crore in the next four years to set up a petrochemicals project in India and another abroad.        
	According to industry sources, GAIL has identified three locations  Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia  to set up its overseas project with an Indian partner.        
	Earlier this week, GAIL chairman and managing director U.D. Choubey had said, The names of the three sites identified by GAIL for its overseas petrochemical venture will be announced shortly.         
	Petrochemical is one of the key focus areas of the company in the next five years, he had added.        
	Choubey also said project details, cost, financing and equity would be decided once the sites were selected and feasibility report commissioned.         
	All I can tell you is it will be a mega petrochemical plant, potentially costing billions of dollars, he said.        
	Sources said GAIL could choose Reliance as its partner to set up the plant of over two-million-tonne capacity.        
	Kuwait Petroleum Corporation said it had held talks with Reliance as a potential partner in refining and petrochemicals projects together with Dow Chemicals.        
	GAIL has entered into an understanding with Reliance Industries to set up petrochemical complexes in feedstock-rich countries. It has set up a working group with representatives from both companies.        
	Sources said once the partners identified the location for the project abroad, a special purpose vehicle would be floated. Company officials said GAIL wanted to diversify into petrochemical, pipeline, exploration and production and telecom.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar improves Esmark offer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Essar improves Esmark offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Moving ahead                                  
	Calcutta, June 11: The battle for Esmark has intensified further with Essar Steel raising its bid for the US-based steel maker to outsmart Russian challenger OAO Severstal.        
	Essar Steel Holdings Ltd, owned by Shashi and Ravi Ruia, said it was ready to pay $19 a share for Esmark compared with $17 apiece offered on April 30.        
	The Indian company has informed the Esmark board about the revised offer. The Esmark board is slated to meet on Friday to consider Severstals offer of $17 per share.        
	The matching offer of Severstal, owned by Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov, has been favoured by United Steelworkers (USW).        
	The current USW contract, which expires on September 1, gives the union the right to reject any reorganisation that may involve a change in ownership of the company.        
	The union has a proven clout in taking a final call on takeovers. It sided with Esmark in its successful takeover of Wheeling-Pittsburg last year, defeating the previous management teams efforts to merge with Brazils Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA, which had lost Anglo-Dutch Corus to Tata Steel.        
	Sources said Essars talks with USW had shown positive signs and there was a possibility that the union might back its bid.        
	The company would not have raised the bid had there not been any favourable discussion with the union, sources said.        
	When the Esmark board meets on Friday, it will have two competing offers to discuss instead of merely approving the Severstal proposal.        
	The new Essar offer will value Esmark at $1.2 billion.        
	Following Esmarks acceptance of Essars offer on April 30, the latter had entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire all outstanding shares at $17 per share of the Nasdaq listed steel company. Essar had also extended a $110-million loan to Esmark, which helped the company address a potential default.         
	Essar had previously informed Esmark that it was ready to recognise USW, accept the Basic Labour Agreement and negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement on an expedited basis.         
	Essar has also proposed a capital expenditure of $525 million for Esmarks Ohio and West Virginia manufacturing facilities over the next five years.        
	If the deal goes through, Essar will be able to further strengthen its presence in the North American market.         
	In 2007, the Ruia firm hd acquired Algoma Steel Plant in Canada and Minnesota Steel in the US. After the revised bid, Esmarks shares jumped 6.91 per cent to $19.93 today from the previous days close of $18.86 on the Nasdaq

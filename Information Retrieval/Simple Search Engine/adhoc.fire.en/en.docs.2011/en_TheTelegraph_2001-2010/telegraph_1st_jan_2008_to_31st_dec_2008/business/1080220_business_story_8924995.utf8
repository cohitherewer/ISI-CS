The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exporters get more tax relief
                                                                                                               Exporters get more tax relief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Smooth sailing                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Centre today exempted exporters from paying service taxes on three more categories, bringing the total number of exempted services to 13.        
	Exporters will pay the tax, but the Centre will refund the money.        
	All the three exemptions given today relate to services offered for transportation.        
	Services provided by agencies for transport of goods by road from a factory to a place of export such as a container depot, port and airport will be exempt from the tax; so too are services provided for transportation by rail. If such services are provided by courier companies, the tax is also exempted. A service tax comprises a 12 per cent levy on the value of a service plus a 3 per cent cess.        
	Exports have been hit badly by the 15 per cent appreciation of the rupee against the dollar this year and are unlikely to reach the target of $160 billion set for this fiscal.         
	Officials said the sops were announced now and not during the budget as these pertained to this financial year, while the budget measures were for 2008-09.        
	Exports for April-December 2007 stood at $111 billion, a growth rate of 21.76 per cent. Exports in December grew 16.04 per cent in dollar terms, but in rupee terms the growth was a meagre 2.54 per cent.         
	Refunds on taxes were earlier extended to services such as ports, general insurance, inspection and certification agency, business exhibition and storage and warehousing.        
	Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Exporter Organisations, said exporters had also been demanding exemptions on services provided by foreign agents as well as those relating to foreign travel. It is the remaining list of services that will provide real relief to exporters, he said.        
	Besides, the system of refunds is a cumbersome process. Not many exporters are able to get reimbursements, Gupta said.        
	Analysts said the relief for transportation by road and rail would help exporters from the interiors. The exemption on courier services would help small firms who send consignments as well as samples abroad through couriers.        
	Exporters have also demanded the removal of state levies such as central sales taxes, sales tax on petroleum products, electricity duty, mandi tax and entry tax.

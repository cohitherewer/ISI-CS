The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Moser Baer draws up capacity hike plan
                                                                                                               Moser Baer draws up capacity hike plan
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 11 (pti): Compact disc manufacturer Moser Baer India today said it planned to invest over $1.5 billion (nearly Rs 6,000 crore) to expand the manufacturing capacity of its thin film photovoltaic modules.        
	For this purpose, subsidiary firm PV Technologies India has signed a memorandum of understanding with a global equipment firm for supply of critical equipment for a 565MW phased expansion of its photovoltaic modules manufacturing unit. The proposed expansion will increase the companys capacity from 40MW to over 600MW by 2010.        
	In March 2007, the company acquired a 40 per cent stake in Slovenia-based Solarvalue Proizvodnja d.d. through Moser Baer Photo Voltaic.        
	We see an increasingly important role for thin film technology in meeting peaking power requirements and aim to be a significant player in this area, said Ravi Khanna, CEO of PV Technologies.         
	Earlier, Moser Baer had issued $150 million worth of FCCBs with a five-year tenure in June last year. The bonds were subscribed 2.25 times.        
	Shares of the company closed at Rs 173.90, down 15.25 points, or 8.06 per cent, on the BSE.

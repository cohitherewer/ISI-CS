	New Delhi, July 20: The two proposed mega power projects in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have cleared some major hurdles, giving much needed impetus to the governments ambitious plan of setting up nine such giant facilities by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12).        
	The Power Finance Corporation (PFC), the nodal agency for the projects, is likely to soon invite bids for the Cheyyur project in Tamil Nadu, while the Maharashtra government is ready to finalise the site.        
	Each of the power projects has a capacity of 4,000MW and requires an investment of Rs 16,000-20,000 crore.        
	Sources in the power ministry said the DMK government in Tamil Nadu had sorted out the problems of land acquisition and compensation, and bidding for the request for qualification was likely to be called by the end of this month.         
	The Cheyyur plant will run on imported coal and provide electricity to Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states. A special purpose vehicle  Coastal Tamil Nadu Power Limited  has been formed as a fully owned subsidiary of PFC.        
	Compensation for the displaced had delayed the project for several months. The state government had even suggested another site, but the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and PFC stuck to the original location.        
	The projects are awarded through a two-stage bidding process. Those who qualify the eligibility round place their bids on a per unit tariff basis, and the project is awarded to the one offering the lowest tariff.        
	Officials said the Tamil Nadu government had expressed interest in another mega power project, which the power ministry would approve if suitable land was identified and clearances obtained.        
	Maharashtra move        
	The Maharashtra government is close to finalising Munge village in Devgarh taluk (Sindhudurg district) as an alternative site for the project.         
	It faced local opposition at Girye, also in Sindhudurg district, which was the original site.        
	The locals have been opposing the project as it would lead to the destruction of mangroves.         
	They have even rejected the compensation, which was calculated on the basis of the value of mangoes that would have grown in the next few years.        
	Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is keen to have the project in his home state, and the state government is giving the necessary approvals for the new location and is also finalising the site for the proposed port.        
	A team of officials from the CEA and the PFC had recently visited Munge and given their consent.        
	Officials said the site had two advantages. It is located just two kilometres from the coast and has been identified as a wasteland.        
	Sources said the first phase of the bidding process could start by the end of this year, if the government is able to acquire the land and obtain environmental clearance.

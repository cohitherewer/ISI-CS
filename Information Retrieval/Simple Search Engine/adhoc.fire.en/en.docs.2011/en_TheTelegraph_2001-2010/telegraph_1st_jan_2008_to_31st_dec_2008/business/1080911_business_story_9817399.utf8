	New Delhi, Sept. 10: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel maker, is facing cost overruns of up to 50 per cent in its two projects in eastern India because of delays in getting regulatory approvals.        
	We have not received approvals for a lot of projects. There are delays in securing mining allocations, L.N. Mittal, who heads the steel behemoth, said here today.        
	The company has proposed two steel plants  one in Orissa and the other in Jharkhand  with a total capacity of 24 million tonnes at an investment of $20 billion. When we started, we estimated they (the steel plants) would cost about $20 billion. But there is a delay and costs are going up. The more the delay, the higher the cost overruns, Mittal said.        
	However, Mittal refused to blame the states for the delay. We are getting support from the state governments. The issue is how fast we can execute and implement and how fast the governments can execute their portion of the responsibilities, he said.        
	The company is in the process of acquiring coal and iron ore mines in the two states. We are working with the governments to identify the mines, he said.        
	On the rise in steel prices, Mittal said, The solution is not to control prices, but to allow more steel to be produced.        
	He said he was looking at other opportunities related to the steel business.

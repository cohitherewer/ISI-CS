	New Delhi, Aug. 31: Manufacturers of consumer goods hope to smile their way to the bank in the festive season.         
	Fears of an economic slowdown plunging the Rs 20,000-crore consumer durables industry into the red seem to have receded, with manufacturers expecting sales to grow between 10 per cent and 12 per cent in the current fiscal.         
	In a recent poll on the durables industry, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) had forecast 10 per cent sales growth. Major players feel post-monsoon festive sales will do the trick.         
	The signs of a turnaround and growth optimism have come in the backdrop of a difficult period experienced by the sector last year, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of the CII.        
	Sales are expected to bounce back since consumers who postponed their purchase of air-conditioners and refrigerators are expected to shop now. The Sixth Pay Commission will also release a lot of disposable income in the hands of the consumer, said Kamal Nandi, vice-president (appliance division), Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Company.        
	The industry believes that an average increase of 21 per cent in the salaries of more than five million Union government employees will boost consumer spending.         
	The industry also hopes to reduce its input costs as the prices of plastics and copper are coming down.        
	It is true that the industry works on very thin margins and any escalation in input costs causes great stress. But with the prices of steel flattening out and those of copper and plastic coming down five per cent, we have room to breathe, Nandi said.        
	While Samsung Electronics India and Whirlpool have already announced their promotional offers for Onam in Kerala, LG, Haier and Godrej have chalked out their marketing strategy well ahead of the festive season.        
	Godrej will launch washing machines, microwaves and frost-free refrigerators and offer gifts in the range of Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000.         
	We are finalising some exciting festive season schemes which will boost our sales, said Pranay Dhabhai, director and chief operating officer of Haier Appliances India.

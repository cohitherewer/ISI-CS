          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Virmani in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The finance ministry is keen on more monetary stimulants, including interest rate cuts.         
	Monetary policy should be much more aggressive and proactive than it has been, Arvind Virmani, chief economic adviser to the ministry, said. He heads the economic affairs department, which decides much of the governments day-to-day finance policies and interacts with the RBI to co-ordinate activities.        
	Virmani said monetary policy should be more aggressive to counter the global financial crisis.        
	Analysts inferred that the government was seeking more interest rate cuts in tune with its huge spending programme.        
	Financial consultant Dun amp; Bradstreet said it expected the RBI to again cut rates.         
	Merrill Lynch said it expected Indian banks to cut prime lending rates by 75 basis points within March.        
	Virmani said the government was concerned with the weak health of the economy and more measures needed to be taken.         
	The analysts said Virmani was probably indicating that a second growth package was on the way. The government had announced a Rs 30,700-crore package on December 7.        
	To make funds available to firms, the RBI has cut the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) a number of times recently. The repo is the rate at which the RBI lends to banks in the short term, while CRR is the proportion of deposits that banks have to keep with the central bank.        
	World Bank economist Dipak Dasgupta said the government should invest heavily in infrastructure and skill development to revive the economy in the medium term.        
	Ficci today asked for more fiscal reliefs from the government and the RBI.        
	Representatives of the chamber met cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and sought monetary reliefs such as cutting CRR to 4.5 per cent and the repo rate to 5 per cent.        
	On its wish list are credit facilities to prop up housing and automobiles plus special packages for labour-intensive segments such as textiles, leather, footwear, handicrafts and gems and jewellery. Industry growth has turned negative in October for the first time in 15 years.         
	The global economic slowdown has also taken its toll on foreign investment, with FDI declining 26 per cent in October.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, July 5: The government today deferred a decision on raising the interest rate on provident funds. The Left parties have been demanding that the PF rate be raised to 12 per cent from the present 8.5 per cent in the face of growing inflation.        
	In January this year, the board of the state-run Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had decided to retain the 8.5 per cent interest rate given to nearly four crore subscribers for 2007-08. At that point of time also, there were demands that the rate be raised to 9.5 per cent.        
	Interest rates should be hiked ... bank deposit rates, other interest rates are all increasing. One fails to understand how the EPFO can sit back, said CPI trade union leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who is also a member of Parliament.        
	The EPFO will meet again next month to take a call on raising PF interest rates. The Left, represented by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and the All India Trade Union Congress, has demanded a 12 per cent rate of interest, citing the double-digit interest rate prevailing in the country.        
	Coverage limit        
	The central board of trustees (CBT) of the EPFO today also decided to bring down the threshold for the EPF coverage to include all establishments that have at least 10 employees and all co-operatives that have at least 20 employees.         
	At present, the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, covers only establishments with 20 or more employees.         
	For co-operatives, the number is 50. The move along with the social security cover envisaged for the unorganised sector is expected to reach out to almost all kinds of units, irrespective of the number of employees.        
	The ceiling for the industries have been revised and now any industry with 10 or more employees will have to deduct EPF money of the employees, Union labour minister Oscar Fernandes said after chairing a meeting of the EPFO board.        
	It was a major decision and there are several industries that were required to be covered under the EPF. There was resistance on the part of the industries but then it was in favour of employees, W. V. Vardharajan, who is a Citu leader and a member of the EPF board, said.         
	The board also took up the issue of industries faltering in paying the EPF money. These industries are putting up requests before the board about giving relaxation in damages, Vardarajan said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deveshwar in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Calcutta, July 30: ITC Ltd  the Rs 21,355.94-crore tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate  is looking to snap up stakes in peer group companies taking advantage of a badly roiled stock market.        
	About five years ago, it had sent a frisson through the corporate world when it picked up a little more than 14 per cent in hotel major EIH which owns the Oberoi chain of hotels.        
	ITC chairman Yogesh Chander Deveshwar told reporters on the sidelines of the 97th annual general meeting here today that the company was open to the idea of investing in companies that occupy the same space in which it operates.        
	We will invest if there is value, Deveshwar said.        
	The Calcutta-headquartered conglomerate holds a 14.92 per cent stake in EIH through a wholly owned subsidiary company, perilously close to the 15 per cent threshold which, when breached, would trigger a mandatory open offer for another 20 per cent.         
	The stake purchase had raised a tingle of excitement as an open offer from ITC could herald a change in management at Indias premier hospitality chain.        
	ITC also owns some 23 lakh shares in paper major Ballarpur Industries. ITC is a strong player in the hotels and the paper industry.        
	Asked what ITC intended to do with the EIH investment, Deveshwar smiled and said, We do not disclose our plans. But as you can see, it is listed as a long-term investment in the balance sheet.        
	However, he clarified that the companys focus would be to boost the existing lines of business  personal and healthcare, lifestyle retail, food, hotels, paper and cigarettes.        
	BAT absent        
	The nominee director of British American Tobacco Plc, the single largest shareholder of ITC, missed the AGM for the first time in many years. One of the two directors, Hugo Geoffrey Powell, could not come because of a visa problem, Deveshwar said, adding that he was stuck in Singapore.         
	Poor show        
	ITC stunned the market by posting a 1 per cent decline in underlying profits in the first quarter after adjusting a tax refund of Rs 29 crore in the same period last year. Net turnover grew 18.4 per cent.        
	On a strict like-to-like basis, net profit was down to Rs 748.67 crore in the first quarter ended June 30 from Rs 782.87 crore a year ago.         
	Net sales were up to Rs 3,899.7 crore from Rs 3,293.83 crore.

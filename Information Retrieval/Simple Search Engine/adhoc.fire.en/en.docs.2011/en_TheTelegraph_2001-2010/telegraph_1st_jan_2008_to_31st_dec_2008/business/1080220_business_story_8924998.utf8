                                                                                                               Tata stake in jet venture
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Feb. 19: The Tatas are entering the aviation business once again. The group, which owned Air India before it was nationalised, is picking up a 40 per cent stake in BJETs to launch Asias first fractional private jet company in May.        
	BJETS is a private jet operator that provides services to corporations and high net worth individuals. The company has placed an order for a fleet of 50 brand new jets worth over Rs 2,400 crore from Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation.        
	Fractional ownership allows a member to acquire a portion of a jet and pay a fraction of the fixed fees and yet have access to an entire fleet of identically outfitted aircraft.         
	BJETS will operate the aircraft and the owner just needs to schedule the flights. In case, a users own jet is unavailable at the desired time, another jet from the operators fleet will be assigned.         
	The Tata stake in the venture is being routed through Indian Hotels Company. The Briley Group, a $2-billion privately held multinational company with holdings in the aviation, hospitality, business process outsourcing and technology and service sectors, will hold a majority stake in BJETS.

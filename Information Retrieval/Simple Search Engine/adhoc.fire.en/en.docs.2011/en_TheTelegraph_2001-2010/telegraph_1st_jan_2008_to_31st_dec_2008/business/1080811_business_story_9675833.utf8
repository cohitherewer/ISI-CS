        Conventional pension plans may not be enough to meet your future needs. Try out the annuity schemes of insurance firms which offer better returns, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                           
	Some 18 years back, one could buy a kilo of potatoes for Rs 2.50, while it costs Rs 8 a kilo now. The consumer price index has surged over three times at an annual inflation rate of 7.08 per cent between 1990-91 and 2007-08. At the same rate of inflation, a kilo of potatoes will cost Rs 25.50 by 2024-2025.         
	The question is whether todays savings are enough to meet the future expenses of ones post-retirement days. An individual may not be much hassled about retirement plans at the start of the career, but care delayed is care denied and it holds good for ones financial health, too.        
	Start early        
	It is important to start retirement planning at an early age, particularly because people now live longer than their ancestors (see Table 1).         
	This means that with the same number of working years (retirement age is 60 years) as before, one will have to provide for an extended post-retirement life.         
	So, what are the options available to take care of ones retirement investments?         
	According to a National Sample Survey Organisation data, only 6 per cent of the countrys working population is in the organised sector and has access to provident fund and pension income. Pension income again is highly skewed in favour of government employees.         
	While a private sector employee can also get a monthly pension under the Employees Pension Scheme of 1995, one will have to be a member of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation with a pensionable service of at least 9 years 6 months.        
	However, under the existing provisions of the scheme, one gets a meagre amount as post-retirement pension. Let us explain this with the help of an example.        
	Not much to count        
	Under the existing rules, an employee contributes 12 per cent of the monthly salary (basic+DA), which entirely accrues to the mandatory retirement savings scheme, Employees Provident Fund (EPF).         
	The employer is also required to make a matching contribution, but part of the employers contribution goes to the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS), while the other part accrues to the EPF.        
	The employers contribution to EPS is also capped at 8.33 per cent of a maximum basic salary (plus DA) of Rs 6,500, or Rs 541 a month.         
	So, if ones basic salary is Rs 5,000, the employer will contribute Rs 416.50 per month to the pension scheme and Rs 183.50 to the provident fund account, apart from the employees monthly contribution of Rs 600 to the provident fund account.         
	But, if ones basic salary is Rs 10,000, the employer will contribute Rs 541 to the EPS and Rs 659 to the EPF, in addition to the employees contribution of Rs 1,200 to the EPF         
	If the basic salary is more than Rs 6,500, one will be entitled to a monthly pension at the rate of Rs 2,785.70 till death, provided one works for 30 years and the employer has contributed to the EPS account without any break during those years.         
	Other options        
	Another option is to buy immediate annuity from a life insurance company by paying a one-time lump sum amount. The annuity rates of life insurance companies are much higher than the pension payouts under the Employees Pension Scheme (see Table 2). Insurance companies also pay a higher rate if the one-time premium paid is more than Rs 1 lakh.         
	So, by contributing to the Employees Pension Scheme one is actually losing money as one is getting much less than what one could have got otherwise.         
	Had the employers contribution accrued to ones EPF account only, one would have accumulated an additional Rs 8,74,946.17, taking into account the 8.5 per cent annual compounded interest rate payable on the EPF account. With this Rs 8,74,946 you could have bought from LIC an annual annuity of Rs 81,807.45 that translates into a monthly payout of Rs 6,817.30. This is nearly 2.5 times more than what one would get from the Employees Pension Scheme.        
	Insurance companies can give a better rate because they are allowed to invest a higher proportion of their corpus in equities and equity-linked instruments which the EPS fund managers cannot. So, by not allowing EPF to invest in equities and private corporate debt papers, trade unions and political leaders are actually working against the interests of employees.         
	Build your own kitty        
	One can build ones own retirement kitty through systematic investments in a mix of equity and debt schemes of mutual funds.         
	While the contribution to EPS is mandatory, one can start an SIP in an equity-oriented mutual fund for Rs 540 every month. Thus, every year one can invest Rs 6,500.         
	At a conservative annual return of 10 per cent over a period of 30 years, ones investment will stand at Rs 11,76,132.26. After this, one can buy an annual annuity of Rs 10,9968.36 that translates into a monthly income of Rs 9,164.03 over and above ones monthly pension income of Rs 2,785.70 from EPS. A meagre investment of Rs 540 a month can thus ensure a monthly income of nearly Rs 12,000 post-retirement.        
	Through a systematic investment plan in an equity-linked saving scheme, one can also claim a deduction on Rs 6,500 investment every year under Section 80C.        
	Choice is yours        
	There are deferred annuity and unit-linked pension plans of life insurance companies. But since most of these plans are unit-linked, the charges are front-loaded. A large part of the premiums that one pays in the initial three to four years get deducted and only 60 to 70 per cent is invested.         
	On the other hand, the charges in mutual funds are much lower and if the units are directly bought from the fund house, one doesnt have to pay any entry load.        
	One can also go in for a bank fixed deposit instead of buying an annuity plan from a life insurer with the retirement fund thus accumulated. Whether one should go for a bank fixed deposit or an annuity plan will depend on the interest rates offered by banks and insurers at a given point of time.

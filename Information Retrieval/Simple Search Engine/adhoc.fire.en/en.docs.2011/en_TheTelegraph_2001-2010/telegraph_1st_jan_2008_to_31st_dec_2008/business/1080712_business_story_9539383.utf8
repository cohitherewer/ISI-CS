          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 11: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today warned that Indias rating might be brought down to speculative grade if the country fails to tamp down on inflation and trim its fiscal and current account deficits.        
	S amp;P currently rates India at BBB-, its lowest investment grade. A cut in sovereign rating will increase the overseas borrowing cost of domestic companies.        
	In an article published by S amp;P, titled Will ratings on India withstand triple whammy of rising inflation and worsening fiscal and current account deficits?, its credit analyst Takahira Ogawa said the Congress-led government faced challenges such as rising fiscal deficits, surging inflation, and, to a lesser extent, widening current account deficits.        
	He added that the withdrawal of Left support to the UPA could complicate early implementation of fiscal-discipline measures.        
	S amp;P, however, added that risks to the Indian economy were mitigated by its deep domestic markets, which allowed it to finance large fiscal deficits without recourse to external funds and by its strong external liquidity.

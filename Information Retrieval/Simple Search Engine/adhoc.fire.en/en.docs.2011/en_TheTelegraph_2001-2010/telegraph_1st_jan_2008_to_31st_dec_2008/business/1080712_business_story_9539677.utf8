The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil jumps to $147 a barrel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil jumps to $147 a barrel

	London, July 11 (Reuters): Oil leapt $5 to a record high above $147 a barrel today, spurred by growing worries of threats to supplies from Iran and Nigeria and the possibility of a strike by Brazilian oil workers next week.        
	The US crude was at $146.50 a barrel by 1315 GMT, after climbing as high as $147.27 earlier in the day. It rose $5.60, or 4 per cent, a barrel on Thursday in a late burst of buying activity. London Brent crude was up $1.52 at $143.55 a barrel. Leading the oil complex was ICE (IntercontinentalExchange) gas oil futures which climbed to a record high of $1,336.75 a tonne amid strong demand for diesel and aviation fuel.        
	Analysts said the threat of supply disruptions provided the bullish backdrop, as the demand picture was unlikely to change much until after the Beijing Olympics. We continue to believe that the downside risk to oil prices remains relatively low until the non-OECD countries begin to show greater price and income elasticity response than has been evident to date, Deutsche Bank analyst Adam Sieminski said in a note.        
	Hot spots        
	Oil, which had been on the retreat for much of the week, reversed course on Thursday as fears of supply disruptions from potential hot spots, Opec members Iran and Nigeria, resurfaced.        
	A spate of missile tests by Iran, the worlds fourth-largest oil exporter, in the last two days against a backdrop of rising tensions with Israel and the US has left the oil markets worried.        
	Iran has threatened to strike back at Tel Aviv as well as US interests in a key oil shipping route if it is attacked over its nuclear programme, which Israel and the West fear is aimed at making nuclear weapons. The US said it was ready to defend its allies.        
	The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the main militant group in Nigerias oil-producing region, said it was abandoning a ceasefire to protest against a British offer to help tackle lawlessness in the region.

	 Mumbai, Nov. 28: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the time period for credit facilities given to various sectors, including exporters, to help them overcome the credit crunch and battle the economic slowdown. In view of the difficulties being faced by exporters on account of the weakening of external demand, the RBI has decided to extend the period of concessional pre-shipment credit to 180 days from 90 days. The facility will come into effect from December 1, an RBI release said. At present, exporters receive concessional credit at 2.5 per cent below the benchmark prime lending rate for pre-shipment activities. The decision was taken after a review meeting convened by RBI governor D. Subbarao with select public and private sector banks. The central bank has also clarified that the refinance facility for the mutual funds, housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) would be available for renewal or rollover, on maturity of existing facility. The RBI has been providing liquidity support to the NBFCs, HFCs and MFs through the refinance route to help them tackle the credit crunch.

	Bharti AXA General Insurance will cater to rural, urban and commercial segments that include corporate houses and medium and small enterprises. It will offer products covering property, projects, motor, health, personal accident and travel.        
	According to Milind Chalisgaonkar, CEO, Bharti AXA General Insurance, the general insurance market in India has strong growth potential, and the company is confident of serving customers with strong distribution, personalised service and efficient claims settlement.        
	According to George Kurien, CFO, Bharti AXA General Insurance, the joint venture, which currently has seven offices across the country, is planning to expand to 29 locations by the end of the first year of operations.

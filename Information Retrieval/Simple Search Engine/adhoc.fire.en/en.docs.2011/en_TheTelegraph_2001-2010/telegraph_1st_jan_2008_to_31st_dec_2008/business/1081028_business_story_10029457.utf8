   Darkness all around on eve of Diwali          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 27: Investors survived another major scare on the eve of Diwali as the sensex plunged 1004 points to a three-year intra-day low of 7697.39, before it was rescued by domestic institutions.        
	While the benchmark index ended only with a fall of 191.51 points at 8509.56, it marked a gory end to Samvat 2064 during which the sensex lost nearly 55 per cent.         
	Investors and marketmen now step into Samvat 2065 with anxiety about how equity as an asset class will fare at a time when the global economy shows all signs of sliding into a recession.        
	Over the weekend, speculation grew that the US commerce department would come out with figures on Thursday that would show that the economy had contracted 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter (July to September), which would underpin all the gloomy talk about a recession. If it does, this will be the second time that the US economy will be contracting after the 0.2 per cent de-growth in the last quarter of 2007 (October to December).        
	The mood is dull and scary as we go into Samvat 2065. However, one must not look into the past, one must look to the future. These are tempting valuations and those who have courageously invested in these times will make huge profits in over a year, said Ashok Jainani, vice-president, research amp; market strategy, at Khandwala Securities.        
	Jainani said an indication of just how cheap stocks were could be gauged from their market capitalisation. The market cap of 100 of the top 200 companies are trading at just 1 to 3 times their 2007-08 cash profit; many are less than their recorded annual sales.        
	Analysts say stocks are now available at crazy valuations, but investors are still hesitant to purchase them because of fears that the correction is not over as yet.        
	Following negative cues coming from Asian markets, the sensex opened in the red at 8,599.58.         
	At noon, foreign institutional investors pressed heavy sales at many counters, sparking some panic in the market. The index swooned to an intra-day low of 7697.39, a drop of 1003.68 points over the last close.        
	It was at this point that domestic institutions came into the picture.         
	Market observers said their purchases triggered heavy short-covering by other investors. This led to the index recovering most of its losses. It, however, ended in the negative territory at 8509.56, a net fall of 191.51 points, or 2.20 per cent, from its last close. The domestic institutions have invested more than Rs 9,000 crore in the markets this month.        
	The sensex was, therefore, better placed than its peers such as Hong Kongs Hang Seng, which tumbled 12.70 per cent, and Japans Nikkei, which fell 6.36 per cent. Chinas Shanghai Composite fell 6.32 per cent and Taiwans weighted index was down 4.65 per cent.        
	The recovery did not quell fears about further turmoil in the days ahead. Analysts said it was still too early to say whether stocks could rise from here.         
	Elsewhere, the 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange shed 59.80 points, or 2.31 per cent, to close at 2524.20 from its last close.

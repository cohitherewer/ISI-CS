	Calcutta, June 18: State-run Andhra Bank is all set to raise foreign currency loans worth $125 million.        
	The bank is targeting a 20-22 per cent growth in loans and deposits in the current financial year, its chairman K. Ramakrishnan said here today.        
	In 2007-08, Andhra Bank clocked a total business of Rs 83,993 crore, reflecting a growth rate of 20.53 per cent over the previous year. While deposits accounted for Rs 49,437 crore, advances were Rs 34,556 crore. Net profit of the bank stood at Rs 575.57 crore at the end of March 31, 2008.         
	On interest rates, Ramakrishnan said, Well take a call on our deposit rates soon.         
	The chairman indicated that the bank might increase its deposit rates by 50 basis points. However, he ruled out any increase in lending rates. Ramakrishnan was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	Earlier this month, the bank had increased its interest rates on domestic term deposits for three to five years to 9 per cent. For fixed deposits of one to two years and five to 10 years, the interest rate is 8.75 per cent.        
	With the inflation rate at 8.75 per cent, the real rate of interest on deposits for many banks has turned negative. Banks will have to increase their deposit rates to mobilise more savings to support credit demand, Ramakrishnan said.        
	Though the possible increase in deposit rates would put pressure on the banks margin in the current fiscal, the Andhra Bank chairman hoped that it would not hurt its profitability.        
	On infrastructure lending, Ramakrishnan said banks were considering medium to long-term bonds to mobilise resources.         
	This will pre-empt the asset-liability mismatch in this sector. Explaining the point, Ramakrishnan said infrastructure loans typically have a long tenure  10 years or more. To fund these long-term loans, the bank needs to raise long-term money in the form of fixed deposits.         
	Though banks offer fixed deposits up to 10 years there are few takers because interest rates are not attractive.         
	Till a few days ago, 10-year bank deposits were fetching lower returns than three-year schemes. This creates an asset-liability imbalance in infrastructure lending.

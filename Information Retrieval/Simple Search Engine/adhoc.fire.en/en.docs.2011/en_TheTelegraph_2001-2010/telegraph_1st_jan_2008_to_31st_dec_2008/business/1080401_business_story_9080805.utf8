	New Delhi, March 31: State-run Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) today floated a wholly owned consultancy company that, among other things, will manage the full range activities relating to the setting up of mega power projects.        
	PFC Consulting Limited, the subsidiary, will provide consultancy services in the power sector and related areas, said V.K. Garg, chairman and managing director, PFC. In mega power projects, PFC will oversee the formation of special purpose vehicles, carry out the bidding and awarding process and obtain regulatory clearances.        
	PFC has been designated as the nodal agency for the setting up of the mega power projects, each having a capacity of 4,000 MW.        
	There are immense opportunities for consultancy services in the power sector. PFC has decided to focus on these opportunities with the new subsidiary, said Garg.        
	The new subsidiary would be headed by N.D. Tyagi, executive director (consultancy services), PFC. It already has consultancy assignments of Rs 60 crore, to be executed over the next 18 months.        
	PFC Consulting is in talks with an international firm for a joint venture to provide technical expertise to domestic power utilities.        
	The new firm will also conduct the bidding process for the projects of state utilities, offer legal advice and prepare feasibility reports for projects. PFC, the premier lending institution in the power sector, started providing consultancy services in 1999.        
	The company has been awarded 55 assignments valued at Rs 90 crore and its clients include the state power utilities of Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Meghalaya.        
	PFC is also expected to soon float a wholly owned subsidiary which will be the nodal agency to implement the Centres accelerated power development and reform programme. The programme was launched in March 2003 to accelerate reforms in the distribution sector.

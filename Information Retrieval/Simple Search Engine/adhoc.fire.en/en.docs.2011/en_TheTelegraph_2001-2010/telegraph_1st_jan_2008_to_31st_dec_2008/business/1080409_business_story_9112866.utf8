                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AMD to slash 1600 jobs
                            
	Silicon Valley, April 8 (PTI): US chip firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which has offices in India, announced today that it would cut 10 per cent of its global payroll, or over 1,600 jobs, because of deteriorating business conditions.        
	AMD, the second largest American chip maker, which has been facing problems largely because of a resurgent Intel, will begin reducing its workforce this month and the process is expected to be completed by the end of September, it said.        
	However, details regarding the locations of job cuts by the company, which has offices in Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi, were not given.        
	The reduction will be global and will span all groups and all levels within the company and be based on business needs, AMD spokesperson Drew Prairie said.        
	He said the layoffs were part of a cost restructuring to help return the company to profitability.        
	The company announced the cutbacks in a press statement after the US markets closed on Monday.        
	It said it expected to report revenues of $1.5 billion, down 15 per cent from the last quarter.        
	AMD said that the revenue drop was caused by lower-than-expected sales across all business segments.

	New Delhi, Nov. 8 (PTI): Indias economic growth may slip to 7 per cent this fiscal because of the global financial meltdown, Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said today.        
	My gut feeling is that it (economic growth rate) may come down to 7 per cent ... we will take another look in January, Tendulkar told reporters after a meeting called by the Planning Commission to review the implications of the global economic slowdown.        
	In August, the economic advisory council had forecast a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.7 per cent.        
	There are some positive and some negative developments which will have implications on Indias economic growth, he said.         
	One or two decimal points above and below 7 per cent should not be a worry ... We will still be recording the second highest growth rate in the world (after China), Tendulkar said.        
	The Reserve Bank in its latest policy review on October 24 projected a GDP growth rate of 7.5-8 per cent, while finance minister P. Chidambaram is optimistic that the economy would grow by 8 per cent despite the global crisis.        
	According to the projections of various economic think-tanks before the Planning Commission, the global financial meltdown could wipe out Indias economic growth by 1.5-2.5 per cent in the next two years.        
	There is a lot of uncertainty but compared with the base run, growth can be 1.5 -2.5 per cent lower, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.        
	Ahluwalia said, Although the country faces a difficult time for the next two years, we can minimise the impact by looking at contra-cyclical policies.        
	He added that by the time the world recovered in the third year, India would be back on the trajectory of growth projected earlier.        
	Indias ability to grow at a high rate is not affected, he said, but may be lower than what was projected in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani with Uday Kotak (left), managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: Anil Ambanis ADAG group is mulling the option of manufacturing equipment for the power sector and is scouting for a global strategic partner.                          
	If Ambani enters the power-equipment segment, he will be following the management mantra that helped father Dhirubhai Ambani reap huge dividends: backward integration.        
	The Reliance ADAG group has already started discussions with a few players, but Ambani refused to reveal names         
	In the power business, Ambani straddles all the sub-segments: generation, transmission and distribution.         
	The proposed foray into equipment manufacture is part of a larger game plan to not only crunch the schedules for the groups massive power projects, such as the 3,960MW Sasan project, but also pare costs.        
	These issues are crucial for Reliance Power Ltd as it is developing 13 medium and large sized power projects with combined planned installed capacity of 28,200MW.        
	Ambani told reporters here today at a roadshow for Reliance Powers Rs 11,000 crore initial public offering (IPO) that the power equipment business would be kept separate from Reliance Power (which will manage the new power projects) and Reliance Energy (which manages power transmission and distribution).        
	This foray is designed to meet the cost and delivery schedules of our power projects, he said        
	He said the power business had undergone a major change in recent times. It was no longer a annuity-based sector where returns were capped at 16 per cent on equity.         
	The ultimate test was the price of power  and in the case of the Sasan power project the average levelised tariff had been fixed at Rs 1.19 per unit.         
	It was essential for the entrepreneur to focus on competencies and efficiencies and maximise returns.        
	He said Reliance Power would also look at the possibility of taking its skills and competencies outside India but chose not to elaborate.        
	Ambani said the group would invest both in wind and nuclear power.         
	In nuclear power, though some basic work has been completed, Ambani indicated that he would wait for the Atomic Energy Act to be amended. At present, this act restricts private sector participation to 49 per cent only.         
	The proceeds from what is being billed as the biggest IPO in the country will be used to fund the 600MW Rosa Phase I and II, 300MW unit in Butibori (Maharashtra), 3,960MW Sasan power project (Madhya Pradesh), 4,000MW in Urthing (Uttarakhand) and 1,200MW at Shahapur in Maharashtra.

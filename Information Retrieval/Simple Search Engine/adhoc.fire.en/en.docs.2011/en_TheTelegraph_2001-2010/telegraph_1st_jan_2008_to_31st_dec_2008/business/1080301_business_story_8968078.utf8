The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | How the ABC rate it
                                                                                                               How the ABC rate it
                            
	The Telegraph put five questions to students of the countrys three top B-schools        
	(a)How do you rate the budget on a feel-good scale         of 1-10?        
	(b)What is the budgets big idea?        
	(c)Where has the        
	FM scored?        
	(d)Where has he failed?        
	(e)If you were the FM, what would you have done keeping elections in mind?              
	IIM Bangalore        
	a) 7         
	b) Improving the lot of the aam aadmi with increased allocations for agriculture, education and healthcare. The focus on social-sector spending is good for the long-term health of the economy and can reduce unemployment. For example, education has a 20% increase in allocation and duties on life-saving drugs have been cut         
	c) He has endeared himself to the farmers. The increased focus on social-sector spending will please the common man. Chidambaram has continued to move towards a Goods and Services Tax regime by cutting the central VAT rate to 14%. Finally, by increasing the exemption limits on personal income tax, he has provided relief to people in small urban centres who have been bearing the brunt of inflationary food and oil prices         
	d) No long-term planning on how to sustain the agricultural sector. While waiving loans, he has failed to help develop long-term crop insurance mechanisms, an improved delivery of credit, extensive agricultural initiatives to help productivity, or improved irrigation. Little focus on infrastructure. Our broken primary education system has been paid lip service without any targeted effort. Power sector reforms are yet to be introduced full throttle        
	e) Would have removed the surcharge apart from raising the exemption limits. By announcing ambitious schemes in irrigation and crop insurance in addition to the loan waiver, we would have won the farmers appreciation. Also, the rural job guarantee scheme should have been improved, promising better work and pay, rather than just extended to more areas              
	IIM Calcutta        
	a) 6         
	b) Its a restrained attempt at trying to be populist without going overboard. One of the important measures is the farm loan waiver scheme. Further, Rs 20,000 crore will be allotted for irrigation projects  an increase of Rs 9,000 crore over last year. Therefore, the mood this year is definitely pro-farmer         
	c) One of the most important areas addressed is education. Not only did the new IIM in Shillong find mention in his speech, the FM also announced 3 new IITs in Bihar, Rajasthan and Andhra. The 20 per cent hike in the education budget is a welcome step. Theres also a lot for senior citizens. A 15% increase in healthcare spending is a welcome measure. He has offered relief to the manufacturing sector by reducing excise duty from 16% to 14% on all goods. The lowering of duty on all goods produced in the pharmaceutical sector and the cut in excise duty on small cars will help the middle class        
	d) The FM did not change the corporate tax, and at the same time increased the short-term capital gains tax up to 15%. These measures will probably not go down too well with the markets        
	e) The approaching elections definitely pointed towards a populist budget. And the budget seems to have unfolded on expected lines. Perhaps Chidambaram could have given a bit more relief to industries and adopted a few market-friendly measures. The dividend distribution tax could have done with a rethink. But having said that, he did do a pretty decent balancing job.              
	IIM Ahmedabad        
	a) 7         
	b) Its an attempt to create feel-good factors through populist measures like the loan waiver to farmers, sops for minorities, raised income-tax exemption limits and increased expenditure on welfare programmes. The budget has managed to please the masses. It has something for everyone         
	c) Raising the income-tax slab is a brilliant move, as is the excise cut on small cars, two-wheelers and pharmaceuticals. Both steps will boost consumption in the economy. The loan waiver of Rs 60,000 crore for small and marginal farmers will revive agricultural economy. The focus on education, health and welfare will create a positive mood         
	d) Businesses arent pleased since there are no changes in corporate tax and surcharges. The markets, too, are unhappy with the increase in capital gains tax  a step that will deter FIIs and could have been avoided. No incentive for investment in infrastructure, less funds for roads. The fall in the stock market was the instantaneous reaction. There should have been some sops for business to reduce or cushion the negative reaction from the markets         
	e) Would have introduced reforms in infrastructure, banking and the capital market, making the most of the growth and optimism in the economy, and would have reduced corporate tax and abolished service tax. More focus on rural education and health. Steps to ensure that inflation stays in check before elections

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Motors gets lower Crisil grade
                                                                                                               Tata Motors gets lower Crisil grade
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 28: Crisil today downgraded its rating on Tata Motors after its acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.         
	The rating agency gave an AA- stable rating to Tata Motors cash credit facilities. The auto maker was so far enjoying an AA+ rating.        
	Crisil officials said Tata Motors business profile would change significantly after the acquisition and more than half of its total consolidated revenues were expected to be generated by the Jaguar and Land Rover operations.        
	Crisil said these operations had been making losses in the past because of high operating costs, limited volumes, and competitive pressure in target markets.        
	The rating agency fears that Tata Motors financial profile is expected to deteriorate because of the large acquisition cost of around Rs 9,200 crore coupled with planned capital expenditure in excess of Rs 10,000 crore.         
	It felt that this large expenditure would require a significant level of debt funding.

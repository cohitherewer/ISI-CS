          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai Dec. 9: Bankers expect Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by at least 50 basis points next month  and provide further impetus to the economic stimulus package that the government and the central bank cobbled over the weekend.        
	On Saturday, Subbarao said there was enough cash swilling about in the financial system in an apparent justification for retaining the CRR at 5.5 per cent. The CRR is that portion of deposits that banks must maintain with the RBI. A cut in this reserve ratio directly infuses liquidity into the system.        
	The central bank will be reviewing its credit and monetary policy in the middle of January.        
	Industry was hugely disappointed that the RBI hadnt cut the cash reserve ratio, which would have given banks more cash to lend to firms.        
	Ample liquidity was one of the key factors why the RBI did not reduce the CRR. However, it could cut it by 50 basis points next month to ensure that cheap funds are available to banks for lending, said a senior official with a private sector bank.        
	Industry mavens had groaned in dismay after the RBI failed to cut the CRR once again. Between October and November this year, the central bank had reduced the reserve ratio by 350 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Along with other monetary measures, this had injected close to Rs 300,000 crore into the financial system.        
	Pressure to cut the CRR has already started to mount. Industry forum Ficci has urged the RBI to cut the reserve ratio to the 2004 level of 4.5 per cent. It also wants the RBI to bring down the statutory liquidity ratio, which is now pegged at 24 per cent. The SLR determines how much of the total deposits banks must invest in approved securities such as government bonds.        
	Last week, the central bank had trimmed short-term lending and borrowing rates  the repo and the reverse repo, respectively  by 100 basis points each and the government followed that up with a pump-priming strategy designed to spur industrial growth, which has shown signs of sputtering.        
	A section of the bankers says the CRR cut is not required now as the financial system has a surplus liquidity of over Rs 56,000 crore.        
	The RBI governor had said the liquidity adjustment facility  through which the central bank manages the level of funds within the system  was in absorption mode.        
	Banks have not responded with alacrity to the cut in the benchmark rates: only Yes Bank, HDFC Bank and Union Bank have announced cuts in their prime lending rates that prop up their rate tables.        
	Bankers argue that the cost of funds for banks remains high. Banks have not trimmed their deposit rates either; both rates will have to move in tandem.

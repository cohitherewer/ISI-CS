          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: Car makers have decided to reduce prices, following the governments decision today to cut excise duties by 4 per cent.        
	Buyers, who were already being wooed with discounts ranging between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000, can now look forward to a minimum of a 4 per cent reduction in the price of cars.        
	New cars have been prescribed for government officials as part of the economic stimulus package.        
	We will absolutely pass on the benefit from the excise duty cut with immediate effect, said Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector), Mahindra amp; Mahindra. The price discount will be more than 4 per cent for premium segment cars, he said.        
	The ad valorem duty on big cars has been reduced to 20 per cent from 24 per cent, while that on small cars has been slashed to 8 per cent from 12 per cent.        
	Big cars attract composite excise duties that include specific and ad valorem rates.         
	Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said, A 4 per cent reduction in cenvat (central value-added tax) means all car prices are likely to come down by four per cent.        
	According to analysts, the central banks liquidity-boosting measures coupled with the excise duty cut seem to have buoyed the industry, which is struggling with mounting inventories and a thinning bottom line.        
	Car sales, which recorded double-digit growth for nearly five years till 2007, has seen single-digit growth since January 2008 because of tight credit conditions, high interest rates and a slowing economy.        
	We expect that todays reduction in excise duty and the RBIs move to increase liquidity will help in boosting demand, Goenka said.        
	The government, on Friday, also cut fuel prices for the first time in two years. Petrol prices are lower by Rs 5 a litre and diesel, Rs 2.

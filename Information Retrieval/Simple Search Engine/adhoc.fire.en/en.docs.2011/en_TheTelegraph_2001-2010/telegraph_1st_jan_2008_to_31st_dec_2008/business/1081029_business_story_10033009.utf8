	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The government plans to relax foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in the wake of massive dollar pullout by foreign portfolio investors.        
	It is considering a dilution of the Press Note 1 norm which forces foreign companies in joint ventures to seek no- objection certificates from Indian partners for ventures in similar lines of businesses.        
	In the new era of global mergers and takeovers, we may forgo the strict use of Press Note 1 in many cases, if the situation warrants it. This, itself, should create some investment opportunities, said officials.        
	Changes in rules and procedures are also expected in telecom and retail.         
	However, multi-brand retail will stay out of bounds for foreigners as the government does not wish to court any controversy.         
	In captive coal and iron ore mining, the government may remove the ambiguities in rules to attract foreign investment. Clarifications may lead to 100 per cent FDI in captive mines of power, steel and cement firms.         
	India has set an FDI target of $35 billion for the current fiscal. Inflows in the first five months were an unprecedented $14.6 billion.         
	However, analysts as well as government officials feel the target is way over what India will finally receive given the changed situation following the global financial crisis.        
	FII inflows, the other major source of foreign exchange, has turned negative. After buying a net $17.5 billion of equities in 2007, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have taken out at least $12 billion from the Indian stock markets this year.        
	Net capital flows had peaked to 10.1 per cent of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) last fiscal. This is expected to come down to just 2-3 per cent of GDP this year. Analysts say drying up of global sources of funds and selloff in domestic asset markets will slow down growth of corporate balance sheets.        
	The officials said the relaxations in FDI might help to stave off this situation.        
	Press Note 1, a modified version of the earlier Press Note 18, says foreign companies in a joint venture need a no-objection certificate from their Indian partners if they want to open separate subsidiaries in the same line of business.         
	A strict interpretation of Press Note 1, which was issued in 2005, often creates investment hurdles.         
	For instance, if a multinational with plans for India takes over another which has a joint venture in the country, the multinational will have to take a no-objection certificate from the Indian company, which might stymie its plans for the country.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, March 11: BMW has increased the capacity at its Chennai plant from 1,700 units to 3,000 units per year on a single shift basis, Peter Kronschanabl, president of BMW India, said today.        
	BMW started assembling its three-series and five-series cars at the Chennai plant last year. The company has so far invested $30 million.         
	Raising production further will depend on the market trend, Kronschanabl said after unveiling the BMW-M model. BMWs first Kun Exclusive showroom was also inaugurated today.         
	The BMW-M model is a sports car with Formula 1 technology, which also provides comfort for everyday use, Kronschanabl said.         
	The company is also implementing an aggressive plan for the development of a dealer network across all metros and will subsequently move to tier-II cities as well, he said.         
	At present, BMW has nine dealers in the Indian market. By the middle of 2008, it will have dealerships in Calcutta, Ahmedabad and Kochi, he added. The company is planning to launch a premium small car, but right now it has no plans to export cars from the Chennai plant.

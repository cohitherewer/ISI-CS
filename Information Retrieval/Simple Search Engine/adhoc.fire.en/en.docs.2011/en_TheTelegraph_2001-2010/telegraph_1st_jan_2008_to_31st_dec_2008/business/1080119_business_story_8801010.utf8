             Deora: Rising curve
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The group of ministers on fuel is believed to be in favour of recommending a marginal hike in the price of petrol by about Rs 1 a litre. 
    
	The view emerged yesterday at the meeting of the ministers and will be discussed with other Congress leaders. If cleared by the political leadership, the ministers may approve the hike at their meeting tomorrow.
    
	This is expected to push inflation up marginally, said top officials. Inflation rose to a four-month high of 3.79 per cent for the week ended January 5 compared with 3.50 per cent in the previous week.
    
	In diesel, the ministers are in favour of a price rise less than that of petrol. This is because a diesel price rise has a cascading impact on other commodities as it is the fuel for trucks which is the principal mode of transporting commodities.
    
	However, last-minute calculations of tax cuts are being made to avoid a hike in fuel prices, especially in diesel.
    
	To partly compensate the losses of state-owned oil marketing companies, the government today issued bonds worth Rs 11,256.92 crore to them. 
    
	Bonds worth Rs 6,362.25 crore had been issued to the Indian Oil Corporation, while Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited got Rs 2,539.13 crore and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Rs 2,355.54 crore.
    
	Losses of the trio in 2007-08 for selling petroleum products below costs are estimated at Rs 70,000 crore.
    
	The companies will get compensated for 42.7 per cent of this loss through oil bonds and 35 per cent through assistance from upstream government entities Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, GAIL (India) Limited and Oil India. 
    
	This still leaves uncovered a gap of 22.3 per cent. 
    
	To fight spiralling global prices of crude oil, the government will also juggle with the duty structure of petroleum products. 
    
	Instead of the current ad-valorem duty, it is likely to accept the specific duty structure suggested by the Rangarajan committee on petroleum prices. Officials said the decision on fuel prices could be taken by the cabinet early next week before petroleum minister Murli Deora goes abroad to do roadshows for the latest round of oil block auctions.
    
	Our endeavour is that consumers should not be burdened too much and the losses of oil companies are also taken care of, Deora said.

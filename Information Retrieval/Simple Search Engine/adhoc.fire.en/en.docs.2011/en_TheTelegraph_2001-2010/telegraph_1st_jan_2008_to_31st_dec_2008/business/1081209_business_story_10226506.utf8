          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Quick to act                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 8: Two leading banks  HDFC Bank and Union Bank of India  today cut their prime lending rates, taking a cue from the Reserve Bank of Indias rate-cut signals on Saturday.        
	HDFC Bank has decided to reduce its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 50 basis points  or half a percentage point  to 16 per cent. The rate cut will be effected in two tranches of 25 basis points each. The first cut will be on December 15 and the second on January 1. This is HDFCs first cut in BPLR this year.        
	State-owned Union Bank has decided to reduce its prime lending rate by 0.75 per cent to 12.5 per cent.        
	On Saturday, the RBI had cut the short-term lending rate, called the repo, by 1 percentage point to 6.5 per cent. The repo is the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from the RBI.        
	The central bank also cut the reverse repo  the rate at which the RBI mops up surplus funds from the financial system  by 1 percentage point to 5 per cent. A cut in the reverse repo underpinned the central banks perception that there was enough liquidity in the system.        
	HDFC Bank executive director Paresh Sukthankar said, The cut in BPLR comes after the reduction in the banks incremental cost of funds and the significant easing seen recently in the monetary stance and the local currency markets.        
	Explaining the decision to cut BPLR in two tranches, HDFC Banks deputy head treasurer Ashish Partha-sarthy said, We reduced deposits rates recently and expect to get newer deposits at lower rates. So, we expect the cost of funds to come down further.        
	Union Bank said it cut its prime lending rate to ensure credit to productive sectors at lower rates to sustain growth momentum. Its rate cut is with immediate effect.        
	Both banks said the cut in BPLR would benefit both their existing and new customers .        
	Union Bank has trimmed its prime lending rate by 1.5 per cent in 35 days in response to the policy signals emanating from the banking regulator.        
	Last month, it had cuts its BPLR by 0.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent along with other major public sector banks. The bank had also reduced its home loan rates recently.        
	ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private sector lender, had also reduced its interest rate for new home loans of Rs 20 lakh and below to 11.5 per cent last week.        
	Yes Bank was the first to respond to the latest rate cut signal by slicing its BPLR by half a percentage point to 16.5 per cent.        
	Other public sector and private sector banks are expected to follow suit.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The aviation industry appears to be divided over investment by foreign airlines, leading to a lobbying war.        
	Airlines such as Kingfisher and SpiceJet want the government to allow them to sell stakes to foreign companies, while Jet and Air India are believed to be opposed to any such move.        
	Kingfisher promoter Vijay Mallya said he had proposed the government to allow foreign airlines to buy up to 25 per cent in Indian carriers. He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit.         
	However, Jet and Air India  the two biggest players in domestic aviation  fear loss of market share if smaller firms become strong by joining hands with foreign airlines.         
	According to analyst Sudipto Bose, few foreign airlines will be eager to invest in India because of their financial problems.        
	Kingfisher is reported to have received offers from Virgin and British Airways. Mallya confirmed that he had received expressions of interest but refused to give out any name.        
	Moves to open up domestic aviation to foreign airlines have surfaced periodically only to be nixed by the civil aviation ministry.        
	The finance ministry, on the other hand, supports investment by foreign airlines, at least as minority players.

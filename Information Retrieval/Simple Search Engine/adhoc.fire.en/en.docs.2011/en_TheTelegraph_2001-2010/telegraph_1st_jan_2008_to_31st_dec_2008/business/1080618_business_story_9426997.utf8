          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: Vijay Mallyas UB Group wants Heineken to sort out the ticklish problem of Asia Pacific Breweries Limited launching products in direct competition with those of United Breweries.        
	Dutch brewer Heineken has a 42.5 per cent stake in Singapore-based Asia Pacific Breweries and a 37.5 per cent stake in United Breweries, which it acquired following the takeover of Scottish amp; Newcastle for $7.8 billion jointly with Denmarks Carlsberg.        
	The competition position with Asia Pacific Breweries does need a resolution and this will also be on the agenda for discussion (with Heineken), said Ravi Nedungadi, chief financial officer of UB Group.        
	He said, It is important for both sides to agree on the best way to address the Indian market effectively with all the brands owned and controlled by both corporations.         
	Heineken officials also said the two groups were in talks to sort out the issue.         
	At present, we are talking to both, our joint venture in India (Asia Pacific Breweries) and the UB Group to find out a satisfactory solution for future operations in India, a Heineken spokesperson said but declined to give further details.        
	UB Group has been objecting to Asia Pacific Breweries launching its flagship Tiger beer in India, which competes directly with United Breweries Kingfisher.        
	On reports about a possible sale of stake in United Breweries by UB Group, Nedungadi said there had not been any talk of stake sale by either side.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Delhi High Court today sought the Centres response to a petition challenging its first come, first served spectrum allocation policy.        
	A public interest litigation filed in the court last week challenged the Centres policy of allocating 2G spectrum resulting in huge losses to the government. The court has asked the government to file its response within three weeks and posted the matter for hearing on December 10.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja has been criticised for allocating 4.4MHz of spectrum  a scarce resource  at the 2001 price of Rs 1,651 crore through a first come, first served policy rather than auctions.         
	It is being alleged that by compromising on the market value of spectrum, the government is estimated to have lost revenues worth around Rs 50,000 crore. On the other hand, new licensees are signing equity deals with foreign players in which the value of spectrum has risen sevenfold.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary policy review next week will have to weigh the need to curb inflation without impacting growth. 
    
	It is also likely to take into account the need to reduce the gap in the Indian and the US interest rates.
    
	At the World Economic Forum in Davos, finance minister P. Chidambaram told the media that the governments goal is to moderate inflation, while not affecting growth. 
    
	Chidambaram also said that the interest rate differential between India and the US has widened. Thats something the central bank will take on board, I suppose, before it decides its policy.
    
	After the US rate cut earlier this week, the spread between two-year Indian government bonds and similar maturity US treasury notes has widened to 5.40 per cent from 5.01 per cent. Finance ministry officials feel the rupee, already up 12 per cent against the dollar, can go up further if the rate gap is not addressed.
    
	The strong rupee, caused by heavy foreign exchange inflows and, consequently, excess money supply, may result in a bout of inflation. As moderating inflation is the principle goal of both the RBI and the government, the central bank may not cut interest rates significantly, said officials. 
    
	For the week ended January 12, inflation rose 3.83 per cent compared with 3.79 per cent a week ago. Prices of manufactured goods and food articles edged up inflation.

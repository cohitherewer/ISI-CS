	Mumbai, June 30: Godrej Agrovet Ltd has entered into a joint venture with Tyson Foods Inc, the worlds largest meat processor and marketer for poultry processing and marketing in India.         
	Tyson Foods will own a 51 per cent stake in the new entity named Godrej Tyson Foods, while Godrej Agrovet will hold the rest. The joint venture company will focus on serving the growing demand for quality poultry in India with processed and value-added chicken products.        
	This agreement will delight consumers and retailers by combining Godrejs hygienic supply chain and value-added chicken brands such as Real Good and Yummiez with Tyson Foods expertise in processing and product development, said Balram Yadav, chief executive officer of Godrej Agrovet. Todays consumers look for safe and healthy poultry products. The joint venture will deliver new processed and value-added products to satisfy these needs, he added.        
	Since 2000, the domestic poultry market has grown at 10 per cent CAGR  faster than other developing and developed markets. However, Indias per capita consumption at 1.8 kg per annum is comparatively lower than the global standards.        
	The $3-billion Indian poultry market represents a tremendous opportunity with processed and value-added chicken currently comprising only 6 per cent of the market, said Rick Greubel, president (international) of Tyson Foods Ltd.

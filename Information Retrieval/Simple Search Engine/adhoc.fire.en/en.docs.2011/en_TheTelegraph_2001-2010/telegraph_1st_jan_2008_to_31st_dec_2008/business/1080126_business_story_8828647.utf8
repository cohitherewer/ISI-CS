	Mumbai, Jan. 25: Anil Ambani may have lost out to brother Mukesh in the bidding battle for a cricket league side, but he notched up a huge win today when a group company swung a deal with footballing giant Manchester United.
    
	Jump Games, a mobile game developer and part of Anil Ambanis Reliance Entertainment, has signed a three-year contract with Manchester United football club to design, develop and distribute mobile games.
    
	The group refused to say how big the deal was, but Reliance Entertainment president Rajesh Sawhney gushed, Its definitely bigger than the IPL deal which created such a splash yesterday. Its one of the biggest deals in the mobile content space. Mukesh Ambani had bid Rs 441 crore for the Mumbai side in the Indian Premier League.
    
	The three-year deal with one of the worlds most popular club will allow Jump Games the rights to build quizzes, puzzles and even 3D football games around Manchester United. 
    
	Were really excited about this new partnership since mobile gaming is a rapidly growing business and Jump is the market leader in mobile gaming. Wed like to have this content on all mobile devices, said Samir Pabari, director of media, Manchester United. 
    
	The tieup aims to cater to the 300-million Manchester United fans worldwide and over three billion mobile users across the globe. Japan, Korea, China and South America are being considered as the biggest markets for the games.
    
	Our games will be popularised on the Manchester United television and website. Were looking to explore more synergies with this club. We want to build a Manchester United franchise in India, Sawhney added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 14: The commerce ministry may request the Centre to refund state levies to exporters and adjust them in the allocations to the states to make exports competitive.        
	Officials said the ministry would submit its proposals to the 13th Finance Commission next month, where trade has been included in its terms of reference for the first time.        
	With state levies accounting for 6 per cent of the cost of exporters consignments, the ministry wants to ensure that these taxes are rebated.        
	Hit by a 12 per cent rise in the rupee value against the dollar, exporters have been seeking a refund of various levies such as octroi, mandi tax and electricity duty.        
	Earlier, the ministry had prepared a cabinet note which had two options: the Centre reimburses the state taxes on inputs used by exporters or states provide refunds.        
	The empowered committee of state finance ministers, which was looking into the refund mechanism, had not been able to come out with a suitable suggestion.         
	The government is now looking to the finance commission to issue a directive on the issue.        
	To help exporters, the Centre has already announced a tax refund on 15 services.        
	The government wants a rebate scheme for state taxes to be worked out urgently. The issues regarding the refund of service tax on services linked to exports will also be resolved shortly, commerce minister Kamal Nath said.        
	Exports for 2007-08 fell short of the targeted $160 billion and stood at over $155 billion.         
	For the current financial year, the government has set an ambitious export target of $200 billion.

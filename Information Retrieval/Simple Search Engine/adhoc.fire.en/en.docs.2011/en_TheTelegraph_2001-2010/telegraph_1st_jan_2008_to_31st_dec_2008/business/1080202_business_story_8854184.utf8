             Coming at a cost
                 
	Mumbai, Feb. 1: Domestic steel companies today hiked prices by Rs 2,000-2,500 per tonne following a rise in cost of inputs such as iron ore and met coke.
    
	A strong demand from user industries has helped these companies pass on the increased raw material costs to steel buyers.
    
	Sources said all leading manufacturers, including Tata Steel, Essar Steel and Ispat Industries, have hiked prices of hot rolled coils, cold rolled coils and galvanised steel. Last month, a few players had hiked prices by around Rs 800 per tonne.
    
	Steel prices have largely remained stagnant for the better part of this fiscal. We had to absorb the increase in input costs as the demand was sluggish. However, from January, the demand has improved and some inventory have been pushed out now, the sources said.
    
	According to them, National Mineral Development Corporation Limited had raised iron ore prices by Rs 600 per tonne. The price hike took retrospective effect from October 2007. The effect of the ore-price hike on steel is Rs 1,000 per tonne.
    
	Met coke costs have risen over the last three months to around $500 per tonne, while freight costs related to some other raw materials, too, have gone up.
    
	If one considers all the cost-push factors, the impact is to the tune of over Rs 5,000 per tonne. But, we have passed only a portion of this increase, a senior official of a domestic steel company said.
    
	Steel companies outside India are also raising prices.
    
	Posco, the worlds fourth-largest steel maker, had recently said it would jack up hot rolled coil prices by 11.5 per cent. 
    
	The Korean company is set to increase cold rolled coil prices by around 11 per cent. 
    
	Analysts said prices had risen in other parts of the world, too. 
    
	For instance, in North America, prices have jumped by around $100 per tonne, whereas in Europe, the rise is to the tune of 50 euros per tonne. 
    
	The landed cost of steel in India is around $725 per tonne. The domestic hot rolled coil price (ex-mill) is around Rs 29,000 per tonne.

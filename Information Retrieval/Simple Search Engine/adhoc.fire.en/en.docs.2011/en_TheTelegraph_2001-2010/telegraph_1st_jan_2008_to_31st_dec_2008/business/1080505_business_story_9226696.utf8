          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, May 4: The State Bank of India (SBI), which has recently won approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has appointed consultancy firm McKinsey to identify possible locations in the island nation where it can open branches.        
	We have appointed McKinsey. Since locations play a very important role, they have been told to identify good locations where we can have a presence, an SBI official told The Telegraph.         
	The SBI got in-principle approval from Singapore on March 26 for a full bank licence with qualifying full bank (QFB) privileges, becoming the only Indian bank to get such status. This will enable the bank to establish up to 25 points of presence, including branches and ATMs. It can also offer its entire range of financial services. The bank is expected to offer various facilities, including debit cards, in the future.         
	It can also offer supplementary retirement scheme, a plan that will encourage Singapore residents to save more for their old age. Contributions to the scheme are eligible for tax relief.         
	The SBI has one branch in Singapore now. The official said it also has a remittance centre, which can be converted into a branch.         
	We will not set up branches at all the points of presence at a time. The bank will go about in a consistent fashion, the official said.         
	Global operations constitute around 11 per cent of the banks bottomline and it wants to raise this share to 25 per cent. Banking analysts, however, said in spite of the huge potential in Singapore, there were some challenges.         
	The non-Singaporean banks do not have privileges that local banks have. For instance, a bank that has won a QFB status cannot be linked to the network of local banks. It can be only linked to the ATM network of those who have won the QFB privilege, an analyst said.   
	Looking Ahead    SBI is the first Indian bank to get qualified banking status in Singapore  It has one branch in Singapore and a remittance centre  A bank that has won qualified banking status can only be linked to   the ATM network of those who have the same status  International operations contribute 11 per cent to the bank's bottomline

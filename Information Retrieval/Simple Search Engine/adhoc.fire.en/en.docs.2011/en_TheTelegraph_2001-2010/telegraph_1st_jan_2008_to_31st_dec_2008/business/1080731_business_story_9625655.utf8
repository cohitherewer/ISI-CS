The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Zinc helps Eveready return to black
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zinc helps Eveready return to black
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 30: Eveready Industries India Ltd has reported a profit after tax of Rs 3.12 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal compared with a loss Rs 11.93 crore a year ago because of falling zinc prices.        
	However, according to the company, it is now grappling with the rising prices of petroleum-based inputs.         
	Zinc prices have fallen to $2,178 per tonne in the first quarter from $3,101 in the second quarter of 2007-08.        
	Eveready posted net sales of Rs 219.52 crore in the first quarter compared with sales of Rs 202.6 crore a year ago.        
	To offset high input prices, Eveready had undertaken price increases in various types of batteries in the range of 20-50 per cent.         
	Such increases have hurt growth of D size batteries, which are consumed mostly in rural areas.        
	In the current fiscal, volume growth in batteries was at 10 per cent, much of it fuelled by the cheap AA batteries.        
	In flashlights, too, rising prices have hit their sales.        
	The company has launched some new products such as mosquito repellents and vapourisers.         
	It is test marketing dishwashing detergents in four states from August 2007, and the brand will be launched soon.

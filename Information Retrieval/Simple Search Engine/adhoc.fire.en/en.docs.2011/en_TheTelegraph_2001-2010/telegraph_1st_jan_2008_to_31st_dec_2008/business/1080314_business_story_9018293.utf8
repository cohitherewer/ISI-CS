	Calcutta, March 13: Videocon will double the capacity of its steel project in Bengal to meet the strong demand for the alloy in the country.        
	Chairman Venugopal Dhoot said the proposed plant would have a capacity of 6 million tonnes (mt) instead of 3mt as earlier announced.        
	The capacity of the proposed power plant will also be increased from 1,200 mega watt to 1,600 mega watt.        
	We are now looking at an investment of Rs 21,000 crore in the Bengal steel and power project compared with Rs 15,000 crore planned earlier, he said on the sidelines of a two-day steel conference, organised by mjunction and the Bharat Chamber of Commerce in the city.        
	Videocon Steel amp; Power had sent a fresh proposal to the state last week. Dhoot said it had been accepted.        
	The companys requirement for land would, however, remain the same. It was angling for a 4,000-acre plot at Jamuria near Asansol in Burdwan district.        
	Dhoot said the company had entered into an agreement with an Indonesian company to import iron ore. It is not a problem. We expect the state to provide us coal linkages, he added.        
	The proposed deep sea port will act as a catalyst for the plant. It will import raw materials like iron ore from there, while exporting finished products.         
	The plant will come up in two phases of 3mt each.        
	The announcement comes at a time when the state government is closely scrutinising the actual requirement of land for various steel plants proposed by investors.        
	There is a growing feeling that the industry is asking for more land than required. The state has set up a committee to look into this.        
	Speaking at the seminar, Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal Steel Ltd, asked the state to be careful while allocating scarce natural resources.        
	Land, water and coal are not abundant in Bengal. The state has to give them judiciously, he said.         
	JSW Bengal will set up a 10mt steel plant, a 1200MW power and a 3mt cement plant on a 4,500-acre plot.        
	Incidentally, JSW Steel had planned to begin work for a 3mt plant in the first phase. After it acquired iron ore mines in Chile, it decided to expand the plant to 6mt in the first phase. Gupta said financial closure for the first phase of the project would be achieved soon.

	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The State Bank of India will decide the price and the share entitlement ratio for its rights issue next week.
    
	The ratio in which the shares will be given, the price of each share, and the date of the rights issue will be decided at a board meeting on January 14, said SBI officials. The board will also decide if shares will be sold to employees.
    
	The bank is planning to mobilise around Rs 16,700 crore through the rights issue before the end of March to fund business growth and meet Basel-II norms. The offering will be one of the largest by an issuer in India. 
    
	The rights issue will be launched in the second week of February and the process will be over by the second week of March, said officials.
    
	The proposed bonds will have maturities of three, five, seven and 10 years. The coupon will be linked to the prevailing interest rate on government securities of the same tenure.
    
	The SBI has hired six book-running lead managers  SBI Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital Market and DSP Merrill Lynch. SBI Caps will also be an adviser. 
    
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had earlier said the government would invest Rs 10,000 crore in the offering by issuing government bonds. And in turn, the bank will subscribe to the bond issues of an equivalent sum issued by the government. This will make it a cash neutral exercise.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Sweet Treat      
	Mumbai, Sept. 8: The Supreme Court today directed the sugar mills of Uttar Pradesh to pay their arrears to cane growers at the rate of Rs 110 per quintal for 2007-08.         
	In an interim order, the apex court asked the government and mills to pay the arrears within four weeks.         
	This order is seen as beneficial to sugar companies based in the state as a lower court had earlier asked them to pay Rs 125-130 per quintal, which was recommended by the Uttar Pradesh government.        
	If we had to pay Rs 125 per quintal, our margins and profitability would have been severely hit, an official of a sugar company based in Uttar Pradesh said.         
	The order had its impact on sugar stocks today, with Bajaj Hindusthan surging 4.2 per cent and Balrampur Chini rising 5.1 per cent. Other sugar stocks, too, gained on the news. On September 1, the apex court had refused to stay a Allahabad High Court judgment that asked the mills to pay Rs 125-130 per quintal.         
	While upholding the price of Rs 125-130 per quintal, the court had modified its interim order that asked mills to pay Rs 110 a quintal. It had also asked the mills to pay the difference by September 6.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government had fixed Rs 125 a quintal as the state-advised-price for common variety sugarcane and Rs 130 for early variety canes for the 2007-08 season ending October.

	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Giving in to demands from cell phone companies and the telecom tribunal, the government today agreed to raise the cap it had placed just a week back on spectrum. 
    
	The department of telecom (DoT) today issued fresh subscriber-linked spectrum allocation norms that raised the cap on spectrum for GSM players to 15MHz from the 7.2MHZ limit announced last week.
    
	On January 9, the DoT had stated that GSM players would not be entitled to spectrum beyond 7.2MHz. This had come as a shock to GSM players such as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea who challenged the DoTs policy flip-flops in Delhi High Court as well as before the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal. 
    
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had also written a letter to the DoT on January 16 questioning the governments move of not following its recommendations on subscriber-linked spectrum allocation norms.
    
	According to the new norms, which come into force with immediate effect, GSM players will be entitled to a maximum of 15MHz of spectrum per circle and CDMA operators, 7.5MHz. 
    
	This is more or less in accordance with Trai recommendations. However, extra spectrum will be given in blocks of 1MHz against the proposal of Trai to give it in blocks of 1.8MHz or 2.4MHz.
    
	The number of subscribers that a telecom player needs in a circle to become eligible for the next tranche of spectrum is also stricter than the earlier norms that are in place since 2006 and those of Trais. But it matches the norms notified last week.
    
	Till now, GSM players required 21 lakh subscribers in Delhi and Mumbai, 13 lakh in Chennai and Calcutta, 12 lakh in Category A circles and 26 lakh in Category B and C circles to be eligible for 15MHz of spectrum.
    
	According to the new DoT formula, GSM players should have 65 lakh subscribers in the metros, 116 lakh in Category A and B circles and 96 lakh in Category C circles to be eligible for 15MHz of spectrum. These are only a little higher than what is proposed by Trai.
    
	However, GSM players are not complaining. Operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone have already crossed the subscriber base required to become eligible for the next tranche of spectrum in various telecom circles.

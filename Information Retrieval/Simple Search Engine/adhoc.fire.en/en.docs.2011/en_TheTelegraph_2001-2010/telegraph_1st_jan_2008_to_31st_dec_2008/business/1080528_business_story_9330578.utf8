          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Hard times                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: Work has stopped at Chiria  Asias largest iron ore mine  because of a flash strike by some 1,000 workers hired through a contractor.         
	Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) ships about 3,500 tonnes of high grade iron ore daily from Chiria mainly to IISCO Steel Plant in Burnpur and to the PSUs plants at Bokaro in Jharkhand, Bhilai in Chhattisgarh and Rourkela in Orissa.         
	Sources said a prolonged strike at Chiria could mean trouble for IISCO, which depends heavily on Chiria.        
	They said the strike was the result of a spat between two unions which were vying for supremacy in Chiria, which is also being eyed by rival steel makers such as ArcelorMittal, Essar Steel and Ispat Industries.        
	Chiria, which has about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore, was leased by IISCO, which has since been merged with SAIL.         
	However, after several steel makers evinced keen interest in these mines, the Jharkhand government tried to take back three of the leases in the Chiria area from SAIL. This spat is now stuck in the courts of law.         
	Last year, too, a strike involving contract labourers had erupted in Gua, an extension of the Chiria mines, also owned by IISCO. Rajesh Koda, the younger brother of Madhu Koda, the chief minister of Jharkhand, had led that strike. Sources said the current strike was led by a rival union.        
	SAIL chairman S.K.Roongta had promised the Jharkhand government some time back that once the state cleared its applications for lease renewals at Chiria, the company would expand capacity in the state, including construction of a mill at Manoharpur.         
	Following the expansion, SAIL will be in a position to not only absorb all the labourers working through contractors but also hire in large numbers.        
	In all, SAIL has some 11 iron ore mine leases in Jharkhand. Besides the three leases of Chiria which have been dragged to court, some seven other leases are pending before the state government which has ignored SAILs pleas for their renewal.         
	Three of these leases are for the Kiriburu-Meghatuburu mine, while the others are for the Budhaburu and Dhobil mines at Chiria, and the JhilingburuII and Toalior mines of Gua.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                MOUNTING CONCERN		    
	New Delhi, April 23: The price of crude oil imported by India has touched an all-time high of $110 a barrel, spelling fresh trouble for the government struggling to contain inflation.        
	The Indian basket of crude oil was at $110.34 per barrel yesterday, a 75 per cent jump over last fiscals lowest price of $62.91 per barrel as on May 9, 2007. In the futures market, New York crude traded around $120 a barrel.        
	Domestic oil companies will have to suffer daily losses of around Rs 500 crore because of the surge in crude prices. Crude was selling at $95 a barrel when petrol and diesel prices were hiked by Rs 2 and Re 1 per litre, respectively, in February. The government may now have to consider another round of fuel hike.        
	At present, the government compensates only 42.7 per cent of the fuel sold below cost through the issue of oil bonds, while one-third is shared by upstream firms such as ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India). However, the petroleum ministry has sought a 55-57 per cent compensation.        
	With the Indian basket of crude staying above $100 a barrel, the petroleum ministry has projected a revenue loss of about Rs 1,50,000 crore on fuel sales this fiscal. This will be almost double of the Rs 77,304.50-crore under-recoveries projected on the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene in 2007-08.        
	Two weeks back, Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL were losing about Rs 450 crore a day on the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene. This has now widened to Rs 500 crore.         
	Officials said oil firms lost Rs 11.80 a litre on petrol, Rs 17.51 on diesel, Rs 316.06 per LPG cylinder and Rs 25.23 a litre on kerosene as they were being forced to sell fuel below cost.

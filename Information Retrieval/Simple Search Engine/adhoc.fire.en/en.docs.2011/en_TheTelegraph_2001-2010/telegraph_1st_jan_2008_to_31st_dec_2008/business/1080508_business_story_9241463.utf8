	New Delhi, May 7: Steel makers who raised prices last month would reduce them by Rs 4,000 a tonne.        
	This was decided at a meeting between steel industry representatives and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today. Faced with a 42-month high inflation of 7.57 per cent, the government had been putting pressure on steel firms to reduce prices.        
	Steel manufacturers led by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) chairman S.K. Roongta and Jindal Steel vice-chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal also promised not to raise prices in the next three months.         
	Last month, the government had accused steel makers of forming a cartel to raise prices. Earlier this month, it had ordered state-run SAIL and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited to pull out of the Indian Steel Alliance that led to the disbanding of the lobbying outfit.        
	In addition to the price cut, the industry also decided to bring down prices of bars and rods by Rs 2,000 a tonne, Roongta told the media after the meeting with Singh.        
	Following appeals by the Prime Minister and finance minister P. Chidambaram, SAIL and Tata Steel had refrained from raising prices in April. However, the others had raised prices, citing higher coal and iron ore costs.         
	Steel makers, during a meeting with steel secretary R.S. Pandey earlier in the day, urged the government to roll back taxes imposed on exports and impose a tax on iron ore exports. An official said the government had decided to look into their demand.         
	Tata Steels managing director B. Muthuraman and Essar Steel chairman Shashi Ruia were also present at the meeting with Singh.        
	The government was unhappy with steel makers who kept increasing prices despite warnings.        
	Early last month, despite appeals from steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, most steel majors increased prices by Rs 1,500-3,000 per tonne.         
	Steel producers had hiked prices twice before that: in January by Rs 600-900 per tonne and in February by an average of Rs 2,500 per tonne.         
	In end-April, the government took steps designed to check steel prices and punish steel makers who were unwilling to heed its appeals.         
	It slapped a 15 per cent export tax on steel, cut import taxes on mild and semi-finished steel to zero and removed a 14 per cent countervailing duty on construction steel.        
	The industry had argued that high prices in India only followed global trends and were the result of a manifold rise in the costs of raw materials such as coal and iron ore over the past few years. It said steps taken by the government would not impact domestic prices.        
	The government officials, however, were not convinced. They said the Competition Commission of India could probe allegations of a cartel.

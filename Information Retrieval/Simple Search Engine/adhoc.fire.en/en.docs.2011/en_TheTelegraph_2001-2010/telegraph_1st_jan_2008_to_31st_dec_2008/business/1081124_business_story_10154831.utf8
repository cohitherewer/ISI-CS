The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rio moves closer to iron ore debut
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rio moves closer to iron ore debut
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Fast forward                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 23: Rio Tintos decade-long wait for a foothold in the India iron ore market may be over soon.        
	The Australian companys proposed joint venture with Orissa Mining Corporation  an Orissa government undertaking  is fast taking shape.         
	When developed, the joint venture will be capable of producing 25 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore annually.        
	In terms of size, the proposed undertaking could be the second largest producer of iron ore after NMDC.        
	Orissa Mining and Rio have been in talks since the mid-nineties to develop Malangtuli deposits. But, their relationship went sour, and the duo went to courts.        
	However, there is a perceptible change in the situation now. Santosh Sarangi, managing director of Orissa Mining, said that the venture would be well served by the technology and expertise of Rio.        
	It will be a big project. We need a company such as Rio, he said.        
	At present, Orissa Mining produces 4.5mt of iron ore and planned to step up production to 6mt by the end of this year. The Malangtuli project will substantially raise its production in the future.        
	According to Sarangi, Orissa Mining will shortly send its observation to the task force set up last year under the aegis of the chief secretary of the Orissa government to resolve the issue.        
	NMDC is going to be a minority partner in the project.        
	Earlier this year, Rio had entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with NMDC to develop mines at home and abroad.         
	As part of the MoU, a joint working group has been formed to scout for deposits.        
	Besides Malangtuli, other deposits in Orissa and Tamil Nadu have been on the radar of the $14-billion Australian firm.        
	One of the contentious issues, which had delayed the Orissa project for so long, has been sorted out. Rio has agreed to the proposition that iron ore would be exported only after meeting the demand of Indian steel units.        
	In the past, the global miner was keen on export, but the Orissa government did not allow that to happen.        
	Strategy shift        
	Expecting higher production in the future, Orissa Mining has changed its sales strategy.        
	The company has decided to have long-term contract for the sale of iron ore. So far, it has been depending on spot sales through competitive tenders.        
	When production goes up, it will be difficult to sell everything on a spot basis, Sarangi said.        
	The company is planning to reduce prices by 40-50 per cent, which will provide a much needed relief to the steel industry.         
	It is expecting lower sales turnover of Rs 2,000-2,200 crore in this fiscal against a target of Rs 3,000 crore.        
	Orissa Mining will foray into coal mining next year. It has received three blocks on a shared basis.        
	Rio Tinto is also investing heavily in the aluminium segment.         
	It is planning to develop bauxite mines prior to investing about $2.2 billion (about Rs 10,500 crore) in an alumina refinery and aluminium smelter in India, a top company official had said last month.         
	Rio Tinto is the worlds largest producer of alumina and aluminium with over 50 refineries and smelters.         
	The mining giant has already applied for reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence and mining leases for iron ore and diamond in the country.         
	It has discovered world-class diamond resource of about 70 million tonnes in Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh.

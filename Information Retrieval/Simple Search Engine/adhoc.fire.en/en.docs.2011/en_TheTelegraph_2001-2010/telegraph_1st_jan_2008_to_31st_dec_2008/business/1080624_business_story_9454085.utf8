          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 23: ArcelorMittal is in talks to buy Australian coal company Macarthur Coal Ltd. If the deal is sealed, it will be the biggest ever acquisition by the worlds largest steel maker for a raw material.        
	ArcelorMittal already owns a 14.9 per cent stake in Macarthur, which it bought last month for $602 million.        
	Negotiations are now on for an additional, if not a controlling stake in Macarthur, which meets 35 per cent of the global demand for pulverised coal.        
	Trading in the shares of Brisbane-based Macarthur Coal was halted on the Australian Stock Exchange at the companys request pending a statement about the talks with ArcelorMittal.         
	The stock will be halted until June 25 or when an announcement is made, the company said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange.        
	In a separate statement to the exchange, Ken Talbot, the largest shareholder of Macarthur Coal, said he was stepping down from the board to avoid any conflict of interest.        
	In May 21, ArcelorMittal bought a 4.27 per cent stake from Talbot Group Holdings and another 10.4 per cent from Tinkler Investments at an average price of Aus $19.96.        
	It is widely expected that ArcelorMittal could make a full bid for the company. Going by the valuation it already paid, the full bid could top $3.5-4 billion.        
	It is believed that Macarthur had been in talks with Xstrata Coal for a deal. Last week, Korean steel giant Posco also confirmed it had sought to buy Talbots stake but was not in any formal discussion. CITIC Resource Holdings Ltd, backed by the Chinese government, is another majority stakeholder in Macarthur.        
	Macarthur shares have almost doubled this year as coal prices surged and takeover speculation swirled.        
	The latest move of ArcelorMittal is in line with its strategy to step up self sufficiency in coal from the present level of 15 per cent.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Repo raised, SBI mulls rate hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Strategic move        
	Mumbai, June 11: Interest rates on both loans and deposits are set to rise.         
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8 per cent in a desperate attempt to check runaway inflation.        
	The surprise hike, which was announced after market hours, prompted several banks to acknowledge that they might raise interest rates after an unequivocal signal from the central bank.        
	It is learnt that the asset-liability committee of the State Bank of India (SBI) is set to meet on Friday and the countrys largest bank may choose to revise interest rates in some categories.         
	Bankers say that the impact of the RBI move will be felt on prime lending rates of banks that are now in the range of 12.75-13.25 per cent. This may go up by 25 to 50 basis points.         
	While deposit rates are expected to rise by 50 basis points, reliable sources say that home loan rates may inch up by 25 basis points.         
	The Union Bank of India, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and a couple of others have indicated that a rate rise was likely by the end of this month or in early July.        
	The countrys largest private sector bank, ICICI Bank, has not taken any decision as yet on interest rates.         
	The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI provides liquidity to banks against government securities.         
	It was last raised in March 2007. Bankers had expected the central bank to use this rate signalling device only after its quarterly review on June 29.        
	Banking circles said the move had been necessitated because of rising inflation. While recent data showed it climbing to a new 45-month high, many expect inflation to hit double digits as the effects of the recent increase in petrol and diesel prices seep into the wholesale price index.        
	Therefore, the RBI move is pre-emptive and it wants to rein in inflationary expectations, said a senior official with a nationalised bank who did not wish to be identified.        
	Explaining the reasons behind the repo rate increase, the RBI referred to its annual policy statement on April 29 which said the overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 would broadly be to ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords high priority to price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations        
	The year-on-year WPI inflation, which was 4.36 per cent on January 12, increased to 7.33 per cent on April 12 and to a high of 8.24 per cent on May 24. Further, various measures of CPI inflation, which ranged from 4.8 to 5.9 per cent in January, have increased to a range of 7.8 to 8.9 per cent in 2008, it said.        
	The RBI added that while the monetary policy had to respond proactively to immediate concerns, it had to act decisively, effectively and swiftly to curb any signs of adverse developments with regard to inflation expectations.         
	In the light of the above, and on a review of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions and with a view to contain inflation expectations, it is essential to take appropriate action on an urgent basis, it observed.        
	Bankers say the repo hike has come at a time when liquidity in the system has become tight on account of previous cash reserve ratio actions coupled with advance tax outflows due on June 15.        
	This will increase our cost of funds. During tightness if we have to borrow from the central bank, it will be at a higher rate. Therefore, in all likelihood this rise in costs will be passed on, the official said.

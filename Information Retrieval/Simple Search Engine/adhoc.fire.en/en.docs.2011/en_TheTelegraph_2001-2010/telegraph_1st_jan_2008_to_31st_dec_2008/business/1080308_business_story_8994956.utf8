	Mumbai, March 7: The Thomas Cook group of the UK will acquire a majority stake in Thomas Cook (India) Ltd (TCIL) from Dubai Financial Group for up to Rs 1,312 crore.        
	Thomas Cook will also repurchase its Egypt business and brand licences in 15 West Asian countries from Dubai Financial.        
	The total consideration of the deals will be over Rs 1,527 crore.        
	In a private transaction with Dubai Financial, Thomas Cook will acquire 54.9 per cent of TCIL at Rs 107 a share and will make an open offer for a further 20 per cent at the same price, TCIL said in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Thomas Cook has agreed to acquire at least 61.8 per cent and up to 74.9 per cent of TCILs share capital. For a 61.8 per cent stake, Thomas Cook will have to shell out Rs 1,061 crore, while a 74.9 per cent holding will cost Rs 1,312 crore.        
	Further, to strengthen its brand value across the world, Thomas Cook will repurchase its brand business, earlier licensed to Dubai Financial, in Egypt along with the rights to the Thomas Cook brand across 15 West Asian countries for over Rs 215 crore, the company said.        
	The transactions (except the open offer) are expected to close by the end of March, and the open offer is expected to close by May this year, it said.         
	Thomas Cook is confident that under its ownership, the TCIL business will increase significantly in a market that is already growing at 15 per cent per annum.        
	I am delighted we have secured such a significant acquisition. Adding what is one of Indias largest travel and financial services businesses to our portfolio will allow us to take advantage of the growth prospects that this market offers, said Manny Fontenla-Novoa, group chief executive of Thomas Cook.

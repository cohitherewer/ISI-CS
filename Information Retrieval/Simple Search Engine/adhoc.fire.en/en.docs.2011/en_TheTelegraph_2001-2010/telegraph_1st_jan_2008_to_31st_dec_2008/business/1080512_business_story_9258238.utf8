	Mumbai, May 11: The State Bank of India (SBI) is making big gains by lending to companies with turnover in the range of Rs 50 crore to Rs 1,000 crore, which are classified as mid-corporate group by the bank.        
	This segment is the banks largest credit group, with cumulative loans in this category being over Rs 1 lakh crore. One of the reasons for strong growth in loans is the bouquet of services offered by the bank to these companies, from plain loans to project finance, syndication, advisory services and acquisition funding.        
	The bank had lent over Rs 21,600 crore to this segment last year, in the face of tough competition from rivals such as ICICI Bank.        
	Though banks are witnessing a slowdown in some loan segments, the SBI does not see any such trend in the mid-corporate sector for this year.        
	It expects advances to this group to jump 30 per cent this year, higher than the average growth rate of 25 per cent for the bank as a whole.        
	Abhijit Datta, deputy managing director and group executive (mid-corporate group) of the SBI, told The Telegraph that the focussed approach of the bank had played a key role in raising its exposure. This approach has resulted in a quicker processing of applications, while appraisals were done much faster than before.        
	The SBI has around 124 relationship managers dedicated to serve these customers, and the plan is to recruit 40 more this year. The bank also plans to hire around 80 credit analysts to strengthen its mid-corporate team.        
	The relationship managers frequently interact with our clients to know their requirements. Customers are also told about new products, Datta said, adding that the effort is not only to find new customers but also to retain existing ones.        
	Around eight regional offices have been set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Chandigarh to focus on this segment.         
	Datta said officials had been given considerable autonomy to reduce the time taken between receiving a proposal and the final disbursement. The autonomy has resulted in local mid-corporate committee clearing loan proposals of up to Rs 70 crore.         
	Our target this year is to clear applications within a period of two to three weeks against at least one month which it normally takes, Datta said.         
	Segments covered in the mid-sized category include power, sugar, pharmaceuticals, construction and textiles.

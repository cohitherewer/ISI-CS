          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 25: GMR Infrastructure will acquire a 50 per cent stake in global power generation company InterGen for $1.1 billion.        
	This is the largest-ever acquisition of a global energy utility by an Indian company. After this acquisition, we are the largest (private) power sector player in the country, GMR executive vice-president Madhu Terdal said.        
	The company has raised $1.1 billion through a bridge loan from a consortium of Indian banks, he said.         
	The bridge loan will have a maturity of two years after which it will be converted into a long-term loan.         
	According to sources, GMR has signed a definitive documentation for the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in InterGen.        
	The Netherlands-headquartered InterGen has power plants in the UK, the Netherlands, Mexico, Australia and the Philippines with a total capacity of 12,766MW.        
	The average life of the plants is about 5.5 years and still 35-40 years are left, which means we are not buying old assets, Terdal said.        
	This acquisition positions GMR Infrastructure as a global power generation company and will subsequently pave the way for international listing, he said.        
	This acquisition comes at a lesser cost because of the sub-prime crisis in the US, he said.        
	GMR is acquiring the 50 per cent stake of AIG Highstar, which is part of the US-based American Insurance Group  a fund management company.        
	The other 50 per cent is held by Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, the largest single profession pension plan in Canada.        
	Intergen was formed in 1995 as a joint venture company.        
	Besides this acquisition, GMR Infrastructure will be investing $1 billion in the next three to four years to generate 3,200MW of power from some plants in India.        
	These projects are self-sustaining, GMR chief financial officer Ashutosh Agarwala said.         
	The GMR group, the holding company of GMR Infrastructure, is evaluating options to acquire ONGCs 51 per cent stake in the Kakinada refinery, he added.

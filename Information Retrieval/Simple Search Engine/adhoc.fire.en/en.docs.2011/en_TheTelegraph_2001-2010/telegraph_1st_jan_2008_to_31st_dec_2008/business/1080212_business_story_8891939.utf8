The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Grey market players devastated
                                                                                                               Grey market players devastated
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 11: Reliance Powers dull debut has spelt doom for the grey market.        
	The grey market is an unofficial market outside regulatory scrutiny where investors make speculative bids.         
	In the run-up to the issue, there was intense speculation in the grey market that the issue would double on listing. This had prompted lakhs of people to open a demat account and invest in the offer. What attracted them was not just Brand Reliance but the grey market premium that was initially at Rs 450 to Rs 500.        
	However, the premium fell sharply after the issue closed on January 19 and two days later, when the stock market crashed, the word got round that the issue would list at around Rs 550 or Rs 600.        
	Stock broker Jayesh Gandhi said grey market deals made up around 30 to 40 per cent of kerb trades across the major cities in Gujarat.         
	With todays abysmal listing of Reliance Power, the grey market faces a major crisis, he added.        
	There is going to be a breach of trust as it will be impossible to settle the payment. Normally two days after the listing the payment is made, Gandhi said.        
	Mukul Bhatt, another stock broker, said, The grey market is finished. This market works on mutual trust. The defaulter cannot be booked for the illegal transactions.        
	Investors in Gujarat will think twice before buying shares now. Even though stock prices were low today, investors chose not to rush in.         
	Even if one invests, he would not do it whole heartedly, said Mukund Patel, a small investor.        
	Pramod Chaudhary, a leading Surat businessman and investor, is highly disappointed but hopes the market will bounce back and he would wait till then. After all, Gujaratis are speculators by nature. They cannot keep away from capital market for long.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Tough time                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: A core group of ministers that met today failed to work out a bailout package for state-run oil companies.        
	The ministers, who also discussed a proposal to raise fuel prices, among other things, are expected to meet again tomorrow.         
	The ministerial group could send its recommendations to the Union cabinet tomorrow, if they manage to arrive at a consensus.         
	While the petroleum ministry is pressing for an early decision on the package and wants to place it before the cabinet as early as tomorrow, other ministries feel the options need to be weighed properly and more time may be needed.        
	Sources said the UPA coalition would take a call on the fuel price hike after holding talks with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and calling on board its allies. Left parties, a key ally, have opposed any move to increase fuel prices.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Murli Deora held discussions on the issue for an hour at a meeting that was also attended by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	Earlier, the group of ministers on gas supplies discussed various options, including a fuel price hike, bonds to oil companies, a reduction in customs duty and a cess on personal income tax and corporate tax.        
	Sources said Deora wanted to raise the petrol price by Rs 10 a litre, diesel by Rs 5 per litre and that of LPG by Rs 50 per cylinder to cut the Rs 580-crore-per-day loss made by the oil marketing companies.        
	Gas allocation        
	The government today decided to give priority to fertiliser while allocating natural gas produced by Reliance Industries eastern offshore KG-D6 Block.        
	An empowered group of ministers, headed by Pranab Mukherjee, decided that for the current financial year demand of existing gas-based fertiliser plants would be met first, sources said.        
	After fulfilling the demand of fertiliser units, gas will be allocated to existing gas-based power units.

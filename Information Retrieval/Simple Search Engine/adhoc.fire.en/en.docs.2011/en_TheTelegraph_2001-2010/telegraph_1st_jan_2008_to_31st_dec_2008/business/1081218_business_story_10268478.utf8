	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The cabinet will soon take a decision on increasing the minimum support price for wheat. The price is likely to be raised around 8-12 per cent over Rs 1,000 a quintal fixed earlier this year.        
	While the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices has suggested Rs 1,080 as the price, officials say, wheat growing states such as Punjab want more.         
	The cabinet is likely to either stick to the recommendation of the commission or better it with a small one-time bonus.        
	It had deferred a decision after many states demanded an increase of up to 20 per cent. Global prices are currently at Rs 950-1,000 a quintal.        
	The price was increased this year to bring more land under wheat after the government resorted to import.        
	Even if the cabinet were to accept the commissions recommendations now, prices may be increased later if there is considerable unrest as this is an election year, the officials said.         
	The minimum support price is the price at which government agencies promise to buy foodgrains from farmers. The price is announced ahead of the two main sowing seasons  rabi, or the winter season, and kharif, or the monsoon season.        
	The price sets the trend for the domestic market. This is why the government is not keen on raising it.         
	Moreover, it will weigh on the governments food subsidy bill. According to the officials, food subsidy for the year can go up to Rs 54,000 crore.         
	Subsidies occur because the government sells foodgrains at a much lower price than the cost of purchase, which includes not only the support price but also interest and warehousing expenses.

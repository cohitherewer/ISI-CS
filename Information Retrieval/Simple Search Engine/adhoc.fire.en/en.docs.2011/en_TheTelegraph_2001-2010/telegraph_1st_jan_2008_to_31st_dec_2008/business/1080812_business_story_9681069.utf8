          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Lamy: Mission man                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: WTO director-general Pascal Lamy will arrive here tomorrow to hold talks with Indian leaders as he seeks to resuscitate global trade talks by narrowing the differences between the rich nations and others.        
	During his two-day visit here, Lamy will hold talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, commerce minister Kamal Nath, trade officials and the leaders of Indian industry.        
	Lamy, who will retire early next year, is expected to ascertain the extent to which India will budge from its stated position on agriculture, industry and services to ensure the completion of the Doha round.        
	Under the Doha round of negotiations, members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) aim to lower trade barriers. The Doha round is so called because the talks had commenced in 2001 in Doha, the capital of Qatar.        
	He is later scheduled to visit the US and the European Union where he will meet trade officials to maintain the momentum for the successful completion of the round.        
	Officials said there could be another mini-ministerial meeting in Geneva next month, with the last meet in July narrowing differences on many issues, though a deal proved elusive.         
	The Geneva talks failed because the US, India and China could not agree on the mechanisms to protect farmers of less affluent and poor countries from a surge in imports.        
	Nath later said that the collapse should be treated as a pause rather than a breakdown. I am hopeful that the process will restart again. India stands ready whenever the process resumes.         
	The nine-day WTO ministerial meet ended without an agreement to cut agriculture subsidies and tariffs on industrial goods.         
	The talks collapsed when the US refused to agree to proposals from India and China that they should be allowed to impose an extra 25 per cent duty if farm product imports were up 15 per cent.

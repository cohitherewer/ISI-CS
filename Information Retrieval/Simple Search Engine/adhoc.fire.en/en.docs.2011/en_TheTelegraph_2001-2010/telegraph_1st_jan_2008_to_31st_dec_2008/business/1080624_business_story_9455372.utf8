  RBI weighs steps to tame inflation          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, June 23: Reserve Bank of India governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy today said the central bank was tossing a number of options to tackle runaway inflation.        
	Reddys comments  his first public statement on the crisis since inflation bolted to a 13-year high of 11.05 per cent last Friday  came after a weekend meeting with government officials in Delhi and a central bank assessment of the situation.        
	Reddy said the central bank would moderate and manage aggregate demand and that it might have to build on the monetary measures that were taken in April and June to collar inflation.        
	In the process of difficult adjustment, the RBI will play its part in moderating and managing aggregate demand so that pressures on prices are not intensified, he said on the sidelines of the 5th convocation function of the National Institute of Bank Management in Pune.        
	In late April, the central bank had raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 25 basis points after increasing it by half a percentage point earlier in the month. On June 11, it increased the repo rate by 25 basis points.        
	CRR is the portion of money that banks have to keep with the RBI. The repo rate reflects the cost that banks incur for borrowing short-term money from the RBI.        
	Commenting on the rate tweak moves, Reddy said these were pre-emptive steps.         
	In view of the recent escalated price situation, we have taken actions in April, in terms of CRR and repo rates. We may have to build on the actions already taken, he said.        
	The RBI governor blamed the surge in oil prices for the sudden spike in inflation that hit double digits for the first time since May 1995  and said the oil shock was coming on top of some underlying inflationary pressures.        
	Reddy said the oil price hike wasnt seeping into the inflation calculations  what economists call the pass through  on a continuous basis even as he admitted that India wasnt the only nation to be badly roiled by the high oil prices.        
	Global problem        
	The oil price increase is now a global problem, making inflation a problem for all countries, both developed and developing. Hence, our solutions to the problem will also be similar, but tailored to suit our conditions, he said.        
	Reddy warned that the high level of energy prices might not necessarily be temporary and that the whole economy and society should adjust to this new reality of high and volatile energy prices.        
	In such an environment, the RBI, he said, was approaching the issue of high oil prices and resultant inflation in a calm and calculated fashion, and on an ongoing basis, in a timely manner.        
	Reddy said the RBI had been successful in ensuring orderly conditions in money, government securities and foreign exchange markets. It had also successfully moderated the signs of overheating in the economy that emerged couple of years ago.        
	Of the three shocks from the global economy, we are safe in regard to the financial sector and the outlook is optimistic on the food front. Therefore, as of now, fuel price is the main problem. The macro policy can, therefore, focus on this problem in the background of some strength in other aspects, he added.

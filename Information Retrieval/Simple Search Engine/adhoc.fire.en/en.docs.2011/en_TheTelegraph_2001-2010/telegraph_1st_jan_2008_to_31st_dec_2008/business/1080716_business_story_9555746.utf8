                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wilbur Ross flies in with $80m to rescue SpiceJet
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 15: Low-cost carrier SpiceJet Limited today said US billionaire investor Wilbur Ross was planning to invest $80 million in the airline.         
	This is a significant investment for SpiceJet to retain its low-cost model. This will strengthen SpiceJet and help it in its expansion plans, said Ajay Singh, director of SpiceJet.         
	WL Ross amp; Co, a private equity fund, will hold less than 15 per cent in the carrier, which is under severe financial pressure because of soaring jet fuel prices.        
	SpiceJet officials said Ross, who made his fortune by taking over bankrupt steel, coal and textile companies, would buy foreign currency convertible bonds held by the Dubai governments investment agency Istithmar and investment bank Goldman Sachs.         
	The airline had raised $80 million in 2005 by selling the convertible bonds. Last year, it sold shares to the Tatas and BNP Paribas to raise another $100 million.         
	On talks with Kingfisher chief Vijay Mallya, Singh said the company would concentrate on the investment by Ross but was open to future consolidation in the industry.         
	An agency report today quoted Mallya as saying that he had made an offer for SpiceJet. I did discuss with the management of SpiceJet, I wont deny that, but I like to do good deals and I wont do expensive deals, he said.        
	SpiceJet shifted focus to Ross as the price offered by Kingfisher was too low. The airlines shares declined 57 per cent this year as record fuel prices raised its costs of operation and took away funds for buying aircraft.         
	Analysts feel Ross may be able to make some profit with the stake buy as the worlds second fastest growing aviation market is expected to see a rise in demand.         
	India is set to become the fastest growing aviation market in the next two decades as more people opt for low-cost airlines. The countrys air traffic is estimated to grow at an average annual rate of 7.7 per cent till 2025 compared with Chinas 7.2 per cent and the global average of 4.8 per cent, said Airbus SAS, the worlds largest maker of planes.         
	We believe in the long-term validity of the low-cost airline model in India, and that fuel prices will eventually stabilise, Ross said in a statement.         
	The transaction is Rosss second investment in India. In February 2007, Ross acquired OCM India Limited, a worsted suiting maker, for about $37 million.         
	SpiceJet has placed orders for more than 20 single-aisle planes with Boeing. The airline, which began flights in May 2005, has a fleet of 15 planes.

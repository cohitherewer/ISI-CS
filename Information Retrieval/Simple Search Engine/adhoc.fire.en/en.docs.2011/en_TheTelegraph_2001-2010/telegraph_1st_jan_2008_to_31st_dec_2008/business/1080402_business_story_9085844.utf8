                                                                                                               Air India puts IPO plan on hold
                          Menon in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                    
	Mumbai, April 1 (PTI): National air carrier Air India today ruled out raising money through an initial public offering (IPO) this year and said it would approach the government for more money to strengthen its equity base.        
	We will not be going for our IPO this year, Air Indias newly appointed chairman and managing director Raghu Menon told reporters here.        
	We will like the government to provide equity to us. It (the government) has done it in the past for certain companies ... It depends on what case we build up, Menon said.        
	Air India will build a well-considered case before approaching the government on the matter, he said. I will like to approach the government for further infusion of equity in our company, because of the huge borrowings that we have taken to purchase new aircraft, he added.        
	On the IPO, Menon said he had really not gone into this issue. However, Air India is looking at employee stock options (ESOPS) and this scheme shall be ready in the next six months, he said.        
	This is something we will like to work out very quickly, may be over the next six months. We already have some people in place who are working on it, he said.         
	Menon said there was a need for the air carrier to improve its load factor, which was very low, with a view to enhancing its revenues.        
	We have to improve our load factor which is very low. I think there is a great deal of scope to improve our load factor  that is when the revenue will increase, he said.        
	According to Menon, there is also a scope to cut cost as after its merger with Indian Airlines, there are many areas in which there are duplication.

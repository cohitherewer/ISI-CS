          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: At a time when the global capital markets are facing turmoil, unit- linked insurance policies (Ulip) continue to be a good bet, top industry officials said.         
	Ulips may be perceived as risky but they are growing phenomenally. The growth rate last year was 30 per cent and with the market and people maturing, it will only get better, said Tarun Bajaj, joint secretary in the ministry of finance.         
	Ulips are insurance policies sold in units such as mutual funds and the funds are invested in the equity and debt market.         
	Insurance firms in the country have been generating maximum premium income from such products.         
	There are approximately 25 lakh agents selling Ulips in the country. A total of 55,000 crore Ulips were sold last year.         
	We have not seen any definite shift from Ulip to other products, T.S. Vijayan, chairman of Life Insurance Corporation of India, said.

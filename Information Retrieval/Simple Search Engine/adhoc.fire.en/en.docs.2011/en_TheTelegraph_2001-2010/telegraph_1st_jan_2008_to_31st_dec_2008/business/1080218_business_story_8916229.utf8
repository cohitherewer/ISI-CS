                                                                                                               Tata Motors thinks global for sales surge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         
	Mumbai, Feb. 17: The contribution of Tata Motors international business to its consolidated revenues is expected to rise to 30 per cent from 20 per cent as the company unveils a slew of new products and enters new markets.         
	The companys passenger cars and trucks are available in Europe, Africa, West Asia, South America and Australia. It also has assembly operations in various countries.         
	We selectively look at geographies and expand step by step. We also go to territories that are similar to ours. For example, we are now set to enter Poland, which is a growing market in eastern Europe, company sources said.         
	South Africa is one of Tata Motors most successful markets. The company is the third largest player in commercial vehicles there and is the market leader in many segments within the industry.         
	Sources said growing international business had enabled the company to derisk itself, as difficulties in one market can be compensated by another.         
	The Indian automobile market has been under pressure for the past few months because of high interest rates. Even in such circumstances, exports from Tata Motors during the nine-month period of April to December 2007 stood at 40,488 units against 38,834 units in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, a 4.3 per cent growth rate.         
	C. Ramakrishnan, executive directorfinance of the company, recently said, Wed like to see our international business contribute 25-30 per cent to our topline to spread our presence both in the domestic and international economies.        
	According to Ramakrishnan, the company is now looking at the Russian and some eastern European markets. The company also has plans for the Latin American countries.         
	Tata Motors recently showcased a range of new products at the recent Auto Expo in New Delhi. Apart from the Tata Nano, some of the products on display were the Sumo Grande, Indigo CS (compact sedan) and the Indica direct injection common rail version, apart from the Xenon XT (cross terrain), a life style pick-up, to be launched later this year.         
	The Xenon XT has already been launched in some international markets. Tata Nano is also likely to make its global debut by 2011.         
	Tata Motors reported 8.75 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 654.79 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2007.

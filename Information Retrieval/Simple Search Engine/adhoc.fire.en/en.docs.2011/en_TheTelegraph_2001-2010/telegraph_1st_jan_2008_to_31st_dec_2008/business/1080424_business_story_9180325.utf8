          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 23: The surge in crude oil prices has hurt Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) with its under-recoveries ballooning to Rs 43,000 crore during 2007-08.        
	The under-recoveries arise because the government-mandated price at which it retails petrol, diesel and LPG doesnt cover its entire costs.        
	The government has tried to ease the burden somewhat by issuing oil bonds. IOC has oil bonds worth Rs 16,500 crore on its books. It has drawn up plans to invest Rs 2,000 crore this year to beef up its marketing network.         
	It will spend Rs 790 crore on retail network expansion and upgradation, Rs 600 crore on the LPG business, including network expansion for autogas.        
	IOC plans to invest around Rs 400 crore to create additional bulk storage for petroleum products. Around Rs 90 crore will be earmarked for the aviation business and Rs 50 crore will be used to augment bulk storage facilities for its large consumers. IOC is confident that these investments will be beneficial over a period of time.        
	G.C. Daga, director (marketing), told reporters today that the corporation would fund the investment plan through internal accruals and borrowings.        
	Total borrowings of IOC touched nearly Rs 36,000 crore. It has the option of liquidating the oil bonds in the case of any major cash requirement.         
	During 2007-08, IOC sold 58.3 million tonnes of petroleum products, an 8.7 per cent growth rate in volumes over the previous year. Daga said the companys market share increased 1.1 per cent to touch 48.9 per cent. Exports during the year touched 3.3 million tonnes, an 8.5 per cent growth rate over last year.         
	During the year, the retail network was extended with 1,200 petrol outlets being set up in the country. IOC now has over 17,626 outlets.        
	Daga said the company was focussing on alternate revenue options from its retail outlets.

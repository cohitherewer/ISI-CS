          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Morparia: New role                          
	Mumbai, Aug. 28: Kalpana Morparia, chief strategy and communications officer at ICICI, has resigned after a 33-year stint  and will now head JPMorgans India operations.        
	Morparia, who was also ICICIs vice-chair of insurance, securities, asset management and a director of several subsidiaries of the financial services powerhouse, had retired from the board of directors of ICICI Bank in 2007 after which she assumed her current role.        
	Since 2007, she has focused on guiding the groups insurance, asset management and securities businesses.        
	She had joined the erstwhile ICICI Ltd in 1975 and was elevated to its board of directors in 2001.        
	Last year, ICICI Bank had decided to set up a new wholly owned subsidiary, ICICI Holdings, which was supposed to house its investments in life, general insurance and asset management companies. Morparia headed this subsidiary, but it had not received all the approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).        
	Morparia, who holds a Bachelors degree in science and law, initially worked in the legal department of ICICI from 1975 to 1994. From 1996, she headed the legal, planning, treasury and corporate communications departments.        
	It was in 1998 that she was promoted as senior general manager of ICICI.         
	She became a deputy managing director in 2003  two years after joining the board of directors  and was promoted as joint managing director in April 2006.        
	She completed her term as joint managing director of ICICI Bank in May last year.         
	Morparia is credited with various achievements during her stint at Indias major financial services group.         
	Sources from the bank said she was a key figure behind the reverse merger of ICICI Ltd with ICICI Bank in 2002. She also helped in building the groups diversified financial services.        
	She shaped the insurance business and also played a major role in ICICI Banks corporate banking business, sources at the bank said.        
	During her earlier days at the financial institution, she was given charge of its capital raising programmes and other products as well. When ICICI launched its first international bond in 1981, she oversaw the entire exercise, sources said.        
	As head of the corporate centre of ICICI Bank till 2007, she was responsible for a range of functions, including planning and strategy, financial reporting, risk management and human resources management.        
	It is being speculated that other executives from the ICICI Bank group can soon follow Morparia to JPMorgan India. This, however, could not be confirmed.

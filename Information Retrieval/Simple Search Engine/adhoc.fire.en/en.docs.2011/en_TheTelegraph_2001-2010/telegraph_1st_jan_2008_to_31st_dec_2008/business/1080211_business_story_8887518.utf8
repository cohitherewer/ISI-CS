The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Entry fee for close-end MFs
                                                                                                            Entry fee for close-end MFs
          ANIRUDH LASKAR                          MONEY GAME                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: Investors in mutual funds will soon be required to pay an entry load to buy close-ended schemes as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked asset management companies to eliminate initial expenses from such schemes.        
	Earlier, Sebi allowed companies to amortise a certain portion of the sum put in by an investor as initial expenses. This meant the investor did not have to pay for the expenses at the time of buying the units.         
	However, the amortisation is staggered over a pre-defined period. In the case of three-year funds, the amortisation fee is a maximum of 6 per cent of the investors contribution.        
	Load structure        
	As Sebi prepares the load structures for close-ended schemes, companies are worried about the impact that these loads will have on their sales.         
	In April 2006, Sebi had passed a similar verdict on open-ended schemes.         
	Since the entry load on most open-ended funds is 2.25 per cent now, companies are bound by this limit while giving commissions to distributors.        
	For close-ended funds, the amortisation fee is higher at 6 per cent, prompting distributors to aggressively sell these funds vis--vis open-ended plans. This is evident from the rise in the number of new close-ended funds over the past one-and-a-half years. According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India, total sales from close-ended funds in 2007 were about Rs 1,29,726 crore compared with Rs 37, 433 crore for open-ended schemes.        
	Brakes on growth        
	Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer of Value Research Online, told The Telegraph, The number of close-ended new funds will come down once the asset management companies start charging entry loads from the investors. Also, the mobilisation from the new offers will be lower, putting a brake on the growth of mutual funds for some time.         
	Since the asset management companies will now be required to bear the initial expenses, it may be a little difficult for them to retrieve the money through entry loads from investors, which in turn may affect their profitability, Kumar said.         
	Srinivas Jain, the chief marketing officer of SBI Mutual Fund, said though Sebis move was healthy for investors, it would certainly have an impact on the sales of close-ended funds.         
	Brokerage charges        
	To make up for the initial expenses, the fund houses will not only have to introduce entry loads but also make adjustments in their exit loads, which may not appeal to first-time investors. Moreover, the companies will now have to negotiate with agents and distributors to keep their brokerage charges within a modest range to help maintain affordable entry loads. However, the companies should not find it difficult to earn profits in the long run, Jain added.        
	Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer of UTI Mutual Fund, said, The distribution and sale of funds involve large costs, and if we start charging entry loads, the industry may see a lot of investors and distributors migrating from mutual funds to other financial products, such as insurance.        
	Nimesh Shah, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, said, Sebis move is good for the investors. We are still awaiting the final guidelines from the regulator.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks seek relief on infrastructure loans
                                                                                                               Banks seek relief on infrastructure loans

	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Banks want the government to offer tax sops on interest earned from loans to infrastructure companies.        
	This will help in funding infrastructure projects and boost growth.        
	Till 2005-06, banks were not required to pay tax on interest earned from infrastructure loans.        
	K. Raghuraman, executive director, Punjab National Bank, said, We want the government to restore the income tax benefits on lending to infrastructure projects under Section 10(23)(G) of Income Tax Act. This will enable us to lower the cost of borrowing for those entities that are implementing infrastructure projects.         
	Under Section 10(23)(G), banks were allowed to claim a deduction on the interest earned from long-term loans to infrastructure projects.         
	This section was deleted by the government in the Finance Act, 2006. When the exemption was removed, banks had increased the rate of interest on loans to existing infrastructure projects.        
	Banks while fixing the interest rates for such infrastructure projects took tax benefits available into account. Deletion of this section has resulted in an increase in tax liability to the banks, the Indian Banks Association said in its pre-budget memorandum to finance minister P. Chidambaram.        
	The floor rate of interest for infrastructure projects is around 12 per cent, depending on the projects and the borrowers. If banks were given an exemption, a 50-75 basis point concession can be given, after taking into account the cost of funds and other operational costs, Raghuraman said.        
	As infrastructure projects have long gestation periods, lower interest rates are important for the successful implementation of a project, analysts said.        
	For the Eleventh Plan (2007-12), the government has projected investments in infrastructure (at 2006-07 prices) of over Rs 20,18,700 crore.        
	Indian industry is also expecting incentives in infrastructure.         
	At a recent Confederation of Indian Industry seminar, Y.M. Deosthalee, chief financial officer, Larsen amp; Toubro, had said that as the infrastructure industry required a lot of investments, there was a need to provide incentives to hike investment.        
	The government, in 2006, had justified removing the exemption on the grounds that the overall cost of projects had fallen because of a softening of the interest rate regime.        
	However, infrastructure projects require at least 70 per cent debt and, so, are dependent on bank credit.         
	Banks that take short-tenure deposits of up to five years cannot lend long-term to infrastructure projects which have a tenure of over 15 years.

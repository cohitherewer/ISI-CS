                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel price riddle yet to be solved 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Steel secretary R. S. Pandey (left), with Tata Steel MD B. Muthuraman, in Jamshedpur on Saturday. (PTI)                                   
	Jamshedpur, May 31: The Centres initiative to bring down steel prices may face a serious challenge from the worsening demand-supply mismatch in the country.        
	India has become a net importer of steel from a net exporter as inordinate delays in new projects hurt fresh capacity addition.        
	Steel secretary R.S. Pandey today said the country imported 7 million tonnes (mt) of steel last year while it exported 5mt.        
	The situation is going to worsen in the next two to three years, Pandey said in Jamshedpur.         
	In 2007-08, steel import increased 46 per cent while export declined 6 per cent. Indias steel production went up about 6 per cent while demand grew 12-13 per cent.         
	The steel secretary was here to blow-in Tata Steels latest blast furnace H, the largest so far in the country.        
	This will increase the companys capacity to 7mt from the present level of 5mt when it starts production from September this year.         
	While Pandey hoped that in five years India would be able to achieve 124mt of steel production from the present level of 53mt, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman was far from being convinced.        
	If this pace continues, we will not add more than 8-10mt each year. In that case, there will be a shortfall of 25mt going by the present demand. The deficit will have to be bridged through imports, Muthuraman said.        
	According to steel experts, if demand remains buoyant and new capacity is not created, it will drive up prices despite artificial restrictions imposed by the government.        
	Export duty         
	Pandey said the export duty on steel could be rolled back soon. He claimed that the duty, ranging from 5-15 per cent, had yielded result. He also said higher duty on iron ore exports, as demanded by steel companies, was under consideration.

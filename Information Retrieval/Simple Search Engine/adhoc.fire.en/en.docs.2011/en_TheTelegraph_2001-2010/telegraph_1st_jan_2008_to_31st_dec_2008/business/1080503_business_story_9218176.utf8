          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 2: The rollout of third generation (3G) services may get delayed as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has started a fresh consultation process on the eligibility, allocation and pricing of 3G mobile spectrum.        
	Trai has asked telecom operators to send their views on an earlier proposed pricing and method of allocation for the 3.3-3.6MHz spectrum kept aside for 3G or value-added mobile services.         
	Moreover, the regulator has proposed the use of 2.3-2.4 GHz and 2.5-2.69 GHz band for 3G mobile services as it offers significant scope for innovation with the potential for induction of new technologies, services, applications and devices.        
	Trai also wants telecom firms to consider eligibility criteria for bidding and the maximum amount of radio waves that a player can bid for. Earlier, Trai had said that 3G radio waves would be auctioned in tranches of 5MHz to each service provider which won the bid to roll out these services.        
	It had also decided to reserve one slot for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited who would not be allowed to enter the auction process but would have to pay a price equal to the highest bidder to get 5MHz of 3G spectrum to roll out services.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dabhol IPO, GAIL bonus on agenda 
                                                                                                               Dabhol IPO, GAIL bonus on agenda 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Choubey: Big plans                                  
	New Delhi, March 11: GAIL plans to come out with an initial public offering for Ratnagiri Power and Gas Company, which owns the Dabhol power plant, by the end of this year.        
	GAIL chairman U.D. Choubey also said the companys board could consider issuing bonus shares in two to three months.        
	He said GAIL would spend Rs 4,200 crore on new and existing projects in the next fiscal against Rs 2,300 crore in this financial year.        
	GAIL plans to increase its pipeline spread by another 5,500 kilometres, adding to the existing network of over 6,700 km.         
	Ratnagiri Power chairman R.K. Goel said the company, in which GAIL has a substantial stake, could come out with an IPO later this year, divesting about 25 per cent equity to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore to repay debt and complete the construction of the Dabhol plant and a LNG terminal.        
	He said a board meeting had been called on March 20 for changing Ratnagiri Power from a private limited company to a public limited one.         
	Of the total share capital of Rs 4,000 crore, GAIL, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and financial institutions have so far contributed Rs 2,985 crore and the rest of the amount will be raised through the IPO, he said.        
	Ratnagiri Power plans to use the IPO proceeds to pre-pay the debt it had taken from Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) and NTPC. The firm had taken a loan worth Rs 350 crore loan from PFC for completion of the power plant and the LNG import terminal. NTPC had also sanctioned a Rs 500-crore loan, of which Rs 150 crore has been drawn.        
	Goel said the IPO would be followed by a Rs 500-crore private placement of equity shares, which was likely to be subscribed by lenders, such as IDBI, ICICI Bank, the SBI, Canara Bank and IFCI, who wish to convert part of their Rs 7,011-crore term loan into equity.        
	The Dabhol plant would be fully operational by next month when the third generating unit is commissioned, he added. Two units are generating about 1,100MW of power.        
	City gas        
	Choubey today announced GAILs plans to set up a subsidiary for the city gas distribution and CNG corridor business.        
	The initial equity in the subsidiary company will be Rs 200 crore. Corresponding to this equity amount, debt of Rs 300 crore will be arranged.        
	GAIL has identified 230 cities that are on the path of its existing and proposed pipelines for the city gas project, which will be implemented in a phased manner.         
	The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board is formulating guidelines to ensure uniformity as several players want a slice of the business.        
	The government plans to roll out gas networks in around 200 cities over five years.         
	This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore, or about Rs 300 crore per city.

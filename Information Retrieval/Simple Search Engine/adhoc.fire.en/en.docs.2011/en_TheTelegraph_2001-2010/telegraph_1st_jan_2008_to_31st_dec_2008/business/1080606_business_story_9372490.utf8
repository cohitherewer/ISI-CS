          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Red Alert                                  
	Mumbai, June 5: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), BG Group Plc and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have stopped oil and gas production at the Panna and Mukta fields after an explosion in a processing platform killed a person.        
	We are assessing the situation. Oil and gas production from the field has been halted temporarily, said an official who did not wish to be identified.        
	Although it is believed that the person killed was a contractual employee of BG, this could not be confirmed from any of the consortium partners.        
	The fields produce around 40,000 barrels per day of oil and around 17 million cubic metres per day of gas.        
	Sources, however, added that the adjacent Tapti field had not been affected.         
	All the oil produced in the fields is sold to Indian Oil Corporation and the gas to GAIL India.        
	BG and Reliance each own 30 per cent in the fields and ONGC holds the rest. The consortium partners are planning to spend over Rs 4,000 crore to increase oil and gas production over the next five years.        
	Though no specific timeframe has been given for the commencement of operations, sources say that while gas production can resume in a couple of days, restarting oil production may take some more time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora seeks oil duty cut
                                                                                                               Deora seeks oil duty cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          LOOKING FOR RELIEF                                  
	New Delhi, April 3: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to cut the customs duty on crude oil to save state-run companies from bankruptcy.        
	Just like the government scrapped the import duty on edible oil, the 5 per cent customs duty on crude oil should also be made nil, Deora told reporters here. Oil bonds given by the government are not enough, Deora said. He has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to issue more oil bonds.        
	With crude prices ruling above $100 per barrel, oil companies face a Rs 130,000-crore revenue loss on fuel sale in the current fiscal. Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL together lost Rs 77,304.50 crore on the sale of petrol, diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene in 2007-08.        
	Sources said Singh could ask his cabinet colleagues to explore the possibility of scrapping the customs duty, or ensure a specific rate of duty instead of it being charged as a percentage of the price.         
	Revenue collections have grown Rs 35,000 crore to Rs 1,80,000 crore because of the higher customs mopup, and other taxes on oil firms, since the duty amount increases with the rise in the global price of crude oil. Officials said the finance ministry could oppose the duty cut as it would affect the governments revenue collections and derail other schemes such as the programme of a farm loan waiver.

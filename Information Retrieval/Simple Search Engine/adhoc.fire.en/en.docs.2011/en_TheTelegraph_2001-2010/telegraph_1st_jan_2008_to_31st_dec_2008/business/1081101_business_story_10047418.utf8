          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: The government has kept up a studied air of nonchalance to the mayhem on the markets that has seen the sensex crumble over 63 per cent this year.        
	Behind the veil of indifference, there is a lurking sense of worry that the precipitous fall can shake investor confidence in equity markets at a time when the authorities are trying to head off a slowdown in the economy.        
	The finance ministry has carried out an unprecedented survey of 10 blue-chip stocks to make some sense of the volatile price movements and determine whether some market participants had colluded to hammer certain stocks.        
	The survey, which covered stocks such as Infosys, HDFC, Tata Steel, Reliance Infrastructure, Larsen and Toubro and Satyam Computers, compared net profit growth with the movement in stock prices.        
	These companies have declared a healthy increase in profits after tax both in the first and the second quarters of the current financial year compared with similar periods in the previous year, top officials said. Yet, the prices of these stocks declined sharply between April 1 this year and October 24. There has also been a steep decline in the price to earnings ratios.        
	Except Hero Honda, all the blue chips have seen their stock prices tumble by 17 per cent to 74 per cent in the past six months.        
	The finance ministry mandarins said they had tried to probe the market behaviour to determine whether there was a cartel that had hammered these stocks. The study did not turn up any conclusive evidence.        
	There is no explanation why the investors sold the stocks of these companies. The behaviour of the market borders on irrationality, the study concluded.        
	Bold gambit        
	Officials said many of these stocks were clearly oversold  which means the sellers had sold more shares than they had in their possession. This usually happens in a bearish market where sellers hope that prices will go down sufficiently so that they can then buy back at lower prices and square up their deals, and still make big profits.        
	A wise investor would (now) begin to buy these stocks, the finance ministry official said in a lighter vein.        
	It is unusual for the finance ministry to study stock market movements so closely. The task is usually left to the capital market regulator.        
	The capital markets have helped companies raise a lot of money in the past to finance their projects. With the collapse of the equity markets, companies have been forced to tap bank credit at a time when the financial system has been strapped for cash, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to take a number of liquidity-enhancing measures to pump in over Rs 1,85,000 crore.        
	Analysts say the market meltdown was precipitated by a wave of selling initiated by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who were offloading shares locally to make good their losses they had run up in their US and European operations.        
	Officials said the Securities and Exchange Board of India could investigate whether there was a bear cartel which had resorted to heavy short selling at certain counters.        
	The FIIs had been lending shares to unregulated overseas entities which sold them promptly in the Indian bourses, triggering the slide in stocks.

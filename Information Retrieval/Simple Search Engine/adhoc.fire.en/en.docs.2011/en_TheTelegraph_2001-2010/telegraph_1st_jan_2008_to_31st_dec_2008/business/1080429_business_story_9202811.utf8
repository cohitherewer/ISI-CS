	New Delhi, April 28: The UK-based Dawnay, Day Hotels is set to enter India. The company plans to have eight to 10 properties at an investment of around Rs 1,000 crore by 2011.        
	We are eyeing the four-star category. This means we are looking at bridging the gap between luxury and budget segments, said Mandeep S. Lamba, managing director of Dawnay, Day Hotels India, a 100 per cent subsidiary.        
	The company will open its first 115-room hotel in Jaipur later this year. Next year, it will open hotels in Pune and Ahmedabad. Later, Dawnay, Day plans to set up hotels in other cities such as Nagpur, Bangalore, Chennai, Coimbatore and Lucknow.        
	The rooms will be priced between Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,000. Each of these hotels will have a swimming pool, a health club, a small spa and two restaurants among other facilities.        
	Citing the need for opening more hotels in the upscale mid-segment category, Lamba said, Statistics say that out of the 1 lakh plus rooms the country needs, about 15 per cent should come up in the four-star segment. As the market matures, there is a need for more segmentation as is the case in overseas market.        
	On whether the company is looking at growth through acquisitions or joint ventures, Lamba said, The hotels under construction are under the built, operate and own model. We are open to either of these routes but its important to find the right partner.

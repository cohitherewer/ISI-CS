                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ACC to take price call after 3 months
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 20: Indias largest cement manufacturer ACC today said it would increase prices after about three months, subject to the government policy and the market situation.        
	Showing our concern to the rising inflation, we froze prices for two-three months, but after that we are going to increase (the rates) if market forces and the government allow us, said Sumit Banerjee, managing director of ACC.        
	He said unlike other sectors where prices were determined by market forces, the cement industry was unable to increase rates after the government and manufacturers agreed to hold prices last week.        
	Banerjee, however, said if the government rolled back the recently announced hike in the excise duty, the company might not consider an increase in prices after three months.        
	On April 29, the government had hiked the excise duty for cement priced above Rs 250 per 50-kg bag.         
	He said because of the current situation, the profitability of the industry, and of ACC, in particular, was under tremendous pressure.         
	Our company is facing an erosion of one per cent in earnings margin every month due to rising input cost and the present duty structure, said Banerjee.        
	In the first quarter of 2008, though the company grew at 10 per cent, its margins went down, he added.        
	Margins in the second quarter will be under further pressure because of high input costs. Excise hike will also hit us further, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mandarins see new roles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mandarins see new roles
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                           New assignments                                  
	New Delhi, July 20: As the Manmohan Singh government readies itself for a confidence vote on Tuesday, it took time out for some intricate reshuffles in key economic ministries.         
	P.K. Rastogi, currently posted as the special secretary in the ministry of defence, is tipped to take over as the steel secretary at a time when the government is keen to combat rising steel prices which have contributed significantly to double-digit inflation.         
	Current steel secretary R.S. Pandey, who many in government circles believed was not very effective in curbing the huge increases in steel prices undertaken by a handful of firms, is being given charge of the even more important petroleum ministry.         
	However, as the steel secretary, Pandey had developed a good rapport with most steel makers, including incoming giants such as ArcelorMittal. This is possibly seen as an asset in handling large entities such as Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries in the petroleum and gas sectors.         
	M.S. Srinivasan, the current petroleum secretary, may move to the World Bank. He has been attacked by the Congresss new ally  the Samajwadi Party.         
	Atul Chaturvedi, financial advisor in the ministry of rural development, where he controls the purse strings of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, will be asked to take charge of the crucial fertiliser ministry, which has to manage huge subsidy payouts that are expected to top Rs 70,000 crore.         
	Current fertiliser secretary K.S. Sarma is likely to join the telecom disputes appellate authority, where he will have to pass judgements on several high profile cases.         
	J.P. Singh is likely to be made the chief executive officer of the Food and Safety Standards Authority of India, which is being beefed up with provisions for wide ranging powers over packaged food and drinks.         
	These products have come up for close scrutiny of parliamentary panels and environmentalists.         
	The proposed reshuffle comes in the wake of an attack on the petroleum ministry by Samajwadi party leader Amar Singh and charges of steel sector cartelisation by the finance ministry.         
	Two months back, despite appeals from steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, most companies increased prices by Rs 1,500-3,000 a tonne. Steel producers had before that, too, increased prices in two phases. In January, they had raised prices by Rs 600-900 a tonne, while in the beginning of February, prices were pushed up by an average Rs 2,500 a tonne.         
	All these had led to the government accusing steel makers of forming a cartel to hike prices. A few cuts were announced by the firms in between after a hue and cry was raised in several quarters, but these were insufficient. Very often, retail prices were far higher than the advertised prices of the firms.

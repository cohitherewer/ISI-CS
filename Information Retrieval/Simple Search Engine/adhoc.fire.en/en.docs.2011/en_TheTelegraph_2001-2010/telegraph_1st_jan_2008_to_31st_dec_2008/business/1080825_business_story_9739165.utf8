                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ambanis lead race to make fuel from coal
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 24 (PTI): Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries and Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure have qualified for the $6-8 billion project to convert coal into liquid fuels such as petrol and diesel, according to criteria set by the government.        
	Firms run by the Ambani brothers were the only ones to meet minimum net worth criteria of Rs 4,000 crore and have a technology agreement with a foreign firm to convert coal into liquid petroleum, sources in the coal ministry said.        
	Besides the Ambanis, seven firms met minimum net worth criteria, including SAIL, GAIL (India), GMR Infrastructure, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and JSW Steel.         
	Of these, SAIL and JSW did not meet eligibility criteria of having a collaboration or a tie-up with a proven technology provider, while GAIL, GMR and IOC only furnished assurance letters from technology providers. No documents related to the memorandum of understanding or agreement were provided.        
	On preliminary examination of the 22 bids received for the coal-to-liquid (CTL) project at Radhikapur coal block, Srirampur block and Ramchandi promotional coal block in Orissa, seven more companies fulfilled net worth criteria if their parent firms balance sheets were taken into account.        
	These include Tata group firm Strategic Energy Technology Systems, Essar, Sterlite Energy, Vedanta Aluminium, Jindal Steel and Power, Vista Natural Resources and Ricon Infrastructure.        
	The Tatas, Essar, Sterlite, Vedanta, Jindal Steel and VistaNatural Resources had technology tie-ups, while Ricon had none.        
	Sources said an inter ministerial group would decide if the assurance letters for technology tie-ups and parent company net worth would qualify a company for a CTL project.         
	However, Reliance Power could not qualify net worth criteria. Others failing to meet this criteria include Solar Industries, Jai Balaji Industries, Shriram Infrastructure and Power, Welspun, Adani, Indiabulls Energy and Bhushan Steel.

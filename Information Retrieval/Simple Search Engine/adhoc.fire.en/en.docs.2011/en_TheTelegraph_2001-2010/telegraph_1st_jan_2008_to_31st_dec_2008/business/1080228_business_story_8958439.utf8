          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Feb. 27: Korean major Posco may face further delays in its Orissa project.        
	The company, which decided to go ahead with the groundbreaking programme in April, said it could be forced to defer the programme.        
	We are hoping for some positive response from the Centre on the iron ore lease in the next one month. If that does not happen, we will reconsider doing the groundbreaking in April, Chang-Ho Kwag, director of the Posco Research Institute, said.        
	Posco had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government for a 12-million-tonne steel plant at an investment of Rs 52,000 crore. But persistent opposition by land owners has delayed the project.        
	Though the Orissa government had recommended a prospecting licence for the mines, the Centre had rejected it. Kwag, however, said that the company was not considering shifting the project from India. We have been waiting. We will wait, he said. Kwag, who made a presentation on the Indian steel scenario in a seminar here today, admitted that doing business in India was not easy.

                                                                                                               Debate on rate regime
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 28: Bankers are divided over the prospect of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising interest rates.        
	But there is a broad consensus that the central bank will raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to curb inflationary expectations.        
	The CRR is that portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the central bank and it now stands at 7.50 per cent.        
	Though there is a unanimity among bankers that the RBI will not lower rates, there are divergent views on whether the central bank will hike the reverse repo and repo, instruments that directly impact the rate regime.        
	Those who felt that the RBI would not hike these rates, said the current trends in inflation were entirely because of supply side factors that included rising food and commodity prices.        
	They also said demand side factors, which could contribute to higher inflation, were not at worrisome levels.         
	Uday Kotak, managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said fiscal and supply side measures should be taken to curb inflation.        
	A CRR hike may come even before the monetary policy on April 29. This is because inflation numbers are certainly not going to look good, said a senior official from a private sector bank who did not wish to be identified.        
	However, another executive felt that the RBI governor Y.V. Reddy would not take a knee-jerk reaction.        
	Harihar Krishnamurthy of Development Credit Bank said while the present rise in inflation was due to dearer food and commodity prices, there was no guarantee that a hike in interest rates would bring down inflation, though it would certainly slow the countrys growth.        
	This (inflation) is a supply side issue and not demand led. He wondered whether a rise in rates would bring down food and commodity prices.

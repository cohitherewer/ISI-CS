                                                                                                            Sensex gets feel of 21000
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: The sensex roared past the 21000 mark  the first milestone it crossed in 2008.        
	In 2007, the bellwether index crossed six peaks after topping the 15000 mark in July.        
	The market opened strong and the index rose to an intra-day high of 21077.53. But it couldnt hold on to the peak and slid on heavy profit-booking to close at 20873.33, a gain of 60.68 points over Tuesdays close.        
	The new peak comes just days before the third quarter earnings season kicks off.        
	Most analysts say that if India Inc delivers on expectations, the index can consolidate above 21000.         
	There is plenty of liquidity flowing into the markets from domestic institutions and others, though foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have not been aggressive buyers. Much will depend on the results and thereafter the Union budget, an analyst with a domestic brokerage said. He added that purchases from foreign investors were also expected to resume after fresh fund allocations by FIIs for the new calendar year.        
	Market circles said that though the day began well for equities, there was trouble for several mid and small cap stocks which witnessed heavy unloading towards the latter half of the days trading.         
	Many of these stocks have seen a huge run-up in their values over the past couple of months and investors rushed to pick money off the table.        
	Reflecting the carnage in these scrips, the BSE small cap index plummeted by 3.28 per cent, or 459 points, and the BSE mid cap index fell 2.82 per cent, or 285 points. The market breadth turned negative with 2,639 losers against 549 gainers.         
	Gold sizzles        
	Gold prices internationally rose to an all time high as higher crude oil prices and a weaker dollar spurred demand for the yellow metal. Gold hit a fresh all-time high of above $875 per ounce in early London trade.        
	Domestic prices of the metal reached a new peak of Rs 11,150 per 10 gram on the bullion markets.         
	Todays rise surpassed the previous record of Rs 11,025 set on January 4 when crude oil prices peaked at $100 per barrel and the US greenback fell against many currencies in the forex market, making the metal more attractive for investment purposes.

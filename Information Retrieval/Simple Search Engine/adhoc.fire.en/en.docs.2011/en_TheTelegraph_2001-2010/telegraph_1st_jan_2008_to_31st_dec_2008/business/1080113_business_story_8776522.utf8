	New Delhi, Jan. 12: More than a lakh queued up to see the Rs 1-lakh car on the very first day the Delhi Auto Expo opened its door to the public. Hall no 11, which houses the Tata Nano, received over 150,000 visitors today. 
    
	Pavilion managers are expecting a bigger crowd on Sunday. 
    
	There were queries of all sorts  When will the booking start? What will be the initial deposit? Will there be a quota for the physically challenged? 
    
	There are no ready answers as the details are yet to be worked out, sources in the Tata pavilion said. 
    
	Pavilion officials quoted industry estimates to say that some 70 million two-wheeler owners are looking forward to book the dream vehicle. 
    
	We do not know how long it will take to deliver the vehicles. We will try our best to meet the demand, they said. 
    
	There were queries from college students as well. Why should we not book the car? There is a facility for loans. There will be no problem arranging finances, a young college boy from Delhi said. 
    
	A senior Tata Motors official told The Telegraph: About four million people have visited our website tatapeoplescar.com in just about 30 hours. 
    
	Taking the unprecedented rush into account, the company is revving up its existing website tatamotors.com. The official said the server might be shut down for about 15 minutes tonight to clear the jam. 
    
	The site is getting jammed, the officials said. 
    
	Significantly, a large number of villagers from the neighbouring states of Haryana and western UP also made a beeline for the Tata pavilion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Pressure is mounting on the government to reduce fuel prices as the Indian basket of crude oil slides towards the $100-per-barrel mark.        
	The Indian basket, comprising Oman-Dubai sour grade and Brent dated sweet in the ratio of 58:42, touched $101.65 a barrel on Monday when the global crude price was around $106 a barrel.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora is now under political pressure to roll back the June price hike.         
	He had ruled out a price cut earlier because the state-owned oil marketing companies were making losses for selling fuel below cost.        
	The oil companies said they were against any cuts and were preparing to strengthen their case. However, sources said, the companies expected a cut after about a month.         
	A cut in fuel prices will help in taming inflation, which is ruling above 12 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: State-run NMDC Ltd has increased the prices of iron ore, to be procured on a long-term basis by steel firms.        
	The increase is in the range of 10.5 per cent to 40 per cent to be implemented retrospectively from April. It will raise the cost of making steel by Rs 1,100-1,500 a tonne.        
	The price hike comes at a time when international spot prices have halved over fears of a global recession. However, the new rates of NMDC will be much lower than its global peers. Brazils Vale and Australias Rio Tinto have raised prices by 71 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively, for Chinese and Japanese steel mills.        
	Domestic steel companies are not happy with NMDCs decision as steel prices have crashed 40 per cent from their peak. We are not in a position to increase prices in the local market. Global prices have corrected from a high of $1,300 a tonne to $800 a tonne. We have to absorb the increase in raw material cost, an executive of a private steel company said.         
	The executive said NMDC had increased prices when they were declining internationally. NMDC chairman and managing director Rana Som dismissed the argument. He said the long-term contract prices were not linked with spot prices.        
	The purpose of a long-term contract is to insulate buyer and seller from the vagaries of market fluctuations, Som told The Telegraph.        
	He said the new rates included the interim term hike of last October. NMDC had increased prices by Rs 574 per tonne for both lumps and fines then. With the fresh round of hikes, lump and fine prices will go up Rs 900-1,000 per tonne and Rs 187 per tonne, respectively.        
	NMDC produces 30 million tonnes of iron ore every year. It sells mostly to domestic companies such as Ispat Industries, Essar Steel, JSW Steel and RINL and other small players. Tata Steel and SAIL get iron ore from its own mines.

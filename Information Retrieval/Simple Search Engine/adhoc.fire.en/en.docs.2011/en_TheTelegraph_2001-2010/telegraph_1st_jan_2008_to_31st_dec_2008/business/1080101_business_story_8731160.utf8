     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) today sold a 7.15 per cent stake in its insurance joint venture to partner Standard Life (Mauritius Holdings) 2006 Ltd for an undisclosed sum.
    
	With the transaction, Standard Life now holds 26 per cent in the HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, a statement here said. The partners have also agreed that any future sale of shares by HDFC to Standard Life, if and when permitted by law, would be at fair value.
    
	The companies are also planning an initial public offer for the insurance company before the end of 2009. In June this year, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had hinted at a stake rejig. 
    
	Analysts said Standard Life picked up the additional stake because it was bullish about the prospects of the life insurance business in India.
    
	Last year, Standard Life had sold its 9.27 per cent stake in HDFC to Citigroup. The stake sale was part of its plan to increase its shareholding in the life insurance venture.

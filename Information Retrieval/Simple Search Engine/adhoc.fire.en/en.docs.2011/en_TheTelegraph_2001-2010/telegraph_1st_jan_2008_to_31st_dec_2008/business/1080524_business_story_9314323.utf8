          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 23: The rate of inflation continued to hover at around 8 per cent amid concerns that it could breach the double-digit barrier as global crude prices reached a staggering $135 a barrel.        
	According to government data for the week ended May 10, the rate of inflation stood at a four-year-high of 7.8 per cent. However, it is a provisional figure.        
	The real rate of price rise is likely to be more than 8 per cent going by final inflation figures released by the government for the week ended March 15.         
	The updated data put it at 8.02 per cent against the provisional 6.68 per cent.        
	At this rate, inflation is likely to have touched the double-digit mark already.        
	Please be patient. We are watching the situation carefully. More steps will be taken as and when needed, said finance minister P. Chidambaram.        
	C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime ministers economic advisory council, said the rate of inflation would remain high for another three to four months but a good monsoon and grain purchases would help dampen pressures.        
	It may reach 5.5 per cent by the end of this fiscal, he said.        
	Current inflation has been caused by food and commodity prices. Contrary to the concerns expressed by FAO and the World Bank on a global food crisis, Chidambaram said the country had enough foodgrain in stock.

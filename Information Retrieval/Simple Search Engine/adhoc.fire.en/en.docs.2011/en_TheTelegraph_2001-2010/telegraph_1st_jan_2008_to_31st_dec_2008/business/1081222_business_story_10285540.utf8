The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank plea for home loan sop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bank plea for home loan sop
          JAYATI GHOSE                                              DREAM ABODE      
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Public sector banks are seeking an interest subsidy for home loans to the economically weaker sections.         
	They feel the rates on deposits are not sufficiently low to earn a profit by lending at the mandated 8.5 per cent interest to the sub Rs 5-lakh borrowers.        
	The chief executive officer of a PSU bank said the average cost of deposits at around 9 per cent was much higher than the lending rates. This is a recipe for disaster.        
	Last week, the government had announced a new home loan package. PSU banks will now offer 8.5 per cent on loans up to Rs 5 lakh and 9.25 per cent on loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. The rates are for new borrowers.        
	Sources said an interest subsidy of at least 1-1.5 percentage points was required to offset the damage which could be caused by offering such low rates.        
	The government is already extending a 3 per cent subsidy for short-term agriculture loans, while a similar support is being provided for export credit, said a senior executive with a Delhi-based public sector bank.        
	Analysts said with the average cost of deposit at 9 per cent and the need to have reserve requirements, the actual cost of funds worked out to at least 9.5 per cent.        
	The banks could lose 1 percentage point on loans of less than Rs 5 lakh and .25 percentage point on loans up to Rs 20 lakh.         
	The government may not be keen on the proposal as it does not wish to add to its mounting expenses.        
	Apart from lower rates, PSU banks have to bear the cost of free insurance cover promised in the package, meaning an upfront premium payment on each loan. Analysts said the cost of life insurance cover for loans up to Rs 20 lakh would be 0.25-0.40 per cent of the loan.         
	Besides, borrowers will have to make lower down payments. For loans up to Rs 5 lakh they are 10 per cent, while for loans up to Rs 20 lakh they are 15 per cent.         
	Deposit rate cuts        
	To avoid an earning mismatch, banks have started reducing their deposit rates.         
	On Saturday, the State Bank of India reduced its deposit rates as well as the prime lending rate.        
	Earlier, state-run Uco Bank and Indian Bank had reduced rates by over 1-1.5 per cent for loans across across various maturities.         
	The Union Bank of India has slashed deposit rates by 75-150 basis points, effective from January 1.         
	Punjab National Bank, too, slashed its rates by around 50-100 basis points on various maturities. PNB chairman and managing director K.C. Chakrabarty said, We may cut deposit and lending rates further. We will review the rates by month-end.         
	Newly appointed chief executive officer of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar said, The cost of funds is coming down gradually. Bulk deposit rates have fallen in the last two weeks. Thats why we will see deposit and lending rates coming down further.         
	While the government hopes to cash in on the package, among middle-class voters, the bankers are worried about the rising incidence of defaults.        
	According to the RBI, around Rs 34,420 crore of non performing assets were added during 2007-08.

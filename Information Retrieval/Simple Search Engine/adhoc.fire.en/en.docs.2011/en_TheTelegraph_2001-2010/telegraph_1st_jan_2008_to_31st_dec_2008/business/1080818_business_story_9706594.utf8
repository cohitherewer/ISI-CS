                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Q amp;A      Dear grandpa
                                I have retired from central government service in May this year. I want to keep some money in bank fixed deposits in the name of my grandson who is two years old. Will the interest accruing yearly or at the end of maturity be taxable in my hands, or will my son and daughter-in-law  the natural guardians be taxed?          G.P. Tripathy, Cuttack
                    y gift received from lineal ascendants or descendants of the family is not considered as income in the hands of the recipient and no income tax has to be paid by the recipient. But if the recipient is a minor, any income from investment of the gifted money will be clubbed with that of the parents whoever has higher income under Section 64 of the Income Tax Act. So, the parents have to pay the tax. However, if you gift shares of a company or units of equity-linked mutual funds, the capital gains wont attract any tax, provided the shares or units are not sold within 12 months from the date of transfer.                                     Right to information      I have enquired with the local post offices whether the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)is covered under Section 80C as reported by your newspaper. The post offices informed me that they havent received any circular on this. Two income tax advocates also told me that the scheme was not covered under Section 80C. Please clarify the position?        S.K. Basu, Calcutta
                    We were right in reporting that SCSS and five-year term deposits of post offices have been brought under Section 80C. It is unfortunate that the post offices as well as your income tax advocates are not updated about this. The release issued by the income tax department can be accessed through the following link: http://www.incometax-india.gov.in/archive/PressRelease_02012008.pdf.                      Tax heat      I have submitted the income tax return by computing the interest income from fixed deposits. I had submitted Form 15G to avoid double taxation of the interest income. Is it admissible?        Dipali Banerjee, Uttarpara
                    der the provisions of the income tax act, one should not submit Form 15G if ones income, after providing for various deductions available under Chapter VI, remains taxable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DoT rules to help cell firms cut cost
                                                                                                               DoT rules to help cell firms cut cost
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          MOVING AHEAD                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: The department of telecom (DoT) today finalised regulations permitting mobile operators to share active infrastructure, such as antenna and feeder cables, while restraining them from sharing spectrum.         
	The guidelines are aimed at reducing the costs of mobile operators, which should lead to lower tariffs and increase rural penetration.         
	Telecom operators said this would bring down their operating costs and speed up network rollouts.        
	Active infrastructure sharing can help operators save up to 50-60 per cent of their rollout expenses.        
	We believe this is yet another positive step by the government to improve the penetration of telecom services, particularly in rural areas. It will also provide the industry with an opportunity to bring down its operating costs and hasten network rollouts, said Manoj Kohli, president and CEO, Bharti Airtel.        
	He said the move would benefit the customer the most in terms of better quality and enhanced affordability.        
	 A Tata Teleservices spokesperson said the move would bring down the cost of network expansion, leading to a cut in call rates and greater penetration.        
	A DoT statement said: Active infrastructure sharing will be limited to antenna, feeder cable, node B, radio access network and transmission system only. Sharing of the allocated spectrum will not be permitted.        
	The government will amend provisions of the unified access service licence and the cellular mobile service providers licence to permit active infrastructure sharing.         
	Earlier, only the passive sharing of infrastructure was allowed by the DoT. Passive infrastructure comprises telecom towers, shelter an enclosure for housing network equipment  and generators for back-up in the case of power failures.        
	The guidelines are aimed at reducing the input costs of telecom access providers which the telecom ministry hopes will facilitate in reduced tariff and increased teledensity in rural areas, the DoT said.        
	Telecom analysts said infrastructure sharing would imply that new entrants, when allotted spectrum, could completely ride on the infrastructure of existing players and launch services within a short period of time.

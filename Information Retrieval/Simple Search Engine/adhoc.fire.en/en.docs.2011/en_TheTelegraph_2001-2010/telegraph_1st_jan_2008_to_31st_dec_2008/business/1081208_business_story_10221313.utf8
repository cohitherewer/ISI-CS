        Equity-linked savings schemes are still your best bet when it comes to saving taxes, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                              
	The merry season is round the corner, so is the season of tax investments. Amid the festivity, you have to sit down and do some serious number crunching.         
	If you are an investor who has seen his gains in stocks and mutual funds vanish into thin air, putting money again in tax-saving equity-linked schemes might seem risky. But even in this market, your best bet is mutual fund ELSS.     
	Better returns        
	Tax-saving investments come with a three-year lock-in for equity-related instruments such as equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) and unit-liked insurance plans (Ulips). For fixed-income assets such as NSC, PPF, bank fixed deposits, post office deposits and the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS), the lock-in is for five years.        
	If we compare the compounded annual returns (CAGR) of equity-linked savings schemes and fixed income tax savings instruments over a tenure of five years, equity-linked savings schemes have given much higher returns than any of the assured income schemes and this is despite an erosion of more than 50 per cent in the net asset value (NAV) of almost all equity-linked savings schemes in the past 12 months (see tables).   
	Worst may be over        
	Moreover, the NAVs seem to have touched the bottom and may not go down further. The net asset values of top 10 ELSS have (as on December 4, 2008) fallen by more than half of their 52-week highs and are currently close to their 52-week lows (see Table 1). Stock prices have slid back to levels where they were three years ago.         
	Mutual funds are slowly coming back with new funds. IDFC Mutual launched IDFC Tax Advantage Fund, an open-ended equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS), on December 1. The scheme closes for subscription on December 17.         
	Moreover, interest rates, both deposit and lending, are on their way down. On Saturday, the Reserve Bank of India reduced benchmark rates to improve credit availability in the system and foster economic growth.         
	Deposits pay less        
	With RBI cutting rates, commercial banks are likely to follow suit. Tax-saving deposits with a lock-in of five years will suffer. Banks will be keen to pay a 10 per cent interest rate on deposits of one to two years rather than pay the same on deposits for five to seven years.         
	Thus, you get a lower interest rate on tax-saving deposits with a longer term maturity of five years or more than normal fixed deposits.         
	The interest rate on tax- saving fixed deposits is lower also because of the benefits these provide under section 80c. Normal term deposits offer a higher interest rate as incentive in lieu of the tax benefit that tax-saving deposits offer.        
	Consumption push        
	When interest rates come down, consumption demand gets a boost as credit becomes cheaper. Lower lending rates reduce the cost of production and hence the prices of goods and services go down. Cheaper goods and services, in turn, foster consumption demand further. Companies find their sales and profitability going up. As the sales and profitability of companies go up, their share prices start rising faster. Thus, falling interest rates indicate rising equity prices.        
	Tax on maturity        
	The comparison of the rate of return between tax-saving equity-linked and fixed-income schemes do not reflect the true picture unless you consider the tax implication on the maturity proceeds of the investment. In case of fixed-income instruments only PPF does not attract any tax liability on maturity. The PPF amount on maturity is fully tax-exempt. The maturity amount in all other fixed-income schemes is taxable.        
	Investments in ELSS or Ulips after three years (the initial lock-in period) are entirely tax-exempt.         
	Thus, PPF is the only fixed income scheme that can be truly compared with ELSS. And, as the chart shows, ELSS has given a return nearly twice as high as that of PPF.         
	The post-tax (on maturity) return of other fixed income schemes would be much lower than the chart shows.         
	If you are in the highest tax bracket (30 per cent), your post-tax return would be the highest at 8 per cent in PPF among all other tax-saving fixed income schemes (which will have a post-tax return of 6.5 per cent and less).        
	Thus, divide your investments in instruments where the maturity amount is tax-exempt (PPF and ELSS) because then only you can maximise your post-tax return.

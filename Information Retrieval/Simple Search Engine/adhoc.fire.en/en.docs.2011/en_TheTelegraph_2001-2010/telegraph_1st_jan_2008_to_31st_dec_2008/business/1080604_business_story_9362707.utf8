          OUR BUREAU                          B.K. Modi: Close watch                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, June 3: Spice Communications, promoted by the BK Modi group, is open to Telekom Malaysia raising its stake to 74 per cent in the company. The mobile service provider is also considering a stake sale to a third party.        
	We have been approached by the UAE-based Etisalat, AT amp;T and NTT DoCoMo for a stake in the company, said B. K. Modi, chairman of Spice Communications.         
	He added that the company was okay with the idea of Telekom Malaysia partnering another foreign player to hike its stake in Spice.         
	Telekom Malaysia is reportedly in talks with potential stakeholders, including Idea Cellular. We do not have a formal offer from Idea yet. Maybe Telecom Malaysia is talking to them. Telekom Malaysia will have to be made part of any restructuring that we do in the company, Modi told The Telegraph.        
	Telekom Malaysia holds a 39.2 per cent stake in Spice, while Modi and his group company Modi Wellvest hold 40.8 per cent. The balance is held by the public and financial institutions.        
	Idea Cellular managing director Sanjeev Aga refused to comment on his companys interest in Spice.        
	Modi also indicated that his family could exit the company if they were offered good valuations and that the foreign holding in Spice could go up to 74 per cent, the foreign investment limit for domestic telecom firms. If there is a good offer, we may consider it. Currently, were in the process of working out various means of raising money to fund the companys expansion, he added.        
	At the companys annual general meeting today, the Spice board decided to raise the ceiling of borrowing to Rs 4,000 crore. The company has already reached its earlier borrowing limit fixed at Rs 750 crore with a provision to borrow another $120 million.        
	Market watchers said Spice could be a good fit for Idea Cellular, which is yet to start operations in the two circles of Punjab and Karnataka, where Spice operates.        
	However, they cautioned that acquiring the loss making company would put pressure on Ideas financials. Spice has been in talks with Idea in the past, but the deal didnt happen because both sides differed over valuations. However, given its financials, Spice is not in a position to bargain, said Harit Shah, telecom analyst at Angel Broking.

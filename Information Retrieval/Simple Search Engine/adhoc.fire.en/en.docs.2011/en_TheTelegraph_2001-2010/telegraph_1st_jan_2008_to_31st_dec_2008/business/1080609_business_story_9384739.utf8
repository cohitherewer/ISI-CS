The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Emami bid to ease Zandu tension
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Emami bid to ease Zandu tension
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, June 8: After scoring a major victory in the takeover tussle for Mumbai-based Zandu Pharmaceuticals on Friday, the Agarwals of Emami have held out an olive branch to the warring Parikh family.        
	The Agarwals said they were ready to work with the Parikhs, one of the Zandu promoters who are trying to thwart Emamis bid to gain control of the company.        
	Yes, we are ready to work with them. It is a question of taking the company forward and enhancing shareholder value, Harsh Agarwal, director of Emami, said.        
	His comments came soon after Emami successfully thwarted the attempt by the Parikhs to issue preferential shares to themselves to scupper the deal.        
	Emami bought into Zandu, which had a great brand recall for pain balm and other ayurvedic products, after another promoter group, the Vaidya family, sold their 24 per cent stake to it.        
	Emami has launched an open offer for another 20 per cent stake by offering to pay Rs 7,315 a share.        
	They bought the Vaidya familys stake at Rs 6,900 a share, which includes a non-compete fee of Rs 100 apiece.        
	Harsh Agarwal sounded confident that Emamis open offer would go through. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Zandu stock closed at Rs 9,976 a share on Friday, a good 36 per cent higher.        
	I would not like to comment on the existing stock price. It may not sustain. We are not thinking of revising the price now, he added.        
	He said the Parikhs had not indicated whether they wanted to remain in the company or tender shares in the open offer and exit.        
	Sources said there was a fair chance that the Parikhs might stay on and share the board room with the Agarwals.        
	Zandu shares spiked on May 31 when Emami announced that it was buying into the company by paying Rs 130 crore to the Vaidyas.         
	On May 30, the Zandu stock closed at Rs 7,012.85. Emami believes it has paid a fair price for Zandu.         
	The current price earning ratio of 48.95 is absurd and far higher than the peer group companies, sources close to Emami said.        
	The Zandu stock has a face value of Rs 100 and its equity base is pretty small. There are only 8,767 shareholders, and the total number of issued shares is 806,400.        
	The public shareholding is not scattered, and the bulk of the public shares is held by the family members of the Vaidyas and the Parikhs and their associates, even if they are not classified under the promoter group.        
	Financial institutions have a very little role to play as they have 1,478 shares, or 0.18 per cent of the Zandu equity.        
	Emami has bought all it could get from various Vaidya family members, some of whom may not be under the promoter group.        
	The Parikh family members and their associates will have to tender shares if the open offer is to sail through.        
	The open offer is likely to open on July 24 and close on August 12, subject to the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. As a result, there is time for Emami to revise the open offer price.

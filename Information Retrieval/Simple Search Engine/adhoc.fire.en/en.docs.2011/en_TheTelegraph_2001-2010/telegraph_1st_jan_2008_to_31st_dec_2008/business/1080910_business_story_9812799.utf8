  Three entities to run local operations          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Mumbai, Sept. 9: Anil Agarwal, the London-based tycoon who controls the $7-billion Vedanta group, is restructuring the mining and metal conglomerates operations in India into three commodity-specific entities.         
	Under the plan, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd will hold all the copper, zinc and lead assets that are now strewn across the group.         
	Madras Aluminium Company (Malco) will house the aluminium and energy operations. Sesa Goa will continue to manage the iron ore assets.         
	As a first step, Sterlite Industries will spin off its aluminium and energy assets to Malco, which will then be renamed as Sterlite Aluminium Ltd.         
	The restructuring process is expected to be completed by March next year after shareholders, stock exchanges, courts and regulators in India and the UK clear it.         
	The recast has been prompted by a need to unscramble cross holdings among group entities and eliminate conflicts of interest.         
	Sterlites equity holding in Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco), Vedanta Aluminium (VAL) and Sterlite Energy Ltd (SEL) will be passed on to Malco. VAL is the greenfield refining and smelting venture in Orissa.         
	The restructuring will help the Vedanta group rank among the worlds five largest aluminium producers by 2012 and become one of the top 10 producers of iron ore.        
	A share swap ratio formula has been worked out to protect the interests of the shareholders of Sterlite and Malco.         
	Under the formula devised by Grant Thornton India, the shareholders of Sterlite Industries will get seven shares of Malco for every four shares held. Malco shareholders will get one Sterlite share for every 51 held.         
	The groups equity holding in Hindustan Zinc Ltd, Copper Mines of Tasmania and Konkola Copper Mines in Zambia will be consolidated in Sterlite.         
	Vedanta will also transfer its 79.4 per cent equity holding in Konkola Copper Mines to Sterlite.         
	Sterlite will also own Asarco, the third largest copper producer in the US, when the $2.6-billion acquisition is sealed in the next two months. This is a done deal, Agarwal asserted even though Grupo Mexico has submitted a higher bid.         
	After the restructuring, the Vedanta group will see its aluminium production swell to 2.58 million tonnes a year from 395,000 tonnes, placing it behind London-based Rio Tinto, UC Rusal of Russia and Alcoa of the US.         
	Various analysts and investors have requested us to restructure our companies. We decided that Vedanta Plc will remain the holding company with three distinct umbrella companies under it, Agarwal said.         
	The group has drawn up a Rs 1,15,000-crore ($26 billion) investment programme. We have already invested Rs 40,000 crore. Another Rs 70,000 crore will be spent over the next three years, Agarwal said.         
	A large chunk of the investment ($9.8 billion) will be earmarked for the aluminium business. The group plans to create an annual smelting capacity of 2.6 million tonnes by 2012.         
	Sesa Goa will increase its iron ore production to 100 million tonnes in five years.         
	Reactions to the restructuring announcement were mixed. The Vedanta groups restructuring plan is a positive for the shareholders of the group entities. It will ensure better valuations for these companies with virtually no cross holdings or overlapping businesses, said Hitesh Agarwal, head of research at Angel Broking.         
	However, the stock markets hammered the Sterlite stock which plunged 7.5 per cent to close at Rs 628 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. One reason for this is that copper and zinc are not considered to be as profitable as aluminium and power. Malco shares surged 17.4 per cent to close at Rs 219.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reliance sets terms for local diesel sale
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukesh Ambani (right) with additional secretary (petroleum ministry) S. Sundareshan in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani is willing to sell diesel to state-owned oil marketing companies if the government sorts out taxation issues.        
	They (Reliance) have offered to sell diesel that the oil marketing companies need but want the taxation issue to be resolved. We are looking into it, said petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey, who held a meeting with Ambani today.        
	State-run companies and political parties have long complained that Reliance earns huge profit by exporting petrol and diesel. On the other hand, public sector oil retailers suffer heavy losses by selling fuels at subsidised rates here.        
	Mukesh, who is locked in a legal battle with younger brother Anil over the pricing of gas from the Krishna-Godavri basin, today also met finance minister P. Chidambaram and other senior ministers and bureaucrats, including cabinet secretary K. M. Chandrasekhar and revenue secretary P. V. Bhide.        
	Mukesh, however, did not reveal the details of these meetings.        
	According to petroleum ministry officials, Reliance is open to selling fuels within the country if taxes on domestic sales are lifted.        
	At present, Reliance pays only customs duty on crude that it imports for the Jamnagar refinery. The facility is an export-oriented unit, exempting Reliance from taxes on sales and income.        
	If Reliance sells diesel within the country, it will have to pay excise duty and income tax, in addition to customs duty.        
	In such a circumstance, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  the three state-run oil marketing companies  will have to pay Rs 2.85 per litre more if they buy diesel from Reliances Jamnagar refinery.        
	The government will, therefore, have to amend the laws so that neither Reliance pays extra tax nor the oil retailers pay more for fuels.        
	It is being examined if Reliances sales in the domestic tariff area can be given export status and the company continues to get income tax waiver.         
	A similar arrangement has been worked out in case of LPG, where Reliances sales to public sector oil companies are treated as exports.         
	During the current financial year, India will have to import 4.14mt of diesel to meet domestic shortfall.

	New Delhi, March 3: Union commerce minister Kamal Nath will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this week to discuss the plight of exporters bludgeoned by the appreciating rupee. 
    
	The Union budget this year failed to meet the expectations of exporters, who are counting losses because of the rupee rise. 
    
	However, trade data released today showed that the countrys exports grew 20.47 per cent in January and 21.62 per cent in the April-January period. In rupee terms, however, exports increased 7 per cent in January and 7.66 per cent in the ten-month period.
    
	Exports during the April-January period stood at $124.19 billion, $35.81 billion short of the $160-billion fiscal target with only two months to go before the financial year ends.
    
	We hope to achieve exports in the range of $150 billion to $155 billion this fiscal, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.
    
	Exports increased to $13.14 billion in January 2008 from $10.9 billion a year ago, while imports grew 63.57 per cent to $22.50 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $9.36 billion.
    
	Trade deficit for the 10-month period amounted to $67.4 billion, higher than the $45.7 billion registered in April-January 2006-07.
    
	The recommendations of neither the Rangarajan panel nor the Krishnamurthy committee have been considered in the budget. The commerce minister will meet the PM in the next few days, officials said.
    
	Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said exporters were hoping that the commerce minister would dole out relief in his foreign trade policy, which would be announced later this month. 
    
	Exports contribute about 14 per cent to the GDP, but it may not remain a viable economic activity if the problems are not addressed, he added.
    
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram in his budget speech had said the government had given relief to exporters in three tranches of over Rs 8,000 crore and Rs 8,351 crore in the form of the interest cost of market stabilisation bonds. 
    
	He said the government was sensitive to the needs of the export sector and would continue to respond sympathetically according to the situation.
    
	Exports to the US had slowed down in 2006 and 2007. A further slide is unavoidable, but it may be relatively modest. The slower economic growth in 2007-08, compared with 2005-06 and 2006-07, may also temporarily dampen capital inflows, the economic survey for 2007-08 had stated.
    
	Stating the need for some fundamental policy changes apart from relief measures already given, the survey suggested measures for merchandise trade. 
    
	The measures include continuation of reduction in customs duty, weeding out unnecessary customs duty exemptions, abolishing export schemes that are redundant with the fall in import duties and streamlining existing schemes.

	Mumbai, June 6: Market regulator Sebi today said a foreign institutional investor could raise debt of up to $200 million in India.        
	The government last month raised the cumulative limit for FII investment in corporate debts and government securities to $3 billion from $1.5 billion and to $5 billion from $3.2 billion, respectively.        
	Sebi today capped these investments at $200 million per registered entity.        
	The enhanced limits shall be allocated among the FIIs on a first come first served basis, subject to a ceiling of $200 million per registered entity, the market regulator said in a statement.        
	The decision to raise the FII limit for debt investment was taken by the government along with relaxing curbs on external commercial borrowings.

	Calcutta, July 21: Uco Bank will float a separate company to sell financial products such as insurance covers and mutual funds. At present, the public sector bank sells them as third-party products and earns a fee income.         
	While the new company will distribute insurance and mutual fund products that the bank sells now, Uco will concentrate on core banking. The company may later get into other financial services businesses such as insurance brokerage and merchant banking, said S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Uco Bank.        
	A separate company will ensure more fee-based income for the bank, Goel said, while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today.         
	The new entity will be set up with an initial capital of Rs 25 crore.         
	Uco Bank will hold a 49 per cent stake in the company, while 26 per cent will be held by a foreign partner. The remaining 25 per cent will be sold to a private bank or a corporate entity.         
	Uco Bank has appointed Ernst amp; Young to look for the foreign investor. We have given them the mandate to finalise the candidates by September-end, Goel said.         
	Lower profit forecast        
	Uco Bank expects a decline in profit for the April-June quarter of the current financial year. We have provided about Rs 130 crore for mark-to-market depreciation in the first quarter of the current financial year. This will pull down our profits, Goel said.        
	However, the bank has been able to make a cash recovery of Rs 180 crore from non-performing assets.

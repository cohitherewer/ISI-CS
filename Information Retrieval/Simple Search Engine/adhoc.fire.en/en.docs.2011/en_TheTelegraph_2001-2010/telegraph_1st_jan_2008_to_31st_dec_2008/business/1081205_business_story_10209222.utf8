The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mutuals to list close-ended funds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mutuals to list close-ended funds
          OUR BUREAU                                
	Mumbai/Calcutta, Dec. 4: Mutual funds will have to list all their close-ended funds, including fixed maturity plans (FMPs), on the stock exchanges.  
	Investors will be allowed to exit prematurely from these schemes by selling the units on the bourses.         
	Earlier, they could scoop their money out of a scheme after paying an exit fee.        
	Under the new rules, the tradeable units will still be in circulation and the mutual funds will no longer have to dip into their reserves or sell assets in order to pay off investors who wish to opt out of a scheme.        
	The decision, which was taken today by the Sebi board, caps the huge redemption pressure that mutual funds have been facing since October.        
	Earlier, asset management companies had the option of listing their close-ended schemes on the two stock exchanges  BSE and NSE.        
	The fixed maturity plan (FMP) segment has been witnessing massive redemption pressure, especially from companies. FMPs are close-ended debt schemes that invest in fixed income securities.        
	It was decided that no early exit will be allowed in any scheme of a mutual fund in the nature of a close-ended scheme. Plans that have been approved earlier but not yet launched will have to be amended accordingly. It will be obligatory for the asset management company to list the close-ended schemes, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave told reporters after a meeting of the Sebi board.        
	Fund houses welcomed Sebis decision. Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer of UTI AMC, said the decision would provide a degree of comfort to the mutual funds and also benefit investors who opt to stay invested in the scheme. This is because mutual funds had to sell their assets  often at depressed prices in a falling market  to meet the redemption pressure. This affected the net asset value (NAV) of the scheme.        
	The market regulator has decided to fix a structural flaw in the fixed maturity plans, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research.         
	The board decided that for such close-ended schemes the underlying assets will not have a maturity beyond the date on which the scheme expires.        
	Kumar said the new regulatory obligation would force fund managers to be more disciplined while building their portfolios.         
	Sebis move will make close-ended funds more transparent and investor friendly, added Bhattacharya.        
	For investors, the order will mean a compromise on the interim liquidity and NAV realisation as close-ended listed funds generally trade at a steep discount to their NAV.        
	In fact, mutual funds earlier used to list their close-ended schemes on stock exchanges to give investors a liquidity option. UTIs Mastershare, Morgan Stanleys Growth Fund (a 15-year close-ended equity scheme) are examples. But later, when mutual funds were allowed to amortise (deduct in equal instalments) their initial issue expenses over a period of five years, they started to offer an early exit option to investors from close-ended schemes by paying an exit fee.         
	However, some problems are expected. The FMPs ownership profile makes them unsuitable for listing, said Dhirendra Kumar.         
	A very large number of FMPs serve a fairly limited pool of investors. Under the circumstances, the existence of a liquid market for any individual FMP is unlikely. For all practical purposes, the Sebi order strips the FMPs of their feature of premature encashment. Investors will now have to approach FMPs as investments that have a genuine lock-in, he added.         
	Rights issues        
	The market regulator has also decided to extend the validity of the approval letter it hands out for public and rights issues from three months at present to a year.        
	So, a company can wait for a year before a flotation if it finds the market isnt receptive to public issues. However, companies will have to file an updated document with Sebi if there are any changes in the prospectus.        
	The market regulator also cleared a proposal under which shareholders with demat accounts could receive their rights shares in an electronic form. It also ruled that the issuer could gain access to issue proceeds only after the allotment was finalised.        
	The policy measures approved by the board along with those undertaken in the recent past for reduction in timelines, are expected to streamline the rights issue process, Bhave added.

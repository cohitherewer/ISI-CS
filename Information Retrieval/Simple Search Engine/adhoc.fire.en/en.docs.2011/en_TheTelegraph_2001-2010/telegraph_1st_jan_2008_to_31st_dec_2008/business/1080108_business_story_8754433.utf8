	Calcutta, Jan. 7: New Delhi-based Marc Sanitation Pvt Ltd is planning to sell sanitaryware, such as wash basins, bathtubs and other clay-based bathroom fittings, imported from Spain and other European countries. 
    
	So far we have been manufacturing faucets from our three plants in Delhi, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. By the end of next year, well start trading in imported sanitaryware to expand our product portfolio, said Sanjay Khanna, chairman and managing director of Marc Sanitation. 
    
	Demand for bathroom fittings has witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of more than 30 per cent because of the rise in residential housing, hospitality and commercial properties. 
    
	Given the countrys annual economic growth rate of between 8 and 9 per cent, the market for bathroom fittings will grow at an average annual rate of at least 25-27 per cent for the next few years. We want to offer our customers a whole gamut of bathroom and kitchen fittings, Khanna said.

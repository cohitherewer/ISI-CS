	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Premium rates for general insurance products are unlikely to come down further. 
    
	The premium rates have started stabilising at their pre-January levels and it is quite unlikely that they will come down, K.N. Bhandari, secretary general of the General Insurance Council, said at a meeting here today. 
    
	Till December 2006, the premium rates for general insurance products, excluding marine cargo and medical insurance, were fixed by the tariff advisory committee. From January 1, 2007, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) allowed non-life insurers to determine the rates, but had put a 51.25 per cent cap on the discount that could be offered. 
    
	However, from January 1 this year, this pricing restriction was also removed. This means that insurers are now free to fix the rates for general insurance products. 
    
	It was expected that the move would lead to a rate-cut war as was the case in 1994 when post detariffing, insurers started charging extremely low premiums for marine cargo insurance.
    
	Though there were stray incidents of insurers giving 70 to 80 per cent discounts, overall the premium rates have started stabilising. Insurers have already slashed their premium rates since January last year. Beginning this year, there is no rate reduction, said G. Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of United India Insurance Company Ltd. 
    
	According to V. Ramaswamy, chairman and managing director of National Insurance Company, Premium rates have already come down by 40 to 50 per cent in the last calendar year. 
    
	The expectation of a further reduction in premiums is out of place. After all, insurers cant reduce the premium to an extent that erodes their ability to pay claims. Neither the council nor the regulator would want this situation, Bhandari said. However, a truly detariffed regime is likely to be kicked off from April this year when insurers will be allowed to plan the terms of their policies. 
    
	Then you can see insurers charging a higher premium rate for, say, a red car than a black car, which is less likely to be stolen. A judge who uses a car for commuting between his or her residence and court may be charged a lower premium than a salesperson who is most of the time on wheels, Bhandari said.
    
	More commission
    
	The General Insurance Council will soon submit its recommendation to IRDA for increasing the commission of agents in the general insurance business . 
    
	The growth in the general insurance market is sluggish and it was agreed in todays meeting that the role of agents must be increased, Bhandari said. Members in the meeting highlighted the structural deficiencies in the agents commissions. It was suggested that the agents should be given more incentives and training. We are going to submit our recommendations to the IRDA panel set up in September, he added.
    
	Only 45,000 new agents joined the general insurance business last year compared with 7 lakh in the life insurance segment, Bhandari said.

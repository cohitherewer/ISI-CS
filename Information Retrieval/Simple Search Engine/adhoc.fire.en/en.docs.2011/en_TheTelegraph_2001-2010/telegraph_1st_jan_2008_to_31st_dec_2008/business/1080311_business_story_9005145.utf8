The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | No crude respite for IOC
                                                                                                               No crude respite for IOC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 10: Indian Oil Corporation today said it was suffering losses of Rs 180 crore per day by selling fuel below cost, sparking off a fresh debate if the government should hike fuel price once again.        
	A marginal rise in the prices of petrol and diesel last month provided some cushion to oil companies, but the surge in the global crude oil prices, which is around $105 a barrel now, seems to be affecting the marketing margins of Indian oil firms.        
	IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the hike in crude prices was narrowing down the marketing margins of the company and could affect its capital expenditure.        
	Despite the rise in crude prices, the government is unlikely to consider another round of rate hike at this juncture, especially after presenting a pro-people budget, including a massive farm loan waiver. Any hike in fuel prices would impact the rate of inflation, which has registered an upward trend and is near a 10-month high of 5.02 per cent, higher than the RBI projection of 5 per cent for this fiscal.         
	Officials said, The surge in crude prices should not be a worry as the government has already taken care of the under-recoveries estimated to accrue this fiscal. The recent hike should provide some cushion to oil companies in the next fiscal also.        
	While increasing the price of petrol by Rs 2 a litre and diesel by Rs 1 per litre on February 14, the government decided to issue bonds to cover 57 per cent of the total under-recoveries, from the current 42.7 per cent.        
	The government has so far issued bonds worth Rs 11,953 crore, according to the revised budgetary estimates. The total under-recoveries from petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG are estimated at Rs 71,808 crore for the current fiscal.        
	Even after the hike, oil firms said they were losing Rs 9.58 per litre on petrol, Rs 12.21 on diesel, Rs 20.95 on kerosene and Rs 303.66 on each LPG cylinder.

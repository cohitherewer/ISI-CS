          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          EIH chairman P.R.S. Oberoi (centre) with joint MD (development) Arjun Oberoi (left) and joint MD (operations) Vikram Oberoi in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture.                                   
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: EIH Ltd will pursue multiple tie-ups with real estate companies to develop new hotels in India.        
	While the prospective allies will own the properties, EIH, which owns and runs the Oberoi and the Trident hotels, will manage them.        
	EIHs strategy is in line with the policy followed by many of its global peers  DLF tied up with Hilton, with whom EIH had a tie-up, while Emaar MGF had joined hands with Accor, InterContinental and Marriott.        
	They have the land. They want to own the property. We want to manage it, P. R. S. Oberoi, chairman of EIH Ltd, said.         
	He clarified that the company was not keen on any exclusive arrangement.         
	We should look at as many tie-ups as possible. To begin with, some two or three may happen, he said after the 58th annual general meeting of the company.         
	Internationally, hotel chains hardly own any real estate. They specialise in management contracts. In India, hotel majors traditionally own properties.        
	EIH would, however, continue to build hotels on its own where it had land. For instance, it will develop one hotel each in Bangalore and Goa at an investment of about Rs 650 crore.        
	Two-brand strategy        
	EIH plans to take Trident hotels to the international market. Oberoi said the first stop for the brand could be West Asia.         
	While EIH Ltd will grow the Oberoi brand, EIH Associated Hotels Ltd will nurture the Trident.        
	PRS said no foreign tie-up would be pursued for the Trident. Its alliance with Hilton came to an end in March after the international chain joined hands with DLF. I think we can market Trident ourselves. We do not need any international alliance, he said.        
	The group plans to open 10 hotels in the next three years, mostly on a management contract basis. We shall add 2,300 rooms in India and abroad, he said. The 436-room Trident at Bandra Kurla in Mumbai will open for business in January next year.        
	Oberoi indicated that a Trident hotel might come up in Calcutta where the group has its oldest property, the Oberoi Grand. It is expected to be a multi-use entity. Though land has been identified, the deal is yet to be signed. Trident will manage the hotel, while the real estate partner will own the property.        
	ITC stake        
	Oberoi said ITCs holding in EIH was not a cause for worry for the existing promoters. We have an over 46 per cent stake. We plan to raise it further, he said.

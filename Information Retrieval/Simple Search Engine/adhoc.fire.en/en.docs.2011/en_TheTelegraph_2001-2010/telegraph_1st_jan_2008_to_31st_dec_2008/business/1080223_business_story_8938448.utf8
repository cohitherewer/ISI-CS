	Calcutta, Feb. 22: Dell, which is known for its direct selling model, is considering other third party channels of distribution in India.        
	We are in a process of transition and expect incremental business growth from this new distribution channel. The company will engage in partnerships required to leverage and supplement the variety of products across segments, said Pallab Talukdar, director (enterprise business), Dell India Pvt Ltd.        
	Talukdar was speaking on the sidelines of Infocom 2007-08.        
	Tamil Nadu plant        
	The company has invested around $30 million over five years in its manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu. The plant will start manufacturing notebooks in the next few months.        
	Talukdar said as Dell supplied only on confirmed orders through direct selling till date, it made manufacturing notebooks in India viable.

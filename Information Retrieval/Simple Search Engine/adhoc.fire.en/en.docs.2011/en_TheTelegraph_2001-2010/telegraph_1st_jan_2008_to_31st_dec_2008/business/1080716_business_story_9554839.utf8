          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 15: Inorbit Malls (India) Pvt Ltd, a K Raheja company, is exploring options in the city for expansion.        
	We are interested in the eastern region but given the current inflationary situation, we are planning our expansion very carefully. We term our malls as urban lifestyle centres. So, a proper catchment area is of great importance, said Kishore Bhatija, CEO of Inorbit Malls, on the sidelines of a retail summit organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	The group, which owns retail brands such as Shoppers Stop, Hypercity and Crossword, is exploring two new formats  an open mall format and a bridge to luxury format  under the Inorbit banner.        
	We will build an open mall at our second location in Pocharam, Hyderabad. The mall will not have any central airconditioning. The individually air-conditioned outlets will have scaled down prices of national and international brands, said Bhatija. This format has been named The Village.        
	The operating costs for such malls are lower and the first one will be spread across 400,000 square feet.        
	The bridge to luxury format is still at the planning stage, Bhatija said. The format will be incorporated in one of the malls being set up by Inorbit. At present, Inorbit has one mall in Mumbai. It is setting up eight more malls across the country. Inorbit is investing Rs 1,400 crore in these malls, which would be operational in one-and-a-half years.

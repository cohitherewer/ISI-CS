          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bandyopadhyay in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 7: Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Money plans to raise around Rs 240 crore by selling part of its equity in Riyada Reliance Money, its wholly owned subsidiary in Saudi Arabia.         
	Riyada Reliance Money was formed a month ago with an initial capital of Rs 10 crore to take up the stock broking and financial product distribution businesses in West Asia, said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, director and CEO, Reliance Money Ltd.        
	We are now planning to raise around 200 million Saudi Arabian riyal (approximately Rs 240 crore) by diluting Reliance Moneys 74 per cent stake in the subsidiary to global institutional investors on a private placement basis, he said. Reliance Money will continue to hold a 26 per cent share in the Riyadh-based company.        
	According to Bandyopadhyay, Riyada Reliance Money has secured a membership licence from the Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange and has applied to the Capital Market Authority in Saudi Arabia for licences to enter financial product distribution, advisory and stock broking on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange.         
	Reliance Money is also looking for a suitable acquisition in West Asia in the money changing business. We may acquire a money changing company in the Gulf region in a span of one year, Bandyopadhyay said.        
	Reliance Money is planning to grow its money changing and money transfer businesses in a big way.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 22: The TCS stock was mauled on the market today  plunging 11 per cent to Rs 887.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)  after the countrys largest software exporter reported its first quarter-on-quarter decline in profits in the last three years.        
	Net profit in the quarter ended March 31 fell by 6.17 per cent over the December quarter to Rs 1245 crore, deepening worries about the impact of a US slowdown on infotech companies in India.        
	The negative outlook for TCS sparked a bad hair day for other infotech firms with Infosys and Wipro tumbling by 3 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.         
	If Infosys set a positive trend at the IT and software counters with its robust fourth quarter results, TCS pooped the party with its disappointing numbers.        
	The TCS stock fell primarily because of the results, which were well below the market expectations. The result has also dampened the sentiments for other IT stocks, said Rishi Maheshwari of Centrum.         
	The volume growth of TCS at 4.8 per cent was also lower than our expectations. A 1.1 per cent decline in margin was also a surprise as the rupee did not appreciate much during the fourth quarter. We expect Infosys and TCS to achieve a revenue growth of about 20 per cent in the current financial year, said Anurag Purohit of Religare.

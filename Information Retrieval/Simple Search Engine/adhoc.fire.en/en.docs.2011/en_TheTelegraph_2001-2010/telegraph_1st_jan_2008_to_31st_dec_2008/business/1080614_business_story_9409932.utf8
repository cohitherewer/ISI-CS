	Calcutta, June 13: Philips Electronics India Ltd has offered to buy back the shares of its minority shareholders. It will then become a wholly owned subsidiary of promoter company Koninklijke Philips Electronics.        
	Koninklijke holds a 96.5 per cent stake in Philips Electronics.The board has earmarked Rs 180 crore to buy back the shares at a price of Rs 260 a piece. Minority shareholding comprises 3.5 per cent, or 25 lakh shares, of the company.         
	We have reserves of Rs 605.7 crore and before considering the buyback, we have factored in the capital required for organic and inorganic growth. Cash lying idle in the balance sheet is not healthy, said Murali Sivaraman, CEO of Philips Electronics.Sivaraman said Philips planned to focus on three major segments for India  lighting, consumer lifestyle and healthcare. We are also open to partnerships and joint ventures which will help us across all three segments, he added.

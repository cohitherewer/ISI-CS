The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel curb puts export target under cloud
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel curb puts export target under cloud
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, April 13: The withdrawal of incentives on the export of steel may cost the country close to $5 billion in foreign exchange earnings.         
	India exported around 4.5 million tonnes (mt) of steel last year compared with an import of 6mt.        
	Restrictive measures at home had encouraged many steel companies to go for export.        
	The export curb on steel announced in the Foreign Trade Policy on Friday is aimed at increasing the availability of the product in the local markets and bring down prices.        
	This comes at a time when the commerce ministry has set a target of raising export to $200 billion from $160 billion in 2007-08.        
	Industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India said the target was steep. A strong rupee against the dollar along with the removal of incentives on steel and the ban on cement export make commerce minister Kamal Naths ambitious target very challenging.        
	Prices of benchmark hot-rolled coil  a type of steel  in the European markets are hovering around $1,000 a tonne on an ex-factory basis, higher than the domestic price of around $800-850 a tonne.        
	The gap between domestic and international prices has widened after the Indian government put pressure on domestic companies to check prices.         
	Raw material cost        
	Steel companies could have made a much higher margin from the export market where prices would firm up on the back of rising raw material costs, an industry observer said.        
	The Centre, however, did nothing to curb the booming iron ore export.        
	It also did not withdraw the 5 per cent duty on the import of coking coal, whose price has risen by as much as 200 per cent.        
	Coking coal is mostly imported. Iron ore, on the other hand, is sold at international prices in the domestic market and the government has not taken steps to increase its local supply.        
	Double trouble        
	While key raw materials have been left untouched and pressure mounts on finished products, companies such as Essar Steel and Ispat are in a greater trouble.        
	These two integrated steel players use natural gas as feedstock. They are getting a lower allocation of gas from the government than the contracted quantity, forcing them to buy gas from the spot market.         
	The price of the contracted gas has also been increased from $4 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) to $7 per mBtu by the government. On the spot market, they are forced to buy at $17-19 per mBtu.        
	There is huge cost pressure on us, an Essar Steel official said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pfizer judges Ranbaxy merit
          KAKOLY CHATTERJEE                           Tough choice                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: Pfizer Indias reported bid for Ranbaxy might not be a profitable one for the US- based drug giant in the long run though the buyout could be easily funded by profits from the sale of its drug Lipitor, which is facing the heat from Ranbaxys generic version.         
	US-based Pfizer is believed to be keen to take over Ranbaxy as it is in the midst of a battle with the Indian firm in around 18 countries to retain the patent rights for Lipitor, the worlds largest selling cholesterol drug, with sales of over $12 billion. Pfizer wants to prevent the Indian company from launching low cost generic versions of Lipitor in most of these countries. Last week, Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo had said it would acquire 50.1 per cent of Ranbaxy for $4.6 billion.        
	However, the patent rights held by Pfizer for Lipitor end in most countries by 2011. This poses a problem for the company as the costly Ranbaxy buy will bring benefits vis--vis Lipitor for a mere three years at the most. In the long run the benefits of owning a generic drug maker, which has a copy of Lipitor would be negated, analysts said. Analysts, however, argued that profits from the three-year global monopoly of Lipitor could well pay for the takeover of Ranbaxy.         
	The profits from Lipitor would be enough to buy out a significant stake in Ranbaxy, said Sudatta Sen, an independent market analyst.         
	The buyout could also create its own problems of management. According to Sujay Shetty, associate director, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) may sell their shares to Pfizer if they get a high price. Even if Pfizer manages to acquire majority shares from the market as well as from the FIIs it doesnt make much sense for the company to lock horns with the promoter Singhs and the top management of Ranbaxy.         
	Pfizer will not want a stressful relationship with the management. It will want to run the company smoothly at the end of the day, he said. Pfizer remained non-committal over the issue of a hostile takeover of Ranbaxy. Christopher Loder, spokesperson of Pfizer said, We do not comment on market rumours and speculation.

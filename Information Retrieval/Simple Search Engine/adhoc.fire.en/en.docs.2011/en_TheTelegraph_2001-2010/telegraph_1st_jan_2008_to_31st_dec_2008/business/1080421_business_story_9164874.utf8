        MFs are a safe way to get out of the tax tangle. Subhash Lakhotia checks out the benefits                                            
	Mutual funds are currently a favourite with investors. Its a convenient investment option for those who may find it difficult to keep track of the changes in the equity market.        
	Mutual funds also offer better tax advantages, especially the equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS). Within an investment cap of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, a person can invest as much as he likes in an ELSS.         
	Moreover, this investment can be made out of any fund available with the taxpayer as there is no compulsion these days to invest in ELSS only out of the income of a particular financial year.        
	Tax-free dividends        
	A big advantage of investing in mutual funds is that under section 10 (35) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, dividends earned from a scheme registered with Sebi is exempt from income tax. This is applicable for all categories of taxpayers. Hence, the after-tax yield to the investor is higher compared with other instruments in the market.        
	Capital gains tax        
	If units of non-equity funds, namely mutual funds investing in debt, government securities as well as in equities to some extent, are sold after a lock-in period of more than 12 months, there is a tax relief of 20 per cent on long-term capital gains after making appropriate adjustments for cost inflation index.         
	If one chooses not to take advantage of the cost inflation index, then the concession will be only 10 per cent.         
	In the case of mutual funds investing in shares, there is zero tax liability on long-term capital gains, while the tax rate will be 15 per cent for short-term capital gains.        
	Gift delight        
	Mutual fund units can be a good gift for ones friends. Any amount received from non-relatives in excess of Rs 50,000 in a financial year is added to the total income of the recipient.         
	Mutual fund units are the only exception. Hence, one can safely receive mutual fund units from non-relatives with no tax liability.        
	However, a person should avoid gifting them to ones spouse and daughter-in-law as under section 64 of the Income Tax Act, the amount will be clubbed with his/her income.        
	Loan advantage        
	Various loans are now available for buying shares and mutual fund units.         
	The amount of tax to be deducted depends on the extent to which the loan is used. In most cases, taking a loan by pledging ones mutual fund units as a security offers no tax benefit.        
	An investor cannot claim a deduction on the interest paid from the dividends earned from units bought with the loan.         
	This is because dividend income is not included in the total taxable income.        
	Long-term capital gains are also tax-exempt. Thus, if a loan is taken to buy mutual funds, there is no tax advantage on the interest paid for the loan.        
	However, one can deduct the interest paid from capital gains from income and balanced funds, which have less than 65 per cent in equity. This can provide additional fillip to ones effective returns from investments in non-equity funds.

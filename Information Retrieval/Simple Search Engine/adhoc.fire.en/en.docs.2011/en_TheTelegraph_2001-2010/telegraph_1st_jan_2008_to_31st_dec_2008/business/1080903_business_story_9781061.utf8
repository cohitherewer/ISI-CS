          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The government will study ways to help small exporters who have been hit by losses arising out of their attempts to hedge foreign exchange operations through forward contracts.        
	We met finance minister P. Chidambaram today. He has promised to forward the memorandum to the Reserve Bank of India to look into the grievances of the exporters, Raja M. Shanmugam, president of the Forex Derivative Consumers Forum, said here today.        
	With the rupee fluctuating against the dollar, the attempt of small exporters to hedge their forex risks resulted in huge losses, which they need to settle with their bankers.         
	Members of the forum are prepared to refund the profit earned, if any, from these exotic derivative products and the banks are requested not to claim the losses suffered, said the memorandum submitted to the minister.        
	Chidambaram reportedly told the exporters that the government could not interfere directly, as the matter involved private and foreign banks, but would refer the issue to the central bank.         
	The exporters claimed that they were lured into entering derivatives contracts by banks to hedge foreign currency losses and were not informed that these contracts are purely speculative and ... has the inherent potential to result in enormous loss.        
	The memorandum further said exporters were faced with hundreds of crores of losses, which could result in the shutting down of several units.        
	India has set a target to more than triple its share in world trade to 5 per cent by 2020 from 1.5 per cent now. For the current fiscal, the country plans to export goods worth $200 billion.

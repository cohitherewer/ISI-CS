          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Cash Course                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: The Indian investor is coming of age.         
	After the global market meltdown, over 33 per cent of Indias wealthy investors are keen to shovel their money into markets abroad over the next 12 months, says a global study carried out by Barclays Wealth along with Economist Intelligence Unit.         
	Over 2,300 high net worth investors with investible assets ranging from 500,000 to 30 million were interviewed for the study titled Breaking the mould: a question of personality to gauge investor behaviour in troubled times.         
	Although the investors showed a strong home bias in their choice of markets (with 65 per cent of investors currently investing in their home markets), over 33 per cent said they were planning to invest in global markets in the coming 12 months.         
	By examining the choices made during periods of volatility, were trying to understand the investor mindset at such times and explore the characteristics which lead them to make those choices. Its clear that wealthy investors react differently to volatile market conditions and their willingness to take risks remains largely intact, said Satya Narayan Bansal, chief executive of Barclays Wealth in India.         
	According to the findings of the study, 40 per cent investors said they were willing to increase the level of risk in their portfolio, indicating their long-term confidence and viewing the downturn as an opportunity. Surprisingly, over 34 per cent of investors said they would increase the allocation in equities even in volatile markets.         
	When quizzed how they would react to market upheavals, around 30 per cent said they were likely to switch their fund managers, showing a propensity for direct action.         
	However, with domestic stock markets having performed poorly in recent months, 42 per cent of the respondents said they planned to increase their allocation to cash in turbulent times.         
	Property remains an interesting investment option for 48 per cent of the respondents.        
	Our more sophisticated property investors are looking for attractive real estate investments across the globe, especially in London, West Asia and eastern Europe. Our global presence enables us to support them, said Bansal.         
	Barclays push         
	Barclays Wealth is ramping up its presence in India. The UKs leading wealth manager will formally launch a wealth advisory service in Mumbai in the fourth quarter of 2008.         
	A team of 57 people has been appointed, which will go up to over 100 in the next six to eight months. Were opening offices in Delhi and Bangalore by the end of 2008 and will take our services to Calcutta and Chennai immediately afterwards, said Bansal.         
	The company will provide private wealth advisory services to onshore investors in India, including the promoters of large corporations as well as small and medium enterprises.         
	Barclays Wealth has invested over $400 million in building product and infrastructure capabilities globally, including India, since 2006.

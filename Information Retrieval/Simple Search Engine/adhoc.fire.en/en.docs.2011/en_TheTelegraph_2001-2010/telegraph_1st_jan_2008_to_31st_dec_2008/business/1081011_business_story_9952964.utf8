   ICICI fails to talk up stock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 10: ICICI Bank today came out with its third statement in as many weeks to soothe the nerves of frazzled investors but it had no effect on the stock which plummeted 20 per cent to close at Rs 359.75.        
	The ICICI Bank share has been one of the worst affected in the current crisis sweeping across global equity markets.        
	During intra-day trades today, the scrip touched a new 52-week low of Rs 326.70. Its close marks a fall of 75 per cent from a peak of Rs 1,465 attained on January 14.        
	ICICI Bank has adequate rupee liquidity in the context of the current environment. ICICI Bank also has liquidity of Rs 12,000 crore in its overseas subsidiaries. The bank has never used rupee funds for its international growth initiatives, said Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director and CFO of the bank.        
	Analysts said the stock had plunged because of fears that there could be more bad news about its exposures to troubled banks overseas.        
	First it was their exposure to derivative instruments, and then came the Lehman announcement. There is a fear that there may be more negative news coming. Tomorrow, some other bank could go bankrupt overseas and for all you know, ICICI Bank could have some relationship with it, said an analyst with a foreign brokerage who did not wish to be named.        
	He said that pressure on the stock could continue till the declaration of its second-quarter results where there could be greater clarity.        
	Observers also felt that the drop in its share price should also be seen in the context of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulling out of the country.         
	FIIs hold around 39 per cent of the ICICI equity and it is felt that these investors could have sold some shares of the private bank as well in the recent past.        
	Last month, ICICI Bank said it might have to make an additional provision of $28 million after providing $12 million for its investment in senior bonds issued by Lehman. These investments were made by its UK subsidiary, ICICI Bank UK Plc.         
	ICICI Bank Plc has invested 57 million euros (around $80 million) in the senior bonds of Lehman Brothers.

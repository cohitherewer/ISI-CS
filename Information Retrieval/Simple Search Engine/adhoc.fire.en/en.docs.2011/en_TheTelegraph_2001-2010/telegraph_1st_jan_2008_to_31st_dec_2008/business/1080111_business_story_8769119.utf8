     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 10: SBI Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between the State Bank of India and Cardiff SA of France, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) by March 2009. 
    
	Two months ago, the insurer had initiated an exercise to arrive at an internal valuation. 
    
	According to U.S. Roy, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Life, The IPO process, including the appointment of an external agency to carry out the valuation of the company, will be undertaken once our promoters okay the flotation. 
    
	He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an insurance conference organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today. Current regulations of the Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority require a life insurance company to be in existence for 10 years and profitable for three consecutive years to come out with a public issue. 
    
	As of now, we are compliant with the requirements for a flotation and are waiting to get a go-ahead from the promoters. The issue may get delayed because the Reserve Bank of India has not yet announced its guidelines for forming a holding company of non-banking subsidiaries of banks, Roy said. 
    
	SBI Life will also require additional capital of Rs 200-250 crore by March this year to support its growth plans. The money will be pumped in by the promoters before the end of the current financial year, Roy said. 
    
	Max New York Life plans
    
	Max India and New York Life are looking at extending their partnership beyond life insurance to areas such as asset management, banking, non-banking financial services and distribution of financial products.
    
	Max New York Life Insurance managing director and CEO Gary R. Bennett said, We have listed 43 initiatives outside the life insurance business that can be considered by both the partners.

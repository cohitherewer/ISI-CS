	Calcutta, Sept. 2: Trading in exchange traded interest rate futures may take off in this financial year itself.        
	According to Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave, the market regulator has set up a joint committee with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to study the technical aspects of trading.         
	It is the same committee that did the technical studies for currency futures. Though the committee has not been given any deadline to submit its report on interest rate futures, we expect that it will be quicker than the time taken for launching currency futures.         
	The guidelines for currency futures were issued in the first week of March this year and its trading was introduced in the last week of August. In interest rate futures, it will take less time. However, we dont have a fix on the date when interest rate futures will be launched, Bhave told reporters on the sidelines of an interactive session with the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	Interest rate futures are used to hedge future volatility. To start with, these exchange traded contracts will have 10-year government bond yield as the underlying asset and all interest rate futures contracts will be settled through physical delivery.        
	The RBI had constituted a technical committee on interest rate futures. The committee had recommended the introduction of other government securities as underlying assets at a later date after gaining some experience with 10-year government securities.         
	The panel has also recommended that a transaction in interest rate futures should be exempted from the securities transactions tax.         
	There is a need to quickly launch cross-regulatory products, Bhave said, adding that the ability of regulators to co-operate would be needed more in the future.        
	Attempts to introduce trading in interest rate futures had been made before. In 2003, the National Stock Exchange tried to launch the instrument, while in 1999, the RBI had tried to introduce over-the-counter futures.         
	Bhave said Sebi would soon issue guidelines for a SME (small and medium enterprise) exchange.         
	The regulator would discuss the grading of initial public offers at its next meeting.

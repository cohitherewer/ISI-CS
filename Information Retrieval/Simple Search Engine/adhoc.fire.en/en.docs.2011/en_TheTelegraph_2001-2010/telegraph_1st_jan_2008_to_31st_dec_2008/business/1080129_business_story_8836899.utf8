The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank, auto put brakes on slide
                                                                                                            Bank, auto put brakes on slide
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: Stock markets today lost nearly 209 points over concerns of a global economic slowdown and feeble Asian markets.         
	Before settling at 18152.78, the 30-share sensex tumbled 770 points from its intra-day high of 18213.21 to a low of 17443.29. It later recovered after buying emerged in auto and bank stocks on hopes of a cut in key interest rates by the central bank tomorrow.        
	The broader market index at the National Stock Exchange, Nifty, also shed 109.25 points to close at 5274.10.         
	The market took negative cues from other Asian indices which went down sharply in the morning over concerns of a recession in the US economy and the ongoing sub-prime crisis, said Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking.         
	There is no fundamental weakness in the Indian stocks at present. But the volatility is certainly going to continue during the week, and the future course will possibly depend on the Reserve Bank and the Fed, Agrawal added.        
	The benchmark indices at other Asian markets ended in the red with the Hang Seng losing the most. Japans Nikkei dropped by about 4 per cent while the Nasdaq and the S amp;P lost about 1.5 per cent each.         
	Led by IT heavyweights Wipro and Infosys, which fell by over 5 per cent each on fears that the rupee was headed for a further appreciation against the dollar, the sensex suffered a loss of 1.14 per cent.

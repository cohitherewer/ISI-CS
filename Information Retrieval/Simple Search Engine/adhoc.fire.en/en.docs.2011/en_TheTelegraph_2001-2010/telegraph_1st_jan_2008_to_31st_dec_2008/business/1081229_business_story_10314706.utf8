                                I pay monthly interests on an education loan I had taken for my daughter from a nationalised bank. Can I claim deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act on the amount paid as tuition fees in addition to the deduction allowed under Section 80E for interest repayment on the loan?          Manoj Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta
                    Education loan repayment is deductible under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act. The deduction will apply only on loans taken for higher education. The educational loan should be for either an individuals or his/her relatives higher studies.           Higher education here means full-time studies for any graduate or post-graduate course in medicine, engineering, or management, or post-graduate courses in applied sciences or pure sciences, including mathematics and statistics.           The amount eligible for deduction is the interest component of the loan repayment. This deduction is available for a maximum period of eight assessment years beginning in the year in which the interest is first paid. So, you can claim deductions under both Section 80C (on tuition fees) and Section 80E if your daughter is pursuing any of the courses mentioned above.                                  Filing returns      My daughter has a PAN card. But she doesnt have taxable income though she is employed. Will she have to file income tax return?        Debabrata Paul, Calcutta
                    g of income tax return is mandatory if a persons annual income is higher than the basic exemption limit. The basic exemption limit of income for women is             Rs 1,80,000 a year. If your daughter earns less than this she wont have to file any income tax return.                                   Income from gifts       Is the gift amount received from a relative as specified in the Income Tax Act taxable in the hands of the recipient?        A.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta
                    Gifts received from close relatives as specified in the Income Tax Act are not taxable. But any income earned from investment of the gifted amount will be included into the total annual income of the recipient.

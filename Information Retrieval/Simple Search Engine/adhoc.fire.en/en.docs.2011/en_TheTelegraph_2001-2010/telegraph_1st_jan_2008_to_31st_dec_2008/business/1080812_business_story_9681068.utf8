	Calcutta, Aug. 11: K.K. Birla-owned Texmaco Ltd, Indias largest wagon maker, is planning to revamp the company.        
	It plans to hive off the engineering division, which includes the wagon business, into a separate entity and bring in private equity funds of about Rs 200 crore for the entity.         
	After the exercise is over, Texmaco Ltd will have the investments, real estate and hydro power businesses in its fold. Texmaco will also be the majority shareholder of the proposed engineering division.        
	Saroj Poddar, executive vice-chairman of Texmaco, said the revamp was being carried out to tap opportunities in infrastructure.        
	We need funds to expand the business, Poddar said after the 68th annual general meeting of the company here today.        
	Texmaco has appointed ICICI Securities to scout for prospective investors, while Ernst amp; Young (E amp;Y) will help it chalk out the revamp roadmap.        
	We do not know yet how things will work out. What I told you is based on our informal discussion with E amp;Y. Hopefully, the agency will submit its report in the next two months, he said.        
	The company hopes to get good valuation for the engineering division, which will have the heavy engineering, steel foundry, hydro mechanical equipment and structural business under its umbrella.        
	I cant say how much we will dilute. But we hope to get a good valuation, he said, adding that the new entity would be listed after a while.        
	The development comes at a time when the company is looking to double wagon making capacity.        
	Ramesh Maheshwari, president and CEO of Texmaco, said the company would make 40 wagons a day by September next year compared with 20 a day now.        
	We are the largest wagon maker in the country and we will continue to be so, Ramesh added.

	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The department of telecom (DoT) is planning to allow new telecom operators, who do not have spectrum, to buy talktime at wholesale rates from existing firms and then sell it under their own brand.        
	In industry parlance, this system is known as the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model.        
	Existing operators usually have excess talktime on a daily basis below-average use of talktime is usually more than above-average use, in aggregate.        
	By leveraging the excess talktime, a mobile virtual network operator can offer services without actually owning spectrum or infrastructure such as telecom tower and transmission equipment.        
	Officials of the DoT said the nine letter-of-intent holders who were yet to be granted telecom licences and start-up spectrum could be considered for an MVNO licence.         
	Those who do not have a mobile licence can enter the business but will have to go through a waiting period, be subject to background checks and have to pay a separate fee.         
	New telecom players who have a licence but no spectrum will not have to pay any separate fee.         
	A number of international companies such as British Telecom and Virgin Mobile are planning to enter through the MVNO route.         
	Even existing Indian players who want to expand are interested in the system as it is cheaper and faster than rolling out a network.         
	Developed countries such as the US and the UK have an MVNO regime. However, this system needs permission from the government.         
	Through an MVNO model, the same amount of spectrum  which is a scarce resource  can be used to increase competition in the market, said Mahesh Uppal, telecom analyst.        
	The DoT officials indicated that an MVNO policy would soon be prepared. An internal note on MVNO has been prepared and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will also be asked to present its recommendations on the subject, they said.

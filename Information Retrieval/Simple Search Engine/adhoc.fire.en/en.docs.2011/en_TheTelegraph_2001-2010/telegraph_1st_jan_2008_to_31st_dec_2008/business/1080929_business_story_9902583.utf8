	Mumbai, Sept. 28: The battle between disgruntled shareholders and the management of Orient-Express Hotels (OEH), the Bermuda-based luxury hotel chain, is coming to a head.        
	Both sides have sent out letters to shareholders telling them which way to vote at a special general meeting to be held on October 10 in Bermuda.        
	Hedge fund owners David Shaw and Steven Cohen demanded that the management convene the meeting where they would propose scrapping of the super-voting stock held by Orient-Express Holdings 1 Ltd.        
	Shaw and Cohen together hold a 14.3 per cent stake in OEH. The management has vowed to defeat the resolutions with its 80.9 per cent combined voting rights resulting from the two classes of shares it holds.        
	The Class A shares, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, carry one-tenth of the voting right of the Class B shares that are entirely held by the holding company. The Tatas hold 11.5 per cent through Indian Hotels Company. They were rebuffed by OEH when it proposed a strategic alliance last November.        
	In a letter to all shareholders, Cohen and Shaw said the companys circular ownership  under which OEH is owned by Orient-Express Holding 1 Ltd and, in turn, controls the latter  violated Bermudas company law. It enabled the company to conduct its affairs in a manner that was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the Class A shareholders.

	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Ford plans to enter Indias small car market by 2010.         
	The car maker also said it was setting up a small-engine manufacturing unit in Chennai, which too, will be operational by 2010.        
	We are looking at various options (platforms) for our proposed small car in India. We will take a look at our global portfolio of small cars but nothing has been finalised yet, said Scott McCormack, vice-president, sales and marketing, Ford India.        
	However, company sources said Ford might look at a car built on Ford Europes existing platforms. There is also a possibility of the small car being based on group company Mazdas platforms.        
	Ford India is investing Rs 2,000 crore to expand its operations in Asias second largest car market. The investment will support the small car, launch of other models and the engine unit.        
	The Chennai engine plant will have capacity of 2.5 lakh units annually and meet the requirement of Fords local operations. Engines will also be exported to Fords plants in the Asia-Pacific and Africa.        
	McCormack said the capacity of its Chennai plant would be doubled to 200,000 units in the next two years.        
	Ford today launched a new version of its sports utility vehicle Endeavour powered by a 3-litre turbo diesel engine. It is exploring the possibility of bringing a military version of the vehicle.

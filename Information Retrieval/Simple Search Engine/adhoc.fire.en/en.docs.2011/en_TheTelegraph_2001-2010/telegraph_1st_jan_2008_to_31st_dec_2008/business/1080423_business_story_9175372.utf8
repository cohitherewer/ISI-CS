          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The Planning Commission today warned that the Competition Commission could take action against steel producers if they did not lower prices.        
	It will be in the interest of steel manufacturers if they reduce prices. Otherwise the Competition Commission can take action against them, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said today.        
	Ahluwalia admitted that though the Competition Commission was non-functional at present, it could be given more powers by the government, enabling it to take action against any alleged cartel.        
	Steel prices have surged about 50 per cent in the past one year, contributing to about one-fourth of the wholesale- price-index-based inflation, now hovering over 7 per cent. According to Ahluwalia, manufacturers were exploiting the market by raising the prices to cash in on the rising demand.

	The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission is conducting an inquiry into the allegations of cartelisation, Ahluwalia said. We are looking at legal and administrative provisions that are available to the government, he added.        
	Earlier, the finance minister had also said,It is my view that cement manufacturers and, to some extent, steel producers are behaving like a cartel. Railway minister Lalu Prasad yesterday joined the commerce, steel and finance ministers in demanding an export tax on iron ore and other measures to contain steel prices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | TCS signs second pact with Chrysler
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TCS signs second pact with Chrysler
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 7: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has signed a new multi-year contract with car manufacturer Chrysler to provide a portfolio of IT services.         
	TCS did not release any financial details of the deal.        
	The company had signed another contract with Chrysler in February this year.         
	TCS will deliver IT application and maintenance support services to Chrysler. It will provide services using its global network delivery model from various locations around the world and its Seven Hills Park domestic delivery centre outside Cincinnati, Ohio. It will also take the help of a locally recruited team in Detroit, Michigan. TCS is proud to play an increasing role in Chryslers business transformation and global expansion efforts, said N. Chandrasekaran, executive director and chief operating officer of TCS.        
	The project will involve several functional areas within Chrysler, such as sales and marketing, shared services, product development and after sales.        
	Our ability to deliver results across the entire spectrum of IT services in Chryslers operations will bring greater efficiency, allowing them to invest more in advanced technology, Chandrasekaran added.        
	Media reports said the contract with TCS would lead to a number of job losses within Chrysler. Around 200 salaried and a considerable number of contract workers in the information technology management and outsource computer maintenance and support departments will get the axe.        
	According to Chrysler spokesperson Kevin Frazier, about 20 per cent of its 1,000 salaried ITM employees will lose their jobs. However, he declined to quantify the impact on its roughly 1,100 contract workers. The car maker plans to slash the jobs in early May.

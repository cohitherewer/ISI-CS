	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Inflation fell to 12.40 per cent for the week ended August 9 from 12.63 per cent the week before. The finance ministry said this was an early sign of moderation in prices.        
	Prices of vegetable, meat, egg and fish and fuel and power items declined one per cent, while those of pulses, fruits, spices, sugar, textiles and iron and steel rose.         
	The decline in the inflation rate comes after four weeks of consistent rise. Inflation was 3.99 per cent a year ago.         
	In primary articles, the finance ministry said, prices of 21 of the 98 items in the group fell, while there was no increase in another 48 articles.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said, It is too early to conclude that inflation is moderating.        
	 He said, We are still in volatile times and data does not suggest that we have entered the declining trajectory.        
	Joshi said the Reserve Bank of India could hike key rates by 25 basis points later in the year to check prices.        
	Analysts said the decline in inflation could be temporary as floods could hit crop output, while the hike in salaries of government workers could push up demand.        
	This years uneven monsoon is creating shortages in many primary items. Recent reports show the prices of various important consumption items such as onions are going to rise very significantly because of poor supply. We cannot draw much comfort from todays reading, Joshi said.

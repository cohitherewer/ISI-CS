                                I get an annuity of Rs 2,000 per month from the Life Insurance Corporation of India against a lump sum premium of Rs 2,66,000. Will this annuity amount of Rs 24,000 a year will be a added or excluded to my annual income while assessing my income tax?          Satyendra M. Nag, Calcutta
                    Yes, the monthly pension that you receive as annuity from the LIC is taxable and will be added to your annual income for calculating your income tax liability. Monthly pension/annuity is considered as income from other sources.                                  Rules of the game      I took a house loan from UBI and have been paying the EMI since 2003. In 2007, the bank has introduced a new charge called inspection service charge every year, besides the EMI. Will I get any income tax relief for the inspection service charge?        Kanakendu Biswas, Bankura
                    You can claim deductions only for repayment of loan principal and interest. However, when you sell the house, you can deduct the amount (payment made towards inspection service charge) as cost of acquisition of the property to calculate the capital gains on the sale.                                  House on sale      We have a house built in 1912 and plan to sell it soon. Do I have to pay capital gains tax? If so, in how many days?        R. Dasgupta, Calcutta
                      In an answer to this question last week, it was wrongly mentioned that you could pay the capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation. Long-term capital gains tax in the case of assets other than listed securities or mutual fund units has to be paid at 20 per cent only with indexation benefit. Calculation of long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent without indexation is applicable only to listed securities other than equities or units of mutual fund schemes in which investments in equities of domestic companies are less than 65 per cent of the corpus of the scheme. The error is regretted.

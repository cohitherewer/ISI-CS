          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 29: The Rajus have been aggressively buying up tracts of land in Hyderabad and other parts of Andhra as they scale up operations of the debt-laden Maytas twins that have been at the centre of the raging controversy over appalling corporate governance standards at Satyam Computer Services.        
	Maytas Infra  a company that is actually three years older than the software giant and originally called Satyam Construction  has already bought 5.7 acres in the heart of the city. It proposes to develop one lakh square feet of space to house a five-star hotel, luxury apartments and a high-end retail enclave.        
	But the jewel in the Maytas crown is the Rs 11,818-crore Hyderabad metro rail project. Maytas Infra fought off other bidders with an audacious bid. It offered to pay a revenue of Rs 30,311 crore over the 35-year concession for the project. In contrast, other bidders such as Essar and Reliance were seeking a grant from the state government of around Rs 3,000 crore to bridge a viability funding gap.        
	When the deal was struck, it was hailed as a landmark financing model for infrastructure projects. That model is now in shreds as the Rajus scramble to raise funds before the March 2009 deadline.        
	Navbharat Constructions, its consortium ally in the metro project, has said it would not stump up its share of the funds, creating liquidity problems for Maytas Infra.        
	More trouble erupted last week when P.K. Madhav, chief executive officer of Maytas, was arrested on charges of financial fraud in a different case  Nagarjuna Finance.        
	The Maytas consortium has also bagged a Rs 1,255-crore project to develop a modern port 30 km from Machillipatnam that will handle 12 million tonnes of cargo.        
	Amid the raging controversy, the Andhra government has granted Maytas a Rs 121-crore project to construct a 30km stretch between Mangapatnam and Sugumanchipalli in Kadapa district.        
	Satyam has also cornered 30 acres of land on the outskirts of Hyderabad to set up an institute to establish mobile hospitals and ambulance networks across Andhra and six other states.         
	According to the records, Maytas Properties owns 6,800 acres in and around Hyderabad.

	Calcutta, Jan. 19 (PTI): Telecom regulator Trai will start discussions next week on the fate of access deficit charge (ADC), a levy paid by private firms to subsidise rural telephony in the country. 
    
	A consultation paper will be released on Monday, where the ADC issue will be discussed on three major points, Trai chairman Nripendra Misra said here today. 
    
	The paper will discuss whether the ADC will be phased out from this March. It will also discuss whether it can be merged with the universal service obligation fund and how the fund can be utilised for the benefit of rural customers after closure .
    
	Private telecom operators pay the ADC to BSNL, which uses the fund to provide services in rural areas. Private firms had criticised the levy, saying it was discriminatory and was aimed at cross-subsidising BSNL.
    
	Misra said private players are taking an active interest in rolling out telecom networks in villages.

	Mumbai, Feb. 19: Ranbaxy Laboratories will demerge its new drug discovery research unit into a subsidiary  Ranbaxy Life Science Research Ltd.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting of its board of directors today. Under the demerger scheme, shareholders having four shares in Ranbaxy will receive one share of Re 1 each in the new company.         
	All assets, liabilities and research personnel of the drug research facility will be transferred to the new entity.        
	Ranbaxy has subscribed to preference shares worth Rs 200 crore of Ranbaxy Life Science. After the demerger, the equity capital of the research arm will aggregate to Rs 12.6 crore.        
	Ranbaxy and the employee welfare trust of Ranbaxy Life Science will hold 19.8 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, in the new company. The balance will be held by the shareholders of Ranbaxy.        
	Ranbaxy Life Science will be listed on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange, while the global depository receipts will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.        
	All approvals required for the scheme, including that of Punjab and Haryana High Court, are expected to come into effect in the second half of 2008.        
	According to company CEO Malvinder Mohan Singh, the demerger has created a robust structure to carry out path-breaking research in modern medicine.

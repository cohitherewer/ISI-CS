The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Shasun pact with US firm
                                                                                                               Shasun pact with US firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 27: Chennai-based Shasun Chemicals amp; Drugs Ltd has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with US pharma company Merck amp; Co. This is Shasuns second such agreement with a foreign company.        
	Under the terms of the agreement, Shasun will grant Merck the use of its proprietary cross-coupling copper technology  also known as Buchwald technology  to manufacture and commercialise active pharmaceutical ingredients. The Buchwald cross-coupling technology allows complex drugs to be manufactured in an efficient and economical way.        
	The technology helps pharmaceutical companies engaged in research to convert chemicals into bulk drugs or intermediates. Shasun officials said while the technology could be used in any therapeutic area, the company would receive royalties from the user if a particular product was successfully commercialised through the technology.        
	Initially, Shasun is likely to get a nominal sum from Merck for the technology.         
	The company is also entitled to a first right of refusal for manufacturing bulk drugs on a contract basis that has used the technology.        
	Michel Spagnol, chief technology officer of Shasun, said, I am very excited to have finalised this agreement with Merck. This is an important milestone for Shasun in making this technology widely accessible and paving the way for further collaborations.        
	In July last year, Shasun announced that its wholly owned UK subsidiary, Shasun Pharma Solutions, entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with H Lundbeck, a Danish research company engaged in finding drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders.

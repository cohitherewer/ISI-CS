The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Unitech smells foul play
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Unitech smells foul play
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 26 (PTI): Unitech today said it was seeking a probe by the government and market regulator Sebi into the 51 per cent plunge in the companys share price on Friday. The company has blamed a cartel of bear operators.        
	The scrip plummeted 51.3 per cent to settle at Rs 30.1 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday.        
	We are in the process of filing complaints with Sebi, the department of economic affairs and the CBI for probing manipulation in our share price, Unitech managing director Sanjay Chandra said.        
	There are rumours being spread about the financial health of our company, possibly by bear cartels or market operators in the last couple of weeks who have vested interest in making short-term gains, Chandra said.        
	On whether rivals are involved, Chandra said, I doubt it. Our investigation points to something else. Some brokers are involved. Similar people were involved in a leading private bank case.

	Calcutta, May 21: Kodak is planning to shift employees from its 35mm films division to high-growth areas.         
	The division hit a rough patch when digital cameras took over the market.        
	Kodak has not opted for hiving off options as these people have a wealth of experience. So we would look at shifting them to areas of growth such as digital printing, commercial printing and other sectors, said Jeffrey Protheroe, regional business director (Asia-Pacific region), graphic communications group, Kodak Singapore.        
	The 35mm film business is part of the companys consumer business division, which also includes motion picture films.         
	Around 60 per cent of Kodaks 50,000 employees are employed in the consumer business.        
	India is Kodaks third most critical market after Japan and China.        
	We will continue to invest in the Indian market and ramp up hiring, said Protheroe.        
	The commercial printing business of the companys graphics division is growing the fastest in India. Digital printing is another area of growth. Kodak said it was open to form joint ventures with Indian companies in the areas of high growth.        
	The commercial printing business, comprising 75 per cent of the graphics business, is expected to grow at around 45 per cent in the next three to four years.        
	The graphics business is projected to grow at 20 per cent in the country.         
	Calcutta-based Anderson Printing House today installed the latest Kodak Nexpress 2100 plus digital printer at its facility. This was the first such machine installed in the entire eastern and northern parts of the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Motors revs up for Tokyo listing
                                                                                                               Tata Motors revs up for Tokyo listing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Long run                                  
	Mumbai, April 2: Tata Motors is planning to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by offering depository receipts to investors in Japan.        
	Market analysts see this as a move to part finance its acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover besides raising funds for other capital expenditure programmes.        
	A depositary receipt is backed by a companys underlying share, and Tata Motors had earlier issued American depository receipts that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.         
	If Tata Motors mops up funds from Japan, it will be the second Indian company after Infosys Technologies to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.        
	In a report, the Nikkei daily said Tata Motors would raise close to 100 billion yen ($983 million) in Japan through the depository receipts.        
	When contacted, a spokesperson for Tata Motors said Tata Motors is at this stage exploring various avenues for sourcing its long-term financing requirements and once finalised will make an appropriate disclosure. We have no further comments to add.        
	It is felt that part of the proceeds from the depository receipt could be used to fund the Jaguar and Land Rover acquisition.         
	Last week, Tata Motors announced that it was acquiring Jaguar and Land Rover for $2.3 billion. The company has tied up bridge finance of $3 billion from a syndicate of banks to fund the acquisition.         
	However, it plans to replace this bridge finance by a long- term debt or equity. The company is also looking to divest some of its stake in its subsidiaries.         
	Apart from the Jaguar and Land Rover acquisition, the company is betting big on the Nano, the Rs 1-lakh car, which will be rolled out from Singur, Bengal.

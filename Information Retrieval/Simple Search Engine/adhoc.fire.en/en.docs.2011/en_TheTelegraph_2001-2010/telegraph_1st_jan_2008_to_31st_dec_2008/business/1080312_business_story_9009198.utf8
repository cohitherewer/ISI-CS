	March 11: Delhi-based real estate developer BPTP Ltd has bagged a 95-acre commercial plot for Rs 5,006 crore from the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida), outbidding realty giant DLF.        
	Its a competitive bidding. We outbid DLF by 10 per cent, BPTP managing director Kabul Chawla said.        
	Other in the fray were Omaxe and Ansal.        
	BPTPs land deal is the biggest in the country so far in value terms.         
	Earlier last year, Unitech had bagged 1,750 acres in Vizag for Rs 3,350 crore, and, in another big-ticket deal, the company had won a 340-acre plot in Noida for Rs 1,582 crore in 2006.        
	DLF, the countrys biggest real estate developer, had clinched a 38-acre land deal in the national capital for Rs 1,675 crore.        
	Today we opened the bids and BPTP has emerged as the highest bidder offering Rs 1,30,207 per square metre against the reserve price of Rs 77,000 per square metre. We will offer the land to them very soon, Yash Pal Singh, chairman of the bids evaluation committee, said.        
	Going by BPTPs bid amount, Singh said the entire land had been valued at over Rs 5,000 crore against the reserve price of about Rs 3,000 crore.        
	Set up in 2003, BPTP is developing 109 million square feet in Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida and Greater Noida.        
	Recently CPI, the real estate arm of Citigroup, had picked up 5.89 per cent in the company by investing Rs 322.50 crore, valuing BPTP at Rs 5,475 crore

	Calcutta, July 9: Calcutta-based Sureka Group will invest Rs 1,300 crore in various projects in the city and the surrounding areas over the next two years through its joint sector company, Bengal Park Chambers Housing Development Ltd.        
	We already have projects worth Rs 500 crore and expect to invest another Rs 1,000 crore next year, said Pradeep Sureka, director of Sureka Group.        
	The group is now busy acquiring land to set up a township near Calcutta. It would need 100-150 acres for the project. The initial investment for such a township will be around Rs 300 crore.        
	The township is likely to be executed by Bengal Park Chambers, a joint venture between the West Bengal Housing Board and the Sureka Group, as it would be easier to obtain the approvals. The township will comprise an IT park, a hospital, a school apart from residential and commercial properties.        
	The group plans to build 2,000 apartments across various projects from next year.        
	However, it has not yet decided on the issue of seeking private equity participation for its upcoming projects.         
	It is not possible to do so in joint sector projects and offer stake to a private equity partner. We have to see how it works out, Sureka said.        
	On inflationary pressure, Sureka said construction costs had gone up by 25 to 30 per cent in the city. We have to absorb most of the cost without passing it on to the customers. The projects cannot be postponed, said Sureka.        
	Bengal Park Chambers today launched its first project in the city, comprising 448 apartments, for the lower- and middle-income groups.         
	The Rs 30-crore project is coming up at Baruipur, which is set to become the companys district headquarter for South 24 Parganas.        
	The complex will have two-bedroom flats priced at Rs 5.5 lakh and one bedroom units at Rs 2.6 lakh.        
	The project is part of a social commitment to meet the shortage of dwelling units in these segments, said Sureka.        
	India is estimated to have a shortage of 18 million housing units by 2010.

	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Toyota Motor president Katsuaki Watanabe today called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, leading to speculation that the Japanese automobile major was pushing ahead with plans for a second car factory in the country and a small car project.        
	Toyota officials, however, refused to discuss the details of the meeting with Singh.         
	When asked if Watanabe had any discussions on Toyota Kirloskar Motors plans to set up a second manufacturing facility, a company spokesperson told The Telegraph, It is his first visit to India, which is why he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh just a courtesy call.        
	Official sources said Watanabe, who led a delegation that included Toyota Motor managing director Akira Okabe, briefed Singh about the company and its operations.        
	The Japanese automobile giant has been planning to set up a second plant, enter the compact car segment in India and capture about 15 per cent of the market by 2015.        
	The company had earlier announced plans to increase production in India to two lakh units by 2010 from 50,000 and then to six lakh by 2015.        
	Toyota has, according to sources, been working on its small car project. Sources said the company planned to enter the segment in the next two years.         
	Parent company Toyota Motors will take a decision and finalise plans over the next few months.        
	The decision to introduce a small car in the Indian market is very much on our minds. it is likely to come through in the next half-year. From then, it will take us another two to three years to launch the car in the country, company sources in Toyota Kirloskar had earlier said.        
	Industry sources said Toyota was working on a small car, codenamed 800L, for the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) markets. The small car may come with both petrol and diesel powertrains.         
	Designed in Japan, the low-cost car will be built on a new platform at Toyotas plant in Bangalore. It is likely to sport a 1.2-litre engine.         
	Watanabes visit coincides with celebrations of Toyotas 10th year of operations in India, the officials said.         
	In India, the company operates through a joint venture with the Kirloskar group.        
	In the passenger vehicle segment, Toyota Kirloskar has successfully launched multi-utility vehicles such as the Qualis and the Innova.         
	But the company has not been able to make a big impact in the car segment so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G firms for spectrum mix 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             3G firms for spectrum mix 
  - Accessibility improves but input crunch persists          JAYATI GHOSE                                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Prospective foreign bidders of 3G spectrum in the mobile phone business want to bid for 2G spectrum as well.        
	Global telecom operators, including Americas AT amp;T and Verizon, the UAEs Etisalat, Japans NTT DoCoMo and Germanys Deutsche Telekom, want to bid for both 2G and 3G spectrum because a combination of the two types of radiowaves will enable them to compete with existing companies.        
	At present, a 3G auction winner is entitled to 5 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum per circle in the 2.1-gigahertz (Ghz) band. This is not sufficient for offering voice and high-end data services.         
	It will be difficult for foreign players to compete with existing operators without 2G spectrum, which is essential to offer basic voice services, said officials.        
	Foreign 3G players have two options for acquiring 2G spectrum  they can either pick up a 74 per cent stake in an existing 2G operator or merge with one.         
	Officials said foreign firms were also looking at the option of collaborating with new telecom service providers as virtual network operators to gain 2G spectrum and cut rollout costs.        
	As virtual network operators, the 3G players will get access to the 1,800Mhz band for 2G spectrum  which is more efficient for voice calls, while the 2.1Ghz band can be dedicated for 3G.        
	However, the government is yet to open the domestic market to mobile virtual network operators, who buy bulk airtime and resell it to customers under their brand name.         
	The officials said that most foreign telecom operators preferred to compete on a standalone basis. This is because valuations of the licences of the telecom players who are yet to start services are quite high, ranging between $1 billion and $3 billion. A lack of clarity on merger norms is also discouraging bidders.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) is willing to give an auction for 2G spectrum a try but wants to restrict it to the allocation of additional spectrum to existing players.         
	However, the finance and the law ministries have repeatedly called for auctions to both new and existing operators.         
	On the auction of 2G spectrum for new players, the DoT said, Considering that the allotment of initial spectrum is linked with the telecom service licence for which an operator pays an entry fee, auction of such initial spectrum is not feasible.         
	Currently, on paying a licence fee, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4Mhz and 2.5Mhz of start-up spectrum, respectively, per circle to launch operations.        
	Auction warning         
	Analysts have suggested that international players should not participate in the 3G auction process as their growth prospects are limited by regulatory and market factors.         
	A report, 3G Scenario in Emerging Markets by research firm Strategy Analytics, says the Indian governments 3G policy is not suitable for foreign players at present because of a number of factors such as a pricing structure and a strict timeline.

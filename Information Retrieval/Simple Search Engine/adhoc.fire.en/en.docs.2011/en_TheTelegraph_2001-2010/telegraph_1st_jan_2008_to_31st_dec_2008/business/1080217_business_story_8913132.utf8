          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: The government has asked the 12th Finance Commission to suggest ways to refund state levies to exporters and adjust these against the accounts of states.        
	I have got it included in the terms of reference of the 12th Finance Commission to work out a mechanism where the state levies are refunded by the Centre to exporters and then appropriated from states, commerce minister Kamal Nath said at the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	The move is an attempt to bail out exporters reeling under the impact of a costlier rupee, officials said.        
	The exporters have been seeking refund of various levies such as octroi, mandi tax and electricity duty.        
	However, under the present tax-sharing arrangement between the Centre and states, the government finds it difficult to work out a refund mechanism. Under the constitution, it is mandatory for the finance commission to define the tax-sharing arrangement between the two.        
	Asked if the forthcoming budget will address the woes of exporters, Nath said he favoured a cut in import duties on several items.        
	There should be reduction in import duties on some items ... because we have to ensure that the inverted duty structure in a large number of areas is corrected, he said.        
	Under an inverted duty structure, the import duty on raw materials is more than that on the finished product, leaving no incentive for domestic production.         
	Nath said it was necessary to correct this duty structure since India was entering into a host of trade agreements under which imports of many items would eventually become duty-free or attract minimal levies.

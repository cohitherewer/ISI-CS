	New Delhi, April 7: Indian firms want the RBI to lower interest rates to spur demand, an Assocham survey of 165 chief executives has revealed. An increase in interest rates or cash reserve requirements will not help contain inflation, which can be checked by raising the supplies of food and metals, the survey said.        
	Former RBI governor Bimal Jalan said the RBI should limit the cash available to banks to lend instead of raising rates. An increase in interest rates is not a solution in an emergency situation as it takes longer to be effective, he added.         
	Rising prices have sparked off speculation that the RBI may raise rates at the monetary policy review on April 29. With commodity prices rising globally, any move that will choke investments will add to a declining index of industrial output, the CII said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 30: In yet another relief to public sector oil marketing companies, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today decided to sell and buy oil bonds through special market operations with a ceiling of Rs 1,000 crore per day.        
	The central bank will also provide foreign exchange through designated banks to these companies. Oil industry circles said the RBI move would provide greater liquidity to these bonds.         
	According to the RBI, nationalised oil companies are important participants in the money, foreign exchange, credit and bond markets. However, liquidity and other related issues currently faced by these entities arising from the unprecedented escalation in international crude prices have systemic implications for the smooth functioning of financial markets and for the overall financial stability.         
	It has, therefore, become necessary for the RBI to put in place special market operations on an ad hoc basis to minimise potential adverse consequences for financial markets in a transparent manner, it said.         
	The special market operations, which would constitute only a fraction of the total turnover in the money and foreign exchange markets, are aimed at reducing volatility and also to improve the access of public sector oil companies to domestic liquidity and alleviate the demand in the foreign exchange market.

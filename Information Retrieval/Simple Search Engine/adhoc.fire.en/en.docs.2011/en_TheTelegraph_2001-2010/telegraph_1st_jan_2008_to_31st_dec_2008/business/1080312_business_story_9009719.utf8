          KAKOLY CHATTERJEE                                             
	New Delhi, March 11: The $14-billion liquor giant Diageo is planning to introduce three whiskies in the luxury segment  Talisker 25, Talisker 30 and King George V  and an Indian wine, Nilaya.         
	Riding on the retail boom, the luxury whisky market is growing at the rate of 25 per cent in India.         
	We are on an aggressive growth mode in India, said Asif Adil, managing director of Diageo India,        
	King George V, which is part of the Johnnie Walker Blue Label range, will be launched in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore very soon.         
	A pan-India rollout is likely over the next six months.         
	After Talisker 10 and Talisker 18, which are already available in India, the UK-based liquor company is planning to launch Talisker 25 and 30 in six months.         
	Premium whisky varieties from the Diageo stable, such as Glenkinchie (Rs 2,930 per bottle), Caol Ila 12 (Rs 2,760), Glen Ord 12 (Rs 3,890) and Clynelish 14 (Rs 2,730), will be available in retail chains.         
	They are now sold only from few outlets, such as five-star hotels. Premium whisky is graded below luxury brands.        
	We are in talks with several retail chains such as Wal-Mart, Metro, Natures Basket and More, said Adil. Diageo is negotiating with More for sale in Bangalore.         
	The companys products are already available at chains such as Shoprite Hyper in Mumbai. It is also in talks with Reliance.         
	Diageo is also entering the wine segment with Nilaya, its first domestic wine.         
	This wine is made in Nashik in four variants, two red and two white.         
	From April, Nilaya will be available in Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal.

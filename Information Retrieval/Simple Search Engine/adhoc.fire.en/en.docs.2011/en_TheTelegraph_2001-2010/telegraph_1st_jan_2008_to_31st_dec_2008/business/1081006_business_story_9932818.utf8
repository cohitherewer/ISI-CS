	New Delhi, Oct. 5 (PTI): The much awaited comprehensive insurance bill, which seeks to raise the foreign direct investment cap in private firms to 49 per cent from 26 per cent, is likely to be introduced in the forthcoming session of Parliament.        
	The draft is being vetted by the law ministry and will be moved for cabinet approval once it is cleared by the ministry, sources in the finance ministry said.        
	It is expected to go to the cabinet for clearance before the session begins, sources said. Parliament is scheduled to meet from October 17.        
	Last month, a group of ministers headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had cleared a proposal to hike the foreign direct investment limit in insurance to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 11: Stocks slumped, the rupee reeled and crude oil plunged as the dollar rallied to a years high against the euro and other currencies amid fears that global economic growth had started to slow.        
	The rupee tumbled to a 23-month low of 45.57 per dollar while the BSE sensex fell 338.32 points (2.31 per cent) to close at 14324.29 as markets around the world shuddered after being hit by a gale of bad news.        
	A steady stream of poor economic forecasts was capped by the European Commission predicting on Wednesday that growth in the euro region would stagnate this quarter after shrinking over the previous three months.         
	Markets around the world were also spooked by reports that Lehman Brothers  one of the most respected investment banking firms  could collapse under the weight of its dodgy real estate investments.        
	On the local forex market, dealers started to worry that the rupee would sink further to 46 against the dollar. The currency fluttered in a range of 45.32 to 45.58 during the day after resuming sharply lower at 45.36 per dollar. It had closed on Wednesday at 45.12.        
	Importers scrambled to buy the greenback amid fears that it could harden in the days ahead. Dollar supplies have been thin with foreign institutional investors continuing to dump stocks. These investors have sold shares worth more than $7 billion since January.        
	Forex circles said the RBI intervened twice today  first when the rupee was trading at 45.45 to the dollar and later when it dipped to 45.55. However, the size of its intervention was not large.        
	Oil prices fell towards $100 weighed down by the stronger dollar and concerns over weakening demand.

	Calcutta, Jan. 16: Allahabad Bank today reported a net profit of Rs 805.23 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2007, surpassing the Rs 750.14-crore profit earned in the whole of 2006-07. 
 
	For the September-December quarter of this fiscal, its net profit stood at Rs 365.05 crore against Rs 286.13 crore in the year-ago period.
 
	The increase in the banks earnings came largely on the back of non-core income, including treasury operations and trading in equities. 
 
	Our interest income during the nine months grew to Rs 4,560 crore from Rs 3,489 crore a year ago, but other income increased to Rs 596 crore from Rs 250 crore in the same period, said chairman and managing director A.C. Mahajan. 
 
	The banks income from treasury operations grew to Rs 250 crore from Rs 50 crore and income from trading in equities and other securities increased to Rs 346 crore from Rs 54 crore in the same period in 2006-07. 
 
	Income from trading in equities in the September-December quarter alone increased to Rs 301 crore from Rs 42 crore a year ago, Mahajan said. However, despite slow growth in advances, the bank clocked a 30.69 per cent increase in income from interest.
 
	Our interest expenses (interest paid towards deposits and other loans taken by the bank) increased to Rs 3,221 crore from Rs 2,224 crore, Mahajan said. 
 
	The banks total business at the end of nine months this financial year stood at Rs 1,13,835 crore, beating the Rs 1,01,458 crore of business generated at the end of 2006-07. 
 
	Total deposits by December 2007 stood at Rs 68,044 crore, while at the end of 2006-07 they were Rs 59,544 crore. 
 
	Advances increased to Rs 45,791 crore by December 2007. At the end of March 2007 they were Rs 41,914 crore. Allahabad Bank is planning to raise Rs 300 crore through perpetual bonds. We have got the boards approval today and will start scouting for investors from tomorrow, Mahajan said. 
 
	The banks capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.84 per cent, of which Tier I capital constitutes 8.21 per cent. 
 
	Insurance foray
 
	The first product from Universal Sompo General Insurance Company is likely to hit the market on February 11. Sompo General is a joint venture among Allahabad Bank (30 per cent), Indian Overseas Bank (19 per cent), Karnataka Bank (15 per cent), Dabur Investments (10 per cent) and Japans Sompo (26 per cent).

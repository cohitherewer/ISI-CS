The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Ace to go global
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata Ace to go global
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 19: Tata Motors plans to take its mini truck, the Ace, to the international market because of growing competition at home.        
	At present, the Ace is available in select countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Tata Motors plans to take it to Africa (including South Africa), the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Thailand is part of this regional grouping), Russia and other countries, P. Telang, executive director of Tata Motors, told The Telegraph.         
	In the domestic market, the commercial vehicles margins came under pressure after rivals Piaggio, Bajaj Auto and Force Motors rolled out similar models.         
	For the overseas market, the mini truck will be launched with new features, including higher engine capacity and air conditioning, Telang said. In India, the Ace is powered by a 700cc engine.         
	The possibility of an economic slowdown and high interest rates have put the brakes on sales in the domestic commercial vehicle industry.         
	Even under such adverse circumstances, Tata Motors has posted a 17 per cent sales growth in March.         
	Telang was concerned about rising inflation and the slowdown in industrial output but said the long-term outlook for the industry was encouraging with the government investing heavily in infrastructure.         
	Tata Motors will roll out its world truck this year. The vehicle is being developed with Tata Motors subsidiary Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicles.         
	The world truck is expected to be launched in the international market first and will be introduced in India either later this year or next year.         
	Telang said the truck would address the issue of driver safety. In Europe, the driver is an important factor as he is responsible for the safety of the vehicle and the goods, he added.         
	Telang said Tata Motors would not only focus on quality aspects such as enhancing fuel efficiency, but also bring down the cost of ownership for its customers. The company is offering value added services such as an annual maintenance contract to some of its customers.

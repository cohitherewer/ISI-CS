                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             IPO applicants get a boost
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Glad tidings                                  
	Mumbai, May 13: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today approved an alternative mode of payment for public and rights issues, which will enable applicants to keep money in banks till the allotment of shares and thus eliminate the need for refunds.        
	The board approved, in principle, the concept of marking lien on bank account as an alternative mode of payment in public/rights issues, the market regulator said after its board meeting here.        
	The new method of payment, it said, would enable the application money to remain in the bank account of the applicant till the allotment of shares.        
	This would eliminate the process of giving refunds by companies to applicants in case of the non-allotment of shares, Sebi said, adding that the modalities would be announced later.        
	At present, an investor who wishes to put money in a public issue  an IPO or a rights offer  needs to pay the entire amount for the shares on application. The money remains locked till the closing of the issue. In case the investor does not receive the shares, the issuer normally refunds the amount within 15 days of the closing of the issue.         
	The Sebi proposal, if implemented, could prove to be a boon for most investors who face problems of refund delays if shares are not allotted to them in a public or a rights issue.         
	Moreover this move will enhance the liquidity in the secondary market as investors who fail to get shares during an IPO can use this money to buy the same on listing.        
	The market regulator also decided to raise minimum net worth criteria for portfolio managers from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore.         
	The existing portfolio managers whose net worth is less than Rs 2 crore will have to increase it to at least Rs 1 crore within six months and to Rs 2 crore in the next six months from the date of notification of this regulation.        
	Sebi also decided that portfolio managers would not be allowed to float a scheme or pool resources of clients in any way akin to mutual fund activities.        
	Portfolio managers will be required to keep assets of each client under separate heads and not in a pooled manner, Sebi said. They will be given six months to comply with this regulation, the market regulator added.        
	The board also approved the regulations related to the issue and listing of debt securities, which were formulated to encourage corporate bonds markets by making the process of issuance more transparent. Sebi had earlier invited public comments on the draft regulations.

	Mumbai, Nov. 28: Two international credit rating agencies today said they had no plans to revise Indias sovereign rating after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai sparked concerns about investment flows into the country.        
	Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) said it did not believe the terrorist attacks would have a direct effect on the sovereign ratings on India (BBB-/Stable/A-3), provided they are an isolated case.        
	Based on the scenario that these attacks were an isolated case, we do not expect there will be negative implications on Indias macro-economic activities, or on the governments fiscal position, S amp;Ps credit analyst Takahira Ogawa said.        
	In the short term, we expect there will be a slowdown in tourist arrivals (particularly business travellers), and some negative impact on the foreign exchange and stock exchange markets, but such short-term effects will recede over time if there are no further attacks, he said.        
	Sources close to Fitch said the rating agency was also unlikely to revise the rating of India because of the incident. Recently, Fitch maintained Indias long-term foreign currency rating at BBB- with a stable outlook.        
	Moodys said India should come out with measures to stimulate growth as the economy may expand at less than 7 per cent in the next four quarters, despite recording a solid growth rate of 7.6 per cent in the September quarter.        
	Indias GDP growth for the next four quarters will certainly slip below the 7-per-cent mark and even test the 6-per-cent mark in mid-2009. The government and the central bank are expected to aggressively implement stimulatory measures to revive growth, observed Moodys Economy.com, a subsidiary of Moodys Corporation.

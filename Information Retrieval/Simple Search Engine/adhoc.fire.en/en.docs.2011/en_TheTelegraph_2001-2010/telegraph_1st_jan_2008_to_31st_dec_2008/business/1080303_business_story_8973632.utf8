The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Take home the savings
                                                                                                               Take home the savings
        Go for a housing loan to maximise the benefit of a tax tweak, says Srikumar Bondyopadhayay                                            
	If you are a tax payer, you must be quite happy with the news that you will have to pay much less tax in the assessment year 2009-10 than what you are paying this year.         
	If your monthly income from all sources is Rs 25,000, your tax liability from April will be only Rs 1,287.50 a month and that too without claiming any deduction on tax saving investments. At the same income, your current tax liability is Rs 3,347.50 every month. The saving in tax liability is higher for people with higher income.         
	What are you planning to do with this reduction in tax liability and saving in tax outgo? Before you draw up your plans, we have a suggestion: Take a home loan and buy a house. If you have already taken a housing loan a few years ago, prepay the principal outstanding with the amount that you save in tax outgo.         
	Other options?        
	In terms of investment instruments, the finance minister has proposed to bring the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS) and the five-year post office fixed deposits under Section 80C for tax benefit.         
	Both these instruments are restrictive as individuals below 60 years cannot deposit money in SCSS, while the post office fixed deposit offers an annual interest rate of only 7.5 per cent.        
	The finance minister has also proposed to allow a deduction up to Rs 15,000 on premium paid by the assessee for medical insurance of his or her parent(s). This is in addition to the Rs 15,000 deduction allowed under Section 80D for premium of the assessee, his/her spouse and children.         
	However, even though one can now theoretically claim a maximum deduction of Rs 30,000 under Section 80D, medical insurance for people above 60 is not easily available.         
	Thus, the new instruments under Section 80C and the additional benefit under Section 80D do not promise much for individual taxpayers. What matters is the reduction in tax liability.         
	More deduction        
	Section 80C allows for deduction on investments in specified instruments, including repayment of home loan principal. However, the maximum deduction available under this Section is Rs 1,00,000. If you take a home loan, you can also claim deduction up to Rs 1,50,000 towards repayment of interest on the loan under Section 24. A home loan thus provides a maximum deduction of Rs 2,50,000 in a fiscal.         
	Cheaper loans and...         
	A number of banks have recently reduced their interest rates on home loans and may reduce it further as global economies are headed for a soft and benign interest rate regime.         
	... properties        
	Following the rise in interest rates in the recent past, home loan demand and property prices have seen a downward correction in many places.         
	Early bird benefit        
	Another benefit of buying a house at a young age is that by the time you retire, you will have repaid the loan and the house will be yours. Without any loan liability, you will be free to use your superannuation benefits as you wish.         
	Buying real estate is good investment, too. In most locations, the price of properties have gone up at the compounded annual growth rate of 15 to 18 per cent since the beginning of this century.        
	To live in         
	However, keep it in mind that you can claim deductions under sections 24 and 80C on a home loan if you use the fund to buy a property for self-occupation and not to let it out.         
	If you sell the property within five years from the end of the financial year during which the house was purchased, the deduction claimed under section 80C for the home loan will be added back to your income in the year of sale and taxed.        
	Rent it out        
	If you have a self-occupied property, a second house could be a good source of income. You can take a loan, buy a second house and give it on rent and use the rent to pay the EMIs.         
	However, in this case, the tax implication will be different. You will have to adjust the interest on loan with the rental income and at the end of the year if you earn an excess rent over the interest paid, it will be added to your total annual income and taxed accordingly. In case, your annual interest outgo is greater than your yearly rental income from the property, you can set off the loss (in income) against your other income, including income from salary.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Excise duty collections dipped nearly 9 per cent in October, a sign of industry producing less as it grapples with unsold stocks and weak demand.        
	Top finance ministry officials said this was a reflection of the slowdown. It may well be a temporary blip and we can see excise collections jumping as companies sell inventories stocked up for the festival period and then increase production.         
	However, Indian firms are unlikely to fulfil the wishes of the mandarins.        
	Many steel and automobile companies are believed to have reduced production, while Indias largest steel maker, Steel Authority of India Limited, is likely to cut production by up to 10 per cent.         
	The moves to cut production come on the back of weak industry performance in August, when it grew 1.3 per cent.        
	In September, passenger car sales fell 6.6 per cent  the most in more than three years  while truck and bus sales fell 36 per cent.        
	Soon after announcing the tax data, top officials from various economic ministries met finance secretary Arun Ramanathan.         
	The high-level panel of ministers, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, is expected to deliberate on the outcome of the meeting to shape future policies.        
	Besides increasing spending, the government may hold talks with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to increase the availability of cash in the system by reducing interest rates.         
	Negative growth in exports and a slowdown in industrial production are the obvious reasons for the slump in collection of excise and customs duties. Given these numbers, we can foresee industrial production figures for September also coming down, said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist with the the Institute of Economic Growth, a government-funded think tank.        
	Customs collection also came down by nearly 1 per cent in October, while exports are projected to slump 15 per cent during the month.         
	However, analysts still believe that industry performance will be encouraging for the year, and the growth in gross domestic product could be above seven per cent.        
	The government and the RBI are already under pressure to cut key interest rates further to boost demand.         
	Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, and former RBI governor Bimal Jalan were among those who called for lower interest rates today.         
	I personally think there would be some scope for further rate cuts, Tendulkar said.        
	The RBI has already cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 150 basis points in two stages from a seven-year high of 9 per cent.        
	It has also cut the cash reserve ratio, or the proportion of deposits that banks have to compulsorily keep with the RBI, by 350 basis points to 5.5 per cent.        
	Banks have already reacted to the RBI steps, cutting lending rates by up to 0.75 per cent.         
	However, firms are protesting that interest rates, which are between 11 per cent and 16 per cent now, are still too high. Banks are also reluctant to lend to certain risky sectors such as real estate.

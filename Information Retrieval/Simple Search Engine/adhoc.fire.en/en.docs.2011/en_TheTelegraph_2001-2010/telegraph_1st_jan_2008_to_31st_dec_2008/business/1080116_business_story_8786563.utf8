	Calcutta, Jan. 15: ICICI Venture, the private equity arm of ICICI Bank, is planning to list its special purpose vehicle for the healthcare sector, I-VEN Medicare India Pvt Ltd, in the next two to three years. 
    
	We will soon sign up a foreign strategic partner for I-VEN Medicare, which is wholly owned by ICICI Venture, said Aluri Srinivasa Rao, director (investments), ICICI Venture Funds Management Company Ltd.
    
	The foreign partner will bring in $80 million (Rs 320 crore approximately) equity capital to I-VEN Medicare. It is likely to hold a 50 per cent stake in the company. ICICI Venture will gradually reduce its shareholding in I-VEN and we are planning to list the company on the bourses in the next two to three years, Rao added.
    
	ICICI Venture has already invested $80 million as equity in I-VEN Medicare and another $90 million (Rs 360 crore approximately) has been raised as debt. This $250-million (Rs 1,000 crore) fund will be invested in regional healthcare companies and I-VEN Medicare will hold more than a 50 per cent stake in most of these companies, Rao said. 
    
	Medica Synergie deal
    
	I-VEN Medicare today announced an investment of Rs 65 crore in city-based Medica Synergie Pvt Ltd, an integrated healthcare chain promoted by Dr Alok Roy, a former trustee of Rabindranath Tagore Heart Hospital here. This is I-VEN Medicares third investment. 
    
	At present, Medica Synergie runs a chain of Medica Health Shoppe and diagnostics centres. We are building a 500-bed super-speciality hospital on a 4-acre plot behind Metro Cash amp; Carry on EM Bypass. We have recently acquired a hospital in Siliguri and another will come up at Asansol before the Pujas this year, said Alok Roy, chairman and managing director of Medica Synergie Pvt Ltd. 
    
	The company plans to build eight hospitals in two years across central locations in eastern India at an investment of Rs 270 crore. Of the total investment, the equity component will be Rs 100 crore and the rest will be borrowed, Roy said. While I-VEN Medicare will pump in Rs 65 crore, Medica Synergie will invest Rs 35 crore.

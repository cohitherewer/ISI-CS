	Calcutta, Aug. 13: Tata Steel today entered into a definitive agreement with two state-run Vietnamese companies  Vietnam Steel Corporation (Vnsteel) and Vietnam Cement Industries Corporation (Vicem)  to set up a 4.5-million-tonne greenfield steel plant at an estimated investment of $5 billion.        
	The plant will come up in the Vung Ang economic zone of Ha Tinh province of Vietnam in three phases over the next 10 years.        
	In the first phase, a cold-rolling mill will come up by 2010, making it the first new plant that the 100-year old Indian company is going to set up outside the country.        
	In the next two phases, backward integration into steel making will begin using iron ore from Thach Khe mines. Tata Steel will have a 30 per cent stake in the iron ore mine.         
	Tata Steel will have a 65 per cent stake, Vnsteel 30 per cent and Vicem 5 per cent in the steel project. The memorandum of understanding for this steel project was signed on May 29, 2007.        
	Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said, We are delighted to enter into the joint venture with Vnsteel and Vicem and believe that this partnership is well placed to make the most of tremendous growth potential Vietnam possesses.        
	Vnsteel president Dau Van Hung said, The joint venture will enable Vnsteel to expand and create a substantial knowledge and technical base, while building a long-term relationship with Tata Steel.        
	The development could not have come at a better time for Tata Steel, which is struggling with greenfield expansion in India and abroad.        
	The Tata group withdrew from Bangladesh a few days back where a steel plant was to come up. Its proposed plant in Iran is not making much headway either.        
	In India, it is planning three new plants in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, out of which, only the Orissa plant is close to a take-off stage.        
	The Vietnam project, being headed by Indronil Sengupta, chief executive of Southeast Asia projects of Tata Steel, will also help the worlds sixth largest firm regain a stronghold over a key raw material source to some extent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 18: ICICI Bank today said its loan book would grow at only 15 per cent this year, an indication that the bank could continue to remain cautious while lending to some retail segments.        
	The 15 per cent growth rate is a sharp fall from the 55 per cent surge in advances that the bank clocked two years ago.        
	The bank has only seen a 7.2 per cent growth in lending in the first half of this fiscal ended September 30  and seen from that perspective a 15 per cent growth rate for the year will look somewhat healthy.        
	Advances during April-September grew 7.2 per cent to Rs 2,21,985 crore over Rs 2,07,121 crore at the end of September 2007.        
	K.V. Kamath, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, who was in Delhi to attend the India Economic Summit, said the 15 per cent growth rate in advances would come despite the economic slowdown.        
	Retail loans at present account for 55 per cent of the banks loan book. Home loans account for a large chunk of the retail advances followed by auto loans, personal loans and credit cards.        
	The retail loan book growth of ICICI Bank has moderated in the past few quarters because of rising interest rates even as the bank consciously tightened credit norms to certain sectors such as credit cards. The bank had also exited small-ticket personal loans.        
	Analysts say growth in advances to the corporate sector has been robust this year. It seems that the bank sees the 15 per cent loan growth coming largely from the corporate sector, said a banking analyst with a local brokerage.        
	As sources of funds start to dry up, companies are expected to turn to domestic banks to meet their credit requirements.        
	However, the State Bank of India expects to see its loan portfolio grow by over 25 per cent this year. A top SBI official said there was a huge demand for credit from the corporate sector.        
	An ICICI source added that though retail lending could see a de-growth, this would be more than compensated by the corporate sector. We do not envisage any major change in the demand for credit, he said.

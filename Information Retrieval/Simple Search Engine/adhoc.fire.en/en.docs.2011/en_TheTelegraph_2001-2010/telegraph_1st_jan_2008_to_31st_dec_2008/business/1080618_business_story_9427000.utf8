	New Delhi, June 17: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is examining the possibility of allowing spectrum trading among operators.        
	Spectrum trading, if allowed, will enable companies to sell or lease their surplus radiowaves to operators facing a spectrum crunch.         
	However, analysts feel that apart from setting the ground rules for reselling spectrum, the government may also want a share in the price of the resold radiowaves.        
	Telecom analyst Mahesh Uppal said, At present, spectrum in India is leased to telecom operators at a subsidised rate. So, if spectrum is allowed to be re-sold at market prices, the government may decide to charge a tax on that price as it does for land transfer deals.        
	According to Uppal, the best route will be to follow the global practice of charging a market price for spectrum and then allowing the operator to either retain or resell it.        
	Since 2003, the telecom regulator has been lobbying for spectrum trading with the department of telecom (DoT), which has, however, always rejected the idea.         
	DoT officials said, If telecom operators are permitted to trade in radiowaves, some of them might shift from providing telecom services to only trading in spectrum, creating greater shortage of the scarce resource.         
	Spectrum trading could also lead to hoarding and the artificial pricing of the resource, making it more expensive, they added.         
	The DoT does not allow spectrum sharing among telecom service providers, although they can share infrastructure and mobile network, including towers.        
	Countries such as New Zealand, the US, Australia and Singapore allow spectrum trading in varying degrees.         
	In 2004, during the Olympics, Sydneys telecom network came under pressure because of a sudden increase in the number of people using it. The city was able to meet the unexpected rise in traffic through spectrum trading.         
	Spectrum trading can be implemented in conjunction with any of these primary assignment mechanisms  auction or first come, first served basis  to increase the economic efficiency of the assignment, feel researchers at Analysys, a UK-based telecom consultancy firm.        
	Trading will ensure that the limited spectrum is always put to best use, said Trai officials. The regulator plans to hire a consultant, who will advise it on the need, timing and approach to spectrum trading.

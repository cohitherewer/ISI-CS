          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           FUELLING HOPES                                  
	Mumbai, April 6: The recent move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to suck out liquidity under the market stabilisation scheme and the government borrowing programme has tempered expectations of an immediate hike in the cash reserve ratio.         
	On Friday, the central bank announced various auction programmes to mop up close to Rs 13,000 crore through the issue of bonds under the stabilisation scheme and the sale of treasury bills. These are over and above the sale of two securities from the Government of India worth Rs 10,000 crore.         
	The announcements came on a day when inflation touched a more-than-three-year high of 7 per cent.         
	High inflation had generated expectations of the RBI hiking up the reserve ratio by half a percentage point from 7.5 per cent. The cash reserve ratio is that portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the central bank.         
	Excess liquidity in the system is now at around Rs 40,000 crore, and it is estimated that a 50-basis-point hike in the reserve ratio will suck out more than Rs 16,000 crore.         
	However, with the auction announcements, banking and bond market circles see the move as an indication of the RBIs unwillingness to hit the panic button through the reserve ratio increase or a repo rate hike.         
	For now, other tools are being used to suck out liquidity. The RBI may prefer to wait for more data before it comes out with a cash reserve ratio hike, an official from a private sector bank said.         
	He added that a hike, if any, could come on April 29 when the central bank announces its monetary policy.         
	According to bankers, since the high rate of inflation is caused by supply side factors, there is no need for the central bank to come out with monetary measures targeted at the demand side, such as the raising of interest rates.         
	Economists are divided over whether the recent moves by the government to improve supplies will bring down inflation. Some believe inflation can moderate in the days ahead, but others see the pressure on prices to remain. A couple of foreign banks have forecast that average inflation in this fiscal can breach 6 per cent.         
	While global crude oil prices are firm, in India, they have not been fully passed on to the end users. So inflation is under-stated to that effect, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil.

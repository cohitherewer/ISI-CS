          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: Hindustan Motors (HM) today launched a mini truck  the Winner. It will be manufactured at the companys Uttarpara plant in Hooghly district.        
	At the launch, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke of his governments efforts to develop the automobile industry.        
	There was a serious setback when the Tatas left Singur. We tried our best to persuade them. But everyone knows the circumstances in which they had to leave. But we have to try again. Bengal needs the auto industry for future development. I thank C.K. Birla for what he has done under these (global meltdown) circumstances, he said.        
	HMs Winner is very different from the Nano, which the Tatas had planned to make in Singur before shifting the plant to Sanand in Gujarat.        
	The company plans to manufacture 12,000 units a year, compared with the planned production of 350,000 units of the Nano. However, the figures cannot be compared as the two automobiles are in separate categories. The Winner could bring HM back in the black.        
	HM managing director R. Santhanam said in addition to manufacturing the Winner and Ambassador, the company was also focussing on the component business in the state. The company is investing Rs 78 crore in the business.        
	The recent meltdown has, however, hit the company hard. It recorded a steep drop in sales over the last three months.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Indian economy braved the global financial crisis to grow 7.6 per cent in the second quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal.        
	By comparison, the US economy shrank 0.5 per cent during this period. The Japanese economy contracted 0.1 per cent, while UK growth also fell 0.5 per cent between July and September.        
	Growth in India in the first quarter was also high at 7.92 per cent, while it was 9.34 per cent in the second quarter of 2007-08, when the global financial chill was just a blip on the horizon.         
	Arvind Virmani, chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, said, I am confident that the economy will grow by 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent during 2008-09.        
	However, the Mumbai terror attacks may prove to be a damper. Analysts said there could be pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates.        
	Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi said growth in services was likely to slow down, particularly in hotel, construction and transport. So I expect GDP (gross domestic product) in the second half to slow down and the growth rate for the current fiscal is likely to be between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent.        
	Policy-makers have taken a slew of measures in recent weeks to improve growth, including sharp cuts in interest rates and banks reserve requirements. The analysts see the central bank acting again soon to lift sentiments hit by the Mumbai attacks.        
	Industry chamber Ficci said, We should make every effort to push up the growth rate in the coming months by aggressively pursuing large scale infrastructure projects, deeper cuts in interest rates and infusing liquidity.        
	Among the sectors to do well is construction. It grew 9.7 per cent in the second quarter compared with 11.8 per cent a year ago.         
	The services and the financial segments also fared well. In services, trade, hotels, transport and communication rose 10.8 per cent, marginally down from the growth rate of 11 per cent in the second quarter of the last fiscal.         
	Growth in the financial segment was 9.2 per cent compared with 12.4 per cent a year ago. Agriculture and allied sectors grew 2.7 per cent compared with 4.7 per cent a year ago. Mining and quarrying growth fell to 3.9 per cent from 5.5 per cent.         
	Manufacturing growth fell to 5 per cent from 9.2 per cent in the second quarter of the previous fiscal.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          BUMPY RIDE                                  
	New Delhi, June 28: Car companies, which are reeling under the pressure of costlier inputs, have written to the government raising concern about cheap imports from developed countries.         
	In a letter written to the government, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has expressed concern over several clauses in the World Trade Organisations revised Non-Agriculture Market Access (Nama) draft modalities text.         
	The auto industry is likely to be impacted, if certain proposals in the draft text are finalised in the ministerial meeting to be held on July 21 at Geneva. The industry has opposed any kind of sector-specific tariff elimination agreement.        
	The proposal on initiatives for the elimination of tariffs in specific sectors is in complete breach of the mandate that these initiatives are merely a supplementary and non-mandatory modality, said the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (Acma).         
	The SIAM also warned against selective automotive non-tariff barriers besides any proposal to allow free trade of remanufactured goods.         
	Trade in used vehicle, under any name, is essentially trans-boundary movement of waste of a country and governments should not encourage trade of such vehicles. As such countries should be free to decide how they want to treat different types of used products and not to be forced through WTO mandate and such products should not be treated as new under any circumstances, it said.         
	Indian industry believes that re-manufactured goods are cheap second-hand items in the garb of a respectable name and has for long opposed their import on grounds that they will hit domestic manufacturing.        
	Stating that such a proposal may even spoil the investment climate, Arvind Saxena, president, Hyundai Motors India Limited (HMIL), said, many automobile companies have made huge investments in the country. If cleared such a proposal will just kill indigenous manufacturers and lower the morale of others who are waiting to invest.         
	At a meeting organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) a few months back, Rahul Khullar, additional secretary in the ministry of commerce amp; industry and Indias chief negotiator at the WTO, had said industry would have to ask itself whether India would have an export interest in such goods.         
	The re-manufacturing industry in the US is worth $4 billion to $5 billion and these units are eligible for local tax benefits given under the guise of sustainable manufacturing. Afghanistan, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Sri Lanka have already opened up to remanufactured automobiles. However, in India, the SIAM and Acma are unified in their opposition to opening up the country to such imports.

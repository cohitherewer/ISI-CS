   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
        
	Mumbai, Jan. 9: Kumar Mangalam Birla is stepping up his presence in Aditya Birla Nuvo Limited (ABNL). The company will raise Rs 4,000 crore through a preferential issue to promoters that will raise the latters stake by 11 per cent.
 
	The promoters hold a little over 39 per cent in the company and, therefore, the preferential offer should see their stake nearing the majority mark. 
 
	ABNL has diverse interests, ranging from viscose filament yarn to branded garments, fertilisers and insurance. 
 
	ABNL today said the offer was being made to enhance its long-term financial resources and strengthen its financial structure. Close to 2.05 crore warrants will be issued to the promoters who will get one share of the company against each warrant in 18 months from the date of allotment. ABNL, however, did not disclose the price at which the warrants would be issued. It will be seeking shareholders permission at an extra-ordinary general meeting to be held on February 6 for this purpose.
 
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Adesh Gupta, wholetime director of ABNL, said the company needed funds for many of its businesses that were growing. 
 
	We are a growing company. The insurance, garment, business process outsourcing (BPO) and other businesses need funds and so the preferential offer, he added.
 
	News of the preferential offer gave a boost to the ABNL scrip on the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, the share ended with a gain of nearly 9 per cent at Rs 2,314.30. 
 
	Market observers said the development indicated the confidence of the promoters in the company. 
 
	During the second quarter of this year, the companys consolidated revenues at Rs 3,000 crore rose 43 per cent from Rs 2,092.1 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year. Revenues from its subsidiaries and joint ventures saw a gain of 74 per cent at Rs 2082.8 crore. 
 
	However, consolidated net profit at Rs 47.8 crore was lower by 38 per cent because of the gestating nature of businesses that included life insurance and BPO. 
 
	In recent times, the company had been sniffing opportunities in telecom. Regaining market share in life insurance and enhancing BPO capacities are its other priorities.

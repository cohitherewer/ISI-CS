          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: Daiichi Sankyos deal to acquire Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has run into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) turning down a proposal to close the transaction through a block deal on the bourses.        
	The share purchase is now likely to be executed through an off-market deal.        
	However, observers said the Ranbaxy promoters would have to pay capital gains tax if they opted to close the transaction through this route.        
	It is understood that the market regulator was approached after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs cleared the deal with the rider that the transaction should be routed through the stock exchanges.        
	A major factor responsible for the development is the huge difference in the price that Daiichi will pay for the deal over Ranbaxys current market price, thereby violating the existing rules governing block deals.         
	According to the agreement, Daiichi was to acquire Ranbaxy shares at a price of Rs 737 per share.         
	The stock closed on the BSE today at Rs 266.35.        
	The regulations stipulate that a block deal in a particular scrip can be transacted at a price variation of only one per cent on either side. Sebi is learnt to have said that it would not waive that condition to allow the Ranbaxy deal to go through the bourses.

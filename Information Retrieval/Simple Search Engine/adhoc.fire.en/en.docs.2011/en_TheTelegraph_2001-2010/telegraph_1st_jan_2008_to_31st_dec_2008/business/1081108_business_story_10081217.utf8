          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: Infrastructure grew 5.1 per cent in September, much higher than the 2.3 per cent growth rate in August.        
	However, this was still lower than the 5.8 per cent growth rate of September 2007.        
	Analysts said the economy would grow at a slower rate this year because of the global financial crisis, and the central bank might have to cut interest rates further to boost industrial activity.        
	Infrastructure industries have a weight of 26.7 per cent in the index of industrial production (IIP). The industrial index for September will be released in the next few days.        
	Growth in core industries dipped in August, dragging IIP to 1.3 per cent and evoking strong criticism from finance minister P. Chidambaram who had questioned the reliability of the data.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said, The core sector figures indicate that the industry is on a growth path, and the IIP data to be released next week will only confirm that.        
	He said growth in September was because of the fiscal and monetary steps taken by the policy-makers, adding that there could be more interest rate cuts.        
	The slowdown in industrial activity has forced the RBI to ease interest rates to improve liquidity. The central bank has lowered its overall growth forecast to around 7.5 per cent for the year from 8 per cent estimated earlier.                                
	In its latest forecast of global trends, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered Indias growth for 2008 to 7.8 per cent, 0.1 percentage points less than its October projection. It said Indias growth rate will slow down to 6.3 percent in 2009 compared with its October forecast of 6.9 per cent.        
	According to N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth, The recent events in the global financial markets and the consequent reactions in both monetary and fiscal policies across the world and in India are expected to bring down the cost of production. But the length of the current industrial slowdown can be much longer than initially anticipated as there are recessionary fears in most of the trading countries such as the US and the EU.         
	Crude output fell 0.7 per cent in September. Refinery growth was down to 2.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent in September 2007, while finished carbon steel grew 5.8 per cent compared with 9.5 per cent growth a year ago.        
	However, coal output grew to 10.7 per cent from 6.3 per cent, while cement rose 7.9 per cent from 5.4 per cent a year ago. Electricity growth was marginal at 4.4 per cent against 4.3 per cent a year ago.        
	The growth momentum has been weakening and that slowdown in growth has been spreading from light industry to heavy industry. With overall industrial production figures also showing a declining trend, it is now imperative that improving growth becomes the focus of all policy actions, Amit Mitra, secretary-general of Ficci said.

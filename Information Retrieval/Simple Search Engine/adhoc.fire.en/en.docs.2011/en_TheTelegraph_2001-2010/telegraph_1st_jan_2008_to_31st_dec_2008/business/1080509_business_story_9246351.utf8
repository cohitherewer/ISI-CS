The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks, rupee take a tumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stocks, rupee take a tumble
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 8: Surging crude oil prices had its impact on the rupee and stock markets today with the Indian currency falling to a one-year low of Rs 41.77 against the dollar and shares falling for the fourth straight session.         
	The 30-share BSE sensex shed close to 259 points with weak global cues adding to investor woes.         
	After resuming sharply lower at 41.60 a dollar from its last close of 41.36, the Indian currency plummeted to a days low of 41.79 to the dollar.        
	It was export proceeds and profit booking by some banks at this level that saw the rupee gaining marginally to finish at 41.77 per dollar, a sharp drop of 41 paise over its previous close. If the surge in crude oil prices continue, then we can see the rupee breaching the Rs 42-per-dollar mark, an analyst with a private sector bank said.        
	The sensex lost 258.66 points today before settling at 17080.65. The Nifty, too, tumbled about 54 points and closed at 5081.70.         
	The operating expenses will go up for those industries which use crude oil derivatives, which in turn affects profitability and the stocks, D.D. Sharma, senior vice-president (equity) of Anand Rathi Securities told The Telegraph.

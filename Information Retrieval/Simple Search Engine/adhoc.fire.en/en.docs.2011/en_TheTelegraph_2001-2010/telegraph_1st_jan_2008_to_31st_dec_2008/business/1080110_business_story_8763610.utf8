     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: German luxury car maker Audi AG today showcased its new midsize salon A4, which will be launched in the country by June this year. 
    
	The company is planning to assemble the A4 locally. It will also assemble its Rs 41-lakh mid-sized luxury sedan A6 at its facility in Aurangabad.
    
	Starting our own production there is the best way to adequately serve a promising market like India, said Audi chairman Rupert Stadler. 
    
	India is one of the components of our Strategy 2015, which aims to achieve worldwide sales of 1.5 million automobiles per year. We want to be the most successful premium brand in India as well, he added.
    
	The company plans to roll out 7,000 units of the A6 and the A4 each by 2015.
    
	Audi operates in the country through Audi India, which is a division of Volkswagen Group Sales India. Audi has been a nearly wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group since 1964. 
    
	The A4 will come in two variants  A4 2.0 T and A4 3.2. A two-litre, four-cylinder direct fuel injection engine will power the salon. The A4 has an all-wheel drive with six-speed manual transmission.

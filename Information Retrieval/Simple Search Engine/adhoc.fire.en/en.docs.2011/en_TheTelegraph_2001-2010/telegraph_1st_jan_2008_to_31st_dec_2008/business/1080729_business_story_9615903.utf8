          A STAFF REPORTER                          Harsh M. Gupta in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 28: Rossell Tea Ltd is betting big on the aviation and hospitality sectors.        
	The tea company produces over 4.26 million kg annually from five gardens, of which 3.3 million kg is high-value orthodox variety.        
	Our core business still remains tea. Last year, we broke the Rs 100-per-kg barrier with an average price of Rs 104.10 per kg. But we want to diversify our product basket, said Harsh M. Gupta, executive chairman, Rossell Tea Ltd.        
	The company started its aviation business two years ago through Aerotech Services. It also acquired Hyderabad-based Sigma Microsystems Pvt Ltd, engaged in the manufacturing, designing and the development of aviation equipment. It is now in advanced talks with another Bangalore-based company involved in aircraft designing.        
	We want to provide support for the repair and maintenance of various aircraft systems. So, we are looking at the design, development and production of various aircraft systems and embedded software technology, said Gupta.        
	The company is also interested in setting up a flying training institute.        
	Recently, Rossell Tea entered into a 60:40 joint venture with Lemon Tree Hotels to set up four-star hotels.        
	We plan to set up 10 hotels in the next one to two years. Our first hotel project is in Bangalore, a 187-room property which will be operational by July next year. We are looking at a 200-room property in Chennai at an investment of Rs 100 crore, Gupta said.        
	Of the 10 hotels Rossell plans to have, one or two will be five-star properties. The company is in talks with international hospitality majors for management contracts.        
	Rossell is also looking to enter the fast food business and is exploring tie-ups with international companies.

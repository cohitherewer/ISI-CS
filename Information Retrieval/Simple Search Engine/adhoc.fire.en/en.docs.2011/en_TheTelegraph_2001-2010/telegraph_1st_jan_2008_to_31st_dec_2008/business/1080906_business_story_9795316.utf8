          OUR BUREAU                          Y.V. Reddy in Mumbai on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 5: Outgoing Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy  widely regarded as a monetary hawk  today said he would have raised interest rates higher if he had his way.         
	This is the first time that Reddy has admitted that he didnt have a free hand in deciding monetary policy.         
	The candid comment was made after he handed over reins of the central bank to Duvvuri Subbarao.         
	Reddy, who was the RBI governor for five years, had been instrumental in raising the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 450 basis points and the repo rate by 300 basis points since 2004 to control inflation.         
	The former RBI governor said he would have ideally liked to cut the CRR and even the statutory liquidity ratio.         
	Reddy admitted that the central bank was forced to hike CRR during his tenure because of soaring inflation.         
	During Reddys tenure, there was a great deal of talk on Mint Road that the central bank and North Block were at variance over strong measures such as interest rate hikes and the managing of public debt.         
	Reddy said the RBI had wanted to bring down CRR to three per cent in the medium term from the present level of nine per cent.         
	He, however, reiterated that ignoring inflation would hurt growth.        
	During his tenure, Reddy managed to keep money supply under check, though his way of controlling it through interest rate hikes had not been very popular with the finance ministry.

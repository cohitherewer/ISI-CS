The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal notice to five tea gardens
                                                                                                               Bengal notice to five tea gardens
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ramesh: Action time                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: Bengal will issue showcause notices on Monday to five closed tea gardens for non-renewal of land lease. It will also invoke 16(E) of the Tea Act, which empowers the Tea Board to take over gardens that have been closed for more than three months and find new owners.        
	The notices will be issued to five gardens of Raipur, Bharnobari, Sikarpur, Dheklapara, and Syamsingh, which have not renewed their garden leases, said Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of state for commerce and industry. Four other gardens  Chamurchi, Red Bank, Kalchini and Raimatong  have moved the courts. Our legal team is looking into it and we are hoping for a speedy decision, he added.        
	Ramesh today met Bengal commerce minister Nirupam Sen, land and land revenue minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen. Each closed garden was reviewed in the meeting.        
	We will do a study on smaller tea growers of Bengal. There are 12,000 small growers, of which only 3,000 are registered with the Tea Board. They account for 25 per cent of Bengals tea production. The land revenue department will do the survey in three months and the additional cost will be borne by the Tea Board, said Sen.        
	Tea fund        
	Bengal tea growers are facing a unique problem in accessing the special purpose tea fund instituted by the Centre. Tea growers in the state are not the owners of the garden land but have taken it on lease from the government.        
	e-auction        
	The e-auction system will be piloted from Calcutta from December 2008.

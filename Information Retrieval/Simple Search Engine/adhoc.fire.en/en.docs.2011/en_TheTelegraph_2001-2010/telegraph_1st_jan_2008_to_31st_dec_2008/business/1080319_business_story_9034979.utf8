          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Confidence Petroleum chairman and managing director Nitin Khara (left) and Energtek CEO Lev Zaidenberg in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, March 18: Nagpur-based LPG and CNG cylinder manufacturer Confidence Petroleum India Ltd today entered into a 50:50 joint venture with US firm Energtek Inc to introduce adsorbed natural gas (ANG) technology in the country.         
	Confidence has picked up for Rs 100 crore a 50 percent stake in Energteks subsidiary Primecyl, whose subsidiary Confi Energtek Asia Ltd will undertake the operations in India and Southeast Asia.        
	The company said the ANG technology would be safer and cheaper than CNG and LPG.         
	We are planning to establish ourselves in the natural gas segment. The joint venture is a step towards achieving our goals. Natural gas is the most practical alternative motor fuel. We plan to make the ANG technology available across all small and major cities of India, said Confidence Petroleum chairman and managing director Nitin Khara.        
	The ANG technology uses activated carbon inside a tank to absorb a greater amount of gas. The technology helps store similar volumes of gas at a pressure lower than that for CNG and LPG. The technology also reduces refuelling cost. Lower pressure allows the vehicle to increase driving range without increasing the size of the tank.         
	ANG cylinders will cost Rs 15 per kilogram against Rs 45 for commercial LPG cylinders. Each cylinder will have three litres of gas. A customer will get two cylinders while buying an ANG compatible two-wheeler. Each new cylinder after that will cost Rs 60, a Confidence Petroleum official told The Telegraph.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: Retail investors subscribing to Reliance Powers IPO will be entitled to a discount of Rs 20 per share to the issue price. The initial public offering of 22.8 crore shares to the public opens on January 15 and will close on January 18.         
	The price will be decided through the book-building process. Reliance Power has fixed a price range of Rs 405 to Rs 450 per share. The company has reserved 30 per cent of the shares for retail investors.        
	Reliance Power will be the first private sector company to offer a discount to retail shareholders after the Securities and Exchange Board of India allowed companies to do so.         
	The company has also offered the facility of making a part-payment at the time of an application.        
	Reliance Power chairman Anil Ambani said the shares of the company were likely to be listed in the first week of February. The company has decided not to go for a pre-IPO placement though it has received a number of requests.        
	We couldnt have picked a better time to create history, Ambani said about the countrys largest IPO. Last year, realty player DLF raised Rs 9187.5 crore, which is the largest IPO till date.

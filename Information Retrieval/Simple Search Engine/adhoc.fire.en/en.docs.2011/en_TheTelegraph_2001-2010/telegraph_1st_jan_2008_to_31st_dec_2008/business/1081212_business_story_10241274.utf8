          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 11: The Centre today withdrew its affidavit in Bombay High Court pertaining to the dispute between Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) over gas supply from the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	It will instead make a written submission to the court.        
	Mohan Parasaran, the additional solicitor-general who is appearing on behalf of the government, said the affidavit was being withdrawn to speed up the legal proceedings.        
	In its affidavit filed last month, the government had said RIL wouldnt be permitted to sell KG basin gas at a price less than $4.20 per million British thermal units (mBtu).        
	The dispute arose because Anil Ambani-owned RNRL claimed that it had an understanding with RIL, under the terms of the demerger of the Reliance group in 2005, that it would have to pay just $2.34 per mBtu.        
	Justice J.N. Patel suggested that the government could withdraw its affidavit and simply assist the court through a written submission.         
	Parasaran accepted the offer and said he would withdraw all the affidavits filed by the government.        
	Ram Jethmalani, counsel for RNRL, was expected to cross-examine S. M. Sundaram, under secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas. However, this did not happen.        
	The case has been adjourned to January 12.

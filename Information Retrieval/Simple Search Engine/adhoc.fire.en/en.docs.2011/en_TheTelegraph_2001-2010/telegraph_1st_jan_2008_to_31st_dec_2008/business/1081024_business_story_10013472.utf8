	Mumbai, Oct. 23: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today reported a 7.3 per cent increase in net profits at Rs 4,122 crore for the second quarter ended September 30 even as its refining margins weakened.        
	The net profits were higher than analysts forecasts of a net profit of Rs 3,800 crore to Rs 4,000 crore for the quarter.        
	Profit from processing every barrel of crude oil declined to $13.4 from $15.7 a year earlier  but it was still much higher than the regional benchmark of $6.89 in Singapore.        
	Observers who track the company said the profit growth of 7.43 per cent was the slowest in the past 10 quarters.

	Reliance said it managed to sustain margins in the refining segment on account of its efficient sourcing of crude oil, ability to produce globally accepted products and flexibility in its crude bucket.        
	RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said, It has been an exciting quarter at Reliance Industries. We have started production of oil from the Krishna-Godavari basin and are at the final leg of capital expenditure in our key businesses Leading economies across the globe are passing through some unprecedented times. Our businesses are gearing to meet these emerging challenges.        
	During the first half, turnover of RIL rose 38 per cent to Rs 89,163 crore. The company said 36 per cent of the rise was because of an increase in prices and 2 per cent came from volumes. On the other hand, net profit for the six-month period rose 10 per cent to Rs 8,232 crore.        
	Its exports rose 57 per cent to Rs 58,180 crore ($12.4 billion) during the six months ended September 30.        
	RIL said refining and marketing revenues rose 50 per cent in the first six months of the fiscal to Rs 68,980 crore, mainly because of high product prices driven by high crude oil prices.        
	Shares of RIL, which announced the results after trading hours today, dropped 7.62 per cent to close at Rs 1,215.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in a weak market.        
	RIL said its share in Tapti block production registered strong growth, while that in Panna-Mukta block declined because of a shutdown in June.        
	Meanwhile, officials from Reliance denied reports that Chevron Corporation had been in talks with the company to sell its 5 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL).         
	RPL shares had come under pressure on reports that Chevron was selling its stake to Reliance at Rs 60 per share.

   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
   
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: Iran today invited Indian companies to invest in developing oilfields.
 
	Indian private and public sector companies can invest in developing gas fields in the country (Iran), Davood Danesh Jafari, Irans economic affairs and finance minister, said after a meeting with petroleum minister Murli Deora here. Sources said the Iran government was keen on Indian companies setting up gas plants in the country under a buyback arrangement.
 
	LNG deal
 
	Jafari said a solution to implement the LNG deal should be arrived at by the two countries. Deora, too, was optimistic that the LNG deal could be worked out.
 
	A contract was signed in 2005 between New Delhi and Tehran for supply of 5 million tonnes per year of LNG by Iran. However, the deal ran into trouble over pricing issues.
 
	India had asked Iran to supply LNG at a price of $3.215 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) as decided in June 2005. New Delhi was willing to pay a higher price for an additional 2.5mt a year of LNG. Tehran, however, was willing to honour the June 2005 price only if the additional gas was bought at $7.92 per mBtu to average the price at $4.78 per mBtu.

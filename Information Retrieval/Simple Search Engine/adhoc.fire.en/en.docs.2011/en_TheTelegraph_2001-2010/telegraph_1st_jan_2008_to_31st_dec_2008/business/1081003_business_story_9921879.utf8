          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Pandey: New stance                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The petroleum ministry wants state-run oil firms to adopt a consortium approach in bidding for overseas assets, enabling them to offer large sums and snuff out competition from Chinese firms.        
	Oil PSUs should also share intelligence on possible takeover targets. This was conveyed by petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey last week to the chiefs of oil firms.         
	In the race for oil and gas blocks with Indian companies, the Chinese firms have emerged winners.        
	ONGC Videsh Limited, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, lost out in the bid for Canadian firm Encanas properties in Ecuador when a Chinese consortium bid $1.42 billion. It also lost PetroKazakhstan  a Canadian firm with a base in Kazakhstan  to China National Petroleum Corp.         
	In Angola, too, a Chinese firm beat ONGC Videsh for a 50 per cent stake in an oil block.        
	Sources said Pandey was worried over the pace of progress of overseas projects. State-owned firms have invested Rs 32,000 crore in 80 blocks located in about 22 countries, of which production has commenced in just 11 blocks of ONGC Videsh.        
	Apart from the state-owned entities, private players such as Reliance and Essar have picked up stakes in overseas oil and gas blocks. Essar has projects in Vietnam, Myanmar, Madagascar and Nigeria, while Reliance has presence in Oman, East Timor, Australia, Peru, Columbia, Kurdistan and Yemen.        
	Yesterday, the consortium of Videocon and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited said they had discovered a hydrocarbon field in offshore Brazil. The duo had acquired a Brazilian oil exploration firm last month for $165 million.         
	At the meeting with the oil chiefs, the government had proposed bringing other PSUs on board during bidding. The consortium could have a tie-up with fertiliser, power and chemical firms. During biding, the consortium can promise additional investments from these firms.        
	Pandey also suggested a joint working group for synergy and co-ordination. Indian embassies overseas can also provide support.        
	Seventy-eight per cent of Indias crude oil requirements are met by imports, and this will go up to 90 per cent by 2030.

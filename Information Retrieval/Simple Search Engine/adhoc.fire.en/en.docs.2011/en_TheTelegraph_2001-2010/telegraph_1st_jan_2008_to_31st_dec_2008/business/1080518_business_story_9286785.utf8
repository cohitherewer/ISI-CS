	Mumbai, May 17: Baja Auto Ltd will bring Kawasakis 150cc sports bike to India next year.         
	The Pune-based company has a technical tie-up with Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan to launch its two-wheelers in the country.        
	Since the tie-up was inked in 1986, Bajaj Auto has launched the KB100, KB RTZ, KB125, 4S, 4S Champion, Boxer, Caliber, Caliber115, Wind125 and the Kawasaki Bajaj Eliminator, the cruiser bike, here. Kawasaki today confirmed a report in Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun that the 150cc bike would be sold in India from next year.         
	India is now the second largest market for two-wheelers in the world. Though Honda Motor Company now dominates the countrys two-wheeler market, a host of foreign players have recently evinced interest to enter the country with their products.         
	Apart from Harley-Davidson, the Italian bike maker Ducati recently launched five bikes in India.

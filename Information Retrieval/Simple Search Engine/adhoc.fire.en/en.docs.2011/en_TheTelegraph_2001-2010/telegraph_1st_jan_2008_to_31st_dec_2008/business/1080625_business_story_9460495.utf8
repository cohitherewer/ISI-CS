	Mumbai, June 24: The stock markets extended their losses for the fifth day in a row today with the benchmark sensex losing over 180 points to close at 14106.58 after plunging below the 14K-level during intra-day for the first time since August last year.        
	The 50-share Nifty on the National Stock Exchange also lost nearly 2 per cent to close below the key 4,200-level at 4191.10 points.        
	The 30-share sensex settled at 14106.58, a fall of 186.74 points, or 1.31 per cent. The barometer, which had lost a total of 1590.32 points, or 10.13 per cent, in the past five straight sessions, oscillated in a range of 14432.90 and 13991.31, reflecting high volatility in trade.        
	Metal stocks continued to be heavy losers with the index closing the day lower by 3.52 per cent, the highest for any index today. Technology, IT, fmcg and psu also bore the brunt of selling and were down by over 2 per cent.        
	Scrip-wise, Hindustan Unilever, which closed lower by 5.32 per cent, was the worst hit among sensex group. Tata Steel followed at 4.6 per cent.        
	Dealers said the sensex rose early on some short coverings by operators ahead of the expiry of June contract on Thursday. However, fears of inflation soaring further and harsher interest rates withdrew investors from stocks, they added.

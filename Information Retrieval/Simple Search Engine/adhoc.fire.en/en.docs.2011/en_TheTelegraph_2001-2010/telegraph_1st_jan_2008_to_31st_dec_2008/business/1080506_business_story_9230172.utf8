          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S.K. Goel in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury                                  
	Calcutta, May 5: Uco Bank has posted a net profit of Rs 412 crore for 2007-08 against Rs 316 crore in the previous fiscal. The banks profits were bolstered by a record recovery of Rs 850 crore worth of bad loans.        
	Net profit from domestic operations grew 418.75 per cent to Rs 83 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal compared with Rs 16 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.         
	A very good recovery from bad loans added to our profitability and a lower slippage in fresh lending (compared with recovery) during the last quarter of 2007-08 helped us make less provisioning under the prudential norms. Both these improved our profits, said chairman and managing director S.K. Goel.        
	Better recovery and a lower slippage in loans in 2007-08 also improved the asset quality of the bank. Gross non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank stood at 2.97 per cent of total advances at the end of March this year compared with 3.17 per cent a year ago. Net NPA was 1.98 per cent against 2.14 per cent on March 31, 2007.        
	However, the banks profitability from overseas branches dipped 80 per cent to Rs 3 crore from Rs 15 crore during January-March 2006-07.        
	Uco Banks total business during 2007-08 increased to Rs 1,35,536 crore from Rs 1,12,331 crore a year ago. Total deposits stood at Rs 79,909 crore against Rs 64,860 crore and gross advances increased to Rs 55,627 crore from Rs 47,471 crore.        
	We are looking at 22 per cent growth in deposits and a 20 per cent increase in advances during this financial year, said Goel. As its capital adequacy ratio at 10.09 per cent is marginally above the stipulated 9 per cent, the bank needs to raise capital immediately to stem its business growth.         
	We consciously went about slow growth in lending in 2007-08 because our capital restructuring plan didnt get the governments ascent before March 31. However, the finance ministry has given its approval to our Rs 625-crore capital restructuring plan in April, said Goel.         
	Under this plan, we proposed to raise Rs 325 crore through perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to qualified institutional investors and convert Rs 300 crore of the governments equity holding in the bank into preference capital.

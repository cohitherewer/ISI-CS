	Mumbai, June 28 (pti): Public sector lender Bank of Baroda (BoB) today decided to increase its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) by 0.5 per cent to 13.25 per cent.        
	The banks plr will go up from the existing 12.75 per cent and the new rate will be effective from July 1, the bank said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The lending rate revision will lead to an increase in plr-related lendings such as floating home loan, corporate loan and car loan.        
	The announcement came after major public sector lenders  the State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank  raised their plrs by 0.5 per cent to 12.75 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Similarly, Bangalore-based Canara Bank also hiked its plr by 0.5 per cent to 13.25 per cent.        
	The move also follows suit of a host of lenders such as hdfc Bank, Jammu amp; Kashmir Bank and Yes Bank, which hiked their respective plrs in the range of 0.25 per cent to one per cent to protect margins.        
	The rate hike comes in the wake of the Reserve Bank increasing its short-term lending rate and the mandatory level of deposit that banks are required to park with the central bank by 50 basis points each to contain inflation.

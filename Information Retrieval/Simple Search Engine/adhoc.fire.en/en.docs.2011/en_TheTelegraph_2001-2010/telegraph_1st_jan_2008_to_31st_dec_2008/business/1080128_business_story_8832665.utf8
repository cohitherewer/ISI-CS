The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil bonds knock on EPFO door
                                                                                                            Oil bonds knock on EPFO door
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY R. SURYAMURTHY                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The government plans to allow the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and other pension funds to invest in oil and food bonds, with the aim of giving them new instruments to shore up declining earnings.         
	This move, analysts said, will also help to perk up the bond market in the country. However, an EPFO board member expressed doubts about the move.        
	Senior finance ministry officials said the procedural hurdles that prevented the entities from investing in oil and food bonds issued to state-run oil marketing companies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) were being removed.        
	The officials said they had clarified that these bonds had sovereign status, and the EPFO did not have to go about seeking permission from various ministries to invest in them.         
	Under current norms, the EPFO is allowed to invest 25 per cent of its corpus in government securities, 30 per cent in bonds of public sector units, 15 per cent in state development bonds and the remaining 30 per cent in a mix of all these three instruments.         
	The EPFO has a corpus of over Rs 1,60,000 crore for 2006-07.        
	On Thursday, the central board of trustees of the EPFO fixed the interest rate for its members at 8.5 per cent for 2007-08, the same as in the previous fiscal.        
	Mixed impact        
	According to Amit Mukherjee, a treasury manager of a nationalised bank, The problem with the bond market is that it is sluggish, and the entry of more players may quicken it.         
	But then there is also the danger that the EPFO being a long-term player will simply buy the bonds and keep it in a cold storage instead of trading in it.         
	W.R. Varada Rajan, a member of the EPFO board and a CITU leader, said the board would have no problems if the government bonds had a coupon rate which is more than the administered benchmark rate of 8.5 per cent for the funds.        
	However, we are doubtful if the government would provide such rates, he said.        
	The government has issued bonds worth Rs 11,256.92 crore to the three state-owned oil marketing companies as compensation for under-recoveries because of rising global crude oil prices.         
	These bonds will have a coupon rate of 7.95 per cent and mature in 2025.        
	Bonds worth Rs 6,362.25 crore had been issued to the Indian Oil Corporation, while Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited got Rs 2,539.13 crore and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Rs 2,355.54 crore.        
	Losses of the trio in 2007-08 for selling petroleum products below costs are estimated at Rs 70,000 crore.        
	FCI dues        
	The FCI is likely to receive dues of Rs 10,300 crore, in principal and interest, from the central government through supplementary allocations in the coming budget . This will be made in the allocations for 2008-09 as well as under allocations under revised estimates for 2007-08.         
	It has put on sale Rs 4,000 crore of bonds issued by the government.        
	Though the sensex bounced back last week after the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the bond market in the country did not respond to the sensex trend.        
	Traders said the yield on the 7.99- per-cent note due July 2017 fell 13.6 basis points this week to 7.41 per cent.        
	Despite talks of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following the US authorities by cutting its benchmark rates, the yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond dipped to 7.28 per cent in early trade on Wednesday, its lowest since January 2006, and closed at 7.39 per cent.        
	The bond yield could decline by another 10-15 basis point over the next few weeks, with the extent of gains depending on the stance laid out in the upcoming policy review of the RBI, a bond analyst said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cost quandary                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The government is planning to curtail diesel use by restricting the sale of big cars and introducing differential pricing for the fuel.        
	The petroleum ministry will soon seek cabinet approval to introduce an additional duty on large cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) and differential pricing of diesel. Curbs on diesel will benefit state-owned oil companies which are selling the fuel at a loss.        
	The ministry will seek higher diesel prices for industrial users and power plants. It will also seek an additional 25 per cent tax on large cars running on diesel, officials said.        
	In June, the government had imposed an additional specific duty ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 on large cars, SUVs and MUVs. However, the oil ministry feels the duties were not sufficient to deter the purchase of these big cars.         
	Officials said the petroleum ministry was in consultation with other ministries and would soon send a proposal to the cabinet.        
	Sources said the government was mulling an increase of diesel prices to Rs 57 a litre for bulk consumers from Rs 34.80 a litre now to reduce the losses of oil companies by about Rs 27,000 crore.        
	Sales to bulk users such as the railways, state transport corporations, defence agencies, power companies, fisheries and marine companies in April-July had grown 18 per cent.        
	If diesel is sold at market rates, the Indian Railways, state transport undertakings and the defence agencies, which account for 60 per cent of bulk sales, will have to pay Rs 15,600 crore extra every year.        
	According to analysts, the implementation of a differential pricing regime, when the price gap is large, will result in a large-scale diversion. It is unlikely that any of the bulk consumers are going to accept a dual pricing regime, sources said.

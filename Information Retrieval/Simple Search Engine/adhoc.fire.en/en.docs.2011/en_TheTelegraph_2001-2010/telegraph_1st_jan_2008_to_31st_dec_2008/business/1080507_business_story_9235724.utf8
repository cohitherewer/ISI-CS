	Calcutta, May 6: Planet M, the music retail store chain of Videocon Industries, plans to explore listing options next fiscal.        
	The company will enter the market to fund its plan of opening 500 stores every year for the next three years.         
	We will explore listing options. Videocon is a listed company and there is no reason why we should not follow the same route. However, a good part of our expansion will be funded by internal accruals. A decision on this will be firmed up in the next fiscal after we attain a critical mass of 500 to 600 stores, said Planet M Retail India chief executive officer Subir Ghosh.        
	The company has to invest around Rs 2,000 per square feet for each store of between 1,200 and 3,000 square feet.        
	Ghosh said Planet M aimed to become the largest entertainment and lifestyle retail chain in the country, diversifying into product ranges beyond entertainment.        
	The rentals are quite inflated at the moment and it is even more difficult and expensive to find property in central areas for our mega stores, said Ghosh.        
	Planet M has three store formats: the mega stores, which are more than 3,000 sq ft with a theme cafeteria; the super store, between 1,200 sq ft and 1,500 sq ft and neighbourhood stores, having area of between 300 sq ft and 500 sq ft.        
	The company is also willing to refurbish neighbourhood stores to suit the Planet M format.

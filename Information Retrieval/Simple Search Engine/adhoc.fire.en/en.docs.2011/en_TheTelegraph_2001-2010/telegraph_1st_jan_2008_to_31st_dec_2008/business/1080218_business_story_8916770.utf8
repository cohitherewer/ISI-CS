The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High revenues offer sop cushion
                                                                                                               High revenues offer sop cushion

	New Delhi, Feb. 17: High tax collections in this fiscal are expected to give the government sufficient room for duty sops to industries and allocations of funds to farming, rural employment and social sector schemes, according to officials of the finance ministry.        
	Revenues are forecast at Rs 6,00,000 crore for the fiscal compared with the last budgets estimate of Rs 5,48,122 crore.        
	However, the officials said the huge collections were unlikely to result in tax cuts for companies or individuals, except for the phasing out of some old surcharges or levies which make no sense now.         
	On the other hand, the collections could encourage the government to come out with a generous increase in salaries and wages of its employees, given that the general elections are in 2009. A pay commission is reviewing the issue now.        
	Buoyed by the excellent performance in revenues, the finance ministry is likely to set a target of a 18-20 per hike in taxes in the coming budget.        
	The large tax haul, which represents nearly 13 per cent of Indias gross domestic product (GDP), has come mostly on the back of a surge in direct tax collections, brought about by rapid growth.         
	Direct tax collections have grown 40 per cent and will account for nearly 55 per cent of all tax revenues. In the earlier years, indirect taxes were the bigger money grossers.         
	The officials said collections from income, corporate and service taxes would be about Rs 60,000 crore more than the target of Rs 2,70,109 crore set in the last budget.         
	According to D. Joshi, director of market rating agency Crisil, The economic boom has fuelled better tax collections for the Indian government. Profits have been up, the services sector has been growing at a rapid pace. All this means the government now has the ability to spend more.         
	The economy is growing at a rate of nearly 9 per cent, with the service sector posting double digit growth.         
	Better compliance, prompted by regulations that ensured the reporting of all high value purchases with the government, has also led to the higher collections, the officials said.        
	Recent moves of the income tax department to use identity-search technology to manage the swelling database of taxpayers will also lead to greater compliance.         
	The step will make tax evasion difficult and bring to book habitual defaulters.        
	The stock markets, too, have contributed to enlarging the tax kitty, with the securities transaction tax imposed on sharedeals growing by nearly 60 per cent.        
	In internal meetings, the officials said, finance minister P. Chidambaram has referred to a greater focus on direct taxes.         
	Service taxes have been growing at over 30 per cent and with service industry expanding at a faster pace than the overall economy this could be one area for tax expansion, they said.         
	The service sector in the advanced economies of western Europe, the US and the Far East accounts for 60-80 per cent of their GDP.         
	In India, too, the service sector will make up a greater proportion of the GDP in the future, they said.

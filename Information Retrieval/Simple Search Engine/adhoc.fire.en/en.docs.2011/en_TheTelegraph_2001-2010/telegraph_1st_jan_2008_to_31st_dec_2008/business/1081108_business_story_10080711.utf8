                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I-banks hand out pink slips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TROUBLED TIMES                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 7: Investment bankers in India are being showered by a confetti of pink slips.        
	Investment bank Goldman Sachs is the latest to announce job cuts in India after American Express, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse trimmed their payrolls last fortnight.        
	It is learnt that Goldman Sachs has cut nearly 10 per cent of its 2,300-strong workforce in India that work in the banks business process outsourcing (BPO), knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and investment banking businesses.         
	While confirming the job cuts, a Goldman Sachs public relations executive said, We dont have specific numbers. Goldman Sachs has announced that it will cut 10 per cent of its global workforce.        
	Goldman Sachs employs around 2,000 people in its BPO and KPO operations in Bangalore. The banks Mumbai office, which offers investment banking, asset management and portfolio management services, has just over 200 employees.         
	There were unconfirmed reports that Morgan Stanley had also reduced its headcount in India on Friday. Sources close to Morgan Stanley ruled out job cuts but added that the redundancies had been announced in the US.        
	The actual number of redundancies in India may not be as huge as in the US. The employee base is much smaller in India. But in percentage terms, the impact is practically the same, said a banker on the condition of anonymity.         
	It remains to be seen whether domestic investment banking and equity teams will also face redundancies as the global credit crisis deepens. Employees of global banks will continue to face the heat as lower levels of business activities bother the peddlers of high finance.        
	Fidelity jobs        
	Boston-based Fidelity Investments will cut nearly 1,300 jobs this month. More layoffs are coming early next year in response to declining markets that have eroded mutual fund assets along with the fees Fidelity earns from its core business. Fidelity has mutual funds in India.

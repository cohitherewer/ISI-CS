          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Glad tidings                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: The government has modified the external commercial borrowing (ECB) norms to allow service sector industries such as hotels, hospitals and software firms to take overseas loans of up to $100 million to import capital goods.        
	It has been decided that borrowers in the service sector such as hotels, hospitals and software companies may avail ECB up to $100 million to import capital goods under the approval route, a statement issued by the finance ministry said.        
	At present, borrowers in the service sector are not eligible for ECB under the automatic route. The liberalised ECB norms will be applicable after the Reserve Bank notifies the same.        
	Software firms, however, are not optimistic about the benefits of overseas borrowings. Although, it is a positive move, it would be beneficial only for large companies who are looking at debt to fund any merger or acquisition, said Vishnu R. Dusad, CEO of Nucleus Software Exports Limited. For small and medium software firms the need for debt is not high, he added.         
	Because of the fluctuations in the exchange rate, the interest rate difference  overseas borrowings are cheaper compared with domestic lending rates  will be negligible, Dusad said.        
	Analysts felt the move was aimed at increasing investments in the service sector.         
	According to the KPMG Business Outlook study, prospects for the Indian service sector are robust over the next one year. A majority of the service sector companies expect an increase in new business and revenues this year, the study said.

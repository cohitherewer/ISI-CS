The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Yahoo cool to Microsoft threat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yahoo cool to Microsoft threat
                            
	New York, April 7 (Reuters): Yahoo Inc, responding to a three-week deadline issued by Microsoft Corp to accept its $42-billion takeover bid, again rejected the deal for undervaluing the Web pioneer.        
	In a defiant open letter to Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer today, Yahoo said the software giants threat of a proxy battle was counterproductive and Yahoo would only be open to a better deal.        
	Our boards view of your proposal has not changed, said the letter, signed by Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock and chief executive Jerry Yang. We continue to believe that your proposal is not in the best interests of Yahoo and our stockholders, the letter added.        
	Ballmer on Saturday set a three-week deadline for Yahoo to agree to its cash-and-stock offer or risk seeing the bid lowered, citing a deteriorating economy and market for Internet stocks, as well as a decline in Yahoos share in the Web search and advertising business.        
	Yahoo countered that its business was in good shape and suggested the software giant should look to the value of its own enterprise. As a result of the decrease in your own stock price, the value of your proposal today is significantly lower than it was when you made your initial proposal, Yahoos letter said.        
	When Microsoft first announced its bid on February 1, the deal valued Yahoo at $31 per share, or $44.6 billion in total, representing a 62 percent premium to Yahoos market price. But a fall in Microsofts stock price means the proposal now values Yahoo at only $29.62 per share. Yahoo shares slipped 2.3 per cent to $27.69 in early Nasdaq trading. Microsoft shares rose 22 cents to $29.38, also on Nasdaq.        
	If the two sides agree to a deal, it would be the biggest takeover in the industry. But Yahoo directors  whom Microsoft hopes to convince to negotiate a friendly deal or else face a battle for their jobs at Yahoos next annual meeting  want more.        
	We have continued to make clear that we are not opposed to a transaction if it is in the best interests of our stockholders, the letter said. Any transaction must be at a value that reflects the value of Yahoo, including any strategic benefits to Microsoft, and on terms that provide certainty to our stockholders, it added.

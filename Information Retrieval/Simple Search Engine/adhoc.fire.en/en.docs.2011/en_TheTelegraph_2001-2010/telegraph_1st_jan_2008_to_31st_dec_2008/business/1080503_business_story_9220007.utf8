          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 2: Inflation has inched up to a three-and-a-half-year high of 7.57 per cent on the back of higher prices of some food items and manufacturing items such as cement and metal products.         
	The government is now mulling administrative steps to contain cement prices and has started income tax probe into commodity trading.         
	It is worried about the political fallout of rising prices, especially with a number of state elections to be fought this year. The BJP had called a nationwide strike today against spiralling prices. The Left parties, too, have taken to the streets.        
	Inflation has stayed above the 7-per-cent-mark for the last three weeks despite a range of fiscal and monetary measures taken by the government to cool down prices.        
	Industry minister Kamal Nath said, Measures have been taken to control prices. It will take three to four weeks for inflation to be tamed. Finance minister P. Chidambaram said at a press conference in Bangalore that more measures might be taken and asked people to be patient.         
	Chidambaram said government agencies, who buy grain to create a buffer stock and to sell to the poor through ration shops, have managed to procure up to 15.4 million tonnes (mt) of wheat and 23 mt of rice till now in this crop year which spans from July 2007 to August 2008. The agencies had managed to buy 8.2 mt of wheat last year at this time of the year.         
	Inflation will remain high for the next few weeks. But with chances that the annual May-August rains will be good, prices should start coming down. Steps taken by the government will also have an impact after a time lag, said D. Joshi, chief economist at rating agency Crisil.        
	He, however, said global food and commodity prices would continue to exert pressure. Everything will really hinge on a good monsoon. Officials, however, claimed a victory of sorts in its campaign to beat down steel prices. Steel secretary R.S. Pandey claimed retail prices of construction steel in domestic markets had slumped 16 to 19 per cent.         
	Income tax officials said that they had started probing commodity traders after investigations were launched by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Association into metal price rigging in commodity exchanges.

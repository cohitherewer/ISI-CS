          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Crude shock                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: Travel by Air India will cost Rs 300-550 more from June 3 following a hike in fuel surcharge in the wake of oil companies raising air turbine fuel (ATF) prices by 18.5 per cent.        
	Jitendra Bhargava, director of Air India, said the hike in fuel surcharge would be effective from June 3.        
	For air travel up to 750 km, the hike in fuel charges would be Rs 300, and above 750 km, it would be Rs 550, a spokesperson for the state-owned carrier said.        
	However, other airlines, including Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines, both private players, said they had not yet taken a decision on the issue.        
	Hit by surging crude, state-run oil companies today decided to raise ATF prices by 18.5 per cent.        
	This is the fourth straight hike in aviation turbine fuel prices since February 2007.         
	In Delhi, the ATF price will go up to Rs 69,227.08 per kilolitre (kl). Till today it was priced at Rs 58,387.92 per kl.        
	In Mumbai, which has the countrys busiest airport, jet fuel prices will go up to Rs 76,625.68 per kl from Rs 64,824.82 per kl.

	The UPA government is likely to take a call on an oil package, which could include marginal hike in fuel prices, duty rejig and oil bonds, next week.        
	Sources also said the Manmohan Singh government would wait for the two-day BJP national executive meet, beginning tomorrow, to be over, before raising fuel prices.         
	The Left parties, which are supporting the government from outside, have made it clear that they are against any increase in fuel prices.

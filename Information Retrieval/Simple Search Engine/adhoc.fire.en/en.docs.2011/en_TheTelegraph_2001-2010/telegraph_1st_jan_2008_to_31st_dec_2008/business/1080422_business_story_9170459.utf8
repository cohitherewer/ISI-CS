                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Maharashtra to cut jet fuel tax
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Happy flying                                  
	Mumbai, April 21: The Maharashtra government is set to reduce the value-added tax (VAT) on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to 4 per cent from 25 per cent in Mumbai and Pune to bring the tax on a par with the rest of the state.         
	Maharashtra will be the third state in the country to slash VAT on aviation fuel, but airlines are not planning any immediate cut in ticket prices.        
	We are reducing VAT on ATF by 21 basis points, which will scale it down from 25 per cent to 4 per cent for the Mumbai and Pune airports, state revenue minister Narayan Rane said.        
	The revenue department has already forwarded the proposal to the state finance minister. The proposal will be tabled at the next cabinet meeting where it is expected to get cleared, Rane added.        
	Last month, the Andhra Pradesh and the Kerala governments slashed VAT on aviation fuel. Maharashtra had followed suit by announcing in the state budget a cut in VAT on aviation fuel all over the state, except Mumbai and Pune.        
	Earlier this month, the state government had received a letter from the Union ministry of civil aviation requesting it to slash VAT on ATF in Mumbai and Pune also.        
	Domestic carriers across the country are feeling the heat of spiralling fuel prices.         
	Jet Airways, the countrys largest private airline, announced earlier this month that it was set to incur an additional expenditure of about $5 million to $6 million a month on account of the recent hike in (ATF) prices.         
	The airline consumes one-fourth of the total fuel used by airlines in India.         
	Jet Airways spokesperson Sreerupa Sen said the airline would not be able to comment on the issue till it received an official confirmation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Buybacks fail to lift sentiment
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Buybacks fail to lift sentiment
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         
	Mumbai, Sept. 7: Buybacks arent working. When the share market started foundering at the start of the year, several companies announced plans to buy back shares in an effort to shore up stock prices.         
	But a quick reality check says the stocks have continued to slide  with no sign that the tide will turn any time soon.         
	Eight companies are currently buying back shares. An analysis of data available with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reveals that in many cases the shares are either trading well below their maximum buyback price or are available at a discount to the stock price on the day that the companys board of directors cleared the buyback proposal.         
	In the past few years, a number of companies have announcing buyback plans because they felt the stock was undervalued.         
	Under the regulations, shares bought under a buyback programme have to be cancelled. This reduces the outstanding number of equity shares, thereby increasing the earnings per share which acts as a ballast to stock prices.         
	However, analysts say in the prevailing market conditions, share prices bounce immediately after a buyback announcement but this is not sustained for long. One should not expect that a buyback will lead to a consistent improvement in the value of a particular share. This depends on the sector that it belongs to and overall state of the equity markets, said a market maven.         
	Take the case of Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. Back in March, the Anil Ambani group company had announced a Rs 2000-crore share buyback programme that would be implemented in two phases with a maximum buyback price of Rs 1,600 per share. The stock is now ruling at Rs 1,041.70. At the time of the buyback, it was quoted at Rs 1,459 per share.         
	DLF, the real estate major, had recently announced a share buyback programme at a maximum price of Rs 600 per share. Although the stock spurted 15 per cent on the day after the announcement, it fell thereafter and is now ruling at Rs 494.         
	One analyst said the full impact of a buyback programme wasnt visible immediately. There have been instances where the stock has risen to the maximum buyback price after the offer has closed, he said.         
	The bad experience with buybacks hasnt deterred companies from announcing their own programmes. Companies such as ANG Auto Ltd, Gateway Distriparks, Goldiam International, Great Offshore, Gujarat Fluorochemicals (not in the chart), Patni Computer Systems, Reliance Infrastructure and SRF Ltd are some of those that are now buying back their shares at a maximum price ranging between Rs 85 and Rs 1,600 per share. The biggest buyback programme is worth Rs 800 crore.         
	Many more are entering the fray. Auto components major Bosch India recently announced a buyback plan for not more than 25 per cent of the capital and free reserves of the company at a price not exceeding Rs 4,500 a share.         
	Godrej Industries is also planning to launch a buyback programme.

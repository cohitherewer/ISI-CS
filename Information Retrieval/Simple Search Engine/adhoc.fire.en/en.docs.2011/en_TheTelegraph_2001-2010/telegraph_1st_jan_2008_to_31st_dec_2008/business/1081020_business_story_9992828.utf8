                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Q amp;A      Locker law
                                My elder brother, who was unmarried, died intestate. My elder brother and I jointly hold a locker in a nationalised bank. The key of the locker was with him and it couldnt be traced after his death. What should be done to get the key of the locker? Can I open the locker if the lost key is found? If the bank requires a succession certificate, can I claim to get the whole or half of the booty present in the locker?          Sudarshan Ghosh, Salt Lake
                    You should first inform the bank about the death of your brother and submit a copy of the death certificate. Joint locker holders can give mandate, such as either or, or all of the account holders, to access the locker in the event of death of one of the holders. In the absence of nomination or mandate for disposal of the contents of a locker, the bank will release the contents of the locker to the legal heirs against indemnity. So, whether you can open the locker or get the contents will depend on the instructions given by both of you at the time of opening the account.                                   Form is must      My gross annual income is less than Rs 75,000. I plan to invest Rs 78,000 in fixed deposits of a bank for eight years. Is it mandatory to submit Form 15G with the bank?        Goutam Paul, Chinsura
                    Yes. You should submit Form 15G in the first week of April every year. If you dont submit Form 15G, the bank will deduct tax at source at the rate of 10 per cent every quarter they credit the interest to your account.                                   Share worry      I purchased some shares in December 2003. The shares had been deposited by the company in my demat account directly. Shall I have to pay capital gains tax if I sell those shares this year or later? Whose will deduct the security transaction tax? My annual income is less than the basic exemption limit?         Jahar Lal Boliar, Calcutta
                    You dont have to pay any capital gains tax since you are selling the shares three years after their purchase. There is no long-term capital gains tax on equities. You will have to sell the shares through a broker registered with a recognised stock exchange, such as the BSE or the NSE. The broker will deduct the STT from the sale proceeds.

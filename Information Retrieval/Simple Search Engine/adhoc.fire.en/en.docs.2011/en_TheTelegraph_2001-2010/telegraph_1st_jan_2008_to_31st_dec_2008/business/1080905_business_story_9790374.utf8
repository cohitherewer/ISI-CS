	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Unfazed by the turmoil over the Nano, car makers are pressing ahead with their plans for small cars.        
	In the queue is General Motors which today said that its minicar, to be launched globally next year, would have a version running on two fuels.         
	Apart from the petrol and diesel versions, the minicar will also be available in alternative fuel versions, such as CNG, Karl Slym, president and managing director of General Motors India, told The Telegraph on the sidelines of a convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.        
	Slym said the company was experimenting with models, which use the extract of the jatropha plant as a fuel. The jatropha extract is blended with diesel to serve as an alternative fuel.         
	The minicar will be manufactured at Talegaon in Maharashtra.        
	GM, which wants to attain a market share of 10 per cent by 2010, expects sales to increase between 30 per cent and 40 per cent during this year.        
	So far we have witnessed a growth rate of 34 per cent and expect to close with a growth rate of 30-40 per cent by the end of December, Slym said.        
	For the industry, the forecast is of single-digit growth because of rising interest rates on auto loans. In the last seven years, the industry grew 13 per cent.        
	GM expects to end the year with a market share of four per cent (three per cent now).        
	Higher output        
	Hyundai Motors India, which will launch its compact car i20 by November, is planning to increase production by one lakh units to ramp up export.        
	We will be beginning the third shift operations at our factory in Chennai. By next year, our overall production will be six lakh units, said H.S. Lheem, managing director and CEO, Hyundai Motors India.        
	Hyundai plans to sell 5.30 lakh units this year. Last year, it had sold 3.30 lakh units, of which 1.15 lakh were exported.        
	Lheem said the government must support companies who were exporting cars to make India a hub for small cars.        
	Though there is a road map to make the country a hub by 2016, there are no incentives from the government till now, he said.

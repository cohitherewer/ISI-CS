          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The home loan package could give a boost to affordable housing in small towns but is unlikely to spur demand in big cities.        
	Real estate companies said their health would improve if there were deeper cuts in interest.        
	The revised home loan rates will give a partial push to affordable housing but to boost demand, banks should extend the Rs 5 lakh-20 lakh bracket up to Rs 35 lakh, said Pradeep Jain, chairman of Parsvnath Developers.         
	He said the industry expected the rates to be reduced to 6 per cent for loans up to Rs 5 lakh and 7.5 per cent for loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.        
	Public sector banks today announced that home loans up to Rs 5 lakh would be offered at a maximum interest rate of 8.5 per cent, while those between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh would be offered a 9.25 per cent rate.        
	The rates of interest are still very high. There will not be many takers, said Rajeev Talwar, executive director, DLF Group.        
	Rohtas Goel, chairman and managing director of Omaxe, said unsold property had touched Rs 20,00025,000 crore. To bail out these projects, the sector needs single-digit interest rates on loans up to Rs 30 lakh.        
	Assocham president Sajjan Jindal wants the government to cut rates on loans up to Rs 30 lakh to 6 per cent.         
	For above Rs 30 lakh, the ideal interest rate is 8.5 per cent, he said.        
	Raminder Grover of Jones Lang La Salle Meghraj, a global property consultancy firm, said the package would not kickstart realty. The main drivers are the Tier-I cities and the prices there are not below Rs 20 lakh.        
	However, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said, Low-cost housing has a tremendous multiplier effect and hence the decision of PSU banks to cut rates for the sector implies that overall demand will get a boost.        
	Unitech managing director Sanjay Chandra said, The reasonable rates will encourage developers to focus on affordable housing.        
	The package, which is valid till June, will encourage a lot of people to buy within that time frame, he said.

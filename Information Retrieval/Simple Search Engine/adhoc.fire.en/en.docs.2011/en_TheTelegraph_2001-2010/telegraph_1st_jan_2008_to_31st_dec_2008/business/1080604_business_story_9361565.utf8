          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, June 3: Hedge fund financiers David E. Shaw and Steven A. Cohen, who picked up stakes in luxury hotel chain Orient-Express Hotels back in January and together hold 13.1 per cent of the listed class A shares, have teamed up ahead of a crucial shareholders meeting tomorrow.        
	In filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the two hedge funds said they had decided to share information with each other on further Orient-Express stock, and restrict certain acquisitions and dispositions of shares.        
	The significance of the alliance was not immediately apparent since the 13.1 per cent holding of the Class A stock translates into a very minuscule voting right: about 2.5 per cent.        
	The Tata-owned Indian Hotels has been pursuing Orient -Express to forge an alliance since August last year and picked up a 11.5 per cent of the Class A shares in Orient-Express which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The shareholding confers a mere 2.2 per cent voting right to the Tatas. Last December, the Tatas were rudely rebuffed by Orient-Express president and CEO Paul White.        
	Whites letter to Indian Hotels left its vice-chairman RK Krishan Kumar smarting over the insult and prompted him to seek an apology which never came.        
	The hedge funds have supported Tatas call for greater clarity on Orient-Express poison pill provisions which were tightened last year. Under the takeover defence strategy, no entity can pick up 15 per cent of the Class A stock without triggering the poison pill.        
	As soon as the threshold is breached, the rights will detach from the Class A and the Class B shares. Each right holder except the hostile acquirer  will then be entitled to purchase one hundredth of a series A junior participating preferred share at an exercise price of $ 142. Holders of these junior preferred shares will then be entitled to convert these shares into as many class A or Class B shares which have a market value of twice the purchase price (i.e $ 284).        
	On current reckoning, each right holder will get just over 5 shares for every 100 shares held. Effectively, this will frustrate any hostile bidder. The Tatas have ruled out any hostile bid for Orient-Express and are hoping they will be able to persuade the board to eventually see the benefits of an alliance.        
	Interestingly, Orient-Express got Goldman Sachs to put out a presentation to investors ahead of tomorrows meeting that underscored the fact that overall revenues had almost doubled from around $ 250 million in 2003 to just under $ 500 million in 2007. The presentation claimed that EBIDTA had risen at a compounded average growth rate of 30 per cent between 2004 and 2007.

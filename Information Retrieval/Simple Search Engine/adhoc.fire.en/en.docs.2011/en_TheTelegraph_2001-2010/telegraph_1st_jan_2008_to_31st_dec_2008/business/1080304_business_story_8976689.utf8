                                                                                                               Spice posts Rs 400cr net profit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 3: Telecom player Spice Communications has posted profits for the first time since its inception in 1997.        
	The company has posted a net profit of Rs 399.92 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 against a net loss of Rs 13.87 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	Total income increased from Rs 213.35 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 to Rs 725.34 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.        
	Officials said this was the first time that the B.K. Modi led company had made profits  both on a quarterly and yearly basis.        
	The company has posted a net profit of Rs 380.13 crore for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with a net loss of Rs 24.52 crore a year ago.         
	Total income increased from Rs 832.35 crore in 2006 to Rs 1,473.88 crore in 2007.        
	A significant chunk of the profits came from the sale of 875 towers to Quipo, a standalone tower company, last December, said an official.        
	The company sold off its tower business to Quipo for Rs 600 crore, to focus on its core telecom business and raise money.         
	It has also increased its borrowing facilities by Rs 3,200 crore last year to fund its expansion plans.        
	However, though the company had applied for licences to operate in 21 circles, it was given licences to operate only in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi in January this year.         
	The company paid a deposit of Rs 740 crore to the government as a licence fee and a bank guarantee for the four circles. Spice has GSM operations in Punjab and Karnataka.         
	Telekon Malaysia has a 39.2 per cent stake in the company compared with 40.8 per cent held by the Modi group.         
	The company was the second largest cellular service provider in Punjab and the fifth largest mobile company in Karnataka, in terms of subscribers, with a combined market share of 14.49 per cent in the two states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New threshold fixed for fuel price cuts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New threshold fixed for fuel price cuts
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Still in queue                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The government will cut fuel prices only if the price of the Indian basket of crude oil stabilises at $61 per barrel.        
	On Friday, the price was $62.86, and the government will wait even if the price falls below $61. The average price of crude during October is still around $70 per barrel.         
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the price had to stabilise at the $61-per-barrel level for the government to announce a cut in fuel prices.         
	There is still some way to go before we can think of a price cut, the officials said.        
	Oil minister Murli Deora had earlier said the government could consider cutting fuel prices if crude fell below $67 a barrel.        
	This limit was later lowered to $61 after the petroleum ministry said the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar had offset the impact of falling crude prices.         
	If crude continues its downward trend, Deora could be under fresh pressure to cut fuel prices, especially as Parliament will be in session next month.        
	However, with the model code of conduct in force after the announcement of assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chhattisgarh, Deora would be able to buy more time.        
	The Indian basket of crude was at $129 a barrel in June when the price of petrol was increased by Rs 5 a litre, diesel by Rs 3 a litre and domestic LPG by Rs 50 per cylinder.        
	The government wants to delay any downward revision in fuel prices to help oil companies compensate their losses and reduce the burden on the exchequer as it will have to issue fewer oil bonds.        
	At present, the oil companies are losing Rs 350 crore a day for selling petroleum products below cost. Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited are losing Rs 4.68 per litre on the sale of petrol, Rs 11.48 per litre on diesel, Rs 28.07 per litre on kerosene and Rs 322.14 per domestic LPG cylinder.         
	The finance ministry is expected to issue oil bonds worth Rs 60,000 crore after seeking Parliaments approval.        
	Of the amount, Rs 14,956 crore is for the fourth quarter of 2007-08 and Rs 24,408 crore for the first quarter of 2008-09.

	New Delhi/Mumbai, Nov. 6: A surprise rise in inflation numbers today stalled a recovery on the bourses and pulled the sensex below the psychological level of 10000. The Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether index ended the day at 9734.22, a loss of 385.79 points over its previous close of 10120.01.        
	Inflation rose marginally to 10.72 per cent for the week ended October 25 as prices of cereals and vegetables hardened during the festival period. The rate had fallen for the previous five weeks.        
	The sensex today opened lower at 9755.03 on negative cues from the global markets and fell to a low of 9635.22 by late noon. Renewed fears of a global recession saw most of the Asian indices opening in the red and then sinking further.        
	However, even as the sensex recovered most of the losses on short-covering, the high inflation numbers triggered fresh selling.         
	The markets had expected the rate of inflation to be around 10.45 per cent, while some had even hoped for a single-digit rate.        
	The broader 50-share Nifty also fell 102.30 points, or 3.42 per cent, to close at 2892.65 from its last close.        
	In the Asian markets, South Koreas Kospi ended down 7.56 per cent, Hang Seng, 7.08 per cent, Nikkei, 6.53 per cent, Taiwan, 5.71 per cent and Shanghai Composite, 2.44 per cent.        
	As the global financial crisis remained the main concern of the Reserve Bank, analysts said it could cut lending rates further to boost liquidity.        
	Inflation was 10.68 per cent a week ago against 3.11 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	The upward movement of inflation is not significant. It should come down to single digit by the end of December, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said.

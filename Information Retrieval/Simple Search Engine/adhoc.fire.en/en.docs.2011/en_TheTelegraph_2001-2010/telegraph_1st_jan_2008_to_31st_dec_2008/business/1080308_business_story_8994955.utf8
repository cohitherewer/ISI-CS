          A STAFF REPORTER                          Khandelwal in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, March 7: The Bank of Baroda expects loans to grow more than 20 per cent this fiscal. It hopes to record business worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore in this fiscal.        
	If economic growth hovers around 9 per cent, we believe the rise in loans will be 20 to 24 per cent.         
	We are yet to work out the impact of the loan waiver in this budget on our bank. It is likely to be around Rs 1,000 crore. We have been told by the Prime Minister and the finance minister that there was no reason to believe that we would not be compensated for the loan waiver, said chairman and managing director Anil K. Khandelwal.        
	Khandelwal said there was headroom in the Tier I and Tier II capital but the bank had not decided how to raise the money.        
	We have fulfilled Basel II norms with a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 13.51 per cent and whatever we choose to do, we will not let CAR go below 12 per cent, Khandelwal added.        
	The bank is set to open branches in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi by March this year.        
	In New Zealand and Canada, the bank has applied for branch licences and hopes to get approvals by next year.        
	Overseas operations contribute Rs 50,000 crore to the banks turnover. This is expected to double in the next three years.        
	With branches in New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore, the bank is looking at expanding its seven offices in the UAE.

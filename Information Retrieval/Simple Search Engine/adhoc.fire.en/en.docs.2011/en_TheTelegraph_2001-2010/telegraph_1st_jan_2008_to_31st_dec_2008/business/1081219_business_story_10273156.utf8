The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam weighs buyback
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Satyam weighs buyback
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: Satyam Computer Services is considering a buyback of shares as it seeks to bring down the curtain on its botched attempt to merge two promoter-owned entities with itself.        
	Following vociferous shareholder protest, Indias fourth-largest IT services provider on Wednesday morning called off the proposed $1.6-billion deal involving Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure. The deal was announced on Tuesday evening.        
	Satyam today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it would hold a board meeting on December 29 to consider the buyback proposal.         
	Analysts are, however, unimpressed. Does this move do something to change the fundamental value of the company? Probably not. What is needed from the company is an effective cash utilisation strategy, an analyst with Kotak Securities said. The company is sitting on reserves of around $1.3 billion. The Raju family is the promoter of all the three companies.        
	The analysts said the size of the buyback would depend on the company taking permission from the board or shareholders.        
	If approved by the board, the amount will be 10 per cent of Satyams net worth, which translates into 7.5 per cent of its equity, or Rs 800 crore (approximately $165 million).        
	Satyam can also approach its shareholders, allowing it to buy back up to 25 per cent of net worth, or 18 per cent of equity.        
	The analysts expect the buyback to take some time but said it would take even longer to improve the companys reputation which has taken a severe beating after the merger proposal.        
	CLSA, a leading brokerage, pointed to a previous instance of Satyam coming under a cloud. Between 2000 and 2003, Satyam showed large gaps between standalone Indian GAAP and US GAAP accounts. During this period, the company had put together a cluster of Internet businesses, including portals and ISPs, and signed several joint ventures. GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles.        
	CLSA said Satyams operations had improved since then making it the industrys best performing large cap stock in 2005 and then again in 2007. The latest episode is one too many for Satyams credibility. However, we suspect that after the immediate sigh of relief at the reversal of the decision, doubts will linger. The Satyam scrip rose 7.15 per cent to Rs 169.35 on the BSE today.

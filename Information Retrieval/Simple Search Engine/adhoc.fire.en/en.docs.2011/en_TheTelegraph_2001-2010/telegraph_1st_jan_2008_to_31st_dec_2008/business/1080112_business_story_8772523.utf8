	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Genpact will set up an IT hub in the state, its third largest in the country. 
    
	The company today signed an agreement with Unitech Hitech Structures for seven lakh square feet of space in the IT special economic zone being developed by the latter.
    
	We began our journey in Calcutta in September 2004. This campus will accommodate 6,000 people over the next few years. Our current premise has capacity for 800 people. We have 650 employees in the city, said Pramod Bhasin, president and CEO of Genpact.
    
	Bhasin also met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today.
    
	Spread over 45 acres at Rajarhat, the IT hub will create 44,000 direct and 1 lakh indirect jobs, Bhattacharjee said.
    
	Genpact started out from Gurgaon, where it has the largest centre, followed by Hyderabad. However, Bhasin said if the growth rate in Calcutta remained steady, it could become the second largest centre for the company in the country.
    
	This year, Genpact expects its revenues to be in the range of $797 million and $810 million, up 30 to 32 per cent from $613 million in 2006. 
    
	Genpact has also been allotted a 12.14-acre plot by the government of Orissa, 50 acres by the Andhra Pradesh government and 25 acres in Rajasthan for the development of SEZs.

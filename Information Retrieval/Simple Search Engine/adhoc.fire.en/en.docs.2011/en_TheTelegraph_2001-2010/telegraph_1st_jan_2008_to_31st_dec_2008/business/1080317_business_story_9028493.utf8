                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Joint venture
                                In a joint bank or post office deposit account, the name of the first account holder is generally considered for TDS. If a retired person deposits money in a joint account where he is the second account holder, how will he show the interest income in his income tax return?          A.C. Banerjee, Uttarpara
                    You should specify in the application yours and the first account holders shares. A token of, say 5 per cent, can be attributed to the other holder to establish your claim of this being your joint account. The bank or the post office will be obliged to comply with your wishes to deduct tax on interest income.                                  Relief for seniors      I am 72 years old. In financial year 2008-09, I shall earn Rs 1.30 lakh as pension and Rs 60,000 from other sources. I shall earn Rs 1.35 lakh as annual interest from an investment of Rs 15 lakh in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. What will be my income tax liability?        Anil Kumar Biswas, Belgharia
                  In 2008-09, your annual income will be Rs 3,25,000, including the interest from deposits in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. However, under Section 80C of the scheme, you will get a deduction of Rs 1 lakh. So, your taxable income will be Rs 2,25,000. The exemption limit for senior citizens in 2008-09 is Rs 2,25,000. Thus, you wont have to pay any income tax.                                      Tax worries      I gifted some money to my wife. She started dealing in shares and also invested part of it in a post office monthly income scheme jointly with my son and daughter. Will her income be clubbed with mine for income tax purposes?        Siddhartha Laha, Calcutta
                    Gifting money to your wife or children will not attract any tax for you. However, the interest she gets from the monthly income scheme will be clubbed with your income. But if she reinvests the monthly interest, she will have to pay tax on the income from the new investments. If this income is less than the basic exemption limit for women at Rs 1.45 lakh, she will have to pay no tax.

	Calcutta, Dec. 13: The United Bank of India will restructure the accounts of small and medium enterprises, which are hit hard by the present global meltdown, so that they do not become non-profitable assets.        
	UBI chairman and managing director S. C. Gupta today said the bank would set up a separate cell for this.        
	He said the UBI would support these accounts either by additional dose of finance or reduction in margins so that they were not unduly affected by the present turmoil.        
	Addressing the members of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here, Gupta said the UBI would help prevent these accounts from becoming NPAs.

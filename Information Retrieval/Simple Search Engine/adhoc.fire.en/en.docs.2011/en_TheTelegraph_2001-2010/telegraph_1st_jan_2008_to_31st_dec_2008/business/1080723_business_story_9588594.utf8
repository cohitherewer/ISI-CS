          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai July 22: The stock markets are likely to post gains with the victory of the UPA in the trust vote but will soon move in sync with economic factors such as the global crude oil price and inflation, feel analysts.        
	Besides, the sensex has already risen 1000 points over the past few trading sessions, which can bring in a correction at higher levels.        
	According to Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking, While the ultimate materialising of the UPA surviving the trust vote will lead to a further rally in the markets in the short term, we believe that the movement of the Indian stock markets in the medium term will continue to be dictated by other macro-economic factors such as oil, inflation and interest rates.        
	Similar views were expressed by Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan. The event will be discounted very fast. After an initial reaction, the stock markets will be back to basics and it will look at fundamentals such as quarterly earnings, the RBI policy review that is coming up on July 29 and global cues.        
	 Sensex gains 254 points        
	Investors today heaved the sensex by another 254 points and took the BSE bellwether past the key 14000-mark, on expectations that the UPA will survive the trust vote.        
	Equities have, therefore, climbed for four consecutive trading sessions on account of declining crude oil prices and the expected UPA victory in the trust vote. Throughout the day the market was taking cues from the Lok Sabha debate and unlike on Monday, investors were more gung ho about buying stocks as the UPAs chances of surviving improved.         
	This was reflected in the turnovers on the bourses today. At the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), for instance, trading volumes rose to Rs 5,522.37 crore from Rs 4,408.03 crore yesterday.        
	The sensex opened at 13837.64 and rose to an intra-day high of 14206.13 towards noon, remaining in a narrow territory thereafter. It finally ended at 14104.20, a gain of 254.16 points, or 1.84 per cent, over yesterday. The National Stock Exchange index Nifty jumped 80.60 points to 4240.10        
	Investors were buying in sectors which would benefit from the UPA remaining in power.         
	Power stocks were in demand as it is felt that the nuclear deal would benefit the sector. The BSE power index surged 4.29 per cent. Stocks such as Tata Power soared over 6 per cent and Reliance Power, from the Anil Ambani pack, added nearly 8 per cent to its last value. Shares of equipment makers Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited and Larsen amp; Toubro rose on expectations of orders from nuclear power firms.        
	Shares of all Anil Ambani group companies ended in positive territory. Reliance Natural Resources was up nearly 6.8 per cent, Reliance Communication, nearly 4.8 per cent, and Reliance Capital, 7.9 per cent.         
	However, elder brother Mukeshs Reliance Industries Ltd ended mildly in the red, though shares of other two Reliance group companies posted gains.

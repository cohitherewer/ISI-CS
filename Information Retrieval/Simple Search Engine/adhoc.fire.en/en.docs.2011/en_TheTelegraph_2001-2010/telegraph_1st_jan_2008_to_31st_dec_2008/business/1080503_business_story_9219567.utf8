          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 2: The SBI will restructure credit card company SBI Cards amp; Payment Services Ltd, a joint venture with GE Capital Services.        
	It will have its own nominee as the CEO in place of Roopam Asthana, a GE Capital person. In addition, the bank will induct 12 officers to manage day-to-day affairs.        
	The development follows a surge in customer complaints about the service of SBI Cards, which suffered a loss of Rs 150-crore loss in the last financial year. The non-performing assets of SBI Cards increased to 16.2 per cent, said an SBI official. SBI Cards amp; Payment has 31 lakh credit cardholders now.         
	We decided to restructure our credit card business and make it a profitable organisation, said .P. Bhatt, chairman and managing director, SBI. However, this doesnt mean that we are going to snap our joint venture ties with GE Capital. We have already initiated discussions with GE Capital for restructuring the company, he said.        
	According to Bhatt, the bank has already prepared a panel of names (of SBI officials) for the post of CEO.         
	The recast will not only involve reshuffling management personnel but also streamlining risk management practices. The income eligibility conditions and credit limits on each card may also be changed, another SBI official said.        
	The bank will get into the merchant acquisition business in six months. This involves the settlement of dues on credit card purchases. The entity will pay the merchant establishments immediately and collect the sum from the credit card issuing bank later. For this service, the entity charges a commission.         
	The SBI has also approached the Reserve Bank of India for approval to set up a company providing custodial (depository) services.         
	Well set up this business as a joint venture. The joint venture partner has also been identified but we cannot disclose the name right now, Bhatt said.

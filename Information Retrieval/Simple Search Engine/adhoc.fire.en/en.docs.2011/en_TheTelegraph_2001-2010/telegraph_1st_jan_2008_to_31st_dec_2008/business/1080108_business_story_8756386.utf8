	Jamshedpur, Jan. 7: Tata Steels iron ore reserves in the country will run out in 20 years unless the company secures new resources to feed its existing operations.
    
	The company runs a 5-million-tonne steel plant here. Plans are afoot to raise capacity to 7 million tonnes by June.
    
	A Tata Steel official said the companys iron ore reserves were pegged at 300 million tonnes.
    
	Our existing reserves only covers the Jamshedpur plant for 20 years. We need more iron ore to sustain operations here in future, he added.
    
	The company operates two iron ore mines  at Joda in Orissa and Noamundi in Jharkhand. It has applied for fresh mining leases to sustain the Jamshedpur plant and the new plants it plans to establish in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand.
    
	Tata Steels admission of a looming iron ore shortage comes at a time when the company has gone ahead with plans to expand the Jamshedpur plant at an investment of about Rs 12,000 crore.
    
	The company plans to ramp up capacity further to 10 million tonnes by 2010.
    
	The Jharkhand government has recommended Tata Steels application for a block at Ankua, close to SAILs famed Chiria reserves. However, the Centre has sought some clarifications on the issue. The company expects to get iron ore reserves of 100 million tonnes at Ankua. 
    
	Sources say even the Ankua reserves will not meet the iron ore requirements of the worlds fifth largest steel maker. Given the fact that mining leases are generally given to serve the requirement of a plant for at least 30 years, the Joda-Noamundi-Ankua combine will not be enough for Tata Steels 10mt Jamshedpur works.
    
	We are hopeful that the Jharkhand government will allocate new mines to us as Tata Steel has gone ahead with investment programmes even though it has not received fresh deposits, the official said.
    
	The company, however, will do its bit to maximise the scarce iron ore resource it has.
    
	The expansion at Jamshedpur will also see a new 6mt pellet plant  the biggest in India when it comes up.
    
	The pellet plant would enable the company to use more iron ore fines for its production through the blast furnace route. Simply put, the company would be able to make more steel from same excavated matter than it does now.
    
	Tata Steel plans to set up such pellet plants in all its new projects in the future as well.
    
	So far only two companies in India  Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India  make steel using captive iron ore, which helps them score over other steel makers like Ispat, Essar and JSW Steel.
    
	Tatas edge was, however, dented when it bought Corus  which is four times its size  in early 2007. Corus has no captive iron ore mines or coal assets, making it vulnerable to market forces. The company has now focused its attention to secure raw materials for it.
    
	It acquired a coking coal block in Mozambique and an iron ore lease in Ivory Coast. It is also looking for new reserves in Brazil and Australia.

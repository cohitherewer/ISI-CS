	New Delhi, April 21: Railway minister Lalu Prasad today said iron ore exports might be banned if a 15 per cent export tax, now under consideration, fails to rein in spiralling prices.        
	If the 15 per cent duty on iron ore export fails, the government should ban its export, the minister said on the sidelines of an industry event.        
	It is an irony that a country that imports steel refuses a ban on iron ore exports. It doesnt consider the fact that if this is not stopped, the countrys mineral wealth will be depleted, he added.        
	The government wants to control the prices of food and commodities, which have been fuelling inflation, as high prices can have a negative political impact.        
	When pointed out that the railways have recently increased the freight rate on steel, Lalu Prasad said this would not have any effect on steel prices.        
	On the possibility of a reduction in the steel freight rate, he said, There is no such proposal at the moment.        
	A group of cabinet ministers, who had met last week to sort out differences among various ministries, agreed on hiking taxes on iron ore exports and slashing duties on steel imports.         
	These measures would not result in any revenue loss to the government as the higher tax on ore would neutralise the loss of revenue from the duty cut on steel.        
	The ministers have agreed to an export tax on iron ore of 15 per cent of its value.         
	Tax on iron ore now is lower at Rs 50 a tonne for low grade ore and Rs 300 a tonne for high grade ore.

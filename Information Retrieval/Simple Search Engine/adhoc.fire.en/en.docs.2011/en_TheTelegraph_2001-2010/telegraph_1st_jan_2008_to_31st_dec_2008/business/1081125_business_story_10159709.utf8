          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                   DARK DAYS              Goldman says:      bull;Big downtrend seen in prices. In
  some regions, prices may fall 30%      bull;Construction slowdown to affect overall growth. It directly accounts for 7.3% of GDP, indirectly impacts another 14%      Citi says:      bull;Demand in NCR likely to be
  sluggish in next 6-12 months      bull;Projects under construction delayed 6-12 months; resale values down 15-25% in capital region      
	Mumbai, Nov. 24: Goldman Sachs today said prices of houses in some regions might fall by up to 30 per cent.         
	It warned that a slowdown in construction would have a negative impact on the economy.        
	While real estate directly accounts for 7.3 per cent of Indias gross domestic product (GDP), other sectors linked to it such as iron, steel and cement make up 14 per cent of GDP.        
	Therefore, a slowdown in construction can potentially have large knock-on effects on the economy, Goldman said in its report on Indian real estate.        
	Property prices have shot up in the past three years, with massive divergences seen across regions.        
	Goldman said property prices in the major cities had now surpassed the previous peak of 1996.         
	Prices had then fallen after appreciating 70 per cent in three years.         
	The impact of a property slowdown could potentially be stronger this time.         
	Demand for real estate is not only driven by income growth, demographics, interest rates and inflation, but also peoples expectations of future prices. As the economy continues to slow because of the knock-on effect of the global financial crisis, income growth will come off, thereby reducing demand for housing, the report said.         
	Demand for commercial real estate will also be adversely affected because of the slowdown in the IT and BPO segments.         
	From the demand side, a property downturn, we think, will have negative effects on consumption and investment, Goldman said.        
	The downturn in India would not be protracted because of many favourable factors.        
	Mitigating factors, such as Indias favourable demographies, low mortgage penetration, falling interest rates and ongoing infrastructure demand will keep the property downturn from being protracted, the report said.        
	Citi view        
	In another report, Citigroup projected sluggish demand for property in the next 6-12 months. Its projection was based on a survey in the national capital region.        
	Citi said prices in the resale market had fallen 15-25 per cent in the last three months.         
	Almost all projects under construction had been delayed by at least 6-12 months, and developers were not planning new projects in the near term.         
	The focus is on completing projects that are under construction. Besides, the festival season had failed to revive demand.         
	Realty stocks have been hammered on the bourses because of a bearish outlook relating to property.

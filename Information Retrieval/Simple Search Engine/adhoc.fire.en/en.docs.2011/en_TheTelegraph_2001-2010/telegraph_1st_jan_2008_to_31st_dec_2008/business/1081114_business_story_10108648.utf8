	Mumbai, Nov. 13: Lathe Investment Pte, a wholly owned subsidiary of Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Ventures (GIC Ventures), will pick up nearly 9.9 per cent equity in Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd, or Arcil.         
	It will pick up close to 3.3 crore shares of Arcil at Rs 84 per share, aggregating over Rs 272 crore.         
	With this, foreign equity participation in Arcil will rise to over 14.66 per cent. Earlier, Rand Merchant Bank, a division of First Rand Bank of South Africa, had picked up a 5 per cent stake in the company from ICICI Bank for Rs 36 per share.         
	The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had recently cleared Lathes investment proposal, after deferring it in September when the Reserve Bank of India said there was no information about the antecedents of Lathe or its suitability as an investor in Arcil.         
	Clarity was sought from Lathe on its relationship with Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and GIC Ventures, which are separate entities of the Singapore government, with the former being a foreign institutional investor (FII).        
	Indian rules permit 49 per cent foreign direct investment in asset reconstruction companies but bar FII investment in the sector.         
	There were apprehensions that Lathe was a subsidiary of GIC and, therefore, should not be allowed to invest in Arcil.        
	In its response to the FIPBs demand for clarity, Lathe said it was a wholly owned subsidiary of GIC Ventures, which was not an FII. GIC Ventures and GIC were separate entities.        
	Arcils business is expected to grow, with projections of a rise in non-performing assets in this fiscal.         
	Recently, S. Khasnobis, managing director and CEO of Arcil, had said that the company hoped to acquire stressed assets of around Rs 2,500 crore in the current year.

             BEING STRICT
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 1: The Reserve Bank of India today clamped a few restrictions on short selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs).
    
	The move comes barely a week after the Securities and Exchange Board of India permitted all classes of investors, including FIIs and their sub-accounts, to short sell, lend and borrow securities of Indian companies.
    
	However, the central bank said short selling by FIIs would not be permitted in those shares that are on the banned list or on its caution list.
    
	The FII participation in short selling as well as borrowing or lending of equity shares will be subject to the current foreign direct investment policy, the RBI said in an official statement. 
    
	The RBI rules stipulate certain ceilings on investments that FIIs can make in Indian companies. When the total holdings of FIIs reach a threshold, which is 2 per cent below the applicable limit, the central bank issues a notice to all designated branches of authorised dealer banks stating that any further purchases of shares in that company will require its prior approval. 
    
	The names of these companies are then placed on the caution list. The RBI gives case-by-case approvals to FIIs for the purchase of shares in companies on the caution list. 
    
	The RBI added that FIIs would be allowed to borrow shares only for delivery linked to short sales. 
    
	The margin has to be maintained by the FII in the form of cash, and no interest will be paid to the FII against collaterals.

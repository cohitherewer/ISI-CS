                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UK weighs loan cover for Jaguar 
                            
	London, Dec. 14 (PTI): The UK treasury and business secretary Lord Mandelson are considering granting a loan guarantee of several hundred million pounds to Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), according to a report by the Sunday Times.        
	This guarantee will allow JLR to raise a bridge loan from commercial banks that will be made available for around 18 months, the report said.        
	Last week, Mandelson had held talks with Ratan Tata  head of the Tata group  and JLR executives who had stressed on the companys sizeable research and development programme.        
	JLR spends 400 million a year and plans to launch several models next year, including an XJ Saloon and the first of its hybrid vehicles.        
	Mandelson is expected to make loan guarantees available to the finance arms of car firms to kick-start sales. Another option is that of low-cost loans to be made from the 400 billion set aside to support the banking industry, the Sunday Times said.        
	The newspaper said details of a European Investment Bank scheme to help the industry were likely to be finalised this week. Low-cost loans will be made available to support investment in fuel-efficient cars. Most large car makers, including JLR, have already prepared their submissions, but it is unlikely that any money will flow from the scheme before April.

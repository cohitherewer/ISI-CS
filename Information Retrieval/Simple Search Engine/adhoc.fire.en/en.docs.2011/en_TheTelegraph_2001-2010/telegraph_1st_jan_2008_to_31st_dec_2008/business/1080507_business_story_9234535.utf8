The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UBS to slash jobs 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UBS to slash jobs 
                            
	Zurich, May 6: (Reuters): UBS will cut 5,500 jobs in one of the biggest purges seen so far in the financial market crisis, as the Swiss wealth-management titan hits back at the investment bank that plunged it into turmoil.        
	UBS said it had a preliminary deal with US asset manager BlackRock Inc to sell a $15-billion portfolio of sub prime mortgages in what the bank said was a signal to the market that the ailing US real estate loans were recovering.        
	Shares of the group fell 5 per cent as investors worried the crisis had ravaged UBS earnings power.        
	The latest 5,500 staff cut comes on top of 1,500 already completed and represents a reduction of 18 per cent of the total headcount since mid-2007. Bank chief Marcel Rohner said the asset sale agreement with BlackRock offered relief in the market for risky mortgage assets.         
	We see clearly that there are sophisticated investors coming into this market, and we view this as a strong support, he said

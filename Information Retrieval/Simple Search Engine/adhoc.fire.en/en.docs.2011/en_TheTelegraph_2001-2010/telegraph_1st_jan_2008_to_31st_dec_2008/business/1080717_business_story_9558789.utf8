          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Kamal Nath in New Delhi 
  on Wednesday. (AFP)    
	New Delhi, July 16: The government is ready to consider the tax status of export oriented units (EOUs) as a policy issue but cant review the status of a particular sector or an unit, according to Union commerce minister Kamal Nath.        
	He also said the government would not ban the export of petroleum products.        
	The minister was reacting to the demand made by Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh to scrap the EoU status of Mukesh Ambanis Jamnagar refinery. If there is a need to look at the EoU tax benefits as a policy issue, we are ready to consider it, but not for a specific sector or an unit.        
	Nath said, He (Amar Singh) had met me but did not discuss any EoU issue with me. The commerce ministry has also not received any representation on the withdrawal of EoU status to any industry.        
	Anyone can make a demand and we in the government will consider it based on the merits of the proposal. In this case, the merits are not in favour of banning exports (of petroleum products).         
	We need to take a broader policy decision on EoUs across the board. There cannot be a policy for one particular industry or a unit. If there has to be a change in the EoU policy, it has to be applicable for all, he said.        
	WTO strategy        
	India today said it has the option of walking out of the WTO meet if the livelihood concerns of the countrys farmers are not addressed.         
	The special safeguards mechanism and special products (ways of protecting agriculture from imports) are not negotiable. They are make or break issues, Nath said while outlining the countrys strategy for the forthcoming WTO ministerial conference in Geneva.        
	Nath said he was hopeful that the WTO meet would be able to conclude a deal, adding the country was ready to consider tariff cuts in some industries.

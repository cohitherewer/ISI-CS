     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: More than a year after its parent entered into an agreement with Johnson amp; Johnson (J amp;J) for the sale of its consumer health business, Pfizer India  the arm of Pfizer Inc  today sold four key brands to J amp;J for Rs 214.85 crore.
    
	These brands are popular mouthwash Listerine, cough syrups Benadryl and Benylin, and anti-allergic lotion Caladryl.
    
	Pfizer India, in which the parent holds roughly 42 per cent, will, however, retain other consumer health brands. These include Gelusil, Nebasulf, Selsun, Ferradol, Neko and Waterburys Compound.
    
	All other brands and the consumer health team will continue to be an integral part of Pfizer India. We believe that there is tremendous potential in our brands and business strategies will be put in place to maximise the opportunities and drive growth in the consumer health business, Kewal Handa, managing director of Pfizer India, said in a statement.
    
	Pfizer Indias board of directors met today and cleared the transfer of the four brands to J amp;J Ltd.
    
	Although officials from Pfizer did not provide details of the turnover of these four brands, analysts said consumer health or the over-the-counter (OTC) segment contributes little over 10 per cent to Pfizer Indias topline. 
    
	Contributions of brands such as Listerine and Benadryl and the other two are significant.
    
	In June last year, Pfizer Inc and Johnson amp; Johnson had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pfizer Consumer Healthcare for $16.6 billion in cash. 
    
	Global sales of Pfizers OTC brands during 2005 was put at $3.9 billion and the acquisition was completed in December 2006.
    
	However, the global arrangement could not be implemented in India. 
    
	In October, Pfizer had said the transfer of the consumer health business to J amp;J was delayed despite an early global closure because of technical reasons. 
    
	The board of directors of the company is now evaluating various options available for a smooth restructuring, the company had said while declaring its quarterly results.
    
	It is believed that the sale in India was held up because of apprehensions of Pfizer India employees on job security.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 21: US-based Motorola has won a $90-million contract to supply GSM network equipment to state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).         
	The deal will help BSNL add 2.3 million subscribers in southern India, Motorola said in a statement.        
	Last year, Motorola was disqualified from BSNLs contract for 23.5 million GSM lines on technical grounds. Ericsson had emerged as the top bidder for the deal.         
	The tender size was reduced by a half from the initially planned 45 million connections after telecom minister A. Raja raised technical and pricing issues.        
	This is a separate tender which was floated for infrastructure expansion in southern states, S.D. Saxena, director (finance) of BSNL told The Telegraph. However, he added that the total number of GSM lines that would be supplied by Motorola had not yet been decided.        
	A Motorola spokesperson said, The company is not in a position to disclose such information.        
	Motorola already supplies second-generation (2G) equipment to BSNL in the south. The latest deal will help grow BSNLs network by using the US firms advanced 2G solutions, the Motorola statement said.         
	BSNL plans to add 33.5 million mobile lines for the year ending March 2009. In April, it said it had a capacity of 36 million GSM lines, most of which had been used up, and 5.5 million CDMA lines, of which 1 million were left to be allocated.        
	Under the contract, Motorola will ship GSM network equipment and provide a network service programme, including both software and hardware support, said Subhendu Mohanty, country head for home amp; networks mobility, Motorola India, adding that this will help BSNL in ramping up.        
	BSNL has been attracting fewer new users each month compared with Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communication and Vodafone Essar because of infrastructure gaps.        
	According to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, BSNL has 40.8 million mobile subscribers out of the 261.1 million users in India. Market leader Bharti Airtel had nearly 62 million users, Reliance, 45.8 million and Vodafone Essar, 44.1 million.         
	BSNL recently floated a tender for 93 million lines. Officials said the total value of the contract could be about Rs 40,000 crore. Of these, about 21 million lines are reserved for third-generation services.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Glad tidings                                  
	New Delhi, April 3: The government today approved a proposal to create information technology investment regions (ITIRs) to hasten the growth of IT, IT-enabled services and electronic hardware manufacturing units.        
	The ITIRs, approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), may include one or more special economic zones (SEZs), industrial parks, free trade and warehousing zones and new integrated townships. Residential areas, entertainment facilities, social infrastructure and administrative services will be part of such regions.         
	These investment regions are similar to SEZs, but firms here will produce for the domestic as well as the export market. Such investment regions will have relaxed labour and tax laws as in SEZs.        
	However, the ITIRs will be much larger than infotech SEZs.         
	Each ITIR is expected to be a specifically notified investment region with a minimum area of 40 sq km planned for IT, ITeS and electronic hardware manufacturing units. The minimum processing area will be 40 per cent of the total area of an ITIR.         
	Infotech SEZs have a minimum land area requirement of 10 hectares and a minimum built-up area of 1 lakh square metres.         
	The ITIRs will be endowed with excellent infrastructure and will be supported by investor-friendly policies, an official told reporters after the CCEA briefing.        
	The units will be built through public-private partnership. States will select the developers and co-developers through a transparent bidding process.        
	The government expects such regions to draw big-ticket investments and create employment opportunities. It will also help in the growth of new townships and dispersal of industry, reducing pressure on existing urban centres.        
	The state government will ensure that all physical infrastructure and facilities such as power, water, roads, transportation, sewerage and effluent treatment plants are provided in each ITIR, while the central government will develop national highways, airport and rail links to the ITIRs, said officials.

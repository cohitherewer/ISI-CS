                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Stock slips despite words of comfort
  - ICICI Bank continues to put up a brave face        OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: ICICI Bank stepped in today to soothe investor fears after the stock was battered on a day of skittish trading on the bourses.        
	The bank sent a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange asserting that 98 per cent of ICICI Bank UK Plcs non-India investment is rated investment grade.        
	The ICICI stock plunged over 12 per cent to close at Rs 493.30 on the BSE, amid growing fears that it might find itself sucked into the vortex of the US credit crisis. It was one of the nine index stocks that hit 52-week lows today and led the markets decline.        
	Two weeks ago, ICICI Bank had said it had an exposure of $80 million to senior bonds floated by Lehman Brothers after the storied Wall Street investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.        
	ICICI Bank UK has zero exposure to the US sub-prime credit, whether directly or through credit derivatives, the bank said in its latest note.        
	It claimed that 98 per cent of the non-India investment book of its UK subsidiary, worth $3.5 billion, was rated investment grade by Standard amp; Poors, Moodys and Fitch. About 89 per cent of the book was rated at A minus or higher.        
	But the statement failed to quell concerns in the market.         
	ICICI Bank has significant international operations comprising about 27 per cent of its book. It is much larger than the overseas exposures of HDFC or Axis Bank, which are pegged at 5 per cent and less than 4 per cent, respectively, said a banking analyst.        
	He said the biggest concern was the fact that ICICI Bank had a history of keeping quiet until the problem deepens into a crisis.        
	Not everyone felt the same way. Theres some comfort in the companys statement. Weve put a buy rating on the stock because we see value in it, especially with the listing of its insurance subsidiary, said another banking analyst.        
	No bottom in sight        
	Marketmen were unwilling to hazard an estimate of where the sensex would go from here.        
	We have no idea where the bottom is, given the rate at which selling continues. If selling were to stop tomorrow, there would be a 10 per cent bounce back. But the sentiment remains negative, said Ambarish Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking.        
	Call rates soar        
	The call rate jumped to 15 per cent on the overnight call money market as liquidity remained tight. The call money rate, which hovered at 8.5 per cent last week, jumped to as high as 16 per cent at one stage.

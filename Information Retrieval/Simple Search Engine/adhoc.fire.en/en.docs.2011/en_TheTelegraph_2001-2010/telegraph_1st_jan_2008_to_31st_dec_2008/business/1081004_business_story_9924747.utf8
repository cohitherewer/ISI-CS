          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          K.R. Kamath (right) with .N. Singh, executive chairman of Universal Sompo, in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: Allahabad Bank has put its rights issue plan on the back burner.         
	K.R. Kamath, chairman and managing director of the city-based bank, said, At this moment we are not very keen to dilute the governments stake in the bank.         
	The government owns about 55 per cent.        
	The Calcutta-based had mooted a rights issue to raise capital and support growth.         
	At the end of June this year, the banks total risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio  a measure that determines a banks capacity to meet deposit liabilities and expressed as a percentage of its credit risk exposure  stood at 11.68 per cent against the regulatory requirement of nine per cent.         
	In absolute terms, risk-weighted capital stood at Rs 6,748.11 crore.        
	The banks net owned capital stood at Rs 4,412.11 crore, or 7.64 per cent.         
	In the first quarter of the current financial year, the banks deposits grew 16.54 per cent year-on-year to Rs 73,207 crore, while gross advances went up 23.88 per cent to Rs 50,244 crore.        
	The faster growth in advances over deposits resulted in the need to raise additional capital. The bank had also sent its rights issue proposal to the government for approval.         
	Except for the State Bank of India, the government has not come out with a policy on the rights issue of public sector banks. Besides, the market conditions at present are also not very conducive. We have a headroom to raise Rs 2,500 crore, including both Tier I and Tier II capital, that well mobilise at an opportune time, Kamath said.         
	Allahabad Bank today signed an exclusive marketing agreement with Universal Sompo General Insurance.

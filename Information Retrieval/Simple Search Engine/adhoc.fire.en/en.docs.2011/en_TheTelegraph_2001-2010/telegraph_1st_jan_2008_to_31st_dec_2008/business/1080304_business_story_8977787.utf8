	London, March 3 (Reuters): World stocks tumbled while the dollar plumbed record lows today as fresh concerns about the health of the banking sector and a US recession drove investors to safe-haven gold and government bonds.
    
	Emerging markets took a beating as investors dumped risky assets, while the cost of corporate bond insurance rose after last weeks weak US confidence data and a regional business survey intensified worries about the worlds biggest economy.
    
	HSBC announced bigger-than-expected bad debts of $17.2 billion because of problems in the US housing market. The global banking sector is expected to suffer a total of $300-400 billion writedowns from the credit crunch, threatening to derail growth in the broader economy.
    
	There are a lot of unanswered questions about banks balance sheets, said Thierry Lacraz, strategist at Swiss bank Pictet. Estimates show a lot of shareholder equity is having to be written down, which will make banks shy to lend this year.
    
	The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 1.7 per cent on the day, while the MSCI main world equity index fell 1.3 percent to hit a one-week low.
    
	HSBC shares fell more than 1 per cent before turning positive, while the broader bank sector index was down 1.8 per cent, dragging down broader indices along with technology and insurer shares.
    
	The dollar fell to all-time lows against major currencies as recession fears cemented expectations for US interest rate cuts with investors pricing in a more than 70 per cent chance of a three-quarter- point rate cut in March. The dollar also hit a three-year low against the low-yielding yen at 102.62 .
    
	Inflation tradeoff
    
	Expectations that the US Federal Reserve and other central banks would cut interest rates to spur the ailing economies have kept world stocks off Januarys 15-month low, although recent data showing rising inflationary pressures might discourage monetary authorities from easing dramatically.
    
	We are seeing the deepest housing deflation since the Great Depression and a massive unwind of the largest credit binge ever. Fiscal and monetary policies are more limited in their ability to respond than earlier this decade, David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch said in a note.

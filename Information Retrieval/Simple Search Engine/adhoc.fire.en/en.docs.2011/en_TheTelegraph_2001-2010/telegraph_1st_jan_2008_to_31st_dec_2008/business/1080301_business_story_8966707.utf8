                                                                                                               Excise relief lifts industry mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: Excise duties on most products have been slashed to14 per cent  a move that comes on top of last years decision to impose a peak customs duty of 10 per cent.        
	Of course, a quibble continues over the peak customs duty especially when some products such as wines and whiskies continue to attract 180 per cent customs duty and motor car importers have to pay a 100 per cent duty.         
	While trimming excise duties, finance minister P. Chidambaram also trimmed customs duties for some products to spur manufacturing growth and boost consumer demand.         
	The excise levy on small cars, two- wheelers and three-wheelers was cut to 12 per cent from 16 per cent which, Chidambaram claimed, would boost consumption of goods such as cars and two-wheelers as higher interest rates have reduced demand for the products.        
	It is consumption that drives production and it is production that drives investmentI believe there is a need to give a stimulus to the manufacturing sector, Chidambaram said.        
	The finance minister did not make any change in the peak rate of custom duty of 10 per cent. He abolished the ad valorem part of the excise duty on unbranded petrol and unbranded diesel and replaced it with a specific duty of Rs 14.35 on per litre of unbranded petrol and Rs 4.60 per litre of unbranded diesel. He said there would be no impact on retail prices.        
	Recognising that exports have come under some pressure because of the appreciation of the rupee, the finance minister said the government had given relief to exporters in three tranches of over Rs 8,000 crore and Rs 8,351 crore in the form of interest cost of market stabilisation bonds.

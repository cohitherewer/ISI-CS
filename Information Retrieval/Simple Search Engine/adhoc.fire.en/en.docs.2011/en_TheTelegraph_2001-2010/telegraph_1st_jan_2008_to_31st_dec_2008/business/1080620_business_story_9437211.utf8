The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Delist hint in BOC open offer move
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delist hint in BOC open offer move
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, June 19: BOC India, the Calcutta-headquartered industrial gas leader, may soon get delisted from stock exchanges.        
	The German parent of BOC India today raised the open offer price to Rs 200 a share from Rs 165, hoping that the increased value will help it to mop up the additional 20 per cent stake in the company.        
	If the open offer sails through, the parents stake in BOC India will touch 93.99 per cent, making it a fit case for delisting as its non-promoter holding will drop below the minimum threshold of 10 per cent.        
	The BOC stock jumped to Rs 196.45 from the previous close of Rs 163.95, up 19.82 per cent, or Rs 32.50, after the revision in prices was announced.        
	The open offer, though delayed, was triggered when Linde AG of Germany acquired BOC Plc, the parent of BOC India two years back.        
	The parent company may have thought that at Rs 165, they will not get full acceptance. Hence, the offer price has been raised. It is certainly a push for delisting, an industry observer said.        
	Linde had delisted one of its subsidiaries in Malaysia last year.        
	Incidentally, Linde AG had made a preferential issue of Rs 597 crore for BOC India earlier this year. This has jacked up Lindes stake in BOC India to 73.99 per cent.        
	The open offer would cost Linde Rs 341.13 crore, if fully accepted.         
	BOC officials declined to say whether the parent would delist the company.         
	We dont know if the offer would be fully accepted. It is hypothetical, company secretary Pawan Marda said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Marriott to cash in on demand
                                                                                                               Marriott to cash in on demand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Spreading out                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: Marriott International Inc, the global lodging company, is charting an aggressive course in India.         
	The hotelier, which runs six properties in the country, plans to add 18 more by 2011 under its various brands that include JW Marriott, Marriott, Courtyard and Marriott Executive Apartments. Two of these properties will come up in Calcutta.        
	While these hotels will be operated under long-term management contracts, Marriott expects revenues from India to rise with the expansion.         
	Marriott has seen revenue per available room grow 25 to 30 per cent over the past year. As a result, the turnover from Indian operations has risen to $150 million. In the current year, it expects the topline to cross $200 million.        
	The growth in India has been astronomical, says Rajeev Menon, area vice-president, Malaysia, India, Pakistan and Maldives at Marriott.         
	Menon told The Telegraph that nine hotels would be opened next year and more would be launched over the next few years.        
	Marriott is not only focussing on cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Calcutta but will also concentrate on smaller locations such as Amritsar, Chandigarh and Ahmedabad.         
	For instance, a 175-room property under the brand name of JW Marriott is expected to come up in Chandigarh by 2011.        
	In Calcutta, a 300-room JW Marriott will open around the same time. The Calcutta property, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, will be owned by Emaar MGF.        
	According to Menon, India will continue to be a major area of operation for Marriott because the demand-supply gap is expected to last for some more time.

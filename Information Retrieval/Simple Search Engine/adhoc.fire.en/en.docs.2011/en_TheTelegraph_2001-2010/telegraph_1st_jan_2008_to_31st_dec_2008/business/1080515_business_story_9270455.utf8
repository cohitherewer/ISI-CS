          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              SPACE GETS BIGGER		      
	Mumbai, May 14: MphasiS today announced a capacity expansion plan for its Chennai facility.        
	EDS, which owns 60.9 per cent in MphasiS, will be acquired by HP for $12.6 billion. The deal could spell good news for MphasiS as HP might outsource more work to the Bangalore-based company. As part of its expansion plans, MphasiS will add 3,600 seats to its Chennai facility by year-end.         
	MphasiS today inaugurated Enterprise Lab, an innovative information technology centre providing engineering, development and testing solutions for MphasiS and EDS clients worldwide.        
	Based on what we see in the global market, we expect our infrastructure management business to be a major growth driver. Opening the Enterprise Lab is an important milestone to accelerate IT expansion and provide high-quality solutions to MphasiS and EDS clients in India and around the world, said Jeya Kumar, CEO of MphasiS.        
	Enterprise Lab is an example of how information technology enables virtual teams to come together in a global delivery model to provide innovation and round-the-clock support for companies and their customers, said Tom Fabry, director of EDS Enterprise Labs.         
	We look forward to continuing the work with the team in Chennai to build a world-class laboratory, he added. Development activities in Chennai focus on the IT industry such as server virtualisation (running multiple operating systems on a single server) and improving the quality and the speed of delivery, a company statement said.

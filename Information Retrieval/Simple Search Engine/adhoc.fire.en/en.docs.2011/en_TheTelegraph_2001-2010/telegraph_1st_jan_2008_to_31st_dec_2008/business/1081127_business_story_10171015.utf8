          OUR BUREAU                          K.P. Singh: Thoughtful                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: DLF Assets  the property fund of billionaire K. P. Singh  is likely to raise $450 million from private equity investors, including JPMorgan and Texas Pacific Group.        
	DLF Assets had been set up to acquire commercial projects of DLF Ltd.        
	According to analysts, the money will be used to improve the overall liquidity scenario of DLF Ltd.        
	We are talking to some investors. The deal is likely to be finalised in 10-15 days, Saurabh Chawla, director (finance) of DLF, told The Telegraph.        
	Private equity investors are likely to put in $200 million.        
	According to sources, DLF Assets, which owes DLF Rs 4,800 crore as on September 30, plans to raise about Rs 2,200 crore ($400-500 million).        
	Sources in the firm said they were confident of getting the required funding by January end.         
	DLF Assets was planning a Singapore listing in June to raise $2 billion, but it had been deferred because of weak market conditions. Earlier, its plan for a domestic float was also called off.         
	DLF Assets had so far raised over $1 billion from private equity firms to purchase properties from DLF.        
	Last year, it had raised $400 million from global investing firm DE Shaw. Another $200 million was raised from a fund sponsored by investment banking firm Lehman Brothers, which later sold the stake to SC Asia, a unit of US-based private equity firm Symphony Capital. This year, it has so far raised $450 million from Symphony Capital.        
	The US private equity firm now owns 60 per cent of the $1.1-billion invested by overseas companies in DLF Assets.        
	At present, DLF Assets has placed on rent 4.7 million square feet, which is expected to grow to 10 million square feet by March 2009, yielding rentals of Rs 600 crore per annum.        
	In a statement issued last month, Rajiv Singh, vice-chairman of DLF, had said, While steps to monetise DLF Assets through fresh equity funding have overshot the original timeline, teams continue to work on it.        
	However, the management continues to explore various opportunities to monetise the assets, he said.

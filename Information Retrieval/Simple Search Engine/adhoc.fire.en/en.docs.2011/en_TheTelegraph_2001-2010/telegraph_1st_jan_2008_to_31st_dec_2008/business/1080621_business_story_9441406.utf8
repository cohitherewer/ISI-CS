          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 20: Hindalco Industries Ltd is coming out with a rights issue of up to Rs 5,000 crore to refinance the bridge loan that it had taken to fund the acquisition of Novelis Inc.        
	The AV Birla group company is also looking to liquidate a part of its $1 billion treasury portfolio apart from sourcing international or domestic debt.        
	These decisions were taken at a board meeting of the company held today where the directors approved a comprehensive financing plan for the take-out of the existing bridge financing for the Novelis acquisition.         
	Debu Bhattacharya, Hindalcos managing director and Novelis vice-chairman, said shareholders would get one rights share for every three shares held. He said the price for the Hindalco rights issue would be announced later.         
	Hindalco had acquired Novelis in February 2007 in an all-cash transaction worth about $6 billion. Novelis is the worlds top producer of aluminium rolled products.        
	At the time of the acquisition, Hindalco had said that the deal included around $2.40 billion of debt on the books of Novelis and would be partly financed through its treasury operations which would provide $450 million. The rest would be raised through debt. This includes a non-recourse debt based on the balance sheet of Hindalco ($3.1 billion) and $2.8 billion on the balance sheet of Novelis.        
	Bhattacharya said that with the acquisition of Novelis, Hindalco has become a global player with a strong presence in five continents and a product portfolio that serves as a natural hedge against the volatility of aluminium prices.

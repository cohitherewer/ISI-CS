The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ford gears up to join the battle
                                                                                                            Ford gears up to join the battle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Jan. 8: Five years ago, when Ratan Tata announced that he would come out with a Rs 1 lakh car, most car makers had sniggered at the outlandish idea.        
	The Tatas will pull the wraps off its closely-guarded five-year secret on January 10 at the Ninth Auto Expo in Delhi.        
	As D-day looms, everyones scrambling to come up with a competing product  a sure sign that the Tatas have finally won the argument.        
	The latest to jump on the bandwagon is Ford Motor Company which announced today that it would roll out its small car from an expanded Chennai plant by 2010.        
	The small car project will be a key element of the Ford Motor strategy.        
	Just six months after announcing major investment plans in China and Thailand, Ford said it would invest another $500 million in its India operations over the next two to three years as part of a global initiative to expand and strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. At the current exchange rate, the investment works out to about Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Fords total investment in India will now go up to $875 million.        
	The money will be used to execute a long-term strategic plan we have developed for our India business, John Parker, Ford Motors executive vice-president, Asia Pacific and Africa, said in a video recording shown at a press conference here.        
	Arvind Mathew, president and managing director of Ford India, shrugged off suggestions that Fords small car would compete with the Tata model.        
	We wont know what the Tata small car will look like until January 10 when it is unveiled in Delhi, he said. All that he would say was that the Ford offering would be smaller than the Fusion.         
	He warded off questions about the Fords small car design saying, I have just brought in the money. Please be patient.        
	Parker said the companys long term plan was anchored by two major initiatives: a new engine manufacturing facility and the expansion of its vehicle manufacturing facility at its factory complex in Maraimalai Nagar near Chennai.        
	The new engine plant will manufacture its next generation diesel and petrol engines, both for the domestic and the export markets, Parker said.        
	It will be Fords first engine manufacturing plant outside Europe.        
	Mathew said the first phase of this expansion had already commenced at its Maraimalai Nagar site by adding a diesel engine assembly plant that will have an initial capacity of 50,000 units a year. The first engines will be delivered in April and will be used in the production of Fords Fiesta and Fusion cars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel prices cut again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet fuel prices cut again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: State-run oil firms today slashed jet fuel prices by about Rs 2,100 per kilolitre (kl), the second cut in four days.        
	The abolition of the 5 per cent customs duty on jet fuel on Friday has prompted the companies to cut prices. They had reduced prices by about 17 per cent, or over Rs 9,400 per kl, on October 31.        
	According to industry officials, the price in Delhi has come down to Rs 44,965.70 per kl, in Mumbai to Rs 46,518.85 per kl, in Calcutta to Rs 53,663.53 per kl and in Chennai to Rs 49,673.64 per kl.        
	The Congress-led government had earlier allowed Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines and Air India to pay back their fuel dues amounting to Rs 2,900 crore in six interest-free monthly instalments.        
	However, airlines have indicated that they were unlikely to pass on the benefit of lower fuel prices as they were still running at huge losses.         
	Private airlines said they wanted to assess the total benefits of the cuts before passing them on to travellers.         
	According to the civil aviation ministry, the airline industry lost about Rs 4,000 crore in 2007-08 and was expected to double its losses during the current fiscal.         
	The ministry believes that airlines can cut capacity by as much as 20 per cent and trim schedules.

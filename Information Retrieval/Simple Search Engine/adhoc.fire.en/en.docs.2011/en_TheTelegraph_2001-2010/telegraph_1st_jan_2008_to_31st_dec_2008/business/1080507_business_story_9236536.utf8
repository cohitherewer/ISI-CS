  Losses continue to mount          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                      On the boil      
	New Delhi, May 6: The import cost of crude oil for India has touched an all-time high of $112 a barrel, which could result in losses of Rs 1,50,000 crore to state-run oil marketing companies in this fiscal.         
	Costs are likely to go up further, with crude price touching $122 a barrel in New York today.        
	Indian crude was at $112.56 per barrel yesterday, a 75 per cent jump over last fiscals lowest price of $62.91 on May 9, 2007. An official in the petroleum ministry said the price had averaged $110.17 a barrel this month, up from $105.77 in April. In 2007-08, the average was $79.25 per barrel.        
	In tune with the crude flare-up, the rupee appreciated to 40.95 a dollar, against Rs 40.61 yesterday as refiners stepped up dollar purchase to meet the oil bill. India imports more than two-thirds of its oil requirements.        
	According to the official, the crude spike can widen Indias trade deficit and put pressure on the rupee. This could scuttle any attempt by the Reserve Bank of India to raise the value of the rupee to fight inflation.        
	Higher crude prices have resulted in Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum losing Rs 450 crore daily on the sale of petrol, diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene. They were losing about Rs 425 crore daily in the last fiscal. The annual loss will be almost double the loss of Rs 77,304.50 crore reported in the previous year. The losses arise because government policies force the companies to keep their prices below costs.        
	At present, only 42.7 per cent of the loss is met through the issue of oil bonds by the government, while one-third of the loss is shared by upstream PSUs such as ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India). Since raising the price of fuel has political consequences, the petroleum ministry wants 55-57 per cent of the revenue loss in 2007-08 be met through oil bonds.         
	Goldman forecast        
	Oil could shoot up to $200 within the next two years as part of a super-spike driven by poor growth in oil supplies, investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note.        
	We believe the current energy crisis may be coming to a head, as inadequate supply growth is becoming apparent, Goldman said.         
	The possibility of $150-$200 per barrel seems increasingly likely over the next 6-24 months, though predicting the ultimate peak in oil prices as well as the remaining duration of the upcycle remains a major uncertainty, it said.        
	Goldman, which was one of the first to point to a triple digit oil price more than two years ago, said it believed the market was approaching the crunch in the super-spike.        
	The super-spike theory argues that a lack of adequate supply growth along with price-insulated demand growth in countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will lead to a dramatic rise in oil prices that will ultimately lead to a sharp correction in oil demand.

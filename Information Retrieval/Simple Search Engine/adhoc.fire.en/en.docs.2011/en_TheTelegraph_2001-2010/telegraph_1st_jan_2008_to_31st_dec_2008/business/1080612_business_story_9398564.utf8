          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          DARK CLOUDS                                  
	New Delhi, June 11: The government has asked state-run oil companies to consider a cut in the base price of jet fuel to give immediate relief to airlines reeling under rising fuel prices.         
	It will also call upon an empowered group of ministers to discuss likely tax cuts to bail out the sector.        
	Weve asked the oil companies to consider a reduction in the base price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), civil aviation minister Praful Patel said after meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the ATF issue.         
	This is an extraordinary situation. There is a crisis in the aviation sector and we must all collectively try to find out a solution. Otherwise it is going to affect the overall growth of the sector in a big way, he added. We have also explained that it is not so easy for a vital sector like aviation go belly up and it will have a cascading effect or multiplied effect on the entire economy, he said.        
	Patel said the Prime Minister was sympathetic towards the airlines that had been reporting losses. He also indicated that the government was likely to give airlines a relief in airport cess.        
	Patel was joined by Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal and Kingfisher Airlines Vijay Mallya in expressing concern over the crisis situation.        
	Rising fuel costs saw surcharges making up for three-fourths of a low cost airlines ticket price.         
	High fuel prices are expected to push the airlines deeper into the red with the industry expected to register a loss of Rs 8,000 crore in 2008-09 fiscal, which is double the losses suffered during 2007-08.         
	Apart from measures such as refuelling in states where ATF is cheaper, airlines such as SpiceJet and IndiGo have renewed their efforts to push for relaxation of rules for flying to international routes.         
	According to these airlines, international flights will lead to a better utilisation of aircraft and will also be cost effective as jet fuel is 75 per cent cheaper abroad.         
	The airlines have already informed the civil aviation ministry that they might have to prune domestic capacity by 20 per cent if the current situation continues for long.

	Calcutta: The budget failed to cheer the steel industry which was expecting a hike in export duty on iron ore if not altogether a complete ban. However, the finance minister abolished 5 per cent duty on steel melting scrap used as input for steel making by some producer, reducing raw material cost. quot;We also expected abolition of customs duty on coke which did not happen, quot; Vinod Mittal, managing director of Ispat Industries, said. FM also raised export duty on chrome ore by 50 [per cent, in a move designed to conserve the mineral and make it available for value-added manufacture.                  
	 Calcutta: The budget proposal to raise tax on non-filter cigarettes may have dealt a death blow to this segment. A packet that cost Rs 5 would now be sold over Rs 11. Industry veterans believe, the segment which closely compete with bidi, would die. This would lead to more people smoking bidi, which is more injurious to health and also earns less revenue for the government.                  
	Calcutta: Cenvat reduction from 16 per cent to 14 per cent is positive for the tyre industry. Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of Dunlop and Falcon, however, said the anomaly in the customs duty structure of tyres and rubber has not been addressed. The indifference of the finance minister may be ominous for the tyre industry that has of late been experiencing dumping of tyres from China and other countries, Ruia said                   
	New Delhi: The cost of electricity is likely to go up with the budget proposing to impose a 4 per cent additional customs duty on power generation as well as distribution projects, other than mega power projects. The government announced withdrawal of exemption of 4 per cent additional customs duty levied under section 3(5) of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 on power generation projects, transmission, sub-transmission and distribution projects.                  
	New Delhi: Barring the elimination of duty on helicopter simulators, the burgeoning civil aviation sector did not get much relief in the budget. However, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said he would continue to pursue pending issues, including reduction of taxes on jet fuel. The plan outlay for National Aviation Corporation of India stood at Rs 5,786.48 crore. The combined outlay of last year was over Rs 8,094 crore.

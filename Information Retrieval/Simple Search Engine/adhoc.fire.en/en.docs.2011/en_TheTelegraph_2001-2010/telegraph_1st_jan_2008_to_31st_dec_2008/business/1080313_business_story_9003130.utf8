	Calcutta, March 12: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) plans to increase its headcount in Calcutta to 4,500 from 1,300 in two to three years. The company now has 4,400 employees in the country.        
	PwC has acquired land beside its existing campus at Salt Lakes Sector V.        
	The Calcutta centre has become a key growth centre for us. Assignments such as tax outsourcing  preparing returns for foreigners and foreign companies  are done here. Our focus on expanding our presence in the city is in line with our national expansion plans, said Ambarish Dasgupta, executive director of PwC India.        
	The Calcutta unit is involved in IT outsourcing, offshoring, analytics and business and knowledge process outsourcing.        
	The company said about 65 per cent of the employees to be hired would be engaged in offshoring and consulting activities.        
	PwC has already taken on lease 100,000 sq ft at Sector V to cater to the additional workforce until the adjacent facility comes up.        
	Tax outsourcing is an important practice for the company. We prepare returns for foreigners and companies such as Exxon Mobil. Returns are filed for companies and individuals in the US, the UK and Australia. We propose to file 4,000 to 5,000 returns for people in the US, 3,000 for Australia and 3,000 to 4000 returns for the UK, Dasgupta said.         
	The company has a team of around 200 employees who work in this area. The consulting major also focuses on transfer pricing. The Centre has appointed the company as its consultant for the national e-governance programme.        
	PwCs Calcutta centre is also involved in e-governance advisory and implementation programmes in countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well as in African and West Asian nations. It also plans to advise multi-commodity exchanges in these countries.

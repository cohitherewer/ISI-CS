	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The security screening of foreign telecom firms, bidding for 3G licences, will be done at the technical qualification stage to prevent complications later.        
	Since foreign telecom players do not require clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) before bidding for 3G spectrum they will be scanned for security in the initial rounds of auction to avoid disqualification at the final stage, said department of telecom (DoT) officials.        
	Last week, the DoT had allowed foreign firms to bid for 3G spectrum as 100 per cent entities. This implies that foreign players do not need to tie up with an Indian partner and seek clearance from the FIPB to participate in the upcoming auctions for 3G spectrum.        
	Following the auctions, successful firms will be offered a time frame to find an Indian partner and get the mandatory clearance from the FIPB.         
	However, to avoid a situation where a 3G winner is unable to get the security clearance, which may delay the rollout process of 3G services and even lead to re-initiation of the entire process, firms will undergo the security check at the initial stage.        
	The DoT, which expects to earn at least Rs 20,000 crore from the sale of 3G spectrum, wants to ensure the participation of foreign players to gain maximum revenue and lessen the governments fiscal burden.        
	If the auction is restricted to existing players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar, it will reduce competition and generate lower revenue.        
	E-auction        
	The government has started the process of conducting 3G auction by issuing a request for proposal to firms for organising the online bidding.        
	E-auction brings in greater transparency and less cartelisation. On-the-spot bidding will force competitors to match the highest price, said the DoT officials.        
	An e-auction for a circle takes a few hours, the officials said.

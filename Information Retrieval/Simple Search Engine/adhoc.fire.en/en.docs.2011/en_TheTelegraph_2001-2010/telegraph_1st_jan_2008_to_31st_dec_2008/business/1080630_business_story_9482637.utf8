The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Central bankers fret over inflation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Central bankers fret over inflation
                            
	Basel (Switzerland), June 29 (Reuters): Central bankers issued a stern warning on Sunday against the dangers of surging inflation, saying rising energy costs risk damaging growth in rich and poor countries alike.        
	Policy-makers attending talks at the annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements said they were on high alert to the dangers posed by rising inflation and slowing growth, but there was no one-size-fits-all solution.        
	We see very difficult times for the world economy moving ahead, said Martin Redrado, Argentinas central bank governor.        
	In particular in the financial sector we are going to be witnessing the second wave of turbulence now that the slowdown is going to hit consumer credit . It is uncharted waters that we are testing at this point, and central bankers all over the world are very alert.        
	Officials from more than 100 central banks exchanged views on the global economic outlook on Saturday and agreed oil prices  which surged past $142 a barrel for the first time last week  were a major concern.        
	In emerging economies, where consumers spend more of their income on food than in industrialised nations, inflation is no longer just a monetary policy problem but a social one.        
	Around the world there is an enormous problem because of the rise in crude oil prices, Daouda Bangoura, Guineas central bank governor, said.

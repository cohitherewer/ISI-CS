          SAMBIT SAHA                           Smooth entry                                  
	Calcutta, May 25: GHCL Ltd, the textile-to-soda-ash giant, is bringing the UKs home furnishing retail brand Rosebys to India in August.         
	GHCL, formerly known as Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd, acquired Rosebys in 2006. With 300 odd stores, Rosebys is the largest home furnishing retail chain in Britain.         
	The Sanjay Dalmia-owned company will kick off with a flurry of stores across the country. About 100 stores are being planned this year, including 10-15 in Calcutta.         
	In India, Rosebys will be a single-brand store compared with the UK s multi-brand outlets.         
	Nikhil Sen, director of the local outfit, said the stores would cater to five categories, comprising bed, bath, window, accessories and personal care.         
	Our focus is predominantly women buyers because they will do up the house, Sen said.         
	The company is working with designers to build its catalogue of products besides bringing in some of the items already available in the UK.         
	While GHCLs Vaapi plant will manufacture most of the products, the company will also outsource from contract manufacturers in India and abroad, especially Thailand.         
	Rosebys is also developing private labels for select personal care products.         
	We want to complete the experience of a shopper by offering soaps, oil and the likes, being developed by a company that produces for global giants, Sen said.         
	The stores would mostly be located on the high streets. Even though the company will have some of its own stores, the ownership will rest with the franchisees.         
	The stores will spread across 800-1,200 square foot area.         
	Rosebys will also have a special section for kids.         
	The company has set an ambitious target to become a leader in home furnishing retail with about 1,000 stores in the next four to five years.         
	The turnover is expected to exceed that of the UK business, now estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore.         
	GHCL, which has initiated the move to restructure the company into two separate entities dealing in heavy chemicals and textile, also plans to introduce the Rosebys brand in developing countries where retail is yet to gain ground. China and the east European countries are some of the options being considered by the management.

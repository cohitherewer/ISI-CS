The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DHL fears slump in business
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DHL fears slump in business
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Bumpy ride      
	Calcutta, April 7: Logistics company DHL India is worried about getting hammered by an impending slowdown in certain sectors and the economic slump in the US.        
	Sectors such as textiles, apparel and leather have already shown a downturn in shipments.        
	There has been a general slowdown which is not only because of rupee appreciation. However, the impact of the US recession will be indirect, said Chandrakant Pitre, national marketing head, DHL Express India Pvt Ltd.         
	Pitre was in the city to inaugurate a 16,431-square-foot service centre, which will handle over 1,110 inbound and outbound shipments a day, weighing more than 1.3 tonnes.         
	The Asian Development Bank projected Indian economic growth to moderate to 8 per cent this fiscal from 8.7 per cent in 2007-08. Overall GDP growth in 2009-10 is predicted to return to around 8.5 per cent.         
	Pitre said clients were preferring the freight mode of delivery these days, which takes longer to deliver but costs less than the express mode, affecting the business of logistics firms.        
	However, DHL expects sectors such as pharma, auto, electronics and high-end products  all of which are on the upswing  to add to its coffers.         
	Any improvement in infrastructure by the government will be welcomed by the industry and we hope that the projected investments of $17 billion in transport infrastructure by 2010 shall go a long way in helping the growth of the Indian logistics market, Pitre said.         
	DHL will also rely on the presence of Blue Dart, in which it has an 81 per cent stake, to bolster its presence in the country.         
	The top 12 third-party logistics providers in India comprise less than 15 per cent of the overall industry, which is fragmented and needs sizeable investments and fleet strength to leverage the market.         
	According to industry estimates, the Indian logistics market is expected to reach $122 billion by 2015 from $45 billion now. Logistics costs in India are 13 per cent of its GDP compared with 11 per cent in Japan, 10 per cent in Europe and 9 per cent in the US.         
	DHL has invested around $300 million in the country in the past four years, including $163 million for an 81.03 per cent stake in Mumbai-based Blue Dart Express.

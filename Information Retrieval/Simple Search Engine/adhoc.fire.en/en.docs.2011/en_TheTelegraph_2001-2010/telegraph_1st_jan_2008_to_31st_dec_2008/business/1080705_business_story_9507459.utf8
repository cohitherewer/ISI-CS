          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 4: Inflation rose to 11.63 per cent for the week ended June 21, propelled by the fuel price hike that led to a surge in the prices of food articles and commodities on the back of higher transportation costs.         
	The upward trend in inflation could result in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) further tightening monetary measures to flush out money from the market.        
	Tea prices rose by four per cent, while those of fruits and vegetables, sea fish, maize and bajra increased by two per cent each.         
	Pulses, including urad and moong, and spices became expensive by one per cent each.         
	Items such as iron ore, steel, edible oil and cement became costlier, notwithstanding attempts of the government to rein in their prices.        
	The finance ministry today said that the main drivers of inflation continued to be petroleum products, iron ore and steel items.        
	However, it said there is considerable relief in the behaviour of prices of 30 essential commodities. These include foodgrains, pulses and edible oils.         
	Analysts said inflation would continue its upward trend, and there were indications that it could touch the 13-per-cent mark soon if the crude price surge and tight monetary conditions persisted.        
	The RBI could raise the repo rate  its lending rate for banks, which is now at 8.5 per cent  by 50 basis points at its next review meeting on July 29, according to D.K. Joshi, principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil.         
	He said the central bank could also hike the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  the proportion of deposits that banks must keep with it  by 25 basis points.        
	On June 24, the central bank had tightened its monetary policy by hiking the repo rate and CRR by 50 basis points each.        
	Lehman Brothers economist Sonal Varma said the momentum in inflation continues to accelerate and that is a worrying sign.         
	With rising input costs, there is a lot of pressure on producers to increase output prices.         
	Given this risk of second-round effects, we expect the RBI to hike the repo rate by 25 basis points at the July policy, and the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points in the third quarter.        
	The government has revised upwards the inflation rate for the week ended April 26 to 8.27 per cent from the provisional figure of 7.61 per cent.

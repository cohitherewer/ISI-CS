The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel ministry calls   for import duty hike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Steel ministry calls   for import duty hike
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                              EXTRA COVER            
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The steel ministry has demanded an increase in the import duty on steel to 15 per cent from 5 per cent and imposition of a 10 per cent countervailing duty on steel used in construction.        
	An inter-ministerial committee will take a call. In their deliberations, the committee will take into account the demands of auto makers and capital goods manufacturers who are complaining of rising input costs.         
	According to officials, duties on some items may be increased, while on others they will be 5 per cent. We may even look at scrapping import duties on steel categories which are not made in significant quantities here, they said.        
	Moves toward higher duties follow steel imports jumping around 70 per cent in November to 1.4 million tonnes from 0.8 million tonnes in the same month last year. The cheaper imports were from China, Thailand and the countries in central Asia.         
	Policy-makers have recast steel duties many times in this fiscal depending on the price of the commodity.         
	The Congress-led government had imposed a 5 per cent duty on imports to protect domestic producers. Prior to that, it had slapped a 15 per cent export tax, cut import taxes on mild and semi-finished items to zero and removed a 14 per cent countervailing duty on steel meant for construction. These were meant to counter a price spiral.         
	Firms are not satisfied with the 5 per cent duty and demanding more levies for protection. Many have been forced to shut down furnaces and cut back production. Some such as the Jindals, Ispat and Essar are believed to have even cut output by up to 20 per cent.        
	From November, steel makers have reduced prices in two phases by Rs 5,000-Rs 7,500 a tonne to overcome a slackening demand. The softening of global prices combined with lower levels of domestic demand had forced them to roll back the price hikes announced over the last one year.        
	Auto makers, who have been trying to battle a recessionary phase, said they, too, were at risk if input costs did not come down. Many consider a price hike as inevitable in January.

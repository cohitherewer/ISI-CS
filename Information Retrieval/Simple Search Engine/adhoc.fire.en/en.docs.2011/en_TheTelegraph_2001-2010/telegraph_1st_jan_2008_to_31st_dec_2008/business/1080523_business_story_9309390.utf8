          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, May 22: The cabinet will go into a huddle tomorrow to consider a fuel price hike, which will help state-owned oil companies.        
	Bottomlines of the companies have been eroded by the surge in the global crude price, with New York crude today reaching a record $135.09 in early trading. Owing to political compulsions, the oil companies sell fuel at a discount, a situation made worse by soaring crude prices.         
	There is a possibility that the cabinet may discuss various measures, including a fuel price hike, tomorrow, sources said. The cabinet could agree to raise petrol and diesel prices steeply in the range of Rs 2-5 per litre to mitigate the resource crunch of the companies.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, said the government was keen to protect the oil companies.         
	We will not allow oil companies to suffer, he told reporters at the fourth anniversary celebrations of the UPA government at his residence.        
	The sources said the government could also bring down the customs duty to zero from 5 per cent and increase the quantum of bonds for the oil companies.        
	Ahead of the cabinet meet, petroleum minister Murli Deora is meeting the heads of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited to assess the situation and report to the Prime Minister.        
	Deora, however, neither denied nor confirmed the cabinet meeting.        
	We are discussing all possible measures to help and protect our public sector oil companies. Some remedial measures need to be taken (urgently). We are concerned about the financial health of the PSUs, he told reporters.        
	Essar move         
	Private refiner Essar Oil today said it was in a position to wipe out most of the fuel deficit in the country.         
	The company will supply the entire output of its refinery at Vadinar, Gujarat, which has been raised to 12.5 million tonnes.

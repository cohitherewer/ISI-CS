          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 31: The Tatas today aborted their plans to invest $3 billion in power, steel and fertiliser projects in Bangladesh.        
	The conglomerate, which made headlines with its acquisition of Corus Group Plc and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), had first proposed four large projects in Bangladesh in 2004 and had intensive discussions with the Bangla government until 2006.        
	Later, the group suspended further work on the projects as it couldnt reach an agreement with the government on key issues pertaining to the projects.        
	Since then the Tata Group has had frequent enquiries on the status of the projects and the prospects for reviving negotiations with the government. It is clear, however, that the government will not be in a position, in the foreseeable future, to grant the projects the natural gas commitment they would require, the Tata group said in a statement today.         
	Consequently, there is no prospect of taking these projects further. A letter to this effect was handed over today to the executive chairman of the Board of Investment, Government of Bangladesh, the group said.        
	It, however, added that this withdrawal would have no impact on its other interests in Bangladesh, which it would continue to develop.        
	As part of the formal investment blueprint submitted to Bangladesh, Tata Steel had proposed to set up a 2.4-million-tonne plant, Tata Chemicals a one-million-tonne urea plant and Tata Power a 1,000MW thermal power plant at a combined investment of $2.5 billion.        
	Had the Tatas been successful with their plans, it would have been the single largest foreign direct investment in that country since its independence in 1971.        
	The group had struck a provisional 15-year gas and coal supply agreement with Bangladesh, but the country went back on its commitment because of political instability. Reports then had also said that the bone of contention between the group and the government of Bangladesh was over the pricing of gas. The Tatas had pointed out that since Bangladesh did not have adequate iron ore reserves, their projects would not be viable if gas was not available at a suitable price.

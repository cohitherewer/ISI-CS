          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The government is making all efforts to lift the stay on the sale of gas produced by Reliance Industries from the Krishna-Godavari basin, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey today said.        
	The government has requested Bombay High Court to lift the injunction on D6 gas sales, Pandey told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference.         
	The court is set to begin its next round of hearing on September 30.        
	Pandeys comments come a day after Anil Ambani criticised the petroleum ministry for favouring elder brother Mukesh on the gas dispute.        
	The brothers are involved in a bitter court battle over the supply of 28 million cubic metres of gas a day from the Krishna-Godavari basin to Reliance Natural Resources Ltd.        
	NTPC is the other company to which Reliance had committed to sell gas at $2.34 per million British thermal unit.        
	Pandey said gas production from RILs D6 block was likely to begin by the year-end.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CASH INJECTION                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 24: Hospital chain Fortis Healthcare Ltd will raise Rs 1,000 crore through a rights offer.         
	In a statement to the stock exchanges today, the company said the proceeds of the issue would be used to fund projects, including the upcoming Medi-City project in Gurgaon, the redemption of preference shares, the repayment of short-term debt and the upgradation of existing facilities. The cash will also be used to explore future investment opportunities.        
	While the details of the share ratio and price would be announced later, Fortis Healthcare said its promoters were fully committed to the success of the offer.        
	Recent rights issues have been spurned by shareholders in view of the current slump in the stock markets. The rights issue of Tata Motors and Hindalco Industries had devolved on the underwriters.         
	We have fine-tuned our operating model and are ready for aggressive growth over the next few years. The rights issue will enable us to restructure our balance sheet and set the base for a healthy future, Fortis Healthcare managing director Shivinder Singh said.        
	New Delhi-based Fortis has operations in Delhi, Jaipur, Noida, Mohali, Amritsar, Chennai and Raipur. It has a network of 23 hospitals, including multi-specialty and super-specialty set-ups in areas such as cardiac and renal care, orthopaedics, oncology and gastroentology. It is now planning to expand in Mumbai and add 550 beds to the current 2,600.         
	Recently, there were reports that Fortis Healthcare was interested in acquiring stakes in Wockhardt Hospitals and Manipal Hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India rejects US offer at WTO meet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       India rejects US offer at WTO meet

	Geneva, July 22 (PTI): India today rejected the US offer to cut its overall farm subsidies to $15 billion a year on the ground that even after the reduction, America had enough headroom to increase the incentives.        
	Reacting strongly to the US offer made at a press conference in Geneva, Indias commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said, India does not negotiate through the press. We negotiate in the green room at the WTO meet.        
	The US has set a limit of $48 billion for farm subsidies. Dubbing the offer to bring it down to $15 billion as inadequate, Pillai said according to the current offer, the applied subsidies would be $7 billion only, which implied that there was enough scope to increase farm support to $15 billion.        
	US trade representative Susan Schwab said the US was prepared to bring down its trade distorting farm subsidies provided developing countries reciprocated with offers to open up their markets to industrial and farm goods.        
	Addressing a press meet here, Schwab said, I will be informing our green room colleagues that we are prepared to reduce our overall trade distorting domestic support to $15 billion. This is a major move taken in good faith.         
	Emphasising that the offer was a strong sign of the US commitment to a successful outcome of the Doha round, Schwab said, With the reductions, the US subsidies on agriculture will have exceeded $15 billion in the last seven out of 10 years. So, in 70 per cent of the years, this would have been an effective cut.These reductions are not offered in isolation and must be accompanied by significant market access and opening in agriculture and Nama, she said.        
	Schwab said the US is committed to move the Doha negotiations forward this week and had sent a strong signal to its trading partners that we are here to get the deal done.        
	She said the US had attempted to get this round back on track by making offers to reduce its allowable subsidies to $22.5 billion in 2005.        
	The lavish farm subsidies extended by the US to its rich farmers have been a major bone of contention at the Doha round of trade talks.

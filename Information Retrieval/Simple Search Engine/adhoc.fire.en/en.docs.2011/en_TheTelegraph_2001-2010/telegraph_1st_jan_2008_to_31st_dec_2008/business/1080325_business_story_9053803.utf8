	New Delhi, March 24: Hyundai Motor Corporation, South Koreas largest automobile manufacturer, plans to sell buses in India from next year.         
	Hyundai today signed a five-year agreement with the Caparo group to provide parts and technology for aero buses.        
	Caparo will build a plant in Chennai with a capacity to produce 1,500 units per annum. The plant will begin production in early 2009, Hyundai said, adding the deal will help Hyundai strengthen its position in a growing economy such as India.        
	Hyundai said Indias luxury commercial vehicle market was expected to grow at a fast rate because of the rapid development and rising demand for such transportation.        
	Hyundai will receive $4 million for the technology transfer. The company has commercial vehicle units in China, Vietnam, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran.

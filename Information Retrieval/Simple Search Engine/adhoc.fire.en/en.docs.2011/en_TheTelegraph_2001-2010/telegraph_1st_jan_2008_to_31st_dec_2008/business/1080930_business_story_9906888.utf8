          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Racing ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Maruti Suzuki India today said it would focus on holding its dominant position in the passenger car market at a time when the industry is plagued with high financing and input costs.         
	We are fighting for market share and we will maintain it. Last year, it was about 55 per cent, said Mayank Pareek, executive officer (marketing and sales), Maruti Suzuki India, at a car rally.        
	Car sales have fallen for two consecutive months, in July and August.        
	The market condition has been very tough over the last five months. Maruti has witnessed just five per cent growth, Pareek said. Maruti reported a 10.15 per cent decline in domestic sales in August and flat sales in July.        
	It said the delay in the launch of the Swift Dzire had hit its plan to garner a greater share of the sedan market. On whether the wait of six to eight months had any effect, Pareek said, I would like to say no, but it is yes.         
	Pareek said higher input costs had affected margins. But we are very good at cost cutting. Manufacturers will have to find innovative ways to deal with the situation.        
	The company will launch the A-Star in November. It will subsequently be exported to Europe. The company will also launch the Splash in 2009.         
	Maruti expects earnings from the overseas sales of the A-Star to counter weak sales in the domestic market.

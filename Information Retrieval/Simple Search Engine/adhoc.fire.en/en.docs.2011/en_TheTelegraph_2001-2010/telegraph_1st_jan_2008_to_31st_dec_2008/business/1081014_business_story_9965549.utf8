                              Krugman: Triumphant                            
	Stockholm, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Paul Krugman, a critic of the Bush administration for policies that he argues led to the current financial crisis, has won the 2008 Nobel prize for economics.        
	The US economist got the prize for his work that helped to explain why some countries dominate international trade.        
	Krugman is a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University. He is reputed for the columns he writes for the New York Times.         
	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the prestigious 10-million-crown award recognised Krugmans formulation of a new theory that addressed what drove worldwide urbanisation.        
	He has thereby integrated the previously disparate research fields of international trade and economic geography, the committee said.        
	Krugmans approach is based on the premise that many goods and services can be produced more cheaply in a long series, a concept generally known as economies of scale, it said.         
	Krugmans theory clarifies why trade is dominated by countries that not only have similar conditions but also trade in similar products.        
	Bank advice        
	Krugman, who today compared the current global economic meltdown with the East Asian financial crisis in 1997, once said that weak banks in India should be closed.        
	The economist during his visit to India when the Asian crisis was at its peak was of the view that unsound financial institutions could not be kept operating in the country simply because they provided jobs. He had also said serious capital requirements should be imposed on strong banks.        
	Krugman had also underscored the need for prudent capital controls for emerging economies as a measure of abundant caution.         
	His lessons for India were capitalising banks, closing weak ones and leaving the convertibility programme where it is.

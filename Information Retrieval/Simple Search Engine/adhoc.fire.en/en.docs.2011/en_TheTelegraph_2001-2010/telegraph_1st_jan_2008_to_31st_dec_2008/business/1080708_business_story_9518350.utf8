	Calcutta, July 7: NTPC-Bhel Power Projects Ltd is likely to get its first chief executive officer (CEO) by the end of this month.

	The committee will be headed by the secretary for heavy industries. The CEO will be appointed by the end of this month. I am going through the final business plan for the company which we will make public this week, Ramesh said.        
	The joint venture company, which is expected to invest Rs 6,000 crore over the next five years in greenfield projects, will raise the money in a debt-equity ratio of 70:30, said K. Ravi Kumar, chairman and managing director of Bhel.        
	The business plan will outline the companys strategy to initially secure engineering procurement and construction contracts for power projects.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharing concern                                  
	New Delhi May 14: The government has persuaded cement and secondary steel firms to cut prices, as part of its efforts to rein in prices.        
	Cement producers have agreed to cut prices by Rs 7.5 per 50-kg-bag in all but a few states, while secondary steel firms will cut prices on all flat products and galvanised sheets by Rs 4,000 per tonne.        
	Both the steel and cement makers have agreed that they would keep prices steady for at least three months.        
	Faced with a three-and-a-half year high inflation of 7.61 per cent, the government has changed the customs and excise duties on a number of items along with many administrative steps, including a ban on futures trading of some farm products.        
	We had discussions with the cement industry, which has stated that in the last one year, the price increase has been only two per cent. However, to combat and address the issue of inflation, they have agreed in certain states (to cut prices), commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath told reporters after his meeting with cement manufacturers here.        
	He said the cement industry was scattered across the country with different prices in states. In certain states, the prices will be reduced between Rs 3 and Rs 7.5 per bag from the level prevailing on April 1, 2008.        
	The price cut will not apply to those companies, which are already supplying cement at concessional rates in states such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The prices of cement in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh should immediately come down, he said.        
	Representatives of leading cement makers such as ACC, Jaypee, Ambuja Cement and Dalmiya Cement participated in the meeting with the minister that lasted over an hour.        
	Nath said the government would look into various issues of coal linkages and the abatement of excise duties for the cement sector. This is the only industry where abatement has not been applied yet. We will look into these issues as well, he said.

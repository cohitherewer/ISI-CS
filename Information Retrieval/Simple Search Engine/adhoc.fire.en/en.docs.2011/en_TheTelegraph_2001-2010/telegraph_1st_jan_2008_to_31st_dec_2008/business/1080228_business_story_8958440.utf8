	Jamshedpur, Feb. 27: Tata Steels greenfield projects in the country are running 12 to 16 months behind schedule.        
	The company plans to set up three plants in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa with a combined capacity of 23 million tonnes (mt), entailing an investment of Rs 90,000 crore.        
	H. M. Nerurkar, chief operating officer (steel) at Tata Steel, said the plant at Kalinganagar in Orissa had made the quickest progress. Orders for critical equipment like the blast furnace and steel melting shop have been placed. But the other two projects in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have made little progress        
	However, the Orissa project has run into a gridlock after locals have started agitating against land acquisition for the project.        
	 We have placed orders of at least Rs 10,000 crore there. But 400 families are holding such a big project to ransom, said Amit Chatterjee, advisor to Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman.        
	Nerurkar hopes to start construction in Orissa within a month or two but the situation does not look very promising. Trouble broke out after the company built a wall around the site at Kalinganagar in Orissa. Tata Steel had signed a memorandum of understanding for a 6mt plant in 2005.        
	We have taken a big risk. The equipment will start arriving this year. Where will we keep it if we dont get the land? If we keep it in the warehouse in the port, we will have to pay a stiff penalty, Chatterjee said.        
	Like Korean steel giant Posco, Tata Steel faced resistance while trying to obtain land for the steel plant. Twelve people died in police firing when locals opposed the move to fence off the area.        
	Land isnt the only issue that has stalled the Orissa project. The Orissa government has yet to recommend Tata Steels plea for a fresh iron ore lease.        
	Nerurkar said the state was examining Orissas ore reserves before deciding on the proposal. We expect them to announce a decision soon, he said. Nerurkar and Chatterjee were talking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar in Jamshedpur where speakers voiced their concerns about delays that were dogging their projects because of problems relating to land acquisition, availability of raw material, rehabilitation of displaced people and environment policies.        
	Except Sajjan Jindals Bengal steel plant at Salboni, none of the big projects ArcelorMittals Rs 80,000 crore twin plants in Jharkhand and Orissa or Poscos Rs 52,000 crore in Orissa  is close to take off.        
	Partha Sengupta, vice-president of Tata Steels corporate services and the head of the Jharkhand project, refused to set a deadline for the 10mt plant in Jharkhand.        
	We have done our bit and are waiting for the government to respond to land and forest clearances over the past one-and-a-half years, he said.        
	Varun Jha, head of Tata Steels Chhattisgarh project, said the deadline to start production in the first phase by 2011 would not be met.        
	There is some progress. Two-thirds of the people who need to be relocated in Bastar region have accepted compensation. But there are issues with the mine lease, he added.        
	Tata Steels Orissa project may be able to head off cost overruns because the equipment orders have already been placed. But the investment plans for the two other projects may have to be reworked.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Ease the pain                                  
	New Delhi, June 25: The Prime Ministers Office is backing the civil aviation ministry and airlines as they go about persuading state governments to cut the sales taxes on jet fuel.         
	Indian airlines have lost about Rs 4,000 crore in 2007-08 and are expected to double their losses to Rs 8,000 crore during the current fiscal, according to civil aviation ministry estimates. The lobbying for a sales tax cut is part of a proposed bail-out package for the airlines.        
	The ministry believes that airlines can cut capacity by as much as 20 per cent as well as trim schedules to stay afloat.        
	Other elements in the bail-out package include relaxing norms to allow domestic airlines fly in international routes, which will allow them to refuel at cheaper rates. There is also a proposal to cap airport and other charges.        
	Top government officials said state finance ministers, who had met in Srinagar, wanted more details on jet fuel pricing before agreeing to the Centres plea to charge a uniform four per cent sales tax.         
	The sales tax currently varies from 30 per cent to four per cent across states. Gujarat has the highest tax on jet fuel at 30 per cent, Tamil Nadu stands second at 29 per cent and Madhya Pradesh has a sales tax rate of 28.5 per cent.         
	Officials feel states can agree to cut taxes if airlines are willing to pass on the tax benefits to passengers  by reducing fares  and maintain their flight schedules.         
	Sources in the civil aviation ministry said that the proposal to ease the norms on flying abroad could be pushed before the cabinet.        
	Such a proposal had been scuttled earlier this year by railway minister Lalu Prasad at a meeting of the group of ministers.         
	However, officials said that the proposal might now be revived in a modified format. The civil aviation ministry wants requirements for flying on international routes to be based on technical and financial parameters.        
	Jet has received permission to fly abroad, and rivals Kingfisher and SpiceJet have intensified their lobbying.         
	Currently, the rule for flying abroad is for an airline to have at least five years experience, a minimum of 20 aircraft and a paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore.        
	Analysts said it might not be prudent to relax the norms because the international routes were showing signs of excess capacity.

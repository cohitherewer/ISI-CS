	Calcutta, Aug. 16: HTMT Global Solutions Ltd, the outsourcing arm of the Hinduja Group, is set to invest Rs 450 crore in funding acquisitions.        
	The company has done four acquisitions in the past. We have sufficient cash reserves and are looking at non-voice outsourcing acquisitions in high growth areas, such as banking, financial services and insurance, said Partha Sarkar, CEO of HTMT Global Solutions Ltd.        
	The outsourcing firm has already invested Rs 100 crore to build campuses across the country. Our 800-seater centre has become operational last month. The 450-seat Vashi centre will be ready by the end of this month, said Sarkar.        
	The 350-seater Mysore centre of HTMT is being closed down and a bigger centre for 650 seats is set to open shortly.        
	We will add 650 additional seats to our Bangalore facility which is one of our biggest with 2,700 people, Sarkar said.        
	HTMT is the first company in Bengal, to set up a centre in Durgapur, which employs around 1,500 people. The one-acre plot for an additional 1,000 employees will be ready by 2009-2010.        
	The Durgapur centre is doing exceedingly well and we have young employees from the whole of eastern India, including Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa, working there. Currently, it services three eastern circles for Bharti Airtel, said Sarkar.        
	The company has a national employee base of 13,575.

          GARIMA SINGH                                          
	New Delhi, March 16: WelcomHeritage, a joint venture between ITC and Marudhar Hotels of Jodhpur, is entering into a franchisee and marketing arrangement with three properties across India.        
	These are The Chalets in Naldehra near Shimla, the BijayNiwas Palace near Ajmer and the 150-year-old Hotel Calve in Pondicherry.        
	According to a senior company official, The three properties being signed are located far apart and offer different moods and uniquely different architectural styles.        
	This may in fact be considered the chains strength, as each of its 56 properties offers different features. This is a reflection of the families who have lived there and those who own the properties at present, the official said.         
	WelcomHeritage will sign an agreement with the owners of these properties early next week.         
	The Chalets is rated as one of the finest retreats in the Himalayas.         
	The log huts are designed in the style of Scandinavian huts and made of wood from Finland.        
	The Chalets has 19 huts, a restaurant and a bar. Golfing, rafting on the river Sutlej, riding, trekking and fishing are some of the leisure activities offered at this resort.        
	The second property which will come under the fold of WelcomHeritage is the BijayNiwas Palace.         
	It was built almost a century ago by Rao Bijay Singhji, the erstwhile ruler of Masuda, and is located in Rajasthans Ajmer district.         
	The palace has about 18 rooms that have been provided with modern amenities. However, the regal heritage can still be felt and relived in this elegant palace  mainly through well-preserved traditional murals and frescoes on the walls and original period furniture, sources said.         
	BijayNiwas has a dining hall, which offers both continental and Indian cuisine. About 65 kilometre from the holy town of Pushkar, the palace is also not far away from the Sonkhla reservoir which is the haunt of the Great Indian Bustard.        
	WelcomHeritages third property is located in Pondicherry. Once a bungalow, the Hotel Calve is made up of tall columns, wooden shutters, tiled flooring and fine woodwork.         
	The polished teak woodwork on doors, windows and wooden shutters are reminiscent of the past.         
	There are 10 rooms, having period furniture and soft furnishings. Continental cuisine is available along with Indian and local food.        
	With the addition of these three properties, WelcomHeritage will have 56 properties, comprising palaces, forts, resorts, manors, havelis, homes and tea bungalows, spread across 18 states in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Buffett in a different role
                                                                                                               Buffett in a different role
                              Its showtime!                            
	Los Angeles, March 20 (Reuters): Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, recently ranked as the worlds richest man,will be drawn into a fictional insider-trading scandal in an upcoming appearance on TV soap opera All My Children.        
	Buffett, 77, will play himself in an episode set to air during the May sweeps ratings period. It will be his second guest turn on the ABC daytime drama, a show spokesperson said on Wednesday. His first appearance was in 1992.        
	Buffett and the creator of All My Children, Agnes Nixon, are friends, and the investment magnate is a fan of the show, said spokesperson Mike Cohen.        
	Hes been waiting for an invitation to come back, and he was speaking to Agnes, and they made it happen, Cohen said.        
	Buffetts part is being written into a story line of the show involving the character Erica Kane, the vixen entrepreneur and self-styled media mogul played byseries veteran Susan Lucci.        
	Luccis character recently pleaded guilty to insider trading  a crime she unintentionally committed  but ended up a fugitive when another convict, she was handcuffed to, escaped en route to prison.        
	Cohen said Buffett would enter the plot after Ericas capture and imprisonment when he is called upon by their mutual friend, Opal (Jill Larson), to use his influence to try to leverage a deal on Ericas behalf. The outcome, however, is not what Erica had anticipated.         
	Cohen said Buffett would be paid the union scale salary as a day player for his role, roughly $700.         
	Buffett told Nixon recently that he never cashed his check from his 1992 appearance. Instead, he had it framed as an office memento with a photograph from his day on the set.        
	Earlier this month, Forbes magazine ranked Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, as the worlds wealthiest man with an estimated personal wealth of $62 billion. All My Children is one of the longest-running dramas on the US television, airing weekdays for 38 years on ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.

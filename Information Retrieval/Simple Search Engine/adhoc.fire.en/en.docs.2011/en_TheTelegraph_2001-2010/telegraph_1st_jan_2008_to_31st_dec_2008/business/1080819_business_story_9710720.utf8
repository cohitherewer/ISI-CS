	New Delhi, Aug. 18 (PTI): German car maker Volkswagen (VW) has firmed up plans to introduce the original peoples car  the Beetle  in the country next year.         
	The Beetle will come here. After strengthening our dealership network, it will come next year, Volkswagen India president and managing director Joerg Mueller said.        
	The company has been looking to use the Beetle as a brand-building tool as it prepares to get into the Indian compact car segment by 2010. The Beetle is now manufactured in Mexico for VWs worldwide supplies and can come to India as completely-built units.        
	VW is investing 580 million euros to set up a manufacturing facility at Chakan in Maharashtra from where it will roll out its small car for the Indian market.        
	It plans to launch its compact car based on the Polo platform in two variants  hatchback and sedan  once its Chakan plant starts production.        
	The car will be rolled out from our upcoming plant in Chakan by the first half of 2010, Mueller said.         
	From next year, the plant will also produce group firm Skodas new Fabia, he said.        
	The company is considering to expand its dealership network. At present, it has eight dealers in the country and targets to have 15 by the year-end. We are planning to have 15 dealers this year and it will go up to 120 by 2011, Mueller said.         
	VW also has plans to introduce its sports utility vehicle (SUV) Touareg in the country by early next year.        
	We are already selling it (Touareg) in India on order. The SUV will be officially launched in the first quarter of 2009, Mueller said while handing over the SUV to the German ambassador in India, Bernd Muetzelburg, here today.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Swaroop in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 5: Standard Chartered Bank India has posted an 89 per cent growth in operating profits for the first half of the year following a good show by its wholesale and consumer banking divisions.         
	Operating profit surged to $606 million from $320 million a year ago.        
	Standard Chartereds growth in operating profits followed a 73 per cent rise in the banks income to $975 million. The results included around $146 million which the bank earned from the sale of its asset management business. Excluding this, profits were up 44 per cent at $460 million.         
	Neeraj Swaroop, regional chief executive, India and South Asia, said he was confident that the bank would be able to repeat this performance during the next six months despite concerns of slowdown in the country.         
	He said the banks diversified earning stream protected it against the effects of the slowdown. Both our wholesale and consumer banking businesses are in good shape. There is some slowdown, inflation is rising and oil prices are high. But our good business model will allow us to cope with the downtrend, he said.         
	According to Swaroop, income from the banks wholesale operations rose 53 per cent to $580 million, while the operating profit from this business was at $411 million.         
	In consumer banking income and operating profits stood at $249 million and $49 million, respectively.         
	The first half saw close to $500 million additional capital flowing into the Indian operations.         
	India is now the second largest market in the Standard Chartered Group with a 23.4 per cent profit share.

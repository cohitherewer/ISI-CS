          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Spark of life                                  
	New Delhi, March 19: The World Bank has approved a $600-million loan to Power Grid Corporation to prop up the countrys electricity transmission system.        
	The bank said the fourth power system development project would aim to reduce transmission losses and cut the cost of energy through further investments in its transmission system.        
	The project will finance five transmission schemes: East-West Transmission Corridor, Western Region System Strengthening Scheme II, Eastern Region System Strengthening Scheme I, Balia-Bhiwadi HVDC Bipole System and North-West Transmission Corridor.        
	The loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,a World Bank arm, has a 20-year maturity, which includes a five-year grace period, according to a World Bank release.        
	The release said inspite of a booming economy, the countrys growth potential was constrained by inadequate electricity services and limited power generation and supply infrastructure.        
	The power ministry and the Central Electricity Authority are working out schemes to strengthen transmission systems in all regions, The projects will be mostly implemented by Power Grid and, in some cases, by private players.        
	The strengthening of transmission system is considered crucial to meet the provision of open access in transmission and distribution and power trading, which has been provided in the Electricity Act, 2003.        
	World Bank country director for India Isabel Guerrero said, This project, by strengthening transmission networks within and between regions, will enable more power to reach the people across the country.

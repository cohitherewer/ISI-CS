	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The number of landline subscribers is down 11 per cent to 3.92 crore in December 2007 from 4.4 crore in December 2004, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
    
	While 81.7 lakh customers opted for mobile connections in December 2007, more than 60,000 fixed-line connections were surrendered in the same month, said Trai officials.
    
	Telecom analyst Sudipto Basu said, Mobile phones provide value-added applications such as SMS, music and digital photos, which are not available on landline phones, leading to the change in preference. 
    
	Call rates are also similar in both modes of communication. Moreover, while a mobile connection is easily available, one has to wait to get a fixed-line connection in most cities, making it convenient for customers to opt for cell phones, Basu said. 
    
	However, industry analysts predict that with the introduction of triple-play services (telephone, broadband and TV on the same line), fixed-line telephones may be back in favour over the next few years. 
    
	Telecom operators such as BSNL, MTNL and Bharti Airtel reported negative growth in the PCO (public call offices) segment for the quarter ended September 2007. According to Trai, the teledensity at the end of December stood at 23.89 per cent against 23.21 per cent in November 2007.

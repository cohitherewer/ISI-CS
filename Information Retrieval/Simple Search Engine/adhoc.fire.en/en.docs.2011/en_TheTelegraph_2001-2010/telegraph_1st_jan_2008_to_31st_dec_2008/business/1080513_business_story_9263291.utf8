          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bajaj: Big venture                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: Bajaj Auto Ltd today announced that it had finalised its plan to launch a Rs 1-lakh car, rivalling Tatas Nano, by 2011.        
	Bajaj Auto will hold a 50 per cent stake in the project, while French company Renault and Japanese car maker Nissan will hold 25 per cent each. The companies will invest around Rs 1,000 crore in the project.        
	Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, and Carlos Ghosn, president and CEO of Renault and Nissan, today announced they would form a joint venture to develop, produce and market the car, code-named ULC, with a wholesale price range starting from $2,500, Bajaj Auto said in a statement today.        
	Bajaj Auto and Renault had started preliminary discussions on the small car project in 2007. Nissan joined as a partner later.         
	Bajaj announced its plans to develop the car in collaboration with the Renault-Nissan alliance in January this year.         
	However, the company had said it certainly will not be a Rs 1-lakh car while showcasing the prototype in January.        
	Ghosn, on the other hand, had announced plans to compete with the Nano. He had said Renault was aiming to manufacture a $3,000 car for the Indian market.        
	Bajaj Auto said the car would be made at a plant to be constructed at Chakan, Maharashtra.        
	The plant will have an initial production capacity of four lakh units per year.        
	The joint venture will also explore the possibilities for exporting the car in other emerging markets.        
	Sales will start in early 2011 in India, as a primary market, with growth potential in other emerging markets around the world, the company said.        
	The project has already extended into a joint product development and is on line to meet targeted performance and cost, the company said.

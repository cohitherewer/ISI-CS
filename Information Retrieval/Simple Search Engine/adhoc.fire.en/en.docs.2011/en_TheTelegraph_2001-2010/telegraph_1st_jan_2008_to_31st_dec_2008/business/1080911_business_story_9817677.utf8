          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Agarwala in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Bengal, in spite of the Singur impasse, inspires confidence among local investors.        
	Maithan Alloys Ltd, the largest producer of ferro manganese in India, said it was working on a plan to expand its presence in the state.        
	The company runs a 94,600-tonne plant near Asansol.        
	Subhas Chandra Agarwala, managing director of Maithan Alloys, said the company was looking for a site in Haldia.        
	This is going to be a port-based plant targeting the export market. We are at a very preliminary stage of planning. The company has approached the authority for land, he said.        
	Agarwala said the Singur problem troubled him but would not deter his plans. I am not going out of the state, he said.        
	While the Haldia project will take time, Maithan Alloys plans to set up a unit in Visakhapatnam at an investment of Rs 275 crore.         
	The new plant will have a capacity of 120,000 tonnes and is expected to be completed by 2011. The company is also setting up a 28,000-tonne unit in Meghalaya at an investment of Rs 80 crore.        
	Maithan Alloys wants plants near ports to enable it to import high quality manganese ore from South Africa and Australia.         
	It exports to Europe and Japan. This year Maithan hopes to export 60 per cent of its production compared with 25 per cent last year.

	Jamshedpur, April 4: Tata Motors subsidiary Telco Construction Equipment Company Ltd (Telcon) has bought a 60 per cent stake in Spanish firm Comoplesa Lebrero SA.         
	Telcon managing director Ranaveer Sinha today entered into an agreement with the shareholders of Zaragoza-headquartered Comoplesa Lebrero, which manufactures, markets and services compaction equipment. The balance 40 per cent will be retained by the shareholders of the Spanish firm, who will continue to be associated with the venture, a Telcon press release said.        
	Telcon focuses on construction equipment. It is a joint venture between Tata Motors and Japans Hitachi Construction Machinery Company.         
	Telcon also acquired a 79 per cent stake in another Spanish construction firm Serviplem a week ago.         
	The acquisition (of Comoplesa Lebrero) will help Telcon strengthen and add relevance to last weeks Serviplem deal, Sinha said.         
	Telcon is also setting up a manufacturing facility, an R amp;D centre and a training school in Kharagpur at an investment of more than $150 million.

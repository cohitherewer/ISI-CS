The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India fares to get cheaper
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Air India fares to get cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      COST CUSHION                           
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Air India will reduce fuel surcharge by Rs 400 on all domestic flights from Tuesday.         
	According to analysts, the move will put pressure on private airlines to cut fares. Most of them either said they would not follow suit or would take stock of the situation and announce a decision later.         
	At present, Air India levies a surcharge of Rs 2,750 for distances up to 750 km and Rs 3,100 for distances beyond that.         
	We are not planning to cut fares right now, said Ragini Chopra, vice-president of Jet Airways. A spokesperson for Kingfisher Airlines said the company was studying the impact of a cut in jet fuel price and would take a decision shortly. The two private airlines control about 55 per cent of the domestic market.        
	Jet and Kingfisher had entered into an alliance in October relating to fuel management, ground handling, network rationalisation and crew sharing.        
	Air Indias decision to cut surcharge follows the reduction in jet fuel prices by six per cent from today. The price of jet fuel, which accounts for nearly 35 per cent of an airlines operating costs, has dropped nearly 50 per cent since hitting a high in August.        
	In addition to cheaper jet fuel, the government has abolished the five per cent customs duty on the fuel. It is also planning to amend the Central Sales Tax Act in the upcoming session of Parliament to include the fuel on the list of declared goods. Such status means the fuel will have a uniform tax of 4 per cent in all states.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had earlier asked airlines to slash fares. Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal had then said that we will do whatever the government wants us to do, provided we are profitable.        
	Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya had said that fares could only be reduced if jet fuel was listed under the declared goods category.         
	Domestic airlines lost about Rs 4,000 crore in 2007-08 and are expected to lose Rs 8,000 crore in the current fiscal, according to government estimates. Their average seat occupancy has dipped from 70 per cent in 2007 to about 50 per cent now.

	Calcutta, July 25: Almost 50 per cent of the Nano cars to hit the road will run on Exide batteries.        
	Apart from the Nano, most of the new offerings from Honda, Maruti, Hyundai, Toyota, General Motors and Mahindra will have Exide batteries, said Rajesh G. Kapadia, chairman and non-executive director of Exide Industries.        
	The batteries will be supplied from the Haldia and the Shyamnagar units.         
	Exide will invest Rs 180 crore this fiscal to expand its manufacturing capacity.        
	The company will consider a hike in prices only if lead prices move beyond $2,500 per tonne.         
	We will not pass on the increase to our customers till lead prices are under $2500 per tonne, said T.V. Ramanathan, managing director and CEO of Exide.         
	Exide has reported 34 per cent growth in gross turnover at Rs 1,135 crore during the first quarter of 2007-08 compared with Rs 848 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	Its net profit rose 17 per cent to Rs 82 crore from Rs 70 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Profit growth was affected by the depreciation of the rupee against all major currencies. A depreciating rupee affects profitability since we import a major part of our main raw material. In view of burgeoning inflation rates, we have to keep a very tight leash on costs over the next three quarters to keep the momentum of the first quarter going, Ramanathan said.

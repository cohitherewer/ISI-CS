The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nalco needs ally in Indonesia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nalco needs ally in Indonesia
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Nalco, the countrys largest integrated aluminium producer and exporter, plans to include another investor in its upcoming Indonesian venture.        
	Last week, the company had signed an agreement to offload a 24 per cent stake in the Rs 14,000-crore smelter and power plant to RAK Minerals and Metal Investments of the UAE. It, now, plans to sell another 25 per cent stake in the project.         
	Nalco chairman C.R. Pradhan told The Telegraph that the company would hold a majority stake.        
	We are looking for one more investor in the project, he said, adding that the company would not sell shares to the public.        
	Nalco will go for the financial closure of the project once it brings in the second investor.        
	Once funds are tied up, we will seek the governments nod for the venture, Pradhan said.        
	Sources said Nalco was already in dialogue with prospective investors.        
	I cannot comment on who the new partner will be before the deal is finalised, he said. The project report will be ready by next month.        
	Navratna PSU Nalco had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the government of Indonesia in January this year for the project. It received approval in November to set up a 5-lakh-tonne aluminium smelter and a 1,250MW captive power plant in the country.        
	The venture plans to build a railway line and a port in south Sumatra, which has the largest coal reserve in Indonesia.         
	After picking up a stake in Nalcos venture, the UAE company will be entitled to use the infrastructure.        
	RAK Minerals will also build an industrial park in south Sumatra along with a freight corridor. The park will have metal-based industries and a captive power plant.         
	Nalco, which does not have any bauxite resource in Indonesia, plans to ship alumina from its Damanjodi plant in Orissa to make aluminium from the proposed smelter, which is likely to be commissioned in about five years.        
	Bauxite ore is processed to make alumina, which is further refined to make aluminium.

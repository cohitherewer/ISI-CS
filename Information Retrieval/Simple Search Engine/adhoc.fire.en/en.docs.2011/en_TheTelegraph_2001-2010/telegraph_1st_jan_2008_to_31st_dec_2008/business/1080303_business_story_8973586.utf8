The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt sees 25% pay hike
                                                                                                               Govt sees 25% pay hike

	New Delhi, March 2: Central government employees could expect an about 20-25 per cent salary hike in the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.         
	However, the commission is unlikely to recommend an increase in the retirement age by two years from the present 60 years, sources said.        
	They said the commission could propose an increase in the house rent allowance for government employees as the employees depended largely on private accommodation where rents are escalating.        
	Headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, the panel is expected to submit its report by March 31. A suggestion to merge some pay scales that would halve the number of the scales from the present 51 is also on the cards.        
	The sources said the introduction of contractual employment in highly specialised areas to bring in fresh ideas and new management skills was also on the recommendation list.        
	They said the anomaly in the pay of pensioners re-employed in a government service could be rectified. Re-employed government officials get their pensions deducted in their new job.        
	In 1996, the Fifth Pay Commission had proposed an increase in the retirement age from 58 to 60 to postpone the payment of retirement benefits because of the poor state of Centres finances.        
	With the budget for 2008-09 sounding the election bugle, the recommendations are likely to be populist to woo the salaried middle class.        
	The government could accept most, if not, all the recommendations as the economy was buoyant now and growing at around 9 per cent.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said that buoyancy in revenue collections could meet the additional burden.         
	He said the normal annual increase had already been accounted for by the government, and it was only a incremental sum that had to be factored in.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad has made a provision of Rs 5,000 crore for 2008-09 to meet the increase in the pay of the railways 14 lakh employees.        
	In the current fiscal, the outgo on account of pay and allowances for central government employees and pensioners has been fixed at Rs 46,379 crore. The Fifth Pay Commissions recommendations had cost the Centre Rs 8,800 crore extra a year.        
	Global credit rating agency Standard and Poors has, however, warned that Indias credit rating, currently at BBB-/Stable/A-3, may be revised downwards after the Sixth Pay Commissions report.         
	The primary threat to Indias fiscal consolidation efforts stems from the Sixth Pay Commission, S amp;Ps credit analyst Sani Hamid said.

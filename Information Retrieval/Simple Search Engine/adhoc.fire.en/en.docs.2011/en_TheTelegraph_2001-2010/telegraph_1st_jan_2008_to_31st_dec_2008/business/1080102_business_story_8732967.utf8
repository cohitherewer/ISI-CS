	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Indias exports grew 26.82 per cent in November 2007 to $12.42 billion compared with $9.79 billion in the same month a year ago. 
    
	However, the growth rate declined from 35 per cent registered in October 2007 because of the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar by about 15 per cent. Exports in October was at $13.3 billion 
    
	Foreign trade analysts said the growth in exports during November was only a fulfilment of the commitments made by exporters earlier. The real impact of the rupee on exports will be visible in the coming months and in the next fiscal, the analysts added.
    
	The Federation of Indian Export Organisations has sought a long-term policy against the rising rupee to prevent large-scale retrenchment of workers witnessed by the sector.
    
	For the April-November period this fiscal, exports grew 22.08 per cent to $98.38 billion against $80.59 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Imports for the eight-month period grew 26.9 per cent to $151.19 billion from $119.07 billion in the year-ago period.
    
	Oil imports during November were valued at $58.23 billion. This is 16.72 per cent higher than $49.89 billion reported in November 2006. Non-oil imports grew 35.3 per cent to $14 billion against $10.35 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year. Trade deficit for April-November 2007 stood at $52.8 billion compared with $38.48 billion in the same period a year ago.

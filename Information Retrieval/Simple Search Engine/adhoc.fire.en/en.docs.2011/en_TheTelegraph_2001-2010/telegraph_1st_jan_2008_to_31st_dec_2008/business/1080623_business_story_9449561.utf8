                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Consensus builds on repo rate hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                       
	Mumbai, June 22: Policy-makers are keen on a repo rate hike this week, believe bankers.        
	This view is gaining ground after Saturdays crisis meeting between finance minister P. Chidambaram and RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy on prices.        
	The bankers feel the hike may even occur before Friday, when the government will announce the latest inflation figures. Though economists do not want to give out a number at this stage, there are apprehensions in some quarters that inflation can hit the 13-per-cent mark.        
	Bond market circles as well as bankers and economists are bracing for a 25-basis-point hike in the repo rate, which is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends to banks. It is now at 8 per cent. On June 11, the RBI had raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8 per cent.         
	Some sections even expect a hefty 50-basis-point hike in the repo rate, though the majority does not subscribe to this view.         
	Many in the banking system also do not expect any tinkering with the cash reserve ratio (CRR), now at 8.25 per cent.         
	CRR is that portion of the deposit of a bank that is mandatorily kept with the RBI.        
	Observers say there are enough indications from the meeting between Chidambaram and Reddy to suggest that a rate hike may come this week itself and that it can be done over the next couple of days.         
	The finance minister spoke of stronger measures on the demand and monetary sides to quell inflationary expectations, which is being interpreted by bankers as a green signal to the RBI to go ahead with restrictive monetary measures.         
	The finance ministry is clearly willing to sacrifice growth for inflation and it certainly does not mind even banks raising lending rates, a senior official with a private sector bank said.         
	Monetary policy        
	In it monetary policy for 2008-09, the RBI had said it would ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords a high priority to price stability, while being conducive to growth momentum.         
	The central bank added that it would respond swiftly on a continuing basis to any adverse international developments and to the domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations.         
	Economists say in the immediate future the situation appears to be grim on the inflation front as crude oil prices are likely to stay firm.        
	With the outlook for inflation not positive for the next couple of months, the RBI is likely to act soon, the private bank official said.         
	The RBI had been on a monetary tightening mode since September 2004 when inflation was at 7.9 per cent. Though inflation did dip to a low of nearly 2.97 per cent in October last year, because of the moderation in prices of some primary food articles and manufactured product items, it has edged up since December 2007.         
	However, there are a few who think that Reddy will wait for one more inflation number before increasing rates. D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, is of the view that the RBI will not take any hasty step.         
	CMIE forecast        
	Inflation is expected to come down to 5.5 per cent in financial year 2008-09 and kharif crop is likely to play a major role in this moderation, says the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).        
	We retain our forecast of 5.5 per cent inflation for 2008-09. We expect inflation to increase further in the next couple of months and start receding from September, the cmie said in its monthly review.

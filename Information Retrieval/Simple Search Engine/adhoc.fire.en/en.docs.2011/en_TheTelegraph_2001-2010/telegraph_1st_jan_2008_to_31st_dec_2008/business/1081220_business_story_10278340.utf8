                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata Steel gets go-ahead from Liberia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prized Possession                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 19: The Liberian government has allowed Tata Steel to bid for the Western Cluster Iron Ore Project.         
	The company was barred from the bidding process because of alleged corruption charges. However, Tata Steel had contested the claim, denying any improper conduct on its part.        
	Now the African government has accepted the companys stand and has invited it for a re-bidding process.        
	The development augurs well for Tata Steel, which is looking for more iron ore mines across the globe to feed its Corus operation in Europe.        
	The ministry of justice of Liberia has given a clean chit to Tata Steel saying the company is not involved in any act of impropriety. The Public Procurement and Concession Commission carried out the investigation.        
	The company had written to the government expressing its anguish on being disqualified as its bid was highly rated  in technical, financial and social aspects  by an international consultant engaged by the Liberian government.        
	The Western Cluster Iron Ore Project has several deposits spread over an area of nearly 210 square km. The project envisages an investment of about $1.6 billion (about Rs 7,520 crore).         
	The deposits include Mano River Iron Ore, the western position of Bomi Hills Iron Ore and Mountain Iron Ore.        
	Besides mining, the project includes a pellet plant, road, rail, power, water and upgraded port facilities.         
	The project is being supervised by an inter-ministerial mineral technical committee that is chaired by the representative of the ministry of land, mines and energy.         
	The committee includes representatives of the ministries of justice, planning and economic affairs, labour, the National Investment Commission and the central bank.

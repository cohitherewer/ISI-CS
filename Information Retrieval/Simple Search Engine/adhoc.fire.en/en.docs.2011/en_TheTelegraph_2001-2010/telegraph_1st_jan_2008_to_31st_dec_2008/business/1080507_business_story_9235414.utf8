The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lower zinc prices give Eveready a breather
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lower zinc prices give Eveready a breather
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 6: Eveready Industries India Ltds net loss was marginally lower at Rs 19.31 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008, against Rs 22.54 crore a year ago.         
	The company said there was a slight easing in zinc prices, but it still had to grapple with rising prices of petroleum-based products.        
	On the London Metal Exchange (LME), zinc prices dropped to $2,784 per tonne in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal from $3,956 per tonne in the same quarter of 2006-07.        
	Net sales increased to Rs 847.17 crore from Rs 839.7 crore in the previous year.        
	There was a significant drop in losses suffered in the fourth quarter at Rs 6.52 crore compared with Rs 19.8 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	The company had hiked the prices of batteries by 20 per cent to 50 per cent in the last two years.         
	The move met with stiff resistance from customers in the rural areas. A company official, however, defended the price hike, saying rising input costs have forced Eveready to make the move.        
	However, the company managed to minimise its degrowth to 2 per cent by the end of last fiscal.         
	It has registered a 4 per cent growth in the last three quarters, resulting in a marked drop in losses.        
	The companys AA batteries registered 22 per cent growth in the last three quarters, but it was offset by a slump in D-size battery sales.        
	However, the companys market share remained steady at 52.7 per cent.        
	Brass flashlights also suffered a slowdown, as they are powered by D-size batteries.

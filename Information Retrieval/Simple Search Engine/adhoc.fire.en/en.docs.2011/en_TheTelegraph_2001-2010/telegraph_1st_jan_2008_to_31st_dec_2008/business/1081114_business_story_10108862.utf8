          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Inflation slithered down to a 21-week low of 8.98 per cent in the first week of this month, but the Opposition wondered whether the drop would benefit the common man.        
	Analysts said the stunning drop in the price indicator provided scope for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to further cut key interest rates and shovel cash into the system to stimulate growth. Political pressure may also mount on the government to reduce fuel prices.        
	For the week ended October 25, inflation was at 10.72 per cent; a year ago, it was much lower at 3.35 per cent.        
	Fuel items such as naphtha, jet fuel, furnace oil and light diesel oil have become cheaper with the plunge in crude price. Crude is currently trading at a 20-month low of $55 from $145 a barrel in July.        
	Analysts expect crude and commodities to continue their downhill journey and inflation to settle at 4.5-6 per cent by the end of this fiscal, much below the RBI forecast of 7 per cent.        
	The Opposition shrugged off the sharp fall in inflation. I am surprised by the massive reduction, in a week where there was no dramatic event affecting prices, Yashwant Sinha, former finance minister and senior BJP leader, told The Telegraph.        
	If the finance minister can doubt the credibility of IIP figures for August, he cannot be elated with the fall in inflation, Sinha said.         
	He said there was no sign of retail prices falling, and the government should cut petrol and diesel prices to lessen the burden on consumers.        
	According to D. Raja, national secretary of the CPI, The claim of the government that prices have fallen resulting in inflation coming down is not reflected at the ground level. Global crude prices have fallen, but the government is not keen to cut petrol and diesel rates, even though jet fuel prices have been reduced by 20 per cent in this month itself.        
	Economists feel the fall is genuine enough for the RBI to pursue an easy monetary policy and spur growth.        
	The surprise decline in inflation will give more leeway to the Reserve Bank to deepen interest rate cuts. The situation has changed dramatically in the space of one month, with inflation now less of a risk to growth than the financial crisis, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil.        
	Yes Bank chief economist Subhada Rao said, I expect a repo rate cut of 50 basis points in the near term. There is also a possibility of a cut of 25 basis points in the reverse repo.         
	Repo is the rate at which the RBI lends to banks for the short term, while the reverse repo is the rate at which it borrows from banks.        
	However, others warned that the fall in inflation should not be read as a signal of a return to good times.         
	India remains vulnerable to the vagaries of the world currency, commodity and financial markets, said the World Economic Forum in its latest report on India. The forum will hold a three-day India Economic Summit in the capital from Sunday.        
	According to the finance ministry, prices of rice, jowar, arhar, masur, potatoes, mutton and gur saw some increase.        
	Prices of raw rubber and groundnut seed declined by 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively.         
	At the same time, prices of iron ore softened by as much as 8 per cent.

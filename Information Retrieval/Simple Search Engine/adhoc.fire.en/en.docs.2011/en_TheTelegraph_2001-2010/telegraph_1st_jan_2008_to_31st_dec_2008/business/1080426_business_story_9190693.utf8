          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 25: Retail coffee chain Barista plans to open 80 outlets this year.         
	Partha Dattagupta, CEO of Barista Coffee, said, We are planning to open 80 stores in the country by the end of the current fiscal, out of which around 20 will be opened in towns where we are not present.         
	Barista has around 206 outlets, including 17 overseas. The expansion will require an investment of Rs 32 crore.         
	Dattagupta said his company was focusing on the domestic market. It is following three models for this purpose. The first is to open outlets near offices. The second is targeting high-street areas, such as malls and shopping complexes, where footfalls are high. The third model is company-owned exclusive stores.        
	These exclusive stores are very important to us and we will open 10 more exclusive stores to add to the 11 existing in the country.         
	Barista plans to open two outlets in Bangladesh. The coffee chain is already present in West Asia and Sri Lanka.         
	While opening new stores, Barista will close the non-profitable ones.        
	The company is hoping to break even by the end of the current fiscal.

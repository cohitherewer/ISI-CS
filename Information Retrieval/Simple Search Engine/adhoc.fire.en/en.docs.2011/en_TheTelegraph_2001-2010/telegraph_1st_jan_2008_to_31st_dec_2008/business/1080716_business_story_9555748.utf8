                                        Widening Reach		    
	Moscow, July 15 (PTI): Indian energy major Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is set to acquire a British oil company operating in Russia and the neighbouring Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, a media report said.        
	ONGC intends to buy Imperial Energy, a British oil company operating in west Siberia and Kazakhstan, the Kommersant daily reported, quoting a banking source.        
	The deal has been under negotiations since January and had received approval from the board of directors of Imperial Energy and UKs financial watchdog. Kommersant added that Imperial Energy, which reached a production rate of over 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in December 2007 and aims to achieve 25,000 bpd by the end of this year, said that it had received a takeover offer but gave no further details.         
	Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch are said to be the underwriters for ONGC and Imperial Energy, respectively.        
	The daily said Imperial Energys stock would go for at least $25.7 per share, which would value the firm at $2.62 billion or 67 per cent above its market capitalisation as of last Friday, and 40.2 per cent above Mondays share price.        
	ONGCs sole project in Russia has been a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-I project off Russias Pacific coast.         
	ONGC, through its overseas operations arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, owns a 20 per cent stake in offshore Sakhalin-I production sharing arrangement, with recoverable reserves estimated at 2.3 billion barrels of oil and 485 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

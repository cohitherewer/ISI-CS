	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Suzuki Motor Corporation is planning to buy out the stake of its Indian partner in two wheeler-venture Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd.        
	After pulling out of the joint venture with TVS, Suzuki Motor floated a new Indian subsidiary for motorcycles in 2006. While the Japanese firm initially held a 74 per cent stake in the subsidiary, the remaining 26 per cent was with the family of Satya Sheel, the companys managing director.        
	But over the years, industry sources said, Sheels stake in the company had significantly come down. This could not, however, be confirmed as both Suzuki Motor and Sheel remained tight-lipped.        
	There is a discussion within Suzuki on such a move, Katsumi Takata, joint managing director of Suzuki Motorcycle, said when asked if the Japanese firm planned to buy out the Indian partner.        
	On the current equity break-up, Takata refused to comment.        
	Sheel, who is now in China, said he was not in a position to comment on the matter immediately.        
	Suzuki Motor has, so far, invested Rs 400 crore in the joint venture and will make an additional investment of Rs 150 crore by 2010 to expand the production capacity.        
	Hyper sports bikes        
	Suzuki today launched two hyper sports bikes in India. To be imported from the companys manufacturing facility in Japan, the bikes  Hayabusa and Intruder M1800R  are priced at Rs 12.5 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	This launch is significant at a time of global uncertainties. Suzuki has been delivering superior technology, which has been proven worldwide. We intend to showcase the same in India, said Atul Gupta, vice-president (sales and marketing), SMI.        
	The bikes will be available in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.

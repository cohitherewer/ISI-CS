	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Auto makers plan to introduce more compact and mid-sized sedans this year. 
    
	Maruti will launch two compacts  the A-Star and the Splash  by October, while Hyundai will roll out the i-20, an upgraded version of the i-10, by the end of this year.
    
	Sedans such as Volkswagens Jetta and Passat, the Fiat Linea, Suzuki Swift (which will replace the Esteem), Mitsubishi Lancer Gallant, Honda City, Toyota Corolla, Audi A4 and a Tata offering will be launched this year. 
    
	India is known as a small-car market, but the country is now growing fast in the compact and mid-sized segments. Therefore, it makes sense for all car companies to plan their launches accordingly, said Jnaneshwar Sen, senior manager (marketing), Honda Siel Cars India.
    
	Marutis A-Star, which will sport a 1-litre Euro V engine, will be exported to Europe. 
    
	It will be showcased for the first time at the Delhi auto show next week.
    
	The Splash will be powered by a 1.2-litre petrol and 1.3-litre diesel engine and produced at Marutis Manesar plant.
    
	Hyundais i-20 will be manufactured in India and exported to other countries. It is expected to sport a price tag of Rs 5-6 lakh.
    
	Audi, after its A6, plans to bring in the new A4, which will have a turbocharged petrol 2000cc and pressure-injection diesel 2000cc engine. It will hit the roads in May.
    
	Auto analysts say in 2008, India is likely to consolidate its position as a hub for compacts and mid-sized sedans.
    
	Compacts and mid-sized sedans have witnessed growth of approximately 18 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, in the first eight months of the current fiscal, according to data compiled by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
    
	The industry sold 5,55,230 compact cars between April and November  the first eight months of the fiscal  against sales of 4,71,524 units in the corresponding previous period.
    
	Car manufacturers sold 1,46,210 mid-sized sedans during the period under review, against sales of 1,29,693 units a year ago. 
    
	According to SIAM, annual sales of passenger cars in India more than doubled in the past five years to 1.08 million units in 2006-07. 
    
	At present, seven of every 1,000 in India own a car.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trai for wider licence reach
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trai for wider licence reach
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New move                                  
	New Delhi, May 28: The telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) today proposed that value-added service providers should be brought under the licensing regime before mobile virtual network operators entered the telecom sector with their own value-added services.        
	In a consultation paper issued today, Trai said, To facilitate the growth of value-added services and appropriate returns on investment to all participants in the provisioning of value-added services and to protect the interest of consumers, there is a need to have a proper licensing regime.         
	Under the unified access services licence now, mobile service providers are allowed to provide value-added services without further licensing. They only need to inform Trai and the department of telecom (DoT) before starting any new service. However, there is no licensing framework for content providers who act as value-added service providers.         
	Therefore, Trai asked, Is there a need to bring such value-added service providers who not only provide the content to telecom operators but also provide and operate the technology platform under the ambit of licensing regime?         
	Value-added services are facilities beyond voice calls and include SMS, MMS, data downloads and email services.        
	According to Trai estimates, revenue generated from value-added services is more than 14 per cent of the total revenue of telecom service providers. It is expected to cross 30 per cent of the their revenue in seven years.        
	There is a need to harmonise the regulatory framework for ushering growth in all the segments of value-added services such as content development, technology platform, content aggregation including copy right protection, said Trai.

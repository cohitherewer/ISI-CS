	Calcutta, April 22: A high-level delegation from the UK will meet R. Velu, minister of state for railways, on Wednesday to discuss investment opportunities.

	Former ICC president J.P. Chowdhary said the British delegation would present various project proposals to improve the service, efficiency as well as annual turnover of the railways.

                                                                                                            TN ultimatum to cement firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Difficult Times                           
	Chennai, Jan. 2: Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi can well achieve what finance minister P. Chidambaram hasnt: drive down cement prices.        
	The DMK government today threatened to take over the plants of the 13 private cement manufacturers in the state if they fail to slash prices, which are currently ruling between Rs 245 and Rs 260 per 50kg bag.        
	In Budget 2007, Chidambaram had tried to force down cement prices with a dual excise strategy: companies were required to pay excise at Rs 350 per tonne for cement sold at less than Rs 190 per 50 kg bag, and Rs 600 per tonne if they sold over the price threshold. It didnt work as the cement makers refused to be bullied into lowering prices.        
	The DMK government is backing up its threat with plans to import cheap cement which will be sold directly to consumers.        
	At a cabinet meeting today, the government ordered state-owned Tamil Nadu Cements Corporation (Tancem) to immediately import one lakh tonnes of cement through the Centres canalising agency, Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC).         
	Imported cement will be stocked in the warehouses of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd  another state-owned agency  and sold directly to consumers at a controlled rate.        
	Karunanidhi issued the threat of a takeover of cement plants after he came under pressure from his political ally, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) party.        
	PMK leader Ramadoss has been demanding that cement should be sold through the public distribution system, in the same way as rice, wheat, kerosene and sugar is sold.        
	Cement makers are peeved by the Tamil Nadu governments move, arguing that the prices are high because of robust demand. They contended that cement wasnt in short supply in the state and most units were working at full capacity. Some cement firms are also planning to expand their capacities because of the real estate boom.         
	Ramadoss antics have forced Karunanidhi to act as the DMK doesnt want to lose the aam admi plank to its fractious ally. Ramadoss has the support of the Vanniyars, an influential OBC group in the state.         
	The situation is so grim that the government had to send out a warning to private cement producers at a time when prices are abnormally high, official sources told The Telegraph.        
	Sources said Tancem had already been authorised by the state government to place a request for the import of five lakh tonnes through MMTC. The state corporation plans to import 18 lakh tonnes of cement over a one-year period to help moderate the prices.        
	Tancem has received clearances to import directly from Pakistan, where the prices are lower. Bidding for Tancems first tender to import up to 1.8 lakh tonnes is scheduled to open on January 14. Tancem can float tenders to import between one and two lakh tonnes every alternate month depending on the demand in the state.        
	The decision to import cement was taken at the India-Pakistan secretary-level talks held last August. MMTC was allowed to import cement from Pakistan without a Bureau of Industrial Standards certification. A similar waiver for a limited quantity was granted to Tancem.

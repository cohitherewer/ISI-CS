The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High fuel rates force airlines to raise fares
                                                                                                               High fuel rates force airlines to raise fares
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 1: Airlines are planning to raise ticket prices after the recent jump in the aviation turbine fuel (ATF) rates.        
	Most airlines are looking to raise the air fuel surcharge by 10 to 20 per cent. The surcharge varies between 25 and 40 per cent of ticket prices for flights over 750 km.        
	Leading the way, Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines today announced that it was raising fares by Rs 150-350 with immediate effect.        
	The increase in the fares for long-haul flights will be Rs 350, while for the short-haul the hike would be Rs 150, a Kingfisher spokesperson said. This indicates that Deccan Aviation will also revise its rates.        
	Jet Airways, the countrys largest private sector airline, also plans to increase the fuel surcharge by Rs 150 for distances up to 750 km, and by Rs 350 for distances above that on domestic routes.        
	At present, the fuel surcharge is a flat Rs 1,650 for all our domestic flights. From April 7, it has been revised to Rs 1,800 for journeys below and up to 750 km. The fuel surcharge will go up to Rs 2,000 for flights over longer distances, an airline official said.        
	But, if you book your flight before April 7 for any date, the revised rates will not be applied, the Jet official added.        
	Private airlines have been forced to take the decision because of growing losses and the Centres inability to persuade states to trim sales tax on ATF.         
	Following a 14 per cent rise in ATF prices, the surcharge was increased to Rs 1,650 in December 2007. Some analysts said the airlines had no option but to pass on the burden of the frequent hikes in ATF prices.        
	At present, domestic air travellers pay Rs 2,025 as the total service charge, excluding the basic fare. This service charge includes an air traffic congestion fee of Rs 150 and a passenger service fee of Rs 225 over and above the surcharge.         
	Following the hike, passengers would have to pay a total service charge of about Rs 2,175 for flying on routes below 750 kilometres, and Rs 2,375 for destinations beyond that.         
	We are also looking at increasing the fuel surcharge by Rs 150 for distances up to 750 kilometres, and by Rs 350 for distances above that. This will certainly deter the growth of the industry. We have been asking the states to decrease the sales tax, but no one has replied, except for Andhra Pradesh, said Siddhanta Sharma, CEO of SpiceJet.         
	The ATF prices in India are higher than those in South-east Asia and are 60 to 70 per cent above the global average.         
	Fuel bills account for 30 to 40 per cent of overall operations for Indian carriers.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had urged the finance ministry to make ATF a declared good so that the sales tax on it could be pegged at 4 per cent. He also lobbied for a reduction in other taxes on ATF to make it cheaper.        
	The government policies seem to be favouring only the state-owned carriers. If air fares keep increasing without actually making the overall business profitable, one or two private airlines might have to stop operating soon, Sharma added.         
	We are still looking at options. As of now, we have not taken any decision to raise the fuel surcharge, an official at Air India said.

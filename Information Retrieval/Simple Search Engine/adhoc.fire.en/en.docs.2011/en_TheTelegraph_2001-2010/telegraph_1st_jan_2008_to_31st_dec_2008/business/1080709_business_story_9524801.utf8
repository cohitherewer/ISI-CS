	Frankfurt, July 8 (Reuters): German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG plans to cut around 4 per cent of its workforce as part of an overhaul and as a result of the global economic downturn, the company said today.        
	Siemens wants to cut 16,750 jobs globally, of which 12,600 are mainly in administration, to help Europes biggest engineering group reach a savings target of 1.2 billion euros ($1.9 billion) by 2010 and boost profit margin levels, Siemens said.        
	Another 4,150 jobs will be eliminated through the companys restructuring programme.        
	Chief executive Peter Loescher, who has extensively restructured Siemens since taking charge a year ago, said Siemens needed to become faster and more efficient to catch up with competition. This takes on special urgency when one considers the economic downturn, he added.

	Calcutta, May 30: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) has proposed a merger with NMDC Limited.        
	Unlisted RINL owns a steel plant in Visakhapatnam and NMDC, listed both on the BSE and the NSE, is the largest iron ore producer in the country. Both the companies are under the steel ministry.        
	This will be a win-win situation for both the companies. Ten years down the line, the merged entity can become as formidable as Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) is today, said RINL chairman and managing director P.K. Bishnoi.        
	Bishnoi said he has floated the proposal informally with the steel ministry as well as with NMDC. The response, however, has not been encouraging so far. I have set the ball rolling. It will take time, Bishnoi added. NMDC chairman and managing director Rana Som, on the other hand, denied any knowledge of such a proposal.        
	I am not aware of any such move, Som told The Telegraph. NMDC sources said any such proposal had to come from the government  the owner of the two firms  instead of an individual company.         
	 NMDC is planning to set up a steel plant and we are looking for a captive mine. They produce iron ore and we make steel, therefore its complementary, Bishnoi said.        
	There are, however, apprehensions about the proposed merger.        
	A three-way joint venture involving SAIL, RINL and NMDC for a steel plant in Chhattisgarh had earlier fallen through. NMDC is now working on the project alone, helped with technical know-how from RINL.         
	The idea was to transfer captive mines to the JV. It could not be done. There was a proposal that the company buys iron ore at a market price, which did not make sense for RINL, Bishnoi added.                                            
	SAIL had also planned to merge RINL with itself earlier, but the plan had to be withdrawn after political opposition in Andhra Pradesh, where both NMDC and RINL have their headquarters.         
	RINL is now plagued with a 200 per cent increase in coking coal and 68 per cent jump in iron ore prices.        
	RINLs executive director M.V.R. Sarma said the company would hardly make any profit if steel prices were not increased. The Centre has forced Indian steel companies to check prices for battling inflation.        
	RINL makes about Rs 8,000-10,000 per tonne margin. It buys coking coal from Australia and iron ore from NMDC.         
	 The best part of the margin will be eaten away if prices are not raised, Sarma added.        
	RINL is expanding production capacity to 6.3 million tonnes by February 2010. It posted a 16 per cent growth in income to Rs 9,993 crore and profit after tax of Rs 1,943 crore, up 42 per cent, in 2007-8.

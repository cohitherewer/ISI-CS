     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: The group of ministers (GoM) on fuel, meeting tomorrow, is expected to finalise its options to fight spiralling global crude prices. It is, however, unlikely to take a call on raising prices of the four petroleum products  petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene.
    
	Sources said the petroleum ministry could seek an increase of Rs 2-4 a litre in the price of petrol and Rs 1-2 per litre for diesel. 
    
	This will be the first meeting of the GoM, which is headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.
    
	While the ministerial meeting will work out the options, the final decision will be taken by the Union cabinet, sources said.
    
	According to analysts, poll reversals in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh will weigh heavily on the mind of the ministers while considering the options at tomorrows meeting. 
    
	The government will also have to consider the Left and BJPs resistance to a hike and the impact on prices of essential commodities.
    
	The GoM is meeting tomorrow and I hope a decision is taken, petroleum minister Murli Deora said.
    
	He, however, refused to say the amount of hike that the GoM might recommend to the Cabinet. I cant say anything on that. He said a hike was not the only option.
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while returning from China, had said all factors would be taken into account before taking a decision on raising the prices of petroleum products.
    
	Expressing concern over the rise in crude prices, Singh said this would affect other commodities, too, and the government would have to find ways to meet this crisis.
    
	State-owned oil retailers  the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited  have been putting pressure on the government to review fuel prices because they are losing about Rs 340 crore daily on their sales.

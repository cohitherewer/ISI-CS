          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 5: An Indian delegation will leave tomorrow for Brussels for the latest round of negotiations in the Indo-EU free trade agreement (FTA).        
	The negotiations are on track and we hope that the FTA will be signed next year, Union commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said on the sidelines of an interactive session of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India (EEPC) here today.        
	Union commerce minister Kamal Nath had recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the pace of the negotiations and wanted the talks to conclude by this calendar year so that the FTA could be in place by 2009.        
	The trade agreements with Korea and Japan are also progressing well.         
	With Korea, about 90 per cent of the negotiations has been settled and another round of talks will take place later in the month. Maybe another round is required before we seal it, Pillai said.        
	According to the commerce secretary, the problem with Japan was about getting market access, and not tariffs.        
	India is trying to make greater inroads into Japan in sectors such as pharma and textiles.        
	Pillai said the acquisition of Ranbaxy by Daichi Sankyo was likely to pave way for the opening up of the Japanese pharma sector to India firms.        
	Textile is another sector where India could claim a greater share of Japanese imports if the technical barriers were removed. Pillai also told exporters not to expect any major policy decisions ahead of the upcoming elections.        
	Land Port bill        
	The Centre will introduce the Land Port Authority bill in the next session of Parliament. The proposed Land Port Authority of India will have the mandate for upgrading the 13 land customs stations and integrated check posts, besides managing and maintaining these posts on the borders for regulation of trade.

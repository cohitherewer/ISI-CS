	Jan. 18: Wipros third-quarter net profit rose 12 per cent to Rs 854 crore. The Bangalore-based, NYSE-listed firm posted a 33 per cent year-on-year growth in revenues in the quarter at Rs 5,303 crore.
    
	Revenues from our global IT services of $910.1 million were ahead of our guidance of $905 million, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said.
    
	Looking ahead, for the quarter ending March 2008, we expect revenues from global IT services business to be $955 million, he added.
    
	Wipro said organic global IT margins remained flat despite an appreciating rupee and impact of wage hikes. For the December quarter, the global IT service and products business added 39 clients.
    
	The results were in line with market expectations, but the surprise element was missing. Besides, the company is facing a higher attrition rate of 18 per cent, and its offshore billing rates are down by 0.5 per cent, said Harshad Deshpande, an analyst with Religare Securities. Wipros shares fell almost 1.11 per cent to Rs 455.35 on the BSE today.
    
	ITC topline up 11%
    
	ITC today beat street expectations by posting 11 per cent growth in its third-quarter topline. Backed by a strong quarter for cigarette sales, profit rose 16 per cent to Rs 830.72 crore from Rs 717.4 crore in the same period last year. 
    
	Net sales were up to Rs 3,458 crore from Rs 3,114.7 crore in the third quarter of 2006-07. The company has posted a 50 per cent growth in revenues from the newer FMCG businesses such as foods, lifestyle retailing and stationery coupled with healthy increases in revenues from the hotels and paperboards and packaging businesses.

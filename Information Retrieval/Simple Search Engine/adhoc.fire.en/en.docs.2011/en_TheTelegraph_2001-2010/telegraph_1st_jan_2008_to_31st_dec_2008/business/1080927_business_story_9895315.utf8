	Calcutta, Sept.26: Larsen amp; Toubro, ICICI Ventures and IL amp;FS are keen to pick up stakes in NTPC-Bhel Power Projects Ltd, the newly formed joint venture company,         
	According to Union minister of state for power Jairam Ramesh, the government plans to offload around 50 per cent stake in the joint venture to strategic investors. The government is in talks with interested firms and a decision will be taken in the next two months.        
	At present, National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) hold 50 per cent each in the company.        
	The NTPC-Bhel combine will hold less than 50 per cent post dilution, Ramesh said during his visit to the Budge Budge generating station, where CESC is building its third 250MW unit.        
	C.P. Singh, Bhels former director of engineering, is the chairman of the new company.        
	The joint venture firm, which is expected to invest Rs 6,000 crore over the next five years in greenfield projects, will raise the money in a debt-equity ratio of 70:30.        
	The company will kick off with engineering procurement and construction contracts for power projects.         
	In the next stage it will engage in critical balancing of plant equipment.         
	Finally, the joint venture will set up manufacturing bases to produce the main equipment having an annual capacity of 4,000MW.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CII survey upbeat on investment in first half
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             CII survey upbeat on investment in first half
                            
	New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): Domestic companies are likely to pump in more money during the first half of this fiscal, which will help the economy to expand by over 8 per cent, a survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said.        
	Though business confidence during April-September is likely to moderate because of factors such as high interest rates, the availability and cost of labour and global turbulence, investments are expected to remain on track, the survey added.        
	New orders, it said, are expected to raise the value of production in the next six months pushing up employment generation in the later part of the current year.        
	With exports likely to grow in the first half, the survey said the government should address problems such as rising interest rates, high transaction costs and procedural delays.         
	This has been a long-standing hurdle for exporters, which raises transaction costs and needs to be addressed urgently, the survey said.        
	The CII survey also raised various other concerns such as infrastructure bottlenecks, declining consumer demand and increasing import.        
	Many of the respondents, the survey said, wanted the government to lower interest rates to boost consumer demand and investment.        
	Some respondents, it said, called for diversification of the export market to address issues concerning the slowdown in the US economy.

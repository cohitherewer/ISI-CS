          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 20: The repo rate has been raised three times this year  twice in June and once in July.         
	On the way up, the key short-term rate was the device that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) used to put a lid on runaway inflation.        
	Four months later, inflation is no longer the biggest bugbear; the new enemy is the cash crunch in the system which threatens to stunt economic growth this year.        
	Bankers have a theory why the RBI chose to use the rate-signalling tool to crank up the growth engine even though inflation was still running in double digits.        
	They said the repo rate cut should be seen in the context of the economic slowdown. Recent data showed that industrial growth had started to falter, falling to a mere 1.3 per cent in August against 10.9 per cent during the yearago period.        
	At the same time, the rate of inflation dipped to 11.44 per cent for the week ended October 4 from 11.80 per cent in the previous week.        
	The RBI clearly thinks that inflation concerns have eased. One must also not forget the crucial fact that crude oil prices and that of commodities such as iron and steel have softened considerably. Therefore, there is some optimism that inflation will ease further going forward, one banker said.        
	Over the past fortnight, the RBI has tried to inject money into the cash-strapped banking system by lowering the cash reserve ratio to 6.5 per cent.        
	One banker said todays repo rate cut should be seen as a measure designed to stabilise volatile equity markets. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been huge sellers of domestic equities.        
	The RBI also wants to improve the stock market sentiment by bringing down the repo rate. Lower interest rates will benefit both banks and corporate houses. It will also have an impact on the economic outlook, which can then arrest FII outflows, the banker said.        
	Banks have, however, used the repo window in only fits and starts this year.         
	At the latest auction on October 17, there was only one bidder who raised Rs 250 crore. But on October 1  when the credit crisis was at its height  51 bids were accepted for Rs 70,295 crore.

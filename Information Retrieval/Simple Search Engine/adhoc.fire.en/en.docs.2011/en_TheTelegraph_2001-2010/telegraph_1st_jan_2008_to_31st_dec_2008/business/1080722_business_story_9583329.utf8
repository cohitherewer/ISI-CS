The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India to talk tough at WTO
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       India to talk tough at WTO
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           G.K. Pillai: Firm stand                                  
	New Delhi, July 21: India and other developing nations today indicated that they would take a tough stand at the WTO meet in Geneva.         
	The developing nations criticised the developed countries for not reducing farm subsidies effectively. There is not much room for compromise because it is a livelihood concern and not for preserving the prosperity of rich farmers, commerce secretary G. K. Pillai said.         
	Pillai is representing India at the WTO ministerial meet, which began today, in the absence of Union commerce minister Kamal Nath, who had to stay back in New Delhi for the trust vote tomorrow.         
	Fourteen years after the Uruguay round of talks was concluded, the developed countries are still having subsidies in hundreds of billions of dollars. No actual reduction has taken place, Pillai said.         
	While developed countries, including the US and the European Union (EU), want the developing countries to open up their markets, the emerging economies want to ensure that they get more out of the Doha round than their richer counterparts.         
	The five-day ministerial meet will determine whether a breakthrough is possible in the Doha trade talks. If the meeting failed to narrow down the differences over market access to agriculture and industrial goods, the round, which began in September 2001, could go on till 2010 or later. India had earlier said that the level of cuts in agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs might be negotiated if there was consensus among the developing and developed countries.         
	There are numbers in the text and whether we can go beyond is something that will be negotiated. It is possible on a few isolated cases that we may even go beyond the numbers if there is a consensus among ministers, Pillai said.         
	If developed countries such as the US go beyond the offer range (as given in the market access texts circulated at the WTO) for cutting farm and industrial tariffs, anybody else can also go outside the numbers, Pillai added.         
	EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said the 60 per cent reduction in agricultural subsidies was the best offer from Brussels and urged emerging economies such as Brazil, India and China to reciprocate by slashing their industrial tariffs.         
	India, South Africa and Argentina  the key members of the NAMA-11 alliance at the WTO  have rejected a move by developed countries to limit the flexibility on tariffs and imports of developing countries to protect the rich countries domestic industry and farm sectors.         
	Meanwhile, the US and the EU are pressing the developing nations to make concessions in opening the markets to ensure a trade deal.

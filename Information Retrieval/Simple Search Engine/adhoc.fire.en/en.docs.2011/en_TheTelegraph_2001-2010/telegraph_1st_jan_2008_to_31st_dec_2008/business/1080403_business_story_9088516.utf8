The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spice Comm scouts for foreign ally
                                                                                                               Spice Comm scouts for foreign ally
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Big plans                                  
	Mumbai, April 2: Spice Communications is in talks with some foreign players, including AT amp;T and Emirates Telecommunications (Etisalat), for a possible collaboration in the Indian telecom market.        
	Spice needs around $3 billion to fund its pan-India expansion plans. At present, the company provides GSM services in Punjab and Karnataka.         
	The Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Telecommunications Corp (Etisalat) today said it had held meetings with Spice Communications and some other companies to invest in the growing Indian telecom market.        
	The possibility of a foreign collaboration had spurred the Spice scrip and in the last three trading days it had gained almost 30 per cent. The telecom scrip jumped over 10 per cent today to close at Rs 33.90.        
	India is a very attractive market for Etisalat and we are studying the different entry strategies to determine the most appropriate fit, Etisalat chairman Mohammad Omran was today quoted to have said in a statement.        
	We have entered into direct meetings with various entities, Spice Communications being one of them, Omran added.        
	However, no agreement has been signed.        
	Etisalat is one of the leading telecom companies in the Gulf. According to Omran, the company is planning to bid for a telecom licence in India.        
	Spice Communications refused to comment on its possible talks with Etisalat, terming the talks a shareholders issue.        
	Though Spice had applied for licences to operate in 21 circles, the company was given permission to operate only in four circles  Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi  in January this year.         
	The company, which posted a profit for the first time in the quarter ended December 2007, however, is keen to expand it presence across India.        
	Another company which is in talks with foreign players for its telecom foray is Unitech. The real estate major, which has recently bagged 12 telecom licences, is in talks with AT amp;T and Qatar Telecom for a joint venture. The company is likely to finalise its partner in a few months.        
	There are also reports that AT amp;T is in talks with the Videocon group for a possible telecom foray.

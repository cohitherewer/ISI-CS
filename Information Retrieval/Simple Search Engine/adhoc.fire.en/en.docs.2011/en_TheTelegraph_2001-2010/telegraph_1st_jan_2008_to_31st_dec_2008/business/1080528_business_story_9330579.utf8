          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: The government today partially lifted the ban on cement exports as demand is expected to be low in the next two months because of the rains. However, the restrictions on rice export will continue despite a bumper harvest and record procurement.        
	June and July is the monsoon period. Nobody builds houses during this time, commerce secretary G. K. Pillai told reporters on the sidelines of an industry meet.        
	Pillai, however, said the exports would be permitted only from the ports in Gujarat and two million tonnes of cement were expected to be shipped.        
	The government had banned cement export in April to contain inflation. Cement manufacturers also agreed to a price cut ranging between Rs 3.50 and Rs 7 per 50-kg-bag for three months.        
	The commerce secretary said there were no plans to relax the ban on rice export. There is no proposal to ease the ban on rice export, he said, while indicating that the minimum export price on basmati will continue. The export ban continues despite record wheat procurement of 20.7 million tonnes this year by the state-run agencies.        
	Around 98.4 per cent of wheat that arrived in Punjab has been procured by the Food Corporation of India and 99 per cent has been procured in Haryana, finance minister P. Chidambaram had said.        
	Trade analysts said the continued ban on commodities sent a wrong signal to the global community, especially at a time of a significant rise in global food and metal prices.

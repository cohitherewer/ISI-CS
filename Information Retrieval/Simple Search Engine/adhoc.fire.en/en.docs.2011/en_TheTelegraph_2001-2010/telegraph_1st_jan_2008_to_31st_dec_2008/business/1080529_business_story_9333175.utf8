	Calcutta, May 28: Srei Infrastructure plans to launch rural mobile telephony and courier services using the national e-governance platform.        
	The company bagged a contract for setting up 25,000 common service centres in six states under the e-governance programme a year ago.        
	There are 10-12 players setting up one lakh service centres in different states under the national e-governance programme. If these players agree, we together can launch services such as courier and mobile telephony catering specifically to rural areas in the country, said a Srei official.         
	He, however, added that there were no such proposals from any of these players and this was just a business idea at Sreis level.        
	Weve identified 33 kinds of business services that can be provided through the broadband-based service centre network, he said.         
	The national e-governance programme, approved in 2006, aimed at setting up one lakh Internet kiosks in rural areas across the country to bridge the digital divide.         
	An investment of Rs 5,742 crore was estimated for the entire project and Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services was appointed the project management agency at the national level.

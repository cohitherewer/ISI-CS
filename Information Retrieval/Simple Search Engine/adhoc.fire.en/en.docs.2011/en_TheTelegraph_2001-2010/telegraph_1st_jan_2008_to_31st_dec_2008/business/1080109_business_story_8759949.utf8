The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sites identified for Mittal
                                                                                                            Sites identified for Mittal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                           
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Jharkhand has identified iron ore prospecting areas for ArcelorMittal at Ankua and Karampada.        
	Besides the land that it has identified for ArcelorMittal, which is yet to be allotted, Jharkhand has given nearly 5,300 hectares of rich ore bearing areas to other investors, state government sources said.        
	Possibly as a reaction to this development, Union steel ministry officials had last week flown down to Jharkhand to meet state chief minister Madhu Koda and try to persuade him to renew the lease of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) on Chiria, Asias largest reserves of iron ore.         
	These officials pointed out that most major steel makers had been given mining or prospecting leases which would enable them to set up plants in the state. Chirias reserves could well be allowed to remain with SAIL, which itself had drawn up plans for investing Rs 40,000 crore in the state, they contended.        
	ArcelorMittal, which has pledged to set up a 10 million tonne steel plant in the state, has been in the race for the Chiria mines, which state-run SAIL currently controls. Part of this lease was cancelled sometime back by the state government, raising hopes that there might be reallocations of some mining areas.         
	The lease cancellation is however under a legal challenge and a mining tribunal has already given a ruling in favour of SAIL.         
	Mittal and SAIL are also locked in a battle over Ghatkuri mining area which, too, may take a long time to resolve as SAIL has been citing an earlier reservation of the area for public sector units.         
	This is perhaps why the state had been looking out for fresh areas which it might offer to ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel maker.         
	Ankua, which borders Chiria, is believed to have ore which is as rich in iron content as Chiria. It has already attracted Indias top steel makers.         
	Tata Steel has been recommended for a prospecting lease of over 1,827 hectares in Ankua, while the Centre has already given a prospecting lease to JSW Steel, of the Jindal group, for 1,388.5 hectares in Ankua, adjacent to SAILs Dobhil lease in Chiria.         
	Sesa Goa, too, has a prospecting licence for another part of Ankua, adjacent to Dobhil. We have made allocations to most important steel makers who have signed memorandums of understanding with us. The total value of this investment could come up to Rs 100,000 crore, other state government officials said.         
	The major players to whom Jharkhand has made allocations of either prospecting or mining leases include Tisco, JSW, Jindal Steel and Power, Essar, Bhushan, Abhijit and Neelachal Ispat.

	Calcutta, April 16: Standard Chartered Bank, into its 150th year in the country, has put in $250 million to increase its capital base to $1.9 billion. The capital infusion was required to increase our capital adequacy ratio, said Peter Sands, group CEO of London-based Standard Chartered Plc.         
	The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is 11 per cent plus compared with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requirement of 9 per cent.         
	India accounts for 17 per cent of Standard Chartered Plcs global revenue. In 2007, our income from operations here rose 52 per cent to $1.13 billion and profit before tax went up 70 per cent to $690 million, Sands said.         
	India will continue to be a focus country for Standard Chartered, which completed the acquisition of American Express Bank (excluding its credit card business) globally in February.         
	At present we have 83 branches in the country. After the acquisition of American Express Bank, our branch network will increase to 90, Sands said.         
	However, the RBI is yet to give its approval to the merger that will bring the American Express Bank branches in India into Standard Chartereds fold.        
	We have also applied to the RBI for opening 40 branches and 300 ATMs in the current calendar year, said Neeraj Swaroop, regional chief executive (India and South Asia), Standard Chartered Bank. The bank has 231 ATMs.        
	Standard Chartered Bank last year sold its mutual fund business and bought a 49 per cent stake in stock broking firm UTI Securities, which is owned by Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd.         
	We have the option to increase our stake in UTI Securities, which is now called SCB STCI Capital Markets, to 74 per cent in another three months. However, we may divest the commodities brokerage platform of SCB STCI Capital Markets into a separate subsidiary, said Swaroop.        
	Insurance broking is also on Standard Chartereds radar. In some countries, we are profitably doing insurance broking, Sands said. He said the bank was not interested in the insurance underwriting business. Standard Chartered Bank, which lost $300 million in the sub-prime fiasco, sees the global financial turmoil to continue for some more months.

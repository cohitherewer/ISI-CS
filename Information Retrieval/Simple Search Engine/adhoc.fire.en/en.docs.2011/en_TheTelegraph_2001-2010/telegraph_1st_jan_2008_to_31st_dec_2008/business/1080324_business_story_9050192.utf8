                                                                                                               Plan ahead of time
        Set your targets and Srikumar Bondyopadhyay helps you with the basics of financial planning                                            
	The financial liabilities of Indian households increased four-fold, while their financial assets only doubled between 2003-04 and 2006-07. According to Reserve Bank data, financial liabilities of households jumped to Rs 2,81,093 crore during the period from Rs 69,982 crore, while their financial assets increased to Rs 7,58,750 crore from Rs 3,77,387 crore.        
	This implies that households will have to part with 37 per cent of their financial assets to repay their liabilities. Apparently, this may not seem to be a worrying sign but it definitely calls for efficient financial planning.        
	Money management        
	Financial planning means taking money management decisions for the future. The basic principles of planning personal finances are to assess ones current financial position, identify short-term and long-term liabilities, set a target to take care of the liabilities and retirement and draw up an investment strategy to achieve the targets.         
	Risk levels        
	Investment planning should hinge on ones ability to take risks. If a person takes too much of risks, he may end up putting his entire plan and finances in danger. If an individual is too comfortable, he would lose out on opportunities to make more money.         
	A simple way to evaluate the risk appetite is to gauge ones loss-making ability. Risk tolerance has two aspects  an individuals personal desire to assume risk and ones financial ability to endure it. So, ask yourself how much loss you can bear and for how long. That will be your risk tolerance.         
	Would you rather have a guaranteed Rs 1,000 or go for a scheme that holds a 90 per cent chance of raking in Rs 5,000?        
	There can be no unique answer to this. The expected value of Rs 5,000 with a 90 per cent chance is Rs 4,500. Some may still prefer to get a guaranteed Rs 1,000. Different people have different risk appetite. Likewise, one may like to get Rs 2,000 now, while some would prefer Rs 1,000 every year for five years. An individuals investment planning must take into account all these factor while drawing up an asset allocation strategy.         
	The balancesheet        
	To start with, one can prepare a simple balancesheet of ones assets and liabilities and an income-expenditure statement to find out ones current financial net worth and income available for investment.         
	The asset section should include cash in hand, savings bank account, fixed and other deposits, investments in equities, mutual funds and cash value of life insurance.         
	The liability segment will include loan outstanding on credit card, house mortgages, and credit card outstanding. The difference between the two columns gives the current net worth. Similarly, the income-expenditure statement should mention the income from all sources, including deposits and dividends. All expenses are to be listed in the expenditure column. The difference between the two gives the income available for investment.         
	Liability check         
	The next step is to fix ones financial targets to determine how much money would be required at different points in the future. One needs to take into consideration the short-term and long-term liabilities such as buying a car, childrens education and marriage, retirement fund etc.         
	Inflation worry        
	An important consideration is the inflation rate. Inflation eats into the value of money, that is, what one can buy for Rs 100 now will cost more later if there is a spiralling increase in prices.         
	For example, at an inflation rate of 5 per cent, the value of Re 1 after five years will be equivalent to 78 paise now. After 10 years, the value of Re 1 will be 61 paise now. Carrying on the extrapolation exercise, Re 1 after 30 years will be equivalent to 23 paise now.        
	To factor in the inflation rate, one has to divide the planned fund value with the present value of the rupee corresponding to different time periods.         
	For example, if an individual has planned (on the basis of the current situation) a Rs 3-lakh retirement kitty after 30 years, the correct value should be Rs 3 lakh divided by 0.23, or Rs 13,04,348!        
	Given the target to be achieved, the income and the time available for investment, it is easy to find out the compounded rate of return that ones investments must generate during this period. One can also take help of websites such as www.moneychimp.com to find out the required rate of return from investments.         
	Asset allocation        
	Once the required rate of return is known, the investments can be split into different assets depending on the risk appetite, volatility and liquidity of assets.         
	The liquidity of an investment is important if it is meant to serve short-term liabilities. But if it is a long-term liability, equities are the best option.         
	The tables show that while making a financial planning, an older person will have to take more risks than a younger individual to achieve the same target. A 25-year-old person can save Rs 1 lakh when he or she reaches the age of 55 by investing Rs 100 in a bank fixed deposit offering a 6 per cent annual interest.         
	But if one starts investing at the age of 45, one will have to invest Rs 600 a month to get Rs 1 lakh after 10 years at the same interest rate. If one invests Rs 100 a month, one has to choose assets that give a 38 per cent compounded return. Even equities fail to give a 38 per cent compounded return over a period of 10 years.

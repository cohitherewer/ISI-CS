    For those who want to invest in equity markets with caution, the answer lies in structured products. Rishi Nathany explains
                      
	With the equity markets at an all-time high, investors have never had it so good. Those who had invested in the markets in the last few years have made handsome profits. However, for those who missed the bus, it may not be too late.
    
	Investors, who want an exposure to the equity markets but are wary of any impending downsides, can park their money with equity-structured products. These instruments are for conservative investors who seek capital protection but at the same time want higher returns than conventional fixed-income plans.
    
	Capital protection
    
	Equity structured products are available through various asset management companies. These provide 100 per cent capital protection along with equity-linked returns. For instance, let us consider a bond with a face value of Rs 100, three-year deep discount and an yield of around 8 per cent per annum available at Rs 80. This means the bond will not give the buyer any regular interest payment. Rather, the interest is built into the price as a discount, and the bond purchased for Rs 80 will mature at Rs 100 after three years, giving the investor Rs 20. 
    
	Now, let us consider another investor who invests Rs 100 in a three-year close-ended structured product. The fund manager will buy a deep-discounted bond for Rs 80, enabling him to give the investor his capital back at maturity. The balance Rs 20 can be invested in various ways. 
    
	Simple structure
    
	Let us look at two such alternatives. In the first option, the balance can be used to purchase equities. After three years, if the equities appreciate, the investor will be able to get higher returns. If the markets fall, then, too, he will get his capital back, along with the market value of the equities at which the fund manager had purchased. This is a simple-structured product offered by fund houses as capital safety funds.
    
	Complex product
    
	In more complex products, the fund manager can purchase long-term exotic options with the balance Rs 20. This can yield higher returns if the contingent conditions on which the options are purchased are met with. 
    
	Put options
    
	Normally, options are available for up to three months. However, in the structured products, a longer duration of three years is made available, which will last through the life of the structured product. These options can be call or put options, or both, which means the investor can benefit from both the rise and fall in the market. The underlying securities of these options can be an index such as Nifty, or a basket of a few leading A group stocks. 
    
	Exotic options
    
	Exotic options have special conditions attached to them. For example, an exotic option can be a barrier option, which limits the payout to the investor in case the market rises or falls beyond a certain point. The reason for purchasing exotic options is that they are less expensive than normal exchange-traded options. 
    
	By adding certain limitations to the option, the cost of purchasing the long-term exotic plans is brought down. 
    
	Let us look at such a product more closely. Suppose an investor puts Rs 100 into a Nifty-linked structured product, which is close-ended and matures after three years. 
    
	The fund manager will use Rs 80 to purchase the deep-discount bonds maturing at Rs 100 after three years, to give the investor capital protection. The balance Rs 20 is used to purchase barrier call options on Nifty, with the limit set at 9000, against a market price of 6000 for the Nifty. 
    
	If the Nifty rises above 6000 within three years, the investor will get full appreciation up to the level of 9000. For example, if the Nifty value is 8400 after three years, the investor will get the full benefit, that is 40 per cent returns. However, if the Nifty settles at 10200 after three years, the investor will only get returns up to 9000, where the barrier has been set, that is a return of 50 per cent. 
    
	Again, the investor has no liability to pay for the losses if the Nifty falls below 6000. The investor will only suffer a loss of interest on capital, since he will only get his principal back in case the Nifty falls below 6000. However, the chances of this happening are very low, since these products are designed to yield higher returns.
    
	Structured products offer the best of both worlds  capital protection as well as equity-linked returns. These products are ideal for parents planning their childrens education and marriage or for retired people.

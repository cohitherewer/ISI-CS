The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile TV prospects entice Qualcomm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mobile TV prospects entice Qualcomm
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Seeking access                                  
	New Delhi, April 7: US-based Qualcomm plans to enter the Indian mobile TV market as soon as the service is launched in the country.         
	We expect to roll out a mobile TV technology in India once the government draws up a policy and frees frequency for the service, Sachin Kalantri, senior staff engineer of Qualcomm India, told The Telegraph.         
	Qualcomm, the worlds largest maker of mobile phone chips, has developed mobile TV technology MediaFLO, which can transmit many live television channels and stereo quality sound to wireless devices and mobile handsets. The company has also created the CDMA mobile phone technology.        
	MediaFLO is deployed mainly in the US by Verizon, with AT amp;T expected to follow soon. Analysts estimate that in 2008 the market for mobile TV services in India will be at around Rs 1,440 crore.         
	Mobile TV technologies that are vying for deep pocketed suitors in India include digital video broadcastinghandheld (DVB-H), popular in Europe, and media forward link only (MediaFLO), promoted by Qualcomm and widely used in the US, said Sudipto Basu, a telecom analyst.        
	At present, Doordarshan offers mobile TV services using the DVB-H technology and offers its eight channels in the New Delhi area.        
	MediaFlo can run 32 channels, without compromising on the quality of the picture on screen, while DVB-H can show only 16 channels, evident from DDs pilot project, said Kalantri.         
	Analysts said globally the number of mobile TV subscribers will reach 216 million by 2011, but the success of the concept would be determined by its revenue outcome, which was controlled by service providers.        
	Even in price-sensitive markets such as India, the majority of mobile phone users are interested in trying out mobile TV whenever it is offered and many are willing to invest in new handsets if their existing phones are not equipped to receive TV content, said Kalantri.        
	He added that it would depend on service providers and the government to ensure that the price does not become a hurdle for the success of this service.        
	Mobile TV providers have effectively addressed the price issue in markets such as the US, where handsets with mobile TV are being sold at less than $250 today, said Kalantri.         
	A recent report from Springboard Research said TV-on-the-go could attract something like 5 to 6 per cent of the total mobile subscriber base in India, which is around 12 million customers, in the very first year of its offering.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum auction to fetch less
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spectrum auction to fetch less
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Call charge                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: The auctioning of third-generation (3G) spectrum may not be able to bring Rs 30,000-40,000 crore to the governments revenue kitty as earlier estimated since the current global financial crisis has deterred many operators from participating in the bidding.        
	Beyond the reserve price of 3G spectrum, I am not an astrologer to know what would be the realisation. Once the auction process is over, only then we will know what revenues can be expected, said Raja. Earlier, the minister had said the government looked to raise Rs 40,000 crore from the auction.        
	With foreign players being allowed to participate in the auction as 100 per cent entities, the government was expecting aggressive bidding.         
	However, analysts say the global liquidity crisis may dissuade global telecom firms from placing high bids. Even domestic telecom players are not keen to come up with exorbitant rates because of lack of funds.        
	Most operators may not bid beyond Rs 2,020 crore  the reserve price for a pan-India 3G licence  as higher price for radiowaves would make the rollout of 3G services financially unviable and expensive for the end customers, the analysts said.        
	However, the government plans to go ahead with the 3G auction and complete it by January 2009. 3G auction is on schedule, said Raja.        
	Analysts said potential bidders could also be discouraged because of lack of clarity over the policy. The government has not been able to provide any clarity over the amount of radiowaves which would be allocated to successful 3G bidders.         
	Current policy entitles each successful bidder to a maximum of 5 megahertz (MHz) of 3G frequency, which is inadequate for new foreign telecom firms to launch operations.         
	The defence sector is expected to vacate around 25-30 MHz of spectrum in the 2.1-gigahertz band for 3G services. However, it will take three to six months for military forces to switch to the optical fibre-based alternative communication network and vacate spectrum, said industry experts.

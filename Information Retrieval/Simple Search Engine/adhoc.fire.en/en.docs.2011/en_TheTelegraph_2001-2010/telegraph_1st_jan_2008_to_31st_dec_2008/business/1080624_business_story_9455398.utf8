	Calcutta, June 23: Binani Cement plans to invest close to Rs 1,600 crore in the next two-three years to double capacity to 13 million tonnes (mt) and acquire a coal block in Indonesia.        
	Vinod Juneja, managing director of Binani Group of Industries, said two plants would come up in Gujarat, while the operations in China and Dubai would be expanded.        
	Binani, at present, operates a 6mt plant at Sirohi in Rajasthan.        
	It now wants to build a 2.8mt plant in Surat and at Verwad. The plants would serve the Maharashtra market and provide clinker to the Dubai unit.        
	Juneja said the Chinese plants capacity would be ramped up to 2 mt from the present 0.8 mt, while the Dubai plants capacity would be enhanced to 2 mt from1 mt.        
	The Gujarat projects would cost Rs 825 crore, the Chinese investment has been estimated at Rs 400 crore and Dubai, Rs 200 crore.        
	We will have global capacity of 13 mt by 2012, having a presence in India, China, Dubai and in some African and Southeast Asian countries, he said.        
	The company is currently scouting for opportunities in Vietnam, Mauritius, Mozambique and Zambia.        
	Coal buy        
	Juneja said the company was soon going to sign a deal to acquire a coal block in Indonesia. This will increase its self-sufficiency in coal.         
	The block, close to the coast, is expected to have 30 mt of good quality steam coal.        
	Binani had spent $ 100 million to import coal from abroad last fiscal.

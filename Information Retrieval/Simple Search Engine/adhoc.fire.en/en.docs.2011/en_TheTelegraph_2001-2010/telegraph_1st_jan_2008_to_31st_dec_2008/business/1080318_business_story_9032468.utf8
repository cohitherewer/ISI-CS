The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Software worries upset real estate mood
                                                                                                               Software worries upset real estate mood
          ARUNDHATI BAKSHI-DIGHE                                          
	Mumbai, March 17: The inf  
	otech industry continues to rubbish speculation about a downturn in their future prospects after all the spooky talk about a recession in the US.  
	But all the babble has sparked fears that if the software industry goes through the skids, it will have a knock-on effect on real estate prices at home.         
	The argument goes like this: the IT and IT-enabled services industry have been one of the biggest drivers of real estate values in the country over the past few years.        
	Reports indicate that software companies are putting their property deals on hold. These are just a few straws in the wind, but some pundits who divine trends from such stray signals say real estate prices can soon head downward as well with one of the key props for the market gone.        
	They believe that there will be a sobering impact on both residential and commercial prices. A recent report by the Deutsche Bank says the IT/ITeS sectors have driven 80 per cent of the demand for office space in the country over the last three to four years.        
	The report adds, These IT and ITeS employees had started the residential boom in India in the late 1990s and accounted for 40 per cent of the demand for residential apartments in the top 15-20 cities in India.        
	But now, with the market agog with news of a slowdown and almost 60 per cent of an average Indian IT companys income coming from the US market, will this have a sobering effect on the scorching realty prices in the country?        
	The realtors dont think so.        
	I dont think that the weakening of demand for IT space will have an overall pricing in the real estate sector, said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, a real estate consultant.         
	A slowdown in the US could also mean more work being outsourced to a low-cost destination such as India which, in turn, would mean an increase in demand for office space, he added.        
	Manish Kashyap, managing director (transaction services) of CB Richard Ellis India, admitted that the IT industry had started to go slow on property deals. There is a delay in decision making and some decisions have been pushed. But we are yet to come across a client who has scrapped his India plan or projects, Kashyap added.        
	He reckoned that realty prices would not soften on account of the anticipated US slowdown. But yes, an oversupply of space, in certain markets, may soften the prices, he said.         
	We cannot yet say that there is a slowdown in the US. We will have to wait and watch for at least another six months to see if there is a slowdown. I believe, for smaller companies, a slowdown could mean more offshoring to cheaper destinations like India. So, no, I dont see prices sobering but yes, there could be a slight rationalisation, added Amol Shimpi, national director of real estate consultant Colliers International.        
	Niranjan Hiranandani, MD of Hiranandani Construction and a major realtor, dismissed all talk about a fall in realty prices. If there is any slowdown in the US economy, it will actually have a positive impact on the ITeS sector as outsourcing will go up. I dont think this will have an impact on the realty prices; definitely not on the residential side, said Hiranandani.

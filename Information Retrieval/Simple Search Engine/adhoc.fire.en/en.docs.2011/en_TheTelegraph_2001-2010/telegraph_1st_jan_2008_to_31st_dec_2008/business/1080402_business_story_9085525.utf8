          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pillai: Low pressure                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: The government today said it would put in place measures that should reduce steel prices by 10 per cent to 20 per cent.        
	Though silent on the measures, it said there were no plans to ban the export of iron ore and levy an ad-valorem duty on ore exports.        
	I think steel prices will come down by 10 to 20 per cent once the set of government proposals are implemented, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai told the media after a meeting with iron ore producers.        
	In steel, the government is considering various proposals, including reducing excise and customs duty as well as increasing export duty.        
	These are meant to check inflation which touched a 14 month high of 6.68 per cent on the back of rising prices of steel and food items.        
	Steel secretary R.S. Pandey said the government had no plan to ban the export of iron ore and levy an ad valorem duty on ore exports.        
	Mining firms, while remaining noncommittal on reducing prices, said they would look into possible ways to help the government to check inflation.        
	Pillai said there was no dearth of iron ore in the country, which made untenable the alarmist stance of steel makers on its scarcity.        
	Pillai said the government would call steel producers for a meeting on prices in the next two days.        
	Everybody understands that steel prices are a little high. Iron ore producers and steel makers are making good profits. They have to decide whether they want to reduce prices voluntarily or force the government to do it for them, he said.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram after a meeting of the cabinet committee of prices yesterday had asked steel companies to observe restraint, amid speculation of a further round of hike in steel prices.        
	The committee had last night deferred a decision on steel and iron ore prices as steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan was abroad.         
	To control spiralling steel prices, Paswan had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, recommending the removal of duties on imported steel and steel inputs and fiscal measures to curb the export of steel.        
	The minister, in the letter, written after steel makers refused to roll back a hike in prices, had said that if these measures did not work, a steel sector regulator should be put in place.         
	Steel makers are opposed to such a regulator.        
	They said the price hike was because of an increase in input costs by Rs 6,000-7,000 a tonne because of the higher prices of iron ore and coking coal, the two main inputs for steel.

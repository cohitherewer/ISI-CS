	New Delhi, April 8: Essar Steel, Ispat and JSW Steel are increasing hot-rolled coil prices by Rs 4,000-5,000 a tonne.         
	Their complaint is that railway freight rates have gone up several fold, while iron ore miner NMDC Limited is raising prices.        
	Officials said, It seems the steel makers are trying to tell the government that it needs to control certain input costs which it has the ability to do so, if it wants steel prices to remain stable.        
	Market leaders, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Tata Steel, have not been impacted by rising iron ore prices as they are fully supplied by captive mines.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of SAILs coking coal needs are met by captive mines and supplies from Coal India Limited. Prices of these raw materials have not gone up.        
	The officials said SAIL and Tata Steel were really not impacted by global rises in raw material prices.        
	However, other major producers, such as Essar Steel and Ispat, who are dependent on coal and iron ore from outside, are facing a cost-push situation.        
	The government may need to help out by controlling freight and iron ore prices, the officials said.

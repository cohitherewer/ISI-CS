                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cement stays under pressure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 22: UltraTech Cement Ltd, the AV Birla group company, today issued a bleak outlook on cement prices when it said a combination of excess supply and constant government intervention could impact prices this year.        
	The government recently banned cement export to control inflation. Prices of the commodity have been firm over the past few months with domestic supply unable to keep pace with strong demand.         
	During the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2007, cement prices (per bag) rose between 10 per cent and 24 per cent in different regions. UltraTech today indicated that not only prices but also industry margins during the year would remain under pressure, a statement that should make the government happy.        
	Overall, demand is expected to grow 9 per cent. The industry will experience a surplus of supply on account of additional capacity of 118 million tonnes during the Eleventh Plan Period which is expected to have an impact on domestic prices in 2009. Continuous government intervention has resulted in an uncertain price environment, which together with significant increase in input costs will have an adverse impact on margins, it said while issuing an outlook for the rest of this year.        
	Observers who closely track the industry agree. The scenario is not too positive on the pricing front. Excess supply will come in from the second half of this year. At least 30 million tonnes could be added during this period, which could lead to soft prices, an analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said.         
	In a recent report, Angel Broking expressed the view that cement companies were unlikely to outperform over the next few quarters as new capacities were expected to go on stream.        
	UltraTech profit         
	For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008, UltraTech posted a 22 per cent rise in net profit. Net profit rose to Rs 283 crore against Rs 232 crore in the same period last year. It clocked net revenues of Rs 1,602 crore against Rs 1,465 crore in the year-ago period. UltraTech said capacity utilisation at 113 per cent was on par with the corresponding period of the previous year.

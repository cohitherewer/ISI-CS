The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel for sops to consumer durables
                                                                                                               Panel for sops to consumer durables
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Union Budget 2008-09 is likely to make provisions for duty cut and easy credit flow to the consumer durables sector, which is witnessing negative growth at present.        
	The report of the Krishnamurthy committee has been sent to the PMO (Prime Ministers Office) and the recommendations are likely to be implemented in the budget, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	Officials said the committee had recommended the lowering of the average excise duty to 8 per cent from 16 per cent. The report, officials said, argued that the duty cut was necessary to increase demand for consumer goods, hit by high interest rates.        
	According to the panel, the demand for consumer goods was low because of strict loan norms adopted by the banks following the Reserve Bank of Indias monetary policy.        
	If banks lower the interest rates for consumer goods loans, the domestic demand can be improved.        
	Growth in industrial production plunged to 5.3 per cent in November this fiscal from 15.8 per cent in the corresponding period of 2006-07, following a sharp decline in the manufacturing sector. Growth in the six core infrastructure industries also declined to 5.3 per cent in November 2007 from 9.6 per cent a year ago. The manufacturing sector has over 80 per cent weightage in overall industrial production.        
	Government figures show that the consumer durable sector recorded 1.7 per cent decline between April and November, 2007.        
	Industrial growth in November has dipped to 9.2 per cent from 11.6 per cent. This has been caused by a contraction of 4.1 per cent in the output of consumer durables and 2.1 per cent in non-durables.        
	The Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council had recently recommended that the government soften tax rates to encourage people to spend more on consumer goods.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had constituted the Krishnamurthy committee to address gaps in manufacturing growth.               
	The committee was given the responsibility of recommending both short and long-term measures to ensure the growth of the sector in next 10 to 15 years.

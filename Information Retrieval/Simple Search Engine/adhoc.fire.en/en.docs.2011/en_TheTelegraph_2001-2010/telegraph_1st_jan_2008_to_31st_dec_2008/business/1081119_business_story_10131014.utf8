	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Major initiatives are underway to help the Indian economy ride out the storm sparked by a recession in the industrialised world.        
	To begin with, the government plans to double the size of a stimulus package  to be spent on infrastructure projects  to Rs 50,000 crore.        
	On the proposed investment, minister of state for industry Ashwani Kumar said, Its specific contours will be announced anytime.         
	The money will be spent on projects built through public-private partnerships, Kumar said at the India Economic Summit here today.         
	The government may also consider more cuts in excise duties and ask the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates further.         
	At the India Economic Summit, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the government might cut excise duty on certain items to boost industrial output and lift economic growth. However, he asked airlines, auto makers, real estate firms, and hotels to cut prices and stimulate demand in a stuttering economy.         
	While industry bodies were open to the suggestion, industry leaders shunned the idea.        
	Manoj Vaish, president and CEO of Dun amp; Bradstreet in India, said, Given the current global scenario, a rise in core sector spending would ensure long-term sustainability of economic growth and will create economic opportunities. Infrastructure in India not only needs to be modernised but also requires substantial addition.        
	While addressing the summit, Kumar said the government had received Ratan Tatas proposal of setting up a special fund in select banks to help domestic companies meet global exigencies. It will definitely be considered, Kumar said.        
	The finance minister today met RBI governor D. Subbarao as a follow-up to yesterdays meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to review the liquidity situation in the country.         
	Chidambaram said the Prime Minister had asked the RBI to keep a vigil on liquidity in the financial system.        
	The government is concerned that reduction in interest rates and release of fresh cash could once again lead to high inflation.         
	Chidambaram said the government was keeping a close watch on the economy and would act speedily depending on the needs of various sectors. The government is also looking at the problems faced by exporters and the core sector, the finance minister said.        
	On whether the central bank was considering further cuts, Subbarao said, The RBI is continuously monitoring the situation. We are hearing what everyone is saying and the decision will be taken at an appropriate time.        
	The RBI has already cut overnight lending rates by 1.5 to 7.5 per cent and the cash reserve ratio from 9 per cent to 5.5 per cent.         
	With inflationary pressure easing, we expect the central bank to cut the repo and reverse repo by 100 basis points, N. R. Bhanumurthy, economist with the Institute of Economic Growth, said.        
	On whether the ICICI Bank was mulling rate cuts, CEO and managing director K.V. Kamath said interest rate is a play of demand and supply. Nobody has asked us to cut interest rates. I am among the first to say that interest rates have to decline ...confidence in business has to come back.

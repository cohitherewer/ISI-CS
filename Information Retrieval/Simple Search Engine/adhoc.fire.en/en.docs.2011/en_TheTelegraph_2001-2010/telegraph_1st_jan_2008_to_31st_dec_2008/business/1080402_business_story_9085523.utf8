The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IPO still on Emaar menu
                                                                                                               IPO still on Emaar menu

	Mumbai, April 1: Real estate firm Emaar MGF will again try to float a public issue in another nine to 18 months. It had to withdraw its Rs 6,000-crore public issue launched in January.         
	We believe the IPO market will present another opportunity for us in the next 12 to 18 months. It could even be within nine to 12 months, said Shravan Gupta, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Emaar-MGF.        
	The volatility in the Indian markets in February forced Emaar to slash the offer price twice  once from the original lower price band of Rs 610 to Rs 540 and subsequently again to Rs 530.        
	The company also extended the closing date of the IPO after raising bids for just 74.69 per cent of the 10.25 crore shares on offer.        
	When it failed to raise the stipulated 90 per cent subscription (including a 10 per cent devolvement on the lead managers), Emaar withdrew the issue three days before the closing date.        
	Marriott tieup        
	The company today announced a tieup with Marriott International to develop three JW Marriott Hotels in Delhi, Calcutta and Hyderabad and a Courtyard hotel in Amritsar.         
	Emaar will raise over Rs 1,700 crore partly through internal accruals and partly in debt to finance the four ventures. It will invest around Rs 889 crore for the Delhi hotel, Rs 402 crore in the Calcutta venture, Rs 400 crore for the Hyderabad hotel and Rs 92 crore for the Amritsar property.        
	A hotel venture is a long-term gestation product and the investments represent the faith we have in the Indian economy and in our own product, said Gupta.

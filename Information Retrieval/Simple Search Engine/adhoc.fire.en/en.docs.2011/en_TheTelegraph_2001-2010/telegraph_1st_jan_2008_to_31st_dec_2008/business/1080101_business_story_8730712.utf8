             Striking balance
                 
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: Indias current account deficit dropped to $5.5 billion in the second quarter of this fiscal from $6.3 billion in the same quarter last year, buoyed by growth in remittances from NRIs and other sources.
    
	Data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today showed the deficit fell, while export growth decelerated and non-oil imports increased.
    
	A current account deficit occurs when imports of goods and services into a country is more than exports. It includes invisibles such as remittances from NRIs and of software services exports.
    
	Data for the period July-September 2007 showed that because of deceleration in export growth and higher non-oil imports, trade deficit (merchandise exports less merchandise imports) was higher at $21.7 billion in the second quarter of this year compared with $16.8 billion in the same period last year. 
    
	According to the RBI, merchandise exports recorded a growth of 19 per cent compared with 27.4 per cent in the previous year. Import payments registered 22.6 per cent growth in the second quarter compared with 26.5 per cent in the previous year.
    
	The deceleration in export growth was mainly because of a decline in exports of textiles and textile products along with a slowdown in exports of agricultural products, engineering goods and chemicals.
    
	Invisible receipts recorded growth of 29.1 per cent during the period against 30.6 per cent in the previous year.

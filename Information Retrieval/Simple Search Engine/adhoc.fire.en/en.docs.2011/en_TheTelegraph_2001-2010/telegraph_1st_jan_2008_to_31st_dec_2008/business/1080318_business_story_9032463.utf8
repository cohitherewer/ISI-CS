                                                                                                               Petronas to up stake in Cairn India 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 17: Petronas is raising its stake in Cairn India Ltd.         
	The Malaysian state oil and gas firm will pick up an additional 2.77 per cent in Cairn through a private placement that will increase its holding to 12.7 per cent.        
	Cairn India is raising Rs 2,534.6 crore ($625 million) from the private placement, which will also include New Zealand billionaire Richard Chandlers investment group.         
	The two investors will pick up 11.3 crore shares of Cairn at Rs 224.30 per share. While 6.33 crore shares will be placed with Petronas, 4.97 crore shares will be picked up by Orient Global Tamarind Fund Pte Ltd, which is owned by Chandler.        
	After the private placement, Petronas will own around 12.7 per cent of the enlarged share capital of Cairn India, while Orient Global Tamarind Fund will own around 2.6 per cent.        
	Cairn Energys stake in the Indian subsidiary will come down to 65 per cent from 69 per cent after the sale.        
	In a press statement, Cairn India said net proceeds from the private placement would be used to fund capital expenditure and for general corporate purposes.        
	Rahul Dhir, chief executive officer of the oil exploration company, said, Cairn India is entering an exciting period of growth. The company is confident of producing the first commercial oil from Rajasthan in 2009. The private placement will help the company meet its investment plans and provide greater financial and operational flexibility.         
	Although Cairn did not specify the end-use of the funds, it is speculated that part of the money will be used for the 600-kilometre pipeline that will carry crude from its fields in Rajasthan.         
	The Cairn India stock closed at Rs 214.25, down 6 per cent, on the BSE. The private placement price is, therefore, at a premium of around 5 per cent to the closing price.

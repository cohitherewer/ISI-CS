	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Indians are looking beyond traditional foreign destinations when planning tour itineraries.        
	Though Thailand, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia continue to be hot spots, tourists now are eager to discover newer territories. Over 8 million Indians travel abroad every year.        
	Undoubtedly, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are the all-time favourites. But places such as Australia and New Zealand are attracting tourists as well, said Praveen Chugh, president of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	We have noticed a fair amount of interest for destinations such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Macau is another place for which we are getting a lot of queries, Chugh added. Tourists are also keen on Latin American destinations such as Peru and Brazil.         
	The US is also a frequently visited destination.         
	According to Pacific Asia Travel Association, Indian visitors to the US increased nearly 60 per cent to 406,000 in the last four years.         
	In contrast, the number of Chinese tourists to the country jumped 44 per cent to 320,000 in 2006.        
	Around 4.31 million foreign tourists visited India in 2006, while around 8 million Indians travelled abroad.        
	Inbound tourism grew by 17 per cent in 2006, while outbound tourism saw a growth of 20 per cent.         
	About 2.7 million tourists travelled to India in the first seven months of 2007 and spent approximately Rs 17,400 crore.         
	This is against 2.4 million tourists who visited the country in the same period of 2006 and spent about Rs 14,400 crore.         
	This represents an increase of about 12 per cent in tourist arrivals and over 20 per cent rise in foreign exchange earnings.        
	Industry sources said the growth rate for outbound tourism this year was about 25 per cent.         
	According to tour operators, destinations which market themselves aggressively through competitive pricing, cultural events and cheap shopping options attract most Indian tourists.        
	Bangkok, Singapore, China, Thailand, Seychelles and Mauritius are doing really well. There are also a number of tourists who are travelling to Spain, said Subhash Goyal, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators.        
	Spain attracted 58 million tourists last year and expects an annual rise of 10 per cent in the inflow of Indian visitors.

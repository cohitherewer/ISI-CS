                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infosys to hire less
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Software firm Infosys today said it planned to hire about 25,000 people in the current fiscal, nearly 29 per cent less than last year.        
	The IT leader had appointed 35,000 people in 2007-08. We are planning to hire 25,000 people in the current fiscal, of which 18,000 would be through campus recruitment, said Nandita Gurjar, senior vice-president and group head of human resources, Infosys.        
	She said the impact on hiring would be visible in the last two quarters of the current fiscal.        
	The third and fourth quarters would be the time when the firm tended to tighten up its hiring, she said.        
	According to Gurjar, while the company would have liked to add more people to its rolls, the reason for the low recruitment level was not just economic slump but other factors such as infrastructure and business strategies.        
	Statistics provided by the firm suggest that it had 3,372 trainees for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, compared with 5,070 in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	On attrition rates, Gurjar said the levels had come down in recent times and was hovering at a little over 13 per cent. During the first quarter of this fiscal, the attrition rate was 13.6 per cent, which is marginally lower than 13.7 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	For the first time, Infosys will offer promotions twice a year. The initiative will be implemented from later this year.        
	The new policy will not add to our wage pressures as the process has already been factored into our HR structure, Gurjar said.        
	On salary increments, Gurjar said the hike this year was in the range of 11-13 per cent against 12-15 per cent in the previous year.

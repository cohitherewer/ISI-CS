          MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM                           KEEP A CHECK                                  
	New York, Aug. 27: Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to raise the benchmark interest rate to slow inflation, but they have not agreed to a time for the move.         
	This was revealed in the minutes to Feds last meeting in early August, which was released on Tuesday.         
	The timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the minutes said.         
	Although members of the Feds policy-making body  the Federal Open Market Committee  did not comment on the issue, their remarks reinforced a sense on Wall Street that the central bank is watching the trend of rising prices, and is more likely to raise rates by the beginning of next year.         
	Inflation is running at the fastest pace in decades, despite a recent retrenchment in gasoline and energy prices. Several members of the Fed board are anticipating the possibility of core inflation failing to reach a moderate rate next year unless monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets.        
	However, the prevailing view among Fed governors at the August 5 meeting appeared to be that inflation would taper off next year.         
	Echoing public comments made by Fed officials in recent weeks, the members of the open market committee anticipated a significant economic slowdown over the next several quarters.         
	Economic activity was likely to remain damped, the minutes said. The officials believe that growth may not pick up till the second half of 2009.        
	The labour market continued to weaken significantly, financial conditions remained unfavourable, consumer and business confidence was downbeat, and manufacturing activity was contracting, the minutes said. Economic growth from April to June, however, was faster than the bankers had anticipated.         
	Officials remained concerned that the tight credit market and the housing slump would continue to slow the economy. They are also worried about further deterioration in financial conditions.         
	A further rise in inflation is considered to be an equal obstacle to growth. Some members believe that it would be difficult to curb inflation in the long run if the Americans became inured to higher prices.        
	At the meetings conclusion, the committee decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at 2 per cent.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

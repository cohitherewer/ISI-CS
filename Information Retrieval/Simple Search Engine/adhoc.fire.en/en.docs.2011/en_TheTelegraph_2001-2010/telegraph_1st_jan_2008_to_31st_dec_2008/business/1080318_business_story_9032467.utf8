The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | FM says impact is moderate
                                                                                                               FM says impact is moderate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: On a day when the bear ran amok on the bourses, finance minister P. Chidambaram said Indian stock markets were taking cues from the US and Asian markets even though the sub-prime mortgage crisis had only moderately impacted the credit and financial flows into the country.        
	The sub-prime mortgage market crisis will not directly affect us, because except one private sector bank, which has made its exposure, none of our public sector banks has any exposure to the sub-prime mortgage market, Chidambaram said in his reply to a debate on Budget 2008-09 in Rajya Sabha.        
	But, when the crisis moved from sub-prime mortgage to the housing market, and from housing to the credit market, there is an impact on India. There is an impact in terms of credit and financial flows. But, at the moment, I believe the impact is moderate, he said.        
	The sensex closed at 14809, down 951 points, or 6.03 per cent. During intra-day trading, it dipped below the 15000-mark for the first time since August 2007.        
	We now have to track what is happening in the Asian markets. If you watch closely, you will find what is happening in the Asian markets is affecting the Indian stock market, the minister added.        
	The finance minister said there was tremendous pressure on the government to fight inflation, and the Centre would take more steps to curb it. He, however, added that the government would see that the price rise did not hamper industrial growth.

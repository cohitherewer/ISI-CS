	New Delhi, Oct. 1: Indias trade deficit has increased 93.8 per cent to $13.94 billion in August this year from $7.19 billion a year ago on the back of higher crude import bill.         
	Exports grew $16 billion from $12.61 billion in August last year, while imports rose to $29.94 billion from $19.8 billion in the same period last year.        
	Exports will face problems as the global financial crisis deepens further, squeezing the demand for Indian goods, said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the Institute for Economic Growth.        
	He, however, said that the trade deficit could come down to less than $10 billion in the coming months as oil prices had come down.        
	Exports during April-August were up 35.1 per cent to $81.23 billion, while the trade deficit during the period increased to $49.14 billion from $34.54 billion.

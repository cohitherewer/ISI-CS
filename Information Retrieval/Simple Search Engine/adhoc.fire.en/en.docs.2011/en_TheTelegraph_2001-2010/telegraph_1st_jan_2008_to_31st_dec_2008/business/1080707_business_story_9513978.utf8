          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mejia, July 6: The Central Electricity Authority has formed a panel to evaluate the quality of equipment supplied by Chinese companies to power plants.Chinese firms such as DongFang Electric Corporation and Shanghai Electrical supply equipment.         
	The committee will submit its report in the next couple of weeks, the Union minister of state for commerce and power, Jairam Ramesh, said here today.         
	We are not against Chinese companies or components. Chinese equipment are the cheapest in the world, but we do such reports to find out the quality standards of power plants. The report will act as a reference for Indian companies planning to give projects to Chinese firms, said Ramesh.         
	He said many Chinese equipment suppliers were involved in installing about 16,000MW of fresh capacity in India through the import of equipment.         
	This is about 22 per cent of total capacity being generated in the Eleventh Plan. There have been instances where the electrostatic precipitators of Chinese suppliers had crashed as the equipment collected floating carbon particles.         
	The West Bengal Power Development Corporations new unit at Sagardighi remains unoperational after cracks developed on its turbine blade. Durgapur Projects Ltds new unit also suffered.         
	Bengal plans        
	In his meeting with Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee, Ramesh proposed that the contract for setting up two new units of 500 megawatt each at Durgapur Projects and Bakreshwar Thermal Power Plant be given to Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel). Each unit will involve an investment of Rs 2,000 crore.         
	We have discussed this in todays meeting. We were offered these two new units to be executed by Bhel on a negotiated basis. We will evaluate the proposal, Banerjee said.         
	Ramesh said that these two units would be over and above the expansion program of Durgapur Projects and the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd.

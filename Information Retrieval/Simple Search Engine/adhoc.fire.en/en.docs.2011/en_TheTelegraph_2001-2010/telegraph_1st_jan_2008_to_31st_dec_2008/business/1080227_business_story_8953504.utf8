     A STAFF REPORTER:
                      
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Rail coach and wagon manufacturers of the eastern region received the Railway Budget for 2008-09 with enthusiasm. 
    
	It is a forward looking budget, said Titagarh Wagons president J.P. Chowdhary. 
    
	Chowdhary expects that the budget proposal to introduce special wagons and dedicated routes for coal transportation will increase the demand for wagons. 
    
	Most of the new dedicated routes for coal movement would be fit for 25-tonne axle load trains, railway minister Lalu Prasad said today while presenting the budget.
    
	As coal constitutes almost 45 per cent of the total volume of cargo carried by the Indian Railways, construction of a dedicated freight corridor will generate a need for efficient, light-weight and higher-axle load wagons, said Chowdhary. 
    
	The company signed a joint venture agreement with Chicago-based FreightCar in January this year and with GE Transport Services in the previous year to make special-purpose wagons. 
    
	These wagons are aluminium-bodied with high axle load, Chowdhary said.
    
	We have started making stainless steel wagons this year. We expect there will be a good demand for these wagons as the railway minister has proposed that all wagons to be used after 2009 should have stainless steel bodies, he added.
    
	Chowdhary is also upbeat about the public-private initiatives announced in the Rail Budget. The city-based company may take part in private-public projects to be announced by the rail ministry in the next five years. 
    
	The KK Birla group-controlled Texmaco Ltd was also optimistic about this years budget. 
    
	Ramesh Maheswari, president and CEO of Texmaco Ltd, said, There is a series of measures in the budget to steer the railways to a fast forward mode. The wagon procurement in 2008-09, planned at 20,000 units, will be 100 per cent more than that in 2007-08. This procurement will comprise special purpose wagons of high capacity and modern design. We shall continue to play a dominant role in meeting the Indian Railways expansion programme.
    
	Texmaco, which has a 30 per cent market share, plans to set up a unit to manufacture stainless steel wagons. We are aiming to supply a minimum of 7,500 units of the 20,000 wagons the railways demand in 2008-09, Maheswari said.

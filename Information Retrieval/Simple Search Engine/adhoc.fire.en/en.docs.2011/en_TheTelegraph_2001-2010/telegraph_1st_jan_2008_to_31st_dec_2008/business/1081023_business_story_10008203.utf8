                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Global gloom spells doom 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 22: Renewed worries that the global economy will tip into a recession and muted corporate numbers had its impact on the markets today with the sensex plunging over 513 points and the rupee sliding to an all-time low of Rs 49.50 to the dollar before recovering from its lows.        
	Investors, who were expecting the key indices to build on their gains in the past two sessions, were disappointed to find the benchmark index opening weak in line with poor overseas markets. What added to the disappointment was a cautious outlook from Wipro as its profit numbers fell short of analyst estimates.        
	Many of the global indices had slipped on fears that the world economy was slipping into a recession. In Asia, equity markets were down anywhere between 2 and 7 per cent.        
	The BSE sensex, which opened lower at 10455.23 and extended its weakness, attempted a small recovery at noon.         
	However, with no major buying coming in, the index ended the day at 10169.90, a sharp loss of 513.49 points, or 4.81 per cent, while the Nifty on the NSE finished lower by 169.75 points, or 5.25 per cent.        
	The bearishness of the stock markets rubbed off on the rupee, which closed at Rs 49.30 to a dollar, sharply lower than the previous finish of Rs 49.04 per dollar.         
	Metal shares also tumbled following a sharp fall in prices on the London Metal Exchange.         
	Among sectoral indices, the BSE metal index led the percentage losers with a drop of nearly 7.90 per cent.        
	Sebi warning        
	Sebi today warned foreign institutional investors not to lend stocks to overseas entities or borrow from them.        
	The warning was issued at a closed-door meeting between Sebi and select foreign investors. However, it indicated that there were no plans to impose restrictions on the issue of participatory notes.        
	This is the second time that Sebi is issuing a warning against stock lending, which many believe triggered a wave of short selling on the markets and saw the sensex plunge below 10,000 last Friday.        
	Brown worry         
	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told lawmakers today that the global economic downturn was likely to cause recession in Britain, echoing the sentiments of the countrys central bank chief. We must now take action on the global financial recession, which is likely to cause recession in Britain, too, Brown said.        
	A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Crucial data out Friday is expected to show that the British economy shrank in the third quarter after zero growth in the second.

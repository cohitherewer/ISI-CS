The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Yahoo says no to new Microsoft proposal 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yahoo says no to new Microsoft proposal 
                                      FIRM STAND      
	San Francisco, July 13 (PTI): Yahoo Inc has rejected a joint proposal from Microsoft Corporation and billionaire investor Carl Icahn for the restructuring of the global Internet giant, saying the deal was not in the best interest of stockholders.         
	After reviewing the proposal with its legal and financial advisers, Yahoos board of directors determined that accepting the proposal is not in the best interests of its stockholders, Yahoo said in a statement last night.         
	Yahoo received the joint proposal from Microsoft and Icahn, an arrangement that would include the acquisition of the Internet companies search business by Microsoft and the rest of the company by Icahn.        
	The proposal was made on Friday evening and Yahoo was given less than 24 hours to accept the proposal, the fundamental terms of which Microsoft and Icahn had made clear they were unwilling to negotiate, Yahoo said.        
	The terms included the immediate replacement of Yahoos board and the removal of the top management, the statement said, terming the proposal completely absurd and irresponsible.         
	This odd and opportunistic alliance of Microsoft and Carl Icahn has anything but the interests of Yahoos stockholders in mind, Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock said.         
	Yahoos board remains open to any transaction that delivers full value to our stockholders  we just do not believe such a transaction should be dictated by Microsoft and a single short-term investor, the statement added.         
	Yahoo said a transaction to acquire the whole company would be much more straightforward and involve far less risk than the new proposal or any similar alternative.         
	Bostock said, Microsoft and Icahn are trying to dismantle the company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms that will be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders.        
	We are prepared to let our stockholders, not Microsoft and Carl Icahn, decide what is in their best interests and we look forward to the upcoming vote, he added.         
	Acknowledging that the Microsoft-Icahn proposal represented a number of improvements over the earlier one, Yahoo said it not only repeated its offer to sell the entire company to Microsoft for at least $33 per share but also offered to negotiate an improved search-only transaction. Microsoft rejected both the offers.         
	The revenue guarantees suggested are well below the search revenue that Yahoo is expected to generate on its own and in association with its announced commercial agreement with Google, the statement said.

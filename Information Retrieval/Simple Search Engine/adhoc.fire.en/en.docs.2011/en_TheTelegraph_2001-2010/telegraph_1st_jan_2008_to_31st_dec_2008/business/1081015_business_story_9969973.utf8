          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Counting Days                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: The government may cut petrol and diesel prices if the price of crude oil falls below $61 a barrel and not $67.        
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, which has offset the impact of falling crude prices, was the reason behind lowering the limit.         
	On Monday, the Indian basket of crude was at $72.20 per barrel.        
	Oil minister Murli Deora had earlier said the government could consider cutting fuel prices if crude fell below $67 a barrel.         
	In October, the Indian basket of crude has averaged $79.70 a barrel compared with $95.81 a barrel in September.         
	Falling prices have fuelled hopes of a cut in fuel prices.        
	Domestic oil companies are suffering losses of Rs 350 crore a day by selling petroleum products below cost.        
	Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited are losing Rs 4.68 per litre on the sale of petrol, Rs 11.48 per litre on diesel, Rs 28.07 per litre on kerosene and Rs 322.14 per domestic LPG cylinder.         
	Import bill        
	Indias crude imports have almost doubled to Rs 1,97,620 crore during the first five months of the current fiscal because of soaring prices of global crude oil. In the first week of July, crude had touched $147 per barrel, though it is now much lower at $81 per barrel.        
	The country imported 54.6 million tonnes of crude oil in the April-August period against 51.9 million tonnes for Rs 1,01,509 crore in the same period a year ago. India imported crude at an average price of $70.25 per barrel in 2007-08.

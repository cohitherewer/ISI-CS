          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Bharat Sanchar Nigam, the Rs 40,953-crore state-owned telecom behemoth, is planning to become the first to launch 3G services in India.        
	BSNL  which wont have to enter a scrum of bidders for scarce radio waves, or spectrum, to launch the service  has already placed an order for 5 million lines with Ericsson of Sweden.        
	For 3G, we are planning five million lines to begin with. It will cost us around Rs 3,000 crore. We hope to receive the equipment from Ericsson soon and will be ready to start operations by December, said officials.        
	BSNL has directed all the chief general managers of telecom circles to take further actions at their end so that 3G services can be launched by December.        
	Third generation or 3G services are high-end mobile value added services that allow real-time transactions, video streaming, voice and data services. If it catches on, it could be a big revenue booster for telecom companies.        
	Two years ago, BSNL had floated a tender for 45 million lines of GSM equipment worth $1.75 billion. Ericsson had emerged as the top bidder and was given 60 per cent of the order. Out of this, 10 million lines have now been earmarked for 3G services.        
	Officials also said that BSNL was planning to float another mega tender for 90 million lines worth some $9 billion by the end of this month.         
	They said 50 per cent of these lines would be set aside for 3G telephony services.        
	Last week, telecom minister A. Raja approved the release of 3G and WiMax spectrum to BSNL.         
	World interoperability for microwave access incorporation (WiMax) is a technology that enables broadband and other 3G services over wireless networks at a low cost that permits mass market adoption.        
	Public sector telecom firms BSNL and MTNL are not required to bid for the 3G and WiMax radio waves unlike other private operators. They will, however, have to pay the price to be paid by the highest bidder.         
	As of now, they seem to have got a head start over private operators who can float tenders and begin operations only if they emerge winners in the bidding process.         
	WiMax is expected to generate a higher average revenue per user (ARPU) per month as it offers higher data speed at lower capital expenditure.         
	BSNL expects WiMax to be a hit in the rural areas where the public sector monolith has deep penetration. At present, the telecom majors ARPU from wireless services is around Rs 200 while it is Rs 350 from wireline operations.         
	The company said that 3G services, which would be slightly expensive, would be reserved for tier 1 cities. Wi-Max technology would be more suitable for rural areas where it is difficult to lay cables.

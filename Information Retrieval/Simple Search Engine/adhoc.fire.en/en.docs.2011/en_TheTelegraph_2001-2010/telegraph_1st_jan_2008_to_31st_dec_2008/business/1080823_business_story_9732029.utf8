The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel faces price-cut pressure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel faces price-cut pressure
          OUR BUREAU                          Rastogi: Points to ponder                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The government today asked steel producers to slash prices when rates soften further in the global markets.        
	Global steel prices have already softened and if the trend continues, it calls for a reduction in the domestic market, too, steel secretary P.K. Rastogi told reporters here today.        
	Globally, the demand for steel has come down, especially from infrastructure firms, resulting in a dip in prices.        
	The gap between domestic and international steel prices has reduced. However, they are not on a par. If the gap narrows down further, we may look at revising our prices downward, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said, adding that the PSU would maintain the price line as of now.        
	Domestic steel producers have been holding the price line for over three months to help the government check inflation.        
	Though steel producers had maintained prices, Rastogi said, if there was a hike, the government would step in.         
	The government has options, we will examine the case if the prices are increased, he said.        
	On the issue of supply contracts with iron ore firms, Rastogi said the government was seeking long-term agreements to ensure supply security and check price volatility.         
	On the reported increase in retail prices of steel in spite of the governments efforts, Roongta said, SAIL has a network of dealers at the district level who are maintaining the price line.        
	Inflation worry        
	There may be no reprieve from inflation, which is ruling at 12.63 per cent, before the third week of November, as the government sees prices riding the base effect among other factors.         
	The base effect pertains to low inflation numbers a year ago, which makes even a small increase in the price index now appear much larger.        
	Headline inflation continues to be a matter for concern. The point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group is measured on an annual point-to-point basis. Hence, it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year, which is the base year, a statement issued by the finance ministry said.        
	Inflation, which surged to 12.63 per cent as on August 9, should also be seen from the perspective that the wholesale price index (WPI) declined to 4.24 per cent from 4.39 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	This trend of a declining WPI continued up to November 24, 2007, the statement said. On whether it meant that inflation would moderate by that time, finance ministry sources said it would be so to the extent of the base effect.        
	Pulse beat        
	The government is considering a proposal to sell pulses at Rs 10 a kilo through ration shops to cool down prices.        
	Masur dal is currently being sold at over Rs 40 a kilo in the wholesale market. Prices of most pulse varieties have risen 60-100 per cent over the last one year. Pulses have a weight of 0.60 per cent in the wholesale price index.

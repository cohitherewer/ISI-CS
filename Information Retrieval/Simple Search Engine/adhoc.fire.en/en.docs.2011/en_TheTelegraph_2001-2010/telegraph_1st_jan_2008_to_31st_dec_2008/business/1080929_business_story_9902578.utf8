	London, Sept. 28 (PTI): British curtains and furnishings major Rosebys, which was acquired by Indias GHCL in July 2006, has collapsed into administration after it made sustained losses because of harsh trading conditions.        
	Nearly 2,000 staff of the company are faced with an uncertain future while it attempts to secure a buyer.         
	A restructuring team from consultants KPMG said Rosebys would continue to trade as normal till then.        
	Rosebys has 280 stores and generates sales of around 100 million a year. It was acquired by textiles-to-soda-ash giant GHCL as a springboard for setting up a retailing presence in the UK.         
	However, in the last financial year, Rosebys suffered losses worth 6 million and has remained in the red since then. GHCL was planning to launch Rosebys in India this month.

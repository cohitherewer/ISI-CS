     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Going public
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: ICICI Bank is planning to take ICICI Securities public.
    
	The move is designed to unlock the value of its investment banking and broking firm through an initial public offering (IPO).
    
	Market buzz about the IPO today sent ICICI Bank shares soaring by nearly 6 per cent. 
    
	On the BSE, the scrip closed at Rs 1,363.90. The share bounced from the days low of Rs 1,235 to hit an intra-day high of Rs 1,380 after it opened at Rs 1,279.50.
    
	Officials at the bank said they were looking at various options and any decision on the 100 per cent subsidiary would be communicated at the right time. 
    
	Market circles said the bank had held an investors meeting today where indications were available that it was considering an IPO for ICICI Securities.
    
	A flotation will boost the banks stock considering the high valuations that investment banking and brokerage companies have been enjoying in recent times.
    
	ICICI Securities handles corporate finance, fixed income business and equities. Headquartered in Mumbai, it has offices in New Delhi, Chennai, Calcutta, New York, London and Singapore. 
    
	It also has a US subsidiary called ICICI Securities Inc, which is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc (NASD). 
    
	Due to this membership, ICICI Securities Inc can engage in permitted activities in the US securities markets. These activities include dealing in securities markets transactions and providing research and investment advice to US investors.

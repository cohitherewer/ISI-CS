The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stage set for early RBI action
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stage set for early RBI action
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Crunch Time                                  
	Mumbai, June 20: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to wait till the quarterly review due on July 29 to raise interest rates further.        
	With inflation hitting a 13-year high at 11.05 per cent, the central bank is widely expected to raise the repo rate by 25 to 50 basis points.        
	On June 11, the RBI had surprised banks by increasing the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8 per cent to contain inflationary expectations. The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides liquidity to banks against government securities. It was last raised in March 2007.        
	But with inflation running far ahead of expectations and mounting fears that it will tend higher, there is a pervasive feeling among bankers and economists that the central bank will raise the repo rate over the next few days.        
	Observers are divided on whether the repo rate will be raised by 25 or 50 basis points. However, it is largely felt that the RBI is unlikely to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) given the current liquidity conditions. CRR, which is that percentage of bank deposits which must be maintained with the RBI, now stands at 8.25 per cent.        
	There will certainly be a policy reaction from the RBI. It will be more a repo than a CRR hike. The RBI will probably wait for one more inflation number and then it can take a decision, says Harihar Krishnamurthy, country treasurer at Development Credit Bank.         
	Krishnamurthy reckoned that the apex bank would not raise CRR as liquidity was not high and the government was expected to borrow more to fund fertiliser and oil subsidies.        
	Tushar Poddar, vice-president of Asia economic research at Goldman Sachs, feels the RBI will increase interest rates by another 100 basis points through a combination of a repo rate hike and a CRR increase. He reckons the repo rate will rise by 50 basis points (winching up his forecast from 25 basis points earlier) and the cash reserve ratio will be raised by a similar margin over the next three months.        
	Going forward, we expect inflation to continue to move higher, though not at the same rate as the fuel adjustment was a one-time move. However, continued double-digit inflation is expected to have a huge psychological impact on consumers, fuelling inflationary expectations, he said in a report released today.        
	Economists such as Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, agree that inflation is much higher than anticipated, but think that an inflation rate of 11.05 per cent was predicated by the surge in the prices of aviation turbine fuel, naphtha, and bitumen. The prices of iron and steel, edible oil and oilseeds had also contributed.        
	The RBI will certainly hike the repo rate by 25 to 50 basis points before the policy and it should come in the next few days, he told The Telegraph.        
	PLR raised        
	In a strong signal that the process of another bout of interest rate hikes has begun, HDFC Bank today raised its prime lending rate (PLR) by 25 basis points to 15.25 per cent.         
	The private sector bank also raised its deposit rates by a similar margin.        
	The indications from other banks, including nationalised and private sector banks, are that they will wait for some more time before taking a decision.         
	However, officials at Punjab National Bank, said the bank might soon review lending and deposit rates. Sources from ICICI Bank said they would wait for some more time before reviewing rates.        
	Banks are probably waiting for the RBI to take some action. As the RBI is certain to raise the repo rate soon by the end of this month, we should see some banks raising lending and deposit rates, a public sector banker said.

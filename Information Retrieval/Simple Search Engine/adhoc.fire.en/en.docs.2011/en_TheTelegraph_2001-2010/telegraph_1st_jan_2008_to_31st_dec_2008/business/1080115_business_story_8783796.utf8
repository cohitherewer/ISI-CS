     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Ambani: D-day nears
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: A day before Reliance Powers maiden offer opens for subscription, promoters Anil Ambani and Reliance Energy brought in Rs 1,440 crore as the promoters contribution at Rs 450 per share.
    
	These shares will be locked in for five years. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had earlier stipulated that the entire 20 per cent of the companys post-issue capital, or the promoters contribution, would have to be locked in for five years instead of three years, which was normally prescribed for IPOs.
    
	The promoters contribution comes at the upper end of the price band of Rs 405-450 per share. 
    
	Reliance Powers IPO opens for public subscription tomorrow and will close on January 18. It is expected to be the countrys largest IPO and the issue is likely to raise around Rs 10,700-11,700 crore, with 22.8 crore shares being offered to the public. 
    
	The total issue size is 26 crore shares, including promoters contribution of 3.2 crore shares.
    
	Sources in the capital market expect a good response to the IPO, both from institutional and retail investors. 
    
	They feel Reliance Power will list at a hefty premium to the offer price. In the grey market, the listing price is being estimated at Rs 775-900 per share. 
    
	Speaking to journalists at the companys roadshow in Mumbai recently, chairman Anil Ambani had said Reliance Power shares would be be listed in the first week of February.
    
	The issue has being rated 4/5 by Crisil and Icra, indicating above-average fundamentals.
    
	Retail investors have been offered a discount of Rs 20 per share, which implies their net cost of subscription will be Rs 430 per share, if they choose to bid at Rs 450 per share. 
    
	Retail investors can also make a part payment of the application money. They can apply with only Rs 115 per share now. The balance will have to be paid after the shares are allotted.
    
	With planned installed capacity of 28,200MW, Reliance Power has one of the largest portfolios of power generation assets under development in the country.
    
	The IPO will be used to fund a few projects. These include 600MW Rosa Phase I and II, 300MW unit in Butibori (Maharashtra), 3960MW Sasan power project (Madhya Pradesh), 400MW in Urthing (Uttarakhand) and 1200MW at Shahapur in Maharashtra.

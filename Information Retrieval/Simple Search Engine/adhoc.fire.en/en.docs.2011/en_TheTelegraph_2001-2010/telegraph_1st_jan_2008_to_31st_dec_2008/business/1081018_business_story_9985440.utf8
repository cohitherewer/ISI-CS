	Calcutta, Oct. 17: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were sellers for the third day running today as the sensex sank below 10000.        
	According to statistics available with market regulator Sebi, FIIs today sold shares worth Rs 4,144.90 crore, while they bought Rs 2,233.60 crore, resulting in a net outflow of Rs 1,911.30 crore. The selling pressure proved heavy on a day of thin turnover of Rs 4,134.51 crore on the BSE and Rs 10,486.53 crore on the NSE.         
	Domestic institutional investors made net purchases of Rs 712.77 crore, but these were insufficient in the face of FII selling. In proprietary trading too, brokerage houses turned net sellers to the tune of Rs 109.97 crore.         
	In this month so far, FIIs have pulled out Rs 9,869.40 crore from the domestic equity markets. Last month, they had taken out Rs 8,278.10 crore.        
	They have been selling from the beginning of this calendar year. From January till date, FIIs have pulled out Rs 46,661.20 crore from direct equity investments (excluding equity derivatives). Except for April, they have been net sellers in the other months.         
	Selling was particularly heavy in January and June this year when FIIs sold Rs 13,036 crore and Rs 10,096 crore, respectively.         
	In October, net sales in less than three weeks have been close to Rs 10,000 crore.         
	Domestic institutional investors are also not investing in a big way. Mutual funds, in particular, are still jittery about buying stocks, though they are sitting on a cash pile in excess of Rs 25,000 crore in existing and new equity schemes. The funds are facing huge redemption pressure in debt schemes.         
	A majority of domestic institutional buyers at this point are insurance companies.        
	The average daily volume of trade has come down significantly  it stood at Rs 4,995.50 crore in September compared with Rs 8,070.56 crore in January. The daily average for October, so far, is Rs 4,420.24 crore.         
	A thin trading volume suggests that most investors are sitting outside, with FIIs the market movers.         
	More losers        
	Trading on both the BSE and the NSE closed today with a negative market breadth, meaning there were more losers than winners among the companies.        
	A negative market breadth often leads to a negative opening on the following trading day.         
	Of the 2,652 companies that traded today on the BSE, the scrips of 1,877 (or 70.78 per cent) fell. The scrips of 124 companies touched 52-week lows.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Two faces of a slide show   Slowdown hint in growth forecast
                                                                                                            Two faces of a slide show     -  Slowdown hint in growth forecast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Centre today came up with a set of statistics that clearly showed that the Rs 33.89-trillion ($860 billion) Indian economy had started to slow down  sparking worries that the economy might stutter after three years of robust growth.        
	Last month, the finance ministry had estimated this fiscals growth at 9 per cent, sharply lower than the 9.6 per cent growth in the previous year that was the highest in 18 years.        
	The further moderation (8.7 per cent) in the first official projection from the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) sends out signals that Indias growth story may not be as resilient as everyone has made it out to be.        
	Key sectors limp        
	All the principal sectors  agriculture, manufacturing and financial services  have started to stutter on the back of flagging consumer demand, triggered by the Reserve Banks tight monetary policy.        
	Growth in manufacturing, which makes up just over 15 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), is projected to slow to 9.4 per cent from 12 per cent in the previous year, the CSO said.         
	Agriculture growth was expected to slow down from 3.8 per cent in the previous fiscal to 2.6 per cent.        
	The lower projections will peg the countrys growth at its lowest level since 2005.         
	But the comforting fact was that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had projected a very conservative 8.5 per cent growth in 2007-08  and the CSO forecast was well above that level.        
	FM optimistic        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram expressed confidence that the economy would grow close to 9 per cent.        
	I am reasonably confident that the figures may be revised and the economy will grow at close to 9 per cent. The Central Statistical Organisation figures are lower than what I had anticipated. We are disappointed but not despondent, he said.        
	Voice of concern        
	Former Planning Commission member S.P. Gupta said, Even this 8.7 per cent figure may prove to be elusive. Services, which constitute a large portion of our economy, are being impacted by global recessionary trends and this will be reflected in the last few months of this fiscal, said .        
	But the main fear is that with the US recession deepening, Indias growth in the coming year can be even slower.        
	Infotech, textile and gems and jewellery sectors are already impacted. A slowdown in demand for steel from China can affect exports of the metal, admitted economists working for the department of economic affairs.         
	Reddy comfortable        
	RBI governor Y.V. Reddy said in Lucknow that nothing had happened in the past week that warranted a change in the monetary policy stance and the growth rate was broadly in line with the RBIs expectations.        
	The inherent logic, analysis and information available in the monetary policy are totally valid even today, he said.

                                                                                                               Firms in buyback rush
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 24: More and more companies are opting to buy back shares in an effort to prop up their sagging stocks in a falling market.        
	The latest to jump on the bandwagon are Great Offshore Ltd and Gujarat Flurochemicals.        
	Just a couple of weeks ago, Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Energy and Patni Computer Systems announced similar plans. Gujarat Flurochemicals is planning to buy back its shares at a price of up to Rs 300 per share. The total amount earmarked for the share buyback programme is Rs 61.43 crore, which constitutes 10 per cent of the companys paid-up equity capital and free reserves.        
	Great Offshore informed the stock exchanges today that its board would meet on March 31 to consider buying back equity shares of the company. Its expected that in this case too, the programme will constitute around 10 per cent of its equity.        
	Ever since the market regulator permitted share buyback by companies in 1998, many companies have tried to use this device to stop an erosion in the market value of their stocks.        
	A share buyback sends out the signal that the current share price is undervalued.         
	Under the regulations, companies that buy back shares have to extinguish the equity capital to that extent. This leads to higher book value and earning per share.        
	Earlier this month, Reliance Energy announced a share buyback programme of up to Rs 2,000 crore.         
	The Anil Ambani group company said it would buy the shares from the open market at a maximum price of Rs 1,600 per share. The share buyback will account for 25 per cent of its net worth or a little over 5 per cent of its diluted equity capital.        
	The Reliance Energy buyback programme commences tomorrow and will be implemented in two phases.         
	Last month, the board of Patni Computers approved a buyback at a maximum price of Rs 325 per share for an aggregate amount of Rs 237 crore.         
	A section of the market feels that during bearish times, a share buyback can be a good way to restore investor confidence.         
	When there is a big correction, a buyback can bring back confidence of the investor, particularly at the retail end, says Dhiraj Sachdev at HSBC Asset Management. Sachdev added that a buyback was also positive in that it reflected the confidence of the management in a particular company.        
	The other companies where share buybacks are currently on include ICI India Ltd and Madras Cements. The combined size of both these programmes is around Rs 4,700 crore.        
	A share buyback weakens the companys balancesheet (by reducing cash); buying back shares can be downright hazardous for debt-heavy companies, IIM Lucknow professor A.K. Mishra had said two years ago in a study that analysed share buybacks in India.

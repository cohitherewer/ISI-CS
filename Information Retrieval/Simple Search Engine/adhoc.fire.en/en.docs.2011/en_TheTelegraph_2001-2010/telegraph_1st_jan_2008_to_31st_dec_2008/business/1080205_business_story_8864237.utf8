	Calcutta, Feb. 4: Calcutta-based Shyam Sel today inked a memorandum of agreement with the Bengal government to set up a 1.1-million-tonne integrated steel plant and a 1,000MW power plant.
 
	The project will involve an investment of around Rs 9,900 crore.
 
	Shyam Sel is the latest addition to a long list of companies that have signed agreements with the state government. More than Rs 1,00,000 crore have been invested only in the steel sector.
 
	The project, spread over 1,500 acres, will come up at Jamuria in Burdwan.
 
	Bhushan Agarwal, vice-chairman and managing director of Shyam Sel, said his plant would be the first to take off among all the steel projects proposed in the state so far.
 
	We will commission a 2,00,000-tonne stainless steel and a 250MW power plant by the middle of the next year, he said. 
 
	He said 35-40 per cent of the land for the project was with the state government, which could be leased out to the company within three to four months.
 
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation will procure the rest of the land and lease it out to Shyam Sel.
 
	Shyam Sel, which will close this year with a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore from steel-related businesses, will invest Rs 2,000 crore in the first phase.
 
	The company plans to come up with an initial public offering of Rs 250 crore in the middle of this year to finance the project. It may also place a stake with a private equity investor to raise another Rs 150 crore.
 
	The company will source coal for the production of steel and power through a block allotted for the project by the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation.
 
	It has already given a contract to a Chinese company for the sinter plant to make steel from iron ore fines.

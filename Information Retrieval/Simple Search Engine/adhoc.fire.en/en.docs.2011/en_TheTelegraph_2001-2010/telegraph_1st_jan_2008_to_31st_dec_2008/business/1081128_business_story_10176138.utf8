          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: An audacious terror attack on Mumbais financial hub  which aspires to become another Shanghai  today blew up financial transactions worth over Rs 3 trillion with stock, commodity and foreign exchange markets closed for business as fear stalked the deserted roads of the metropolis.        
	The stock markets were the first to go off air. More than an hour before trading was set to begin, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the bourses said there would be no trading during the day as the state government had advised people to stay at home.         
	A short while later the Reserve Bank of India announced that there would be no transactions and settlements in government securities, foreign exchange and money markets. Recent estimates indicate that the daily turnover on the forex markets is around $45 billion.        
	However, the central bank added that transactions under liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)  a tool used to manage liquidity, settlement services and the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system  would function normally. The RTGS is a platform that allows money transfers across banks on a real-time basis.        
	Stock market mavens supported the decision to halt trading. They took the right decision. It reduced the number of people travelling to the city, said Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, who added that only the brokerages would feel the heat of a loss of a trading day.        
	Sebi will take a call tomorrow morning on the resumption of trading on Friday.        
	Index futures weak        
	Stock index futures and rupee forwards fell today, signalling that shares could open lower tomorrow as a reaction to the terrorist attacks in Mumbai        
	The S amp;P CNX Nifty Index futures for November delivery dropped over 2 per cent in Singapore, its biggest fall in the past week. The rupee forwards dipped just under 1 per cent.        
	On the overseas bourses, shares of domestic companies were weak though the American depository receipts ended higher on Wednesday even as news of the terrorist attacks trickled in. Market circles say there can be heavy selling in early trading tomorrow but reckoned that stocks may recover losses.        
	Tata meet postponed        
	Tata Steel has postponed its board meeting tomorrow in the wake of the terror attacks in Mumbai.         
	The company was to announce its half-yearly result taking into account the performance of the European operations of Corus.

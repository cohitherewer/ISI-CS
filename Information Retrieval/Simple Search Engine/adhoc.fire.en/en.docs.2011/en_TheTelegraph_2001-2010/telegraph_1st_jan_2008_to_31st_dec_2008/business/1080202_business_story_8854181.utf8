	Calcutta, Feb. 1: ICICI Bank wont follow HDFC in slashing home loan rates, managing director K.V. Kamath said today. 
    
	There is no clear signal from the Reserve Bank of a rate cut and we are not going to reduce our lending rates, he said. 
    
	Kamath was here to attend a function of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), a non-profit global network of software entrepreneurs and professionals. He added that the rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve would not have much of an impact on the Indian economy. 
    
	In the meantime, if the Reserve Bank does not reduce its key policy rates, any rate reduction by commercial banks is likely to happen only after March, Kamath said.

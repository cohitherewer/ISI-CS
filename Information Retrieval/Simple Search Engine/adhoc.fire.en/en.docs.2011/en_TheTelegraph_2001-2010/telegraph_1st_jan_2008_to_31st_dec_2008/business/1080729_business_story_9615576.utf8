          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 28: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today warned that crude oil prices were expected to remain at an elevated level and the supply side pressure on global food prices were not showing any sign of easing.         
	The RBI warning, penned in its report on monetary and economic trends for the first quarter of 2008-09, came in spite of the fact that crude prices, in recent times, have cooled off quite a bit and there are indications that consumption growth in advanced economies is likely to slow down.        
	The report, released a day before the quarterly review of credit policy, said global crude price was likely to remain high because of a relatively tight demand-supply balance.         
	Not only crude but foodgrain and agricultural raw materials are also contributing to higher global commodity prices. There are no signs that the supply-side pressures on global food prices are abating.         
	Potential inflationary pressures from global food and energy prices appear to have amplified and, by current indications, are likely to remain so for some time, the RBI said.        
	It said the recent increase in fuel prices effected by the government was not sufficient because of rising global crude oil prices. This suggests that the pass-through in case of administered petroleum products is still incomplete.        
	Analysts feel that the RBI review is perhaps an indication of the possibility of inflationary pressures persisting in the economy. It is also felt that the RBI will continue with its focus on containing prices.        
	Bankers are divided on whether the central bank will raise the repo rate tomorrow. While a section of the market believes that a 25-basis-point hike in the rate is likely, others are vouching for a status quo. Repo rate is the RBI lending rate to banks and a benchmark for other interest rates.        
	On inflation, the apex bank said the recent surge in prices reflected to an extent the impact of higher global crude oil prices on various items of consumption.        
	Commodities which became costlier include iron and steel, chemical products, machinery and machine tools, oilseeds, edible oils, oil cakes and raw cotton. Besides crude woes, inflation ruled high because of strong demand and international commodity price pressures. In oilseeds, the output in the rabi season fell.        
	Overall, manufactured products group was the major driver of year-on-year WPI (whosesale price index) inflation as on July 12 with weighted contribution of 49.9 per cent, followed by fuel, power, light and lubricants group and the primary articles group, the RBI said.        
	Crop area        
	Sowing was progressing with the arrival of the southwest monsoon in various states with the coverage under kharif crops up to July 18 being higher by 1.3 million hectares compared with the year-ago period. Among food crops, rice exhibited a significant increase in sown area along with coarse cereals and oilseeds, the Reserve Bank said.

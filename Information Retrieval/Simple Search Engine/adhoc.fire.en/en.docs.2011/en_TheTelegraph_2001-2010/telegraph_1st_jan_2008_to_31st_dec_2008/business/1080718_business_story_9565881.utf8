          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cross connection                                  
	New Delhi, July 17: In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, GSM cellular operators today justified the amount of spectrum in their possession.        
	The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), a body representing the interests of GSM players, stated in the letter that they fulfilled subscriber criteria for spectrum at their disposal.        
	T.V. Ramachandran, the director-general of the COAI, said in the letter that existing GSM players were not new operators and consequently, the cap of 6.2 Mhz of spectrum is not applicable to them.        
	Earlier this week, the Prime Ministers Office had forwarded a letter of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh to the telecom ministry that demanded a one-time fee for the GSM players, in line with market rates, for spectrum held by them beyond 6.2 Mhz.        
	Telecom licence terms state that a licensee is new only when he is being allocated initial start-up spectrum and has not started operations. Therefore the cap of 6.2 Mhz is only applicable to initial start-up spectrum, said Ramachandran, in his letter to the Prime Minister.        
	The COAI argued that the existing GSM players including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular had fulfilled subscriber allocation norms as prescribed and amended from time to time and were eligible for the spectrum in their possession.        
	Amar Singhs letter had stated that the GSM players, who earlier got spectrum free of cost, had more than their quota and were hoarding more than 50 Mhz.         
	Expressing disappointment at the allegations, Ramachandran said, By global reckoning, Indian mobile operators make do with the lowest spectrum allocations, pay the highest taxes and offer the lowest tariffs in the world to their customers.        
	Last year, Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani had written several letters to both the Prime Minister and the communications ministry along similar lines.         
	On getting free spectrum, Ramachandran said that this was not true as the GSM players had to pay extra for additional spectrum. These charges, too, have been prescribed according to the licence terms and are part of a settlement between the industry and the government in 2002.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Broader view                                  
	New Delhi, July 20: Consumer electronic firms are drawing up innovative strategies to sell premium products, as the mass market reels under the impact of inflation.        
	Japanese company Hitachi Home Electronics Asia (S) is strengthening its high-end product portfolio as part of its strategy to shield itself from the pressures of inflation, Tarun Jain, country head (India) of Hitachi Home Electronics Asia (S) told The Telegraph.         
	As part of its global launch, the company has introduced ultra-thin liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions in India. Hitachi has identified the growing number of millionaires in the country for the premium offering priced between Rs 83,000 and Rs 1,45,000.         
	The product is 1.5-inch thin and is said to be 70 per cent thinner than conventional flat panel televisions. Besides being the thinnest LCD to be introduced in the domestic market, it also boasts of being the lightest in its category with a 32-inch LCD weighing 10.9 kg.        
	According to industry estimates, there are around 1.6 million households earning more than Rs 45 lakh a year, with a majority of them residing in Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi.        
	Hitachi is in advanced talks with Palador Pictures promoters of world cinema in India  to jointly set up film clubs in over 30 premium private member clubs and corporate campuses.         
	These clubs will also promote Hitachis ultra-thin plasma televisions and an even thinner range of LCD TVs that will be introduced soon.        
	Initiatives such as the world cinema film clubs will help the company reach out to customers interested in high-end products.        
	Hitachi, which currently has a 2.1 per cent market share in the LCD TV category and 7.7 per cent in the plasma category, is targeting a 10 per cent market share in LCD and 20 per cent in the plasma segment in the next two years.        
	Korean giant LG is also trying to drive growth in the premium segment across all product categories as part of its global strategy of making the brand more premium and aspirational.         
	Even though we have earned our name in the mass market, this year we plan to earn between 25-30 per cent of our sales revenues (Rs 11,000 crore for fiscal 2008-09) from high-end products, said V. Ramachandran, director (sales and marketing), LG Electronics India.        
	Adding that inflationary pressure is strengthening its resolve to target premium segment, he said, Going forward, the industry will face strong pressure on margins. The increase in prices (4-6 per cent last month) has also proved to be insufficient in keeping us insulated from depreciating money and rising inflation.        
	Therefore, its prudent to sell high-margin high-priced products, which will in turn help increase profitability, Ramachandran said.

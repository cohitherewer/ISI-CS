          A STAFF REPORTER                          Growth mode                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: Canon India will invest Rs 100 crore this year in advertisements and brand promotions.        
	The digital products and solutions firm is targeting a revenue growth of Rs 700 crore, or 37 per cent, this year.         
	About 20 per cent of the total investment in advertising and brand promotion will go to the eastern region. Most of the investment will be made in local-level marketing activities, said Alok Bharadwaj, senior vice-president, Canon India.         
	Such heavy investments are required to unveil the new product portfolio. Sixty six per cent of our products are phased out and replaced with new ones every year, he said.         
	The eastern region contributes about 25 per cent to Canons revenues.        
	We had clocked revenues of Rs 510 crore last year and in the first half of this year, we have grown 34 per cent. Therefore, we are on track to meet our targets for the year, said Bharadwaj.        
	Canon would also be focusing on ramping up its B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consume) plans.        
	In B2C, we have the Canon Image Lounge, which are centres spread across 3,000 square feet, displaying the companys 100 products. These centres will not sell products but can make arrangements with the nearest dealer, said Bharadwaj.        
	On the other hand, the Canon Business Solutions Lounge will be located in corporate areas and display 48 business solutions.        
	This year both types of centres will be rolled out in Gurgaon, Bangalore and Mumbai, whereas next year cities such as Calcutta, Chennai and Hyderabad will have the centres. The investment per Canon Image Lounge is around Rs 2 crore.        
	Bharadwaj, however, said Canon had no plans of setting up an assembly or a manufacturing centre in India.        
	These are global decisions and dependent on a host of factors. India is not on the map for such a base currently. Maybe when the eco-system is more evolved one will have a relook, said Bharadwaj.        
	About 40 per cent of Canon Indias turnover comes from the B2B segment, 20 per cent from the retail printer business, 30 per cent from camera sales and another 10 per cent from service and software.

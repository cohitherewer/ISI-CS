	Calcutta, Aug. 19: US entities are keen to explore investment and trade opportunities in Bengal.         
	The US Consulate is getting an increasing number of requests from companies eager to visit the eastern state, according to Beth A. Payne, the US consul-general in Calcutta.         
	American companies have discovered Bengal and the US-India Business Council has included Calcutta as one of the top three cities its delegation of industrialists will visit in its annual trade mission to India next month, Payne said while addressing a conference organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	The growing outward investment from India has also made investors abroad look at the country not only as an investment destination but also as a source of venture capital, she added.        
	Trade between the two countries has also increased to $41 billion in manufactured goods and $10 billion in services. Indian exports to the US has grown by more than 10 per cent last year, Payne said.         
	In the next two years, the US consulate will give top priority to promoting investments by small and medium enterprises from the US in Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | American billionaire checks in at Orient
                                                                                                               American billionaire checks in at Orient
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 15: Steven A Cohen, the 47th richest American who is a billionaire hedge fund manager, has announced that he holds 9.7 per cent in Orient-Express Hotels.         
	Cohens disclosure comes two days after two US investment funds  BlackRock and DE Shaw Valence  picked up stakes in the luxury hotel chain and gave a fresh twist to the acrimonious battle between the Tata-owned Indian Hotels and Bermuda-based Orient-Express.        
	While the shares are held in Cohens own capacity and through various firms controlled by him, it is not yet clear as to when the stake was picked up.        
	In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SAC Capital Advisors said it beneficially owned close to 0.1 per cent Class A shares of Orient-Express. SAC Capital Management held an identical amount, while CR Intrinsic Investors owned 4.7 per cent. The number of shares beneficially owned by Cohen was 2,045,103 or 4.8 per cent.        
	Interestingly, the filing ends with a certification that the securities are not acquired or held to effect a change in the control of the issuer of the securities. This means that the shares have been acquired purely as an investment.        
	In early January, DE Shaw picked up a 5.7 per cent stake in Orient-Express. Just a week before that, BlackRock, one of the largest hedge funds in the world, picked up a 5.2 per cent stake in Orient-Express.        
	After picking up the stake, DE Shaw Valence sent a hard-hitting letter to James Hurlock, chairman of the board of Orient-Express, asking the company to publicly clarify the rights of the companys super voting class B shares and (explain) how it intends to use these shares in the event (that) a fair and equitable offer for the company as a whole is received.

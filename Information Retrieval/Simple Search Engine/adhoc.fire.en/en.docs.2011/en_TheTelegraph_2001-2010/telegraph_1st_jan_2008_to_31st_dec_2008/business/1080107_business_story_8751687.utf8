	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Indian Farmers Fertilisers Cooperative Limited (Iffco) is setting up a special economic zone (SEZ) in Andhra Pradesh that will process agricultural produce and house other farm-based industries.
    
	Called Kissan SEZ, the facility comes at a time of a raging debate on farmlands being used for industrial purposes. The multi-product zone will be in Nellore district of the state. This is Iffcos first initiative in infrastructure development. 
    
	According to S.K. Jhakhar, chairman of Iffco, This will not only boost industrialisation in the area but also benefit the local people, particularly the farmers. 
    
	Iffco officials said farmers co-operatives would participate in the SEZ as equity partners. The zone has secured the green signal from the board of approvals of the commerce ministry.
    
	It will cover an area of 2,800 acres, owned by Iffco. The site is located on NH5  the Howrah-Chennai highway  and close to Krishnapatnam, which is being developed as a major port.
    
	Around Rs 2,400 crore will be invested to develop the enclave, which will directly employ 10,000, the Iffco officials said.
    
	Iffco will initially invest about Rs 500 crore in building the infrastructure for the project.
    
	The company will set up a special purpose vehicle to generate funds for the SEZ. The investments will be in a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. 
    
	Talks for finalising a strategic partner will begin soon. 
    
	On displacement of landowners, the officials said most of the land was owned by the government. 
    
	Private owners held some part of the SEZ land, which Iffco acquired from them in 1997 for a fertiliser unit.
    
	The fertiliser plant proposal has now been abandoned, leaving the land free for the SEZ.
    
	Apart from farm-based industries and food processing units, there will also be units making leather goods. 
    
	Iffco will set up grain storage facilities and training institutes for post-harvest technologies. Training will also be imparted on construction skills.
    
	There are plans to adopt certain industrial training institutes in the region to upgrade their facilities for training the local population.
    
	The total number of zones that have received either in-principle or formal clearances in the country has crossed 600.

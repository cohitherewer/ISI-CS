The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Decision on spectrum fee hangs in balance 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Decision on spectrum fee hangs in balance 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Singh: Awaiting progress                          
	New Delhi, July 15: The government is unlikely to decide on fixing a price for the excess spectrum with various telecom operators, though the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has forwarded a letter of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh seeking policy changes on this count to the department of telecommunications.         
	Top officials said the PMO had forwarded the letter dated July 2 to the telecom secretary, some six days after it received the letter.        
	However, the PMO was not expecting any quick decision as the issue was a complicated one, and the government could not act in haste.        
	Sources said the PMOs forwarded letter bore the unusual tag at once, assigning a high priority to the delivery of the letter. Normal tags on government files and letters include out today, top priority, priority, most urgent and urgent. The use of the at once tag has naturally attracted considerable attention.         
	However, the telecom department would be looking into the issue and might act on it, the officials said. Amar Singh had demanded in his letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that GSM operators be charged a one-time fee in line with the market rate for spectrum held by them beyond 6.2 megahertz (Mhz).         
	Currently, on paying a licence fee, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4Mhz and 2.5Mhz of start-up radio frequencies (spectrum) per circle, respectively, to launch operations.         
	Licence conditions also provide for the allotment of GSM spectrum up to 6.2Mhz, on meeting a subscriber target.        
	Amar Singh himself clarified today that the letter was not written at the behest of his friend Anil Ambani but was rather written in the national interest as the government was losing out on revenues worth Rs 15,000 crore.

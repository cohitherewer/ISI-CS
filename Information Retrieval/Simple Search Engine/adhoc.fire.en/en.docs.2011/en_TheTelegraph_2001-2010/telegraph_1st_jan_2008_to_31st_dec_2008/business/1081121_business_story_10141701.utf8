                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Religare to sell mutual stake to Aegon 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Nov. 20: Religare Enterprises Ltd and Dutch financial company Aegon are parting ways in mutual fund business.         
	Both the partners today decided to rearrange their asset management joint venture  Religare Aegon. Under the terms of the rejig, Religare will exit and Aegon will buy its 50 per cent stake in the venture.         
	Besides, Lotus India Asset Management Company, which was recently acquired by Religare Aegon, will come under Religares control and renamed Religare Asset Management. This is subject to approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.         
	A spokesperson for Religare said that the split between the two entities in mutual funds would not affect their relationship in life insurance.        
	Religare and Aegon are also partners in life insurance and their investments have a lock-in period of 10 years. He did not comment on the consideration that Aegon would pay to buy Religares 50 per cent in the mutual fund venture.         
	There have been reports of Aegon not being too enthusiastic of buying Lotus, and the Dutch firms rising losses have forced it to go alone in mutuals. The spokesperson denied that this was a major reason behind the entities parting ways.         
	Early this month, Religare Aegon announced that it was acquiring Lotus from its majority shareholders, Alexandra Fund Management (an affiliate of Fullerton Fund Management Company Ltd) and Sabre Capital.

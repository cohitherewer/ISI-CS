The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Onus on industry to hold prices
                                                                                                               Onus on industry to hold prices
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 5: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked industry to hold the price line and, if possible, reduce prices of goods and services.        
	Chidambaram, who has cut excise duties in his budget to battle inflation, was speaking at a post-budget meet organised by Ficci.        
	Expand volume of production and gain in volume what you might lose by not increasing prices, he said.        
	Industry may hurt itself in the long run if it exploits short-term demand-supply mismatches, he added.        
	Chidambaram said the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission had come out with two observations on cement firms which said these companies were acting as a cartel. He was confident of demand rising in 2008-09 and urged industry to produce enough goods to meet the rising demand.        
	Sure of high growth in 2008-09, Chidambaram said, I have said that my batting average is 8.8 per cent in four years. I have no intention to close my innings with a lower average.        
	Chidambaram also appealed to states to reimburse taxes collected from the exports sector.        
	ECB restrictions        
	Chidambaram said the government was open to revisiting the temporary restrictions on bringing money raised through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to India.        
	The only restriction (on ECBs) we have placed, which I hope would be temporary, is that you must spend the money abroad on capital expenditure ... If things get better, we shall certainly revisit these restrictions, he said.        
	Restrictions on ECBs were imposed because the government was struggling to moderate capital inflows last year. At that time, industry had complained about the rising rupee, because of which measures were taken to moderate capital inflows, he said. And now industry is complaining about restrictions on these inflows, he added.        
	You (the government) are damned if you do, you are damned if you dont do, he said, asking corporate India to understand the RBIs compulsions on this issue.        
	The RBI governors task is an unenviable task. He has to balance a number of interests, especially containing inflation, managing money supply and maintaining monetary and financial stability. I think the RBI has struck a balance (with regard to ECBs), he said.

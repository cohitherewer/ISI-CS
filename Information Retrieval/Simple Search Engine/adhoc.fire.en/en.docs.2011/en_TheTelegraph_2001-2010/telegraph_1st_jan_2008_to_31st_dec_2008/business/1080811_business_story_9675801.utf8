The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas keen to sell low-yield Corus assets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tatas keen to sell low-yield Corus assets
                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 10 (PTI): Tata Steel may dispose of some of the low-profit yielding assets of Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel maker, to fulfil its target of almost doubling the return on invested capital in five years. Tata Steel had acquired Corus for $12.9 billion last year.        
	The group will pursue the optimisation of its European assets, dispose and restructure assets that are of low profitability and pursue differentiation of products and services, Tata Steel group director (strategy) Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in the companys latest annual report.        
	Tata Steel is aiming to improve the return on invested capital of its existing assets to 30 per cent from 19 per cent over the next five years, he said.        
	This will, however, be a daunting task for the group mainly because a large portion of its raw material comes from long-term contracts.        
	Tata Steel, which has a combined steel making capacity of 28.1 million tonnes per annum and ranks sixth largest in the world, has been on the receiving end as Corus depends on long-term contracts for raw material, the price of which has skyrocketed in recent times.        
	In India, Tata Steel is self-sufficient in iron ore, while 60 per cent of its coking coal needs are met locally. With the acquisition of Corus, the combined security stands at 22 per cent, down from 80 per cent for Tata Steel alone.         
	Iron ore and coking coal prices have jumped 400 per cent and 500 per cent, respectively, since 2004.         
	Tata Steel is looking for mines abroad to feed Corus and targets 100 per cent self-sufficiency for India and 50 per cent for its European operations. It has augmented its workforce to 41,900 by adding 800 people as on March, 2008 from 41,100 during the time of acquisition on April 2, 2007.        
	Group chief financial officer Kaushik Chatterjee said the incremental return on invested capital would be generated from better margins from existing assets through performance enhancement programmes, exhausting the existing capital and efficient asset deployment in new projects. It would also continue to benefit from continuous improvement of processes and products from the synergies achieved from the acquisition of Corus.

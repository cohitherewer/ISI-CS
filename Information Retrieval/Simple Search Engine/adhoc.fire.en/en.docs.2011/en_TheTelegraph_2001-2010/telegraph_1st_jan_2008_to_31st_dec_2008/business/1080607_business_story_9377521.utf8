          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Holding on                                   
	Mumbai, June 6: The Essar group does not intend to let go off Esmark Inc.        
	The Ruias are planning to raise the bid for the vertically integrated steel maker to prevent a rival offer from OAO Severstal, Russias largest steel manufacturer.        
	Essar Steel Holdings Ltd, a group company, today informed the Esmark board of directors that it would consider raising its April 30 offer to acquire the US-based steel maker at $17 per share.The offer had valued Esmark at $1.1 billion.        
	The Ruias move comes after a counter-offer from Severstal. Although the Russian giant had offered the same price as Essar, it was ahead in the race because it had been backed by the United Steelworkers, a major union in the US steel industry.         
	Since Esmark must have the union support before a sale, Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC  a majority shareholder  said it would tender its shares in response to the Severstal offer.        
	In a press statement released late this evening, Essar said it would consider making a higher bid after it had obtained additional information from Esmark. Essar had been invited by Esmark and UBS, the firms financial advisor, to participate in the bidding process for the steel maker.        
	Following Esmarks acceptance of Essars offer on April 30, the latter entered into a memorandum of agreement to acquire Esmark Inc at an estimated enterprise value of $1.1 billion, which included a proposed tender offer for a cash purchase price of $17 per share of all outstanding shares of the Nasdaq listed steel company.        
	Simultaneously, at Esmarks request, Essar also immediately extended a $110 million-loan to Esmark, which helped the company address a potential default, Essar added.         
	As part of the acquisition strategy, Essar has proposed a capital expenditure programme of $525 million for Esmarks Ohio and West Virginia manufacturing facilities over the next five years. In a letter sent today to the Esmark board of directors, Essar sought information on any arrangements or understanding that Severstal may have had with Franklin Mutual Advisers.

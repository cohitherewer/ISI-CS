 												      Srikumar Bondyopadhyay suggests  a  combination  of  fixed-income  instruments  and  equities  to  strike  a  balance                                  
	At a time when stock markets are tumbling, banks are giving 10 per cent plus assured interest on fixed deposits. But should this be reason enough for investors to park their money in fixed deposits?        
	Think twice: while fixed-income instruments should be an integral part of ones financial planning, an individuals investment portfolio should also take into consideration other factors such as inflation and soaring interest rates on home and personal loans.         
	Rest assured        
	Banks and company deposits generate regular and assured income in the form of interest. One can calculate beforehand the amount of interest one may get on the maturity of the deposit or at monthly/quarterly intervals throughout the term of the deposit.         
	Fixed deposits ensure a regular source of income for people after retirement. Such instruments can also be used to meet expenses in the short to medium term.         
	For example, if one has planned a major expense, say after one year, one should go in for a one-year fixed deposit scheme rather than invest the money in equities or equity-related instruments that are linked to the unpredictable nature of the market.        
	Fixed deposits ensure that ones known expenses in the near term are met adequately. Monthly and annual education/admission fees for children, annul premium payment for life/medical insurance, monthly house rent and other such definite expenditures can be adjusted against interest income from fixed deposits.        
	This can be illustrated with the help of an example. Suppose the monthly tuition fee of Rahuls son is Rs 2,000. A fixed deposit of Rs 2,40,000 at an annual interest rate of 10 per cent compounded quarterly will take care of this expense. The annual interest accrued to the fixed deposit will be Rs 24,915.90. Rahul should transfer this interest at the end of every year to his savings bank account to pay for the monthly tuition fees. In the savings bank account, the money will earn an additional 3.5 per cent annual interest.         
	Once the investment is made, the payment of these expenses from the interest income will put less pressure on Rahuls monthly income.               Banks

	Terms and conditions        
	The next big question is what should be the tenure of ones fixed deposit. Choosing a long-term deposit involves a number of risks. First, banks do not offer the same interest rate across different maturity  the interest rate is higher for 1- to 3-year deposits and lower for other tenures.         
	Second, given the interest rate cycles, one should ideally go in for 1- to 2-year fixed deposits offering the highest interest rates.         
	Medium-term deposits also offer the advantage of changing interest rates as these are renewed every one or two years.         
	Moreover, long-term deposits are more susceptible to inflation rather than short- to medium-term deposits.         
	Banks are now offering 10 per cent plus interest rate on fixed deposits because of the tight liquidity situation and a rise in the general price level and interest rates.         
	However, once inflation and liquidity condition improves, banks will lower their interest rates on fixed deposits. Hence, it is a good time to lock in a part of ones investments in fixed deposits at 10 per cent interest rate to take best advantage of the situation.        
	Long-term view        
	Fixed deposits should comprise ones short- to medium-term (one to two years) investment needs. For long-term investments, equities or equity-related instruments are a safe bet. Over a longer term, returns from equities are much higher than those from fixed-income assets. Equities are also the best investment vehicle to beat inflation.         
	The short-term volatilities in equity prices get ironed out over long-term growth in the stock market.         
	For small investors, the best way to ride the see-saw in equities is to invest systematically in secured businesses. Systematic investments help in averaging costs and optimising returns.        
	With all macro-economic indicators, such as inflation, interest rate and industrial growth presenting a bleak picture, equity prices have plummeted drastically.         
	Quality control        
	Its time for bottom-fishing of quality stocks which, when the tide turns, could yield hefty gains.         
	Even at the estimated 7 to 8 per cent annual growth rate in the gross domestic product, equities can generate nominal returns of between 12 and 15 per cent in the next one year.         
	Equities and equity-oriented mutual funds are the best investment instruments also because of their tax advantages. While an investor doesnt have to pay any long-term capital gains tax on equity investments, the short-term capital gains tax is only 15 per cent compared with 30 per cent for income in the highest bracket.

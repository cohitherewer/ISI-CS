	New Delhi, July 22 (PTI): The fight between Bisleri and Mt Everest, a Tata Group company, over the use of the Himalayan brand reached a new pitch today with the Ramesh Chauhan-promoted firm accusing the latter of fabricating and pasting labels on its bottles.        
	We were surprised about how the bottle went out of our shelf as it had not been marketed. We got the bottle inspected by our companys lawyers and technical personnel who found that there was overpasting on an existing label, Chauhan said.        
	Bisleri and Mt Everest have been fighting a case in Delhi High Court over the prominent use of the word Himalayas by the former.        
	Mt Everest, however, said it was Bisleri who had pasted the label over its own bottles.        
	During the last hearing on June 24, the Tatas pointed out that the contentious label was pasted over another by Bisleri under the instructions of its lawyers. The counsel for the defendants stated that they had advised their clients to paste the label over another, Mt Everest said in an affidavit.

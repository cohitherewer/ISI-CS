                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Realty braces for hard times 
          JAYATI GHOSE                      Shadowy prospect                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The financial turbulence in the US can lead to a slowdown in domestic real estate and force consolidation among smaller players.         
	Drying up of funds from global equity investors over the next few months because of the US financial crisis along with the tight liquidity situation in the domestic market will have a cascading effect on real estate, said Anuj Puri, chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, a global real estate consultancy firm.        
	According to industry players, the crisis will make it difficult for many to raise resources.         
	Projects which are in the planning or initial construction phase will see a correction. However, projects in the delivery stage will remain unaffected, Brijesh Bhanote, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Delhi-based real estate development firm Vipul Limited, told The Telegraph.        
	He said the crisis would not affect Vipuls residential projects because they were in the delivery stage. Moreover, its 18-storied commercial complex in Salt Lake is being funded by internal accruals.        
	Small developers who are unable to complete projects may resort to consolidation.        
	Small and medium-sized firms are placing their land banks on the block to counter the downside, Bhanote said.        
	Global consultancy firms have forecasted that the cancellation and postponement of expansion plans of companies could lead to oversupply in office space in Gurgaon, Bangalore and Pune. The rentals in these areas can drop 25 to 30 per cent in the next 12 months.        
	While metro cities are holding up at the moment, Tier II and Tier III cities, which had seen a slew of new developments, could see a drop in prices, Puri said.        
	According to a Ficci-Ernst amp; Young report, property prices in all cities have dropped 10-15 per cent in the past six months and the downward spiral is likely to continue.        
	According to analysts, prices have already dropped 15 -20 per cent in Tier II cities. There has been no price adjustment in Delhi and Mumbai.         
	Michael Jansen, CEO of Satellier  a global leader in real estate workshare services  feels funds from countries other than the US which are coming into India, will partially offset the impact of the financial crisis.

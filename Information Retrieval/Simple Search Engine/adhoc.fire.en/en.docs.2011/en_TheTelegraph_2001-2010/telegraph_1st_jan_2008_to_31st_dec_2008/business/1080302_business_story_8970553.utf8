	New Delhi, March 1: The Congress-led government plans to introduce a scheme to provide banks with equivalent liquidity to pay for the Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver announced in this years budget.         
	In an interview to The Telegraph here today, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, The last time the government announced a loan waiver, the bill was picked up by the next government .... we wont do any such thing. We will provide a scheme to provide equivalent liquidity for the banking system.         
	The last time the government had handed out bulk loan waivers was in 1990, when then deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal had announced a Rs 8,900-crore loan relief for farmers. The government then was headed by Prime Minister Chandrashekhar, but the tabs were picked up by the next Congress government. The delay had seen many banks taking a hit on their balancesheets and reporting losses.        
	Analysts say the government is likely to come up with a combination of bonds and other market instruments to pay the banks part of the money that will have to be written off.         
	Banks can absorb part of the loan waiver, which would have normally been written off as dead loans. The rest or bulk of the bills will probably be picked up by the government.         
	North Block officials said the Congress-led government could not spell out the details of the loan waiver package as it could lead to a privilege motion in Parliament.         
	The finance minister said the deadline to provide the loan relief is June-end so that farmers could access fresh loans for monsoon sowing. We must do it (loan writeoff) in time so that they (farmers) can get fresh loans for the kharif crop, Chidambaram said.         
	Political analysts yesterday speculated that the time limit was linked to the possibility of the government announcing elections ahead of schedule.         
	Though critics have labelled it as populist and election-oriented, Chidambaram asserted that he had presented a reformist budget. He pointed out that reforming personal taxation by changing slabs once in 10 years made sense. Once in 10 years if you adjust the tax slabs ... is it not the right thing to do? he said.        
	In 1997-98, the finance minister had presented what was then described a dream budget, slashing the maximum rate of income tax to 30 per cent and reducing corporate tax to 35 per cent.         
	This year, in a move which could help win votes among Indias growing urban middle class, Chidambaram increased the income tax exemption limit to Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 1.1 lakh and pushed upwards the income slabs on which variable personal taxes at the rate of 10, 20 and 30 per cent are calculated.        
	Analysts said during the last 10 years per capita income had more than doubled, giving room for a relook at tax slabs.        
	Chidambaram said that as tax compliance improves, there is a case for moderating tax rates. Tax players have been very obliging, they have paid more taxes.         
	In fact, this (changing the tax slabs) will bring me more revenues, he added.         
	Economic theory says that by cutting taxes, revenues actually increase as more people are eager to come clean on undeclared income and pay taxes.         
	However, Chidambaram said policy options suggested in the economic survey, were just an idea bank ... from which the government of the day picks up whatever can be done.         
	For example (from past suggestions) we picked up this year plans for launching smart cards (to deliver foodgrains under public distribution system) and that central public sector enterprises must be listed.         
	Smart cards to distribute cheap grains will be launched in Chandigarh and Haryana on a pilot basis, while the government has indicated it would offer five to ten per cent equity in state-run companies through public offerings.        
	The Left had seen red at the options which included opening up of retailing business to foreign investment, privatisation of coal mining and bringing more state-run companies to the stock market.

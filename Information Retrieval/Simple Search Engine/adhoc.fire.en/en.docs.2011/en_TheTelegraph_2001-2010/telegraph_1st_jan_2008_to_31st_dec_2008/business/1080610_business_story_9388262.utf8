          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                CALLS NO BAR      
	New Delhi, June 9: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) today slashed STD charges on its cellular and fixed line networks by up to 50 per cent.         
	The state-run telecom operators move follows similar tariff cuts by rival private sector players earlier.         
	The new tariff will be effective from Wednesday. Although BSNL had reduced the prices to retain its competitiveness with the private players, the tariff cut could prompt rivals to bring down prices further.        
	BSNL reduced rates for all STD calls from landlines to Rs 1.20 per minute from Rs 2.40 per minute. For rural customers, the company has slashed the STD rates to 0.80 paise per minute.         
	The STD charges for wireless services have been cut to Rs 1.20 per minute. The tariff has been brought down to Rs 1.20 per minute from Rs 2.20 per minute for calls made on the BSNL network, while call charges to other networks will cost Rs 1.20 per minute from Rs 2.40, BSNL chief managing director Kuldeep Goyal said.         
	This is not a question of being late, our tariffs will be a trend setter. May be they will bring about a further reduction in prices since we will offer the lowest STD tariffs now, he added.        
	In April, BSNL said it planned to add 33.5 million GSM wireless lines within a year to compete with private players. You should have capacity. Had I cut it earlier, it would not have been beneficial. Goyal said. BSNL had already ordered 25 million lines as part of its expansion project, and would start expanding in all its circles from July, he said.        
	BSNL has also reduced prices under pre-paid and post-paid services to bring them on par with private telecom firms .

          PIYA SINGH                                           AT A LOSS            
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: Kotak Securities, a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has initiated a round of salary cuts among the employees of its institutional equities team.         
	Kotak Institutional Equities, part of the stockbroking arm of the Kotak Mahindra group, is regarded as one of the leading institutional brokers in the country.         
	Members of this 60-plus team, including 26 analysts who offer secondary market-broking services and initial public offerings to domestic and foreign institutional investors, have been asked to accept a salary cut of 10 per cent.         
	It is not clear whether all team members have been asked to take a salary cut. However, sources said the move was likely to impact a large part of the team. In response to a questionnaire on the salary cuts, a Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said, Kotak does not comment on market speculation as a matter of policy.         
	Kotak Securities is one of the latest domestic brokerages to either reduce salaries or jobs as the deteriorating economic situation roils the countrys financial services industry.         
	Over the last two months, many frontline brokerages have announced several belt-tightening measures.         
	Motilal Securities cut salaries of some of its employees in the retail broking business by 10 to 20 per cent. So did retail broking house Sharekhan. Others domestic brokerages such as Edelweiss, Emkay and Prime Securities have had to announce layoffs.         
	What is probably more frightening is the possibility of worse news in the New Year, said an employee of a domestic brokerage on the condition of anonymity.         
	Several large overseas banks have started announcing another round of job cuts. Last week, Bank of America said it would be forced to cut another 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it tried to absorb Merrill Lynch.         
	While Bank of America is considered as one of the healthier banks in the US, several other big banks that received bailout loans from the government have also slashed jobs.         
	The picture is equally gloomy in Europe. Earlier this month, Credit Suisse announced that it was laying off 5,300 employees, or 11 per cent of its workforce.         
	Even Nomura Holdings plans to cut 1,000 jobs in London after its acquisition of some of the operations of Lehman Brothers.         
	These global moves may point to another round of job cuts in the banking and financial services sector in India, said a Mumbai-based banker.

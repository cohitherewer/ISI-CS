          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Manwani: Upbeat                                  
	Mumbai, April 4: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is exploring the possibility of developing some of its prime properties as well as selling some of them.        
	The properties include the one at Brookfields in Bangalore and those in Chennai, Mumbai and Kochi.        
	Chairman Harish Manwani today said at the companys annual general meeting that HUL was considering all aspects of the Brookfields property as well as its Mumbai realty.         
	He said HUL was mulling options of unlocking value, including disposing of or developing them.        
	The company is consolidating its operations at a new office in Andheri.         
	Temporarily, the foods division has shifted from Brookfields to the Unilever House in south Mumbai and next year all operations at Unilever House will move to Andheri.        
	Manwani said the company had no plans yet regarding the Unilever House.        
	We have a dedicated property division, which looks after these matters. We will do it if we need to unlock value from time to time. However, let me clarify that it will neither be a distress sale nor an opportunistic sale, he said.        
	Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch parent of HUL, has increased its stake in HUL to 52.12 per cent from 51.40 per cent through a buyback of shares.        
	Board recast        
	HUL today announced the appointment of D. Sundaram, director finance and IT, as its vice-chairman. Dhaval Buch, executive director supply chain will also be joining the companys board as a director.        
	Manwani, said, The appointments reflect our strong commitment towards leadership development and our tradition of leveraging experience and talent. quot;

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 12: The revised draft on market access for industrial goods and agricultural products prepared by the WTO has not gone down well with industry and trade analysts in India.        
	The WTO released fresh proposals for opening global markets to industrial products and reducing subsidies and tariffs in agricultural items in the run-up to the ministerial meeting on July 21 for resolving the Doha stalemate.        
	However, while the Indian government is still examining the fineprints of the draft released by the negotiating groups on agricultural and non-agricultural market access (Nama), industry chambers have expressed concern over certain provisions in the new proposal.        
	Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the anti-concentration clause in the Nama draft would put restrictions on developing countries. Such undue restrictive clauses disregard the realities and sensitivities of Indian industry, he said.        
	Mitra said the new draft continued to create artificial division among developing countries. Any additional flexibility cannot be provided to one or two particular members, they should be multi-lateral, he added.        
	The anti-concentration clause cripples the ability of a developing nation to provide tariff protection to a set of industries within the overall limit that will be provided under the agreement.        
	There are certain clauses in the new text which would put sensitive industrial sectors in India at risk, said R. Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, WTO and trade agreement committee.        
	Gopalakrishnan is also not in favour of including negotiations on remanufactured goods in the main Nama text. He said special safeguard mechanism in the agriculture text needed to be addressed according to the needs of the developing countries.        
	The draft on agriculture gives a maximum tariff protection of 25 per cent, under the special safeguard mechanism, in case the volume of imports exceeds 110 per cent.        
	The protection can go up to 50 per cent if imports gallop to 135 per cent. India and other developing countries with interests in agriculture may not find themselves comfortable with these proposals, experts said.        
	The Group of 20, which includes India and Brazil, has been mounting pressure on developed countries to cut their trade distorting farm subsidies substantially.

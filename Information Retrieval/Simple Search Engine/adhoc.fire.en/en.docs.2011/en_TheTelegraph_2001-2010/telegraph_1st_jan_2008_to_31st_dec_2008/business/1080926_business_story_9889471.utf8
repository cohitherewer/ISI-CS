	Mumbai, Sept. 25 (PTI): Tata Motors today sold a 1.36 per cent stake in Tata Steel to the groups holding company Tata Sons for Rs 485.57 crore in an open-market transaction.        
	A Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed the deal and said, Besides the rights issue, as announced on August 20, Tata Motors intends to monetise part of the companys investments through a phased divestment of certain investments (preferably as inter-group sales wherever feasible) at prevailing market prices over the next six to eight months.        
	Tata Motors sold a little over one crore shares of Tata Steel at Rs 485.70 and Rs 485.40 per share in two bulk deals on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The total consideration of the deals was Rs 485.57 crore.        
	The funds released from such future divestments together with those already sold during the current fiscal, will form part of the resources to be raised for repaying the bridge loan taken for the Jaguar-Land Rover acquisition, the spokesperson said.        
	Todays sale is part of this plan, he said.        
	At the end of the June quarter, Tata Motors held a 4.30 per cent stake, or 3.14 crore shares, in Tata Steel, according to shareholding information available on the BSE. Tata Sons held a 27.90 per cent stake in Tata Steel at the end of the June quarter.        
	Shares of Tata Steel closed 0.13 per cent lower at Rs 485.05, while Tata Motors settled 1.03 per cent down at Rs 383.95 on the BSE.

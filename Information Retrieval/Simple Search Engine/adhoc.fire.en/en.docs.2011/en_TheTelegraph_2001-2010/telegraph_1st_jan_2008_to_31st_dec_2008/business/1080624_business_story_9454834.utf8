	The board approved the audited results of the last fiscal. GAIL reported a turnover of Rs 18,008 crore in the last fiscal, which excludes internal consumption and excise duty. Turnover in the last 10 years has shown a compounded annual growth rate of 13 percent.         
	Profit after tax was Rs 2,601 crore. The board has recommended a dividend at the rate of 100 per cent on the paid-up share capital for the last fiscal.        
	The market capitalisation of the company by the end of March was at around Rs 35,000 crore against Rs 22,372 crore a year ago. Earning per share increased to Rs 30.76.

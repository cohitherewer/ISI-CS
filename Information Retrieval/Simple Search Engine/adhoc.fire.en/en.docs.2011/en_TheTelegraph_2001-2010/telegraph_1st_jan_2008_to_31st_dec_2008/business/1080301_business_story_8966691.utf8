The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Players in arbitrage market set to suffer
                                                                                                               Players in arbitrage market set to suffer

	The hike in short-term capital gains tax from 10 per cent to 15 per cent will have an impact on institutional and high net worth individuals.        
	The impact might not be very significant because investors would now try to hold on to their investments for a longer term going forward. But, capital gains tax being part of service tax, the overall transaction cost will certainly go up due to this hike. From the capital market point of view, the hike will have its biggest impact on people who are playing in the arbitrage market.         
	From the point of economics, I would call the budget a fairly balanced one. The reduction in excise duty on small cars, two-wheelers and three-wheelers from 16 per cent to 12 per cent, on pharmaceutical goods from 16 per cent to 8 per cent will reduce the cost of such consumer products.        
	The finance minister also proposed to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to nil on a few items, including composting machines, wireless data cards, packaged coconut water, tea and coffee mixes, and puffed rice. These measures will eventually lead to growth in consumption demand and reduce inflation further.         
	On the flip side, the finance ministers proposal to increase the excise duty on packaged software from 8 per cent to 12 per cent to bring it on a par with customised software, which will attract a service tax of 12 per cent, will have a short to medium-term impact on IT and technology stocks. However, this may be offset through consumers buying power.         
	The budget is particularly positive for banks because they will be reimbursed (over a period of three years) the Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver granted to farmers.         
	This move could help PSU and scheduled banks to actually convert some portion of their non-performing assets (NPAs) to performing assets, without affecting their surplus.         
	When it comes to the equity market, I dont think the budget will have any long-term impact. Going forward, the stock market will be governed by the global markets and the upcoming fourth quarter results.                                      
	Overall, the budget has been good, but I wish the surcharge could gave been removed from the corporate tax, as we have already seen a significant rise in corporate tax revenues. Furthermore, there should have been a more aggressive focus on infrastructure growth to support Indias economy.

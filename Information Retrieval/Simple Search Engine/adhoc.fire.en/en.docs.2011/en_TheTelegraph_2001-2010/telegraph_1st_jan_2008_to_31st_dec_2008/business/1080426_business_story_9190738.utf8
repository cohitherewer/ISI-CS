          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, April 25: Bharti Airtels net profit jumped 54 per cent to Rs 6,244 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 4,033 crore in 2006-07. However, the company also reported a mark-to-market derivative loss of about Rs 204 crore for the year  one of the highest till date.         
	Total income according to Indian GAAP increased 45 per cent to Rs 25,939 crore from Rs 17,887 crore last year.        
	The Indian telecom story is now entering the second wave of growth, which will come from rural India, chairman and managing director Sunil Mittal said.        
	We see another year of strong demand in all business segments, including a foray into Sri Lanka and the launch of direct-to-home satellite television, he added.        
	On the derivative loss, Sarvjit Dhillon, chief financial officer of Bharti Airtel, said: Under US GAAP we do report mark-to-market derivative changes from quarter to quarter. But thats not unusual.        
	Bharti shares today soared to an intra-day high of Rs 940 before closing at Rs 925.30, amid reports that it was planning to bid for South African telecom group MTN.         
	However, Mittal said the speculation is unwarranted, while adding that Bharti was always open to acquisitions. MTNs market capitalisation is around $33 billion.        
	The company will spend about $3.4 billion in 2008-09 to expand its network, said Dhillon. It expects strong growth from smaller towns and villages. More than 55 per cent of the net additions are coming from rural areas. That makes it a sustainable story, joint managing director Akhil Gupta said.        
	Bharti also expects to lure high-revenue customers from other operators when number-portability is allowed later this year.        
	Bharti, which had almost 62 million mobile subscribers by end-March, added 6.8 million subscribers in the March quarter and said its user base rose 67 per cent from a year earlier.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Retail FDI still a distant dream
                                                                                                               Retail FDI still a distant dream
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 14: The government today said there were no immediate plans to open up the retail sector to foreign direct investment (FDI).        
	There is no proposal to allow FDI in retail (and) the government is not thinking of it because it wants to protect the interests of (small) retailers, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told the Rajya Sabha.         
	Pawars statements come in the backdrop of the Economic Survey calling for opening up retail trade to FDI.        
	He said the report of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (Icrier) on the impact of domestic organised retail on unorganised retail would be submitted by May.        
	Though the report was due in July 2007, Icrier sought more time to do some additional surveys. Pawar said the Centre did not regulate the trade, which fell under the jurisdiction of the state governments.         
	State governments can allow or disallow the setting up of retail establishments.        
	The opening up of retail is facing stiff opposition from political parties as it may adversely impact the 1.3 crore small retailers in the country.         
	Indian laws allow 51 per cent FDI for single brand retail, while 100 per cent FDI is for the cash-and-carry business.         
	Global giants such as Wal-Mart and Metro Cash amp; Carry have entered through the 100 per cent FDI route, while Carrefour is planning a foray.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          L.N. Mittal: Moving ahead                                  
	Calcutta, July 4: Lakshmi Niwas Mittal moved a step closer to strike the first ever publicly known business transaction with brother Pramod since the two parted ways in the mid-nineties, when he agreed to supply raw material to Kremikovtzi AD today.        
	ArcelorMittal is one of the two suitors for the ailing Bulgaria plant owned by Pramod Mittal. Ukrainian billionaire Kostyantin Zhevago is the other bidder.        
	Kremikovtzi, facing bankruptcy, is in dire need of cash to modernise its facilities. It also needs funds for environmental upgradation to meet European standards. The Bulgarian government, which owns a strategic stake in the countrys largest steel mill, has decided to bring in a new owner following intense pressure from the labour union to remove Pramod Mittal from ownership.        
	Observers believe LNM is now clearly the frontrunner in buying the plant after the deal was announced today.        
	The development comes weeks after ArcelorMittal extended a $47-million loan to Kremikovtzi AD to meet its immediate needs such as salary payments.        
	According to the agreement inked today, ArcelorMittal will provide raw materials to Kremikovtzi and help improve its productivity.        
	This co-operation has a possibility to lead to investments in the future. This will provide a long-term viability to the plant, Kremikovtzi said in a statement.        
	Initially, steel production will be kept at 60,000 tonnes per month, the company added, but declined to provide details on the amount of steel to be produced under the agreement, or the tenure of the contract.         
	Under the deal, Kremikovtzi will market the produce but the revenue will go to ArcelorMittal. This arrangement will also increase productivity of the 2.2-million-tonne plant. Sources said this was the first step for LNM to manage the show at Kremikovtzi.         
	Though a bankruptcy proceeding is on in a Bulgarian court, the odds will be in favour of ArcelorMittal since it has already started working on the steel mills revival.        
	ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel producer, had earlier said it would invest $500 million euros over the next four years in the plant, that indirectly supports 100,000 people, if it acquired the company.        
	Pramod Mittals Global Steel Holding, which owns Indias Ispat Industries, bought a 71 per cent stake of Kremikovtzi in 2005. The Bulgarian government holds a 25 per cent stake.

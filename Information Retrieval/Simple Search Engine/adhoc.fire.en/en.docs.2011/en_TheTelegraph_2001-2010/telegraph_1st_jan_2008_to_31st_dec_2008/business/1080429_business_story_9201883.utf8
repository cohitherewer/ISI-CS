          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Sanjiv Goenka: Glad tidings		    
	Calcutta, April 28: Power utility CESC is expected to achieve financial closure of its proposed Haldia plant in the next 6 months.        
	The flagship of RPG Enterprises hopes to complete work in the first phase of the 600MW plant within the next three years. Sanjiv Goenka, vice- chairman of the group, said land had been acquired for the first phase. It would entail an investment of Rs 2,500 crore.        
	The company is now executing a 250MW expansion at Budge Budge.        
	The third unit is likely to be commissioned by September 2009, which will improve the power situation in the city and the suburbs. There had been an unprecedented rise in demand for power in Bengal and Calcutta, which was anticipated neither by government power agencies nor the private operators.        
	This has led to severe power shortage. CESC is ready to buy power at any price but nothing is available.        
	CESC has spent Rs 600 crore in the last 18 months to improve transmission and distribution network in Calcutta. It will spend another Rs 300 crore this year to take more load.        
	Besides Haldia, CESC is pursuing two more projects in Orissa and Jharkhand. The projects will be financed through debt and equity. The strong cash flow generated by the company during the last fiscal will help CESC pursue new projects with confidence.        
	Its income in fourth quarter ended March 2008 grew 18.4 per cent to Rs 680 crore while profit increased 41 per cent to Rs 86 crore. For the full year, income grew 12.4 per cent to Rs 2,898 crore while profit increased 17.6 per cent to Rs 354 crore.

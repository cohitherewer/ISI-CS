	New Delhi, Sept. 28: The Congress-led government will go ahead with its plan to merge more state-run banks but will insist on adherence to prudential norms.         
	Following the collapse of a bank of the size of Washington Mutual because of the sub-prime crisis in the US, the finance ministry would like the pros and cons of a merger evaluated more minutely before giving permission to state-run banks.         
	Officials said the idea was that in no way should a weaker entity emerge from a merger between a weaker bank and a stronger one.        
	The countrys largest banker, the State Bank of India (SBI), has recently merged the State Bank of Saurashtra into itself. The SBI is likely to merge more of its unlisted subsidiaries with itself.         
	However, the next round of such mergers may not happen in this calendar year. The government would like to assess the cost and the benefit of the exercise before going ahead with merging the state banks of Hyderabad, Patiala and Indore with their principal (SBI).         
	The government as well as the bankers are waking up to the fact that merely creating large entities may not help Indian banks face competition from global rivals. Washington Mutual had about 2,300 branches and $182 billion of customer deposits at the end of June this year. JPMorgan Chase amp; Co picked up the bank after its failure for a mere $1.9 billion.         
	Naturally such figures are sobering facts, admitted the officials. The SBI has deposits of $126 billion, in comparison. Banking division officials argue that Indian banks have been following far stricter prudential norms and are unlikely to be in similar trouble.         
	However, growth in real estate and housing loans, which occurred in the last four years, is worrisome, and any downturn in the housing market can cause problems for some banks.         
	We have been monitoring both the loan portfolio of banks and the possible future NPA rate and feel we have no cause for alarm, the officials said. However, these two factors are likely to be looked at more closely whenever studying proposals for mergers.

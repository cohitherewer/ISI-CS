                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil bailout balance still elusive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Seeking solution                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: The crude crisis today took oil minister Murli Deora first to finance minister P. Chidambaram and then to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the government continued to juggle with remedies for the beleaguered state-owned oil marketing companies.        
	With the global price of crude crackling above $130 per barrel, the companies are expected to lose about Rs 2,25,000 crore this fiscal for selling fuels at a discount. A bail-out package comprising more oil bonds, cuts in taxes and a marginal increase in the petrol price is under consideration.        
	Since the finance ministry is harping on revenue neutral measures, Deora has suggested a cess on income tax and corporate tax.        
	Officials, however, said the cess on income and corporate taxes had not found much favour as it would be difficult to push the proposal politically.         
	The Left has already lashed out at the proposal, with RSP leader Abani Roy calling it a retrograde measure, which will hurt only the common man.         
	The petroleum ministry has calculated that if a 3 per cent cess on income tax and corporate tax is imposed, it will generate around Rs 10,500 crore. Deora, who is seeking a reduction in the import duty on crude from five to zero per cent, suggested the cess as a revenue neutral measure.        
	Deora met Singh in the evening to find an early solution to the oil crisis. We dont want to see scarcity of petroleum products, particularly kerosene and LPG. Oil companies are in a precarious state and we need to find solutions urgently, he said.        
	The minister, according to sources, told the Prime Minister that oil companies would lose Rs 2,25,000 crore in revenues this fiscal, and the situation called for an immediate increase in retail fuel prices. His talks with Singh followed a meeting with Chidambaram in the morning, where he failed to convince the finance minister on the urgency of a cut in import and excise duties.        
	S. Sundareshan, additional secretary in the petroleum ministry, said oil companies could not wait for another week for a decision on the bail-out package. We are hopeful that a decision will be taken soon. The crisis needs to be defused at the earliest.

                                                                                                               Paswan pushes for curb on ore exports
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Paswan: Tough stand                                  
	New Delhi, March 14: The government today said it was planning to restrict the export of iron ore and told steel producers to reduce prices.        
	The country aims to more than double steel capacity to 124 million tonnes by 2012 and must curb ore exports to meet the target, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said in the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Steel makers are lobbying the government for a ban on the export of ore, the price of which has been soaring in recent times.        
	India has 25 billion tonnes of ore reserves, with 4 per cent being high quality ore, Paswan said.         
	It is my view that the export of high-grade ore should be allowed only after meeting domestic requirements. he added.        
	He said domestic steel consumption growth was expected to be 13 per cent this year, while production was increasing at only 5.5 per cent.        
	In 2006-07, the steel industry consumed about 68 million tonnes of iron ore, while 94 million tonnes were exported.        
	Steel price         
	The government today asked steel producers to cut prices. I am concerned that steel producers have raised prices, Paswan said.        
	He said he had held a meeting with the producers on March 1 soon after the budget and told them not to increase prices. (But) steel prices have increased. It is a matter of concern.         
	Last week, the producers raised prices by Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000 a tonne for long products, which are used in the construction industry.         
	For flat products, which go into consumer durables and automobiles, the increase was Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 a tonne.         
	He said some producers had raised the prices of finished steel products more than the rise in raw material costs. I once again ask them to voluntarily reduce prices.         
	Though the government has reduced the taxes on steel, the prices of raw materials have shot up, Paswan said.        
	The price of coking coal has risen 73 per cent, iron ore, 133 per cent, shredded scrap, 29.4 per cent and sponge iron, 22.1 per cent.

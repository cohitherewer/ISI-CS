          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CALL COUNTER                                  
	New Delhi, July 18: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has agreed to the proposal of the department of telecommunications (DoT) to increase spectrum fees for cellular operators.        
	Telecom operators pay the government a percentage of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as a spectrum fee.        
	The DoT has proposed an increase of 1 per cent of AGR across the board. For telecom operators holding 10 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum, the DoT had proposed 6 per cent of an operators revenue as the fee. Trai wants this to be increased to only 5 per cent. At present, an operator holding 10 Mhz pays 4 per cent of its revenue to the government as a spectrum fee.         
	Trai had earlier said that the spectrum fee should be increased if operators held more than 10 Mhz in a circle. However, the DoT has hiked the fees across all slabs, from 4.4 Mhz to 15 Mhz.        
	Trai had also suggested that the DoT could start levying a one-time spectrum fee on all operators who wanted more than 10 Mhz. This meant an operator in Mumbai, Delhi or Category A service areas would have to pay Rs 16 crore for each megahertz allocated beyond 10 Mhz. Trai feels the proposed hike in charges will lead to an additional payment of Rs 1,000 crore by the operators.        
	Sarin backs auction         
	Arun Sarin, the outgoing CEO of UK-based Vodafone Group, today said he favoured the auction route for spectrum allocation.         
	Auctions are always a good way because spectrum is a scarce resource and the government should get the highest value for radiowaves (spectrum), Sarin said. He also asked the government to formulate long-term policies.

	Calcutta, May 16: Tea prices have shot up to Rs 72 per kg in the first four months of this year, the highest in almost a decade.        
	Since touching Rs 78 in 1998-99, the industry went through a prolonged phase of low prices, made worse by escalating costs.        
	According to auctioneer J Thomas, the average price of north Indian tea in the first four months of the current year has been around Rs 72 per kg.        
	The start of the year has been good and it seems like tea prices are in the process of a correction. These dismally low prices (of the last 10 years) were divorced from rising inflation and the commodity price trend, said Amit Chowdhuri, chairman and managing director of J Thomas.        
	The price recovery comes at a time when the industry, like many others, has been under the shadow of rupee appreciation, with export falling 28 per cent last year.         
	One reason for the recovery is the low stock that was carried forward from the previous season.         
	Besides, consumption in the country is growing at 3.5 per cent, pushing up prices. The per capita consumption has been increasing steadily and is expected to go up to 711 gram from 696 gram last year.         
	More tea is also being routed through auctions, leading to better realisation of prices.

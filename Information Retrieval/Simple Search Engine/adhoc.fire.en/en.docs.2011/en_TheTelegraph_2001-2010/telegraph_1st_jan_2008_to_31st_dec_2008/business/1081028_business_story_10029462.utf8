	The bank today said its UK subsidiary had registered a $35 million (Rs 160 crore) net loss for the half year ended September 30 on account of higher provisioning in its investments abroad.

	Net interest income grew 20 per cent to Rs 2,148 crore from Rs 1,786 crore. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned and interest paid.

	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The government has cancelled exploration licences for 166 coal blocks as the entities with exploration rights have failed to start work.        
	We have cancelled licences for coal linkages to power generators of 22,000 megawatt capacity for the Eleventh Plan Period as they failed to explore coal either on their own or through joint ventures with Coal India, minister of state for coal Santosh Bagrodia said today. The decision, however, is yet to be notified.        
	The ministry had allotted 180 blocks in the last two years, of which only 14 had become operational.         
	The remaining blocks are still unexplored which shows the reluctance among companies to undertake exploration. Therefore, the government has decided to cancel their licences, said Bagrodia.         
	Coal output for this fiscal will be around 515 million tonnes (mt), with public sector Coal India Limiteds share being over 480 mt. Import for the year will be around 31 mt.

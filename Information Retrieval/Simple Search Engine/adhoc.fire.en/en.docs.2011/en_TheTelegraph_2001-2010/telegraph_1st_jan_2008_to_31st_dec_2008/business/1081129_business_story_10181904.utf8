          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The government today asked the directorate general of shipping to undertake a special audit of security in all the major ports of the country.         
	In an emergency meeting called by shipping minister T.R. Baalu following the terror attacks in Mumbai, the port authorities were asked to take immediate steps to acquire at least two speed boats for patrolling.         
	The terrorists in Mumbai reportedly came by rubber boats from the sea.        
	The meeting decided that ports should immediately send security requisitions to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which protects the countrys vital economic installations.        
	The CISF should inspect all security equipment, including CCTVs, and advise any changes.        
	In addition, the CISF should deploy a marine commando unit in every port and raise bomb disposal and dog squads for each port.         
	The meeting was attended by the representatives of the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, CISF, home ministry and the port chairmen.        
	The government also decided to authorise the coast guard to check all suspicious merchant vessels prior to their arrival at the ports.        
	Baalu said the directorate general of shipping would request the Indian Space Research Organisation to expedite its project to design a low-cost boat tracking system for fishing vessels.         
	To keep a watch on their movements, trucks entering ports should have vehicle tracking systems.

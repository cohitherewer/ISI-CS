	Mumbai, March 8: J.P. Chalasani has taken over as chief executive officer of Reliance Power Ltd. He was formerly the whole-time business development director of Reliance Energy Ltd.         
	Chalasani has resigned from the Reliance Energy board with effect from March 7. He joined the Reliance group in 1995 and has over 27 years of experience in the power sector.         
	He was earlier with the National Thermal Power Corporation of India (NTPC). Commissioning the 2100MW Ramagundam thermal power station, the largest thermal power project at the time, was a key highlight of his over 15-year stint with NTPC. He has handled various assignments for Reliance ADA Group, including the successful bidding for two ultra-mega power projects. Reliance Power is the flagship company of Reliance ADA Group, which will develop, construct and operate power generation projects.

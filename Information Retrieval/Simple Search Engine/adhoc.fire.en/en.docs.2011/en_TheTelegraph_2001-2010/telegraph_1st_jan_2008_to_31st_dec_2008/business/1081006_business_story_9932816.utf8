                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Investor wealth takes a hard knock

	Calcutta, Oct. 5: Investor wealth in domestic bourses eroded by more than Rs 1,800,000 crore between February and October 3.         
	The total market capitalisation of over 4,900 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) slipped below $1 trillion (approximately Rs 4,500,000 crore) last month because of the global financial turmoil that saw foreign institutional capital being withdrawn from the domestic markets. A thousand billion makes a trillion.        
	The BSE, which accounts for about 75 per cent of market capitalisation of all listed companies in the country, surpassed the $1-trillion mark in June 2007 and remained steady at this level till August this year amidst a sustained outflow of foreign institutional investment.         
	Net FII outflow in this calendar year till August end was Rs 28,513.60 crore  the highest monthly net outflow was Rs 13,035.70 crore in January followed by Rs 10,095.80 crore in June.         
	The BSEs market capitalisation in January and June remained at $1.47 trillion and $1.02 trillion, respectively.         
	However, since the beginning of September, the news of investment banking giants such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley going belly up sent share prices across the globe, including India, on a free fall.         
	The withdrawal of foreign institutional investment from the country also gathered pace  in September FIIs sold shares worth Rs 8,278.10 crore on a net basis compared with Rs 1,211.70 crore in August and Rs 1,836.80 crore in July.         
	Total market capitalisation on the BSE on October 3 fell to $864.30 billion because of a more than 6 per cent depreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar in September.        
	While all the global stock exchanges suffered losses in market capitalisation, the BSE lost more than most of its peers (see chart).

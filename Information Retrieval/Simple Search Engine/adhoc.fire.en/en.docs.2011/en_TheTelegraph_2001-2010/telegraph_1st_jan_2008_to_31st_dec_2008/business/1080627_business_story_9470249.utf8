          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, June 26: Essar Steel has withdrawn its $1.2-billion bid to acquire American steel firm Esmark as rival suitor Severstal of Russia made a higher offer to clinch the deal.        
	The Moscow-headquartered company came up with a $19.25 a share offer late last night, trumping Essars $19 per share bid for Esmark. The deadline for submission of bids was to end today.        
	Esmark said in a statement that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Severstal for $19.25 per share.        
	Essar said its offer reflected full and fair value for the US steel maker and, therefore, it would not go ahead further.        
	The continuous support of the Esmark union  United Steel Works (USW)  for the Severstal bid and its opposition to the Essar offer have also been cited by the Indian company as reasons for pulling out of the race.        
	Essar, however, vowed to continue with its merger and acquisition drive and focus on the north American market.        
	In a statement, Shashi Ruia, chairman of Essar Steel Holdings, said the company remained committed to step up capacity to 25 million tonnes by 2012 despite todays development.        
	Essar was keen on the Esmark acquisition as it would have given a fillip to its north American business. Only last year, Essar had acquired Algoma Steel in Canada and Minnesota Steel in the US.        
	On April 30 this year, Essar had entered into a memorandum of agreement with Esmark. The Indian steel firm had offered to pay $17 a share to acquire the American steel firm.         
	According to a pact with the Esmark management, the USW had the option to bring in any other suitor interested in the American steel firm. The labour union found that Severstal was interested in the Wheeling, West Virginia based company, which has a 2.4-million-tonne steel plant and service centres across the US.        
	Backed by the USW, Severstal, owned by Alexei Mordashov, made a matching offer of $17 a share for Esmark.         
	Stung by the competition, Essar upped its bid to $19 per share bid for the loss-making company.         
	The Esmark board had recommended the Essar offer and termed Severstal bid as inadequate.         
	Enraged by the American companys stand, the Russian company had accused Esmark of favouring Essar.        
	The matter then went to an independent arbitrator who had set aside Essars bid, saying that the target company (Esmark) did not inform the workers union sufficiently in advance about the deal.

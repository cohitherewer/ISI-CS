	Calcutta, Aug. 28: Ispat Industries Ltd expects to use iron ore and coal from its captive mines in its steel operations at Dolvi, near Mumbai, within the next two to three years. This will reduce its reliance on the open market for securing the supply of the key inputs.        
	We have now ensured raw material availability. It was a big question, Pramod Mittal, chairman of Ispat Industries, said here today.        
	Ispat has been allotted a coking coal block in Madhya Pradesh with reserves of 70 million tonnes (mt) and an iron ore mine with reserves of 80-120mt near Nagpur.        
	The company has also secured an iron ore block in Brazil with an estimated reserve of 300-500mt. Ispat has a 40 per cent stake in the venture, while the rest is equally divided between the promoter group company and a local partner.        
	In Columbia, Ispat has a 40 per cent stake in a coal mine, which has about 70mt reserves.        
	We have joined hands with international players to develop the mines. After initial studies, we will have a better idea of the reserves, Mittal said.        
	At present, Ispat depends on market purchases for raw materials. After the Centre put a leash on steel prices to tame inflation, the company is suffering a crunch in margins.        
	Once it starts using captive raw materials, profitability will improve. The company has not given dividend for years.        
	Apart from mining, the company has taken up three projects involving an investment of Rs 3,200 crore. A power project, which is expected to reduce energy cost by 30 per cent, has achieved financial closure. A pellet plant and a coke oven unit are being pursued to keep a check on raw material cost.        
	We will finalise the pellet plant and the coke oven project soon. Its in a complex and 90 per cent of land is with us. We are doing financial closure, Mittal said on the sidelines of the 23rd annual general meeting of Ispat here today.        
	Ispat has managed to secure additional gas to fire its sponge iron plant at Dolvi, which will help the company in saving Rs 250 crore annually.        
	It will now buy gas from Shells liquefied natural gas plant at Hazira.

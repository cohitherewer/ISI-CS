	Mumbai, Sept. 17: Morgan Stanley is selling.        
	The investment bank, whose Wall Street peers  Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch  bit the dust earlier this week, offloaded stakes in as many as seven companies on the Indian bourses.        
	Educomp Solutions, Gujarat NRE Coke, Jindal SAW, Opto Circuits, Pantaloon Retail, United Spirits and Subhash Projects were the seven companies in which block deals were seen involving Morgan Stanley.        
	The firm sold over five lakh shares of Educomp Solutions, 17 lakh shares of Jindal SAW, 18 lakh shares of Gujarat NRE Coke, 7.5 lakh shares of Opto Circuits and over 57 lakh shares of Pantaloon Retail. In most of the deals, Deutsche Securities was the buyer.        
	These sales came on a day when the benchmark sensex ended lower by 256 points to a two-month low of 13262.90. There rupee bounced back to end stronger by 55 paise at 46.35 against the dollar. In the world markets, crude oil was trading higher at $93.37 per barrel at 13.43 GMT.        
	Merger option        
	Morgan is weighing whether it should remain independent or merge with a bank, given the recent turbulence in the companys share price, a TV channel reported on Wednesday.        
	Senior people at Morgan concede that further zigzags in the companys stock price could and possibly will force the company to change course and seek a merger partner, probably a well capitalised bank, CNBC said.        
	As uncertainty prevails in financial markets, UK media reports said British bank Lloyds TSB was in an advanced stage of talks to buy UKs troubled mortgage lender HBOS, to create a retail banking giant worth 30 billion.

	New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has warned that falling food prices and reduced access to credit are likely to hit agricultural production and threaten global food security.        
	In a report on global food security, the FAO said that the matter of greater concern was the availability of credit in the wake of the global financial crisis.         
	Countries and investors should be firm in meeting their commitments to agricultural development. It would buffer and help cushion greater losses incurred in the other sectors of the economy, the FAO said.         
	The channels through which agricultural markets will be affected are on both the demand and supply sides. In addition to the direct impact of slower growth, the prevailing uncertainty and consequent negative expectations could further dampen demand.

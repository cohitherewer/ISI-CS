	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Inflation dropped to a seven-month low of 8 per cent for the week ended November 29 because of cheaper food items.         
	However, infrastructure growth fell to 3.4 per cent in October compared with 4.6 per cent a year ago and 4.8 per cent in September 2008. Infrastructure accounts for 26.7 per cent of industry output. In 2007-08, it grew 5.6 per cent.        
	Analysts said inflation, which peaked at 12.91 per cent in early August, would fall further as commodity prices weaken and manufacturers weigh price cuts in a slowing economy. We expect March-end inflation to be around 1.75-2 per cent, said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank.         
	The index for primary articles declined 0.2 per cent from the previous week, with the prices of fruits, vegetables, barley and gram falling. Unrefined oil, gur, rapeseed and mustard oil became cheaper. Cement prices fell, while the index for fuel and lubricants remained unchanged.

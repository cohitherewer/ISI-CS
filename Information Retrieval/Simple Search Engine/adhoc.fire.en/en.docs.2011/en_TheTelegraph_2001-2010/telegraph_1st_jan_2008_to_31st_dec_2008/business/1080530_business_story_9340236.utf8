          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 29: The impasse over BlackBerrys message encryption keys continues with the government and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) failing to arrive at a solution today.        
	At a meeting of officials of the department of telecommunications and intelligence agencies as well as the representatives of Canada-based RIM here today, various options were discussed that would allow the agencies to monitor the messages sent between two BlackBerrys without compromising data security.        
	However, officials said RIM today refused to share translation codes with the government.         
	Earlier, it was reported that RIM was considering giving access to individual users email to the government on condition that the latter took responsibility of any information leak.         
	RIM is now also not willing to locate a full-fledged server in India in the near future, which would have allowed security agencies to monitor traffic at the gateway without having to break into BlackBerrys secure transmission codes, said officials.         
	According to industry estimates, a server will cost $500,000. BlackBerry sends data in a coded form using an advanced encryption technology.

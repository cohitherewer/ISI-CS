	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The government today announced a 4 per cent cut in central value- added tax (cenvat) as part of an economic stimulus package, which earmarks an additional Rs 20,000 crore for infrastructure, industry and exports.        
	Involving an estimated revenue loss of Rs 8,700 crore in the next four months, the package seeks to revive the crucial housing, export, automobile, textile and small-and- medium enterprise segments to counter the economic slowdown caused by the global financial crisis.        
	The three slabs of excise duty  14 per cent, 12 per cent and 8 per cent  applicable to non-petroleum products have been reduced by 4 per cent each, an official release said today. The revised rates will be 10 per cent, 8 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.        
	Power firms have got relief in the form of full exemption from basic customs duty on naphtha. The exemption is effective till March 31, 2009.         
	In iron ore fines, the 8 per cent export duty has been withdrawn. The levy on the export of iron-ore lumps has been slashed to 5 per cent from 15 per cent.        
	The iron ore industry had witnessed a waning demand, with prices declining up to 60 per cent. Prices of fines had touched a peak of $143 a tonne in June this year and are now hovering around $50 per tonne.        
	The domestic steel industry gave a thumbs-up to the reduction in cenvat and said that the benefits would be passed on to the final user. It is a welcome move. With the lowering of the excise duty, steel prices will automatically get lower (stimulating more demand for the commodity), said S.K. Roongta, chairman of Steel Authority of India Ltd.        
	Steel products are priced between Rs 28,000 a tonne and 40,000 a tonne in the domestic market, depending upon the quality and the extent of value addition. The lowering of the duty by 4 per cent will make the products cheaper by at least Rs 1,000.         
	Steel companies see prices stabilising in the near future. However, they do not rule out a further correction in rates following Chinas move to scrap five per cent export duty.        
	Giving details of the tax concessions, the official statement said that the ad valorem component of the excise duty on big cars has been reduced to 20 per cent from 24 per cent. For small cars, it has been reduced to 8 per cent from 12 per cent.         
	Providing impetus to the cement industry, the ad valorem rate of 12 per cent on cement has been reduced to 8 per cent. In addition, cenvat has been slashed to 10 per cent, or Rs 280 per 1,000 kilogram, whichever is higher.        
	The package also reduced the rate of duty on cotton textile and similar items from 4 per cent to zero.

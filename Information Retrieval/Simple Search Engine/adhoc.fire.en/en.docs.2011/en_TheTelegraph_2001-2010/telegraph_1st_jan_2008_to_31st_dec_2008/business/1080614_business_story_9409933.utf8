                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Esmark turns down Severstal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 13: The Esmark board has rejected Russian steel maker Severstals bid last night but it may still not be a smooth ride for Essar Steel.        
	While terming the Severstal offer as inadequate, the Esmark board kept the door open for higher bids from others, including the Russian company.        
	Industry observers believe the battle between the Indian and the Russian firms for the US asset will continue as Alexei Mordashov-owned Severstal is likely to strike back with a matching or higher bid.         
	A June 25 deadline has been set for companies keen to submit fresh bids.        
	We continue to invite bidders, including Severstal, to provide a superior proposal to that of Essar, James P. Bouchard, chairman and CEO of Esmark, said in statement.        
	The Esmark board had agreed to merge itself with Essar Steel Holdings Ltd, owned by the Ruia brothers  Shashi and Ravi  on April 30. Essar had offered to pay $17 per share valuing the deal at $1.1 billion.         
	It had also extended a $110-million loan to Esmark and proposed a $525-million capex for its Ohio and West Virginia manufacturing facilities over the next five years.        
	But the Indian companys plan was derailed when United Steel Works, the Esmark union, raised an objection to the offer.

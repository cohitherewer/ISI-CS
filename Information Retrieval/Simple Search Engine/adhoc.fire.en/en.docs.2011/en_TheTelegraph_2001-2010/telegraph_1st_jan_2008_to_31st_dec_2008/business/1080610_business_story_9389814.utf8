	New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): Three Indian cities  Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore  have been ranked among the 75 top centres of commerce in the world.        
	According to a study titled Mastercard worldwide centres of commerce index, London has been ranked as the most influential city in the world in the index of 75 cities.        
	However, the study stated that the future appeared to belong to Asia and eastern Europe, whose cities represent the fastest rising regions in the index.         
	The index is an annual research initiative designed to evaluate and rank how major cities compare in performing critical functions that connect markets and commerce around the world.        
	The booming Chinese and Indian economies have clearly continued the shift of economic power to Asia. The strong presence of Asia-Pacific, West Asia and Africa is further evidence of the growing influence of the regions not just in manufacturing and services, but also in commercial strength, the report stated.        
	Of the three Indian cities, Mumbai is at the 48th position, New Delhi is at 61 and Bangalore at 66.

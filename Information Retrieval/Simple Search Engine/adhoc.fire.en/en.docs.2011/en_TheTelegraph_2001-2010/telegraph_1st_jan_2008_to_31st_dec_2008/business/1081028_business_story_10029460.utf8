          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 27: The rupee hit a new low of 50.26 to the dollar today, before the RBIs rescue act helped it to close seven paise higher at 49.89.        
	Relentless selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) is taking a toll on the Indian currency, and observers believe that the worst is yet to come.        
	Kotak Mahindra Bank said the rupee could dip to the Rs 54-level by the year-end. Chetan Ahya, managing director of Morgan Stanley, said it could hit 54-55 in the next five to six months.         
	Starting at 50.08 to the dollar against Fridays close of 49.96, the rupee had to parry a selling onslaught from FIIs who were unwinding their positions in the stock markets.        
	The RBIs dollar sales through nationalised banks saw the rupee recover from the low of Rs 50.26. It ended an eight-day losing streak.         
	Crude recovers        
	Oil trimmed losses after sinking to a new 17-month low below $62 a barrel on Monday, driven down by investor pessimism about the deteriorating global economic climate and its likely impact on the demand for fuel.

	Mumbai, July 7 (PTI): The ministry of corporate affairs has asked market regulator Sebi to examine whether there are any conflicts of interest among sponsors of mutual funds, trustee companies and asset management companies (AMCs).        
	The ministry, taking cognizance of a representation made by a mutual fund industry expert Vijay Gokhale, has asked Sebi to examine the matter at the earliest.        
	Vijay Gokhale, in his representation to Sebi as well as the corporate affairs ministry, said many AMCs carried out practically all activities pertaining to the fund on behalf of the trustees and the AMC is virtually the face and mouthpiece of the fund.         
	He said there should be an arms-length relationship between a trustee company and an AMC. But that is not the case in many mutual funds.        
	Gokhale said many trustee companies did not have an independent place of business or staff of their own.        
	It is impossible to visualise how these trustees discharge various responsibilities without their own staff. It is feared that conflicts of interest occur in this informal arrangement creating great potential for abuse. This has been going on for years, Gokhales communique to Sebi said.        
	A P. Kurian, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds of India, however, maintained there was no conflict of interest in mutual funds.         
	When asked why many trustee companies did not have independent staff or office space, he said it was not needed.

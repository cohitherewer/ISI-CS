The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil windfall worry recedes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil windfall worry recedes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cause for concern                            
	New Delhi, July 7: The government is unlikely to go ahead with the windfall profit tax on oil exploration and production companies, which has been demanded by the Congresss friend-in-need, the Samajwadi Party.        
	There is no such proposal under the consideration of the government at present, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	On whether such a proposal could come up for consideration in the near future, the official said that the present government policy is not to impose any windfall profit tax on E amp;P (exploration and production) firms.        
	In letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has demanded a windfall profit tax of up to 50 per cent on oil companies, which will generate instantly over Rs 100,000 crore.        
	Similar demands were made by the Left parties before the government raised fuel prices last month.        
	The Samajwadi Party leader in his letter had made no mention of Reliance Industries, which had quickly got the status of an export-oriented unit (EOU) for its Jamnagar refinery on application in March 2007.         
	The Jamnagar refinery has to export 75 per cent of its output, while 25 per cent can be sold within the country. However, domestic sales are not viable as Reliance Industries does not get any government concession, which state-run oil marketing companies enjoy.        
	Analysts said all private exploration and production companies were in the preliminary stages of operation. Barring Cairn, no company produces oil in large quantities.         
	Such a tax will actually hurt Oil and Natural Gas Corporation  the leading exploration and production company in the public sector  the most.         
	For imposing such a tax, the oil hunt policy as well as the production sharing agreement signed till now for all oil and gas blocks will have to be changed, which could be challenged in the court.         
	Besides, the government has a profit share in all oil and gas blocks, the analysts said.        
	They said the government would not change the rules just to bring the Jamnagar refinery under the tax net as it would send a wrong signal to investors.        
	Officials, too, said the tax would merely act as a disincentive to export which various government committees have sought to encourage.        
	Analysts said the proposed tax was to be similar to the levy imposed on steel exports and basmati export  an attempt to get something out of the windfall which steel and rice companies are earning on account of a sudden surge in global commodity prices.

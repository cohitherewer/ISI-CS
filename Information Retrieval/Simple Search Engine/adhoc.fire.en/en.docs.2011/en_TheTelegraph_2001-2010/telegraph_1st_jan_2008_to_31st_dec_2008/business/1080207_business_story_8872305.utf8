          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ahluwalia in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Indians should invest in saving instruments such as insurance to meet emergencies, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the plan panel.        
	People do not plan rationally for exigencies. Contractual savings should be made compulsory in India, which has a high savings rate, he said.        
	While releasing a study on How India Earns, Spends and Saves, Singh said people should contribute to a pension fund, a provident fund, and a health insurance plan. The study by Max New York Life and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) found that Indians save but do not invest.         
	Rajesh Shukla, the author of the study, said, Almost 81 per cent of Indians save and the average savings are Rs 16,139 per annum. The high-income group saves 44 per cent of their income, graduate households save 30 per cent, non-graduate families save 18 per cent, salaried earners save 7 per cent and labour households save 4 per cent.        
	NCAER director-general Suman Berry said, In the absence of state-provided social security, Indians need to look at financial instruments to meet their old age needs.        
	The study found that households keep 65 per cent of their savings in liquid assets such as bank and post office deposits and cash at home, invest 23 per cent in physical assets such as real estate and gold and allot only 12 per cent for financial instruments. On spending patterns, the study found that expenses on food drop as households get richer.         
	Shukla said Indians were confident of their ability to live off their savings after retirement. Unfortunately, this optimism is not based on facts. Almost 96 per cent of households feel they cannot survive for more than one year on their current savings, he said.

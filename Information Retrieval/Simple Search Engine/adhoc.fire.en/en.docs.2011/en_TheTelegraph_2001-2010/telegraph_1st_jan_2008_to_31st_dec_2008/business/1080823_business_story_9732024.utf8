	Calcutta, Aug. 22: The Mahindra group will enter the retail arena this year with a pan-India rollout.

	We are creating our own brand. The retail chain will be rolled out very soon on a pan-India basis, Mahindra said. Bengal is a place where we surely want to be in, he said.         
	We are going on our own with the retail venture and are not partnering anyone, Mahindra said.        
	On the proposed World City project in Bengal, Mahindra said, Arun Nanda, the vice-president of our infrastructure business, has come here several times and met government officials. However, nothing has been finalised yet, Mahindra said.        
	World City is a subsidiary of real estate development arm Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd.

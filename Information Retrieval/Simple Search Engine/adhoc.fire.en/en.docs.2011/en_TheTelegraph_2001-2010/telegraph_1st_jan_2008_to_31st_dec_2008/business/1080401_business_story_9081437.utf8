The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lodha still has a long way to go
                                                                                                               Lodha still has a long way to go
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Calcutta, March 31: Rajendra Singh Lodha may have scored a major victory today when the Supreme Court removed Birla patriarch BK Birla from the legal battle for the control of the MP Birla empire, but his troubles are far from over.        
	Lodha faces legal challenges on several fronts that have been opened by the Birlas in various courts.        
	There are hundreds of cases. I cant recall all of them, said N.G. Khaitan, counsel for the Birlas.        
	The chartered accountant turned industrialist faces a criminal suit filed in Alipore Court on charges of conspiracy, a breach of trust and cheating.        
	The Supreme Court had refused to quash the criminal proceedings in early 2006, noting that a prima facie case had been made out.        
	The case will have a bearing on the probate proceedings relating to the late Priyamvada Birlas will of 1999. The will had named Lodha as the custodian of the Rs 5,000-crore empire.        
	The Birlas claimed that the assets of the late Madhav Prasad Birla and Priyamvada had been pledged to charities in an earlier will. Madhav Prasad and Priyamvada were said to have created five trusts in which they had planned to vest their assets.         
	The Birlas claimed that Lodha had dissolved the trusts and took control of the property that was meant for charity.        
	Priyamvada Birla cannot will an asset to Lodha which was not hers. So if it is proved that there was criminality involved in the revocation of these five trusts, then the 1999 will stands void, said a Birla confidant.        
	The Birlas have opened another legal challenge by seeking a court directive on the appointment of an administrator for the assets of MP Birla.        
	Even as the division bench of Calcutta High Court set aside the trial court order for the appointment of four administrators, the Birlas have moved the Supreme Court challenging it.        
	The Birlas were keen to have a court-appointed administrator for the assets of MP Birla as that would place curbs on Lodha who is the chairman of several MP Birla group companies, including flagship Birla Corporation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Renewed MS bid to clinch Yahoo deal
                              Not giving up                            
	Seattle/New York, May 19 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp has proposed an alternative deal to Yahoo Inc rather than a full acquisition, but the move is unlikely to win favour with financier Carl Icahn, a person familiar with his thinking said.        
	Icahn launched a proxy campaign on Thursday to replace Yahoos board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft, saying Yahoo had acted irrationally in refusing the giant software companys $47.5-billion bid.        
	Microsoft walked away from its pursuit of Yahoo two weeks ago after three months of negotiations when Yahoos board rejected Microsofts sweetened offer of $33 a share, saying the company was worth at least $37 a share.        
	The software giants move on Sunday was likely to prompt the billionaire investor to press Yahoo to further pursue a possible alliance with Google, the source said.        
	Microsoft is trying to get the milk without buying the cow, and if you look at Icahns history, he has never been used that way, quot; said this person.         
	He does not want to see Yahoo pushed into some joint venture with Microsoft and is not going to be used to push Yahoo into it.        
	Microsofts statement on Sunday said it was quot;considering and has raised with Yahoo an alternative that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not an acquisition of all of Yahoo. quot; It did not clarify what that alternative might be.        
	The New York Times reported that Microsoft and Yahoo might form a partnership or joint venture for search-related advertising to take on Google Inc, which dominates the search market with a share significantly larger than a combined Yahoo and Microsoft.        
	For its part, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc about a search advertising partnership and a deal could come as early as this week, a source familiar with the talks said on Thursday.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          EQUAL MUSIC                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: In its pre-budget wish list, the automobile industry has urged the government to announce a uniform 16 per cent excise duty on all passenger vehicles, cars, multi-purpose vehicles and multi-utility vehicles.        
	The government now charges a 24 per cent duty on larger passenger cars and 16 per cent on small cars.        
	The auto industry has always been asking for a uniform 16 per cent excise duty on all passenger cars. The finance minister had allowed a 16 per cent duty on small cars two years ago. We had requested for a uniform duty last year and requested it this year also, said Pawan Goenka, president  automotive sector, Mahindra amp; Mahindra.        
	The industry has also demanded that the excise duty on two and three-wheelers should be snipped to 8 per cent from 16 per cent.        
	The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) has urged the government to exclude engine and fuel capacity from the definition of small cars in its pre-budget memorandum to the finance ministry.        
	Small cars should be defined only on the basis of length. Fuel and engine capacity should not be included in the definition (in case differential duties continue to be levied), it said. Small cars are defined as vehicles with a maximum length of 4,000 mm and an engine size of 1,200 cc for petrol and 1,500 cc for diesel.         
	The government is proactive, and we go by what Siam is seeking on the budget, said Jnaneshwar Sen, head  marketing, Honda Siel Cars India.

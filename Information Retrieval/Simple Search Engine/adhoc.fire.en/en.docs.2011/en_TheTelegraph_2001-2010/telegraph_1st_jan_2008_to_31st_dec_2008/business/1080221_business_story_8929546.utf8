The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sovereign fund faces hurdle
                                                                                                               Sovereign fund faces hurdle
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                                                DOLLAR DREAMS      
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The finance ministry has opposed the Planning Commissions proposal for a sovereign wealth fund to invest abroad in a manner similar to Singapores Temasek.        
	Ministry officials said such a fund could lead to the double counting of money, causing inflationary pressures on the economy.         
	Planning Commission member Surya P. Sethi said, A decision on this (sovereign funds) would be taken after the budget. The fund would invest in overseas energy assets like Temasek of Singapore does.         
	The finance ministry is opposed to the idea as the rupee is issued in lieu of all foreign currencies which flows into the country.         
	If money is taken out for this fund without a rupee equivalent coming back into the coffers of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it amounts to double counting of the currency.         
	Besides the money does not belong to the government and its use could create constitutional problems, too.         
	The discussion on the issue is at an early stage. The fund, if set up, will invest in overseas oil, gas and coal assets, Sethi said.        
	He said the country has large foreign exchange reserves which have associated costs.         
	Up to a certain level, the costs are justified in minimising the risk of fluctuations and any kind of shocks.        
	Beyond a point, the costs cannot be justified, necessitating other ways to earn revenues, Planning Commission officials said.         
	A sovereign fund is an investment vehicle created to manage national savings and generate higher returns.         
	It is usually carved out of the official reserves of a country.        
	Ashvin Parekh, analyst with Ernst and Young, said, It is a good concept, but we need to know how much will be invested and whether it will be in debt or equity instruments.        
	He said the RBI should come out with regulations as there were issues of market risks and interest risks.         
	The funds would be available to entrepreneurs for acquiring assets abroad, but for that several steps have to be worked out before it becomes a reality.         
	There needs to be greater clarity before any decision is taken, Parekh said.        
	Singapore, for instance, earns over 20 per cent annually by deploying the money in its sovereign wealth funds in diversified assets abroad.         
	India earns less than 5 per cent by investing its foreign exchange reserves in US treasury bills, the Planning Commission officials said.        
	They said the government could go in for such a fund once foreign exchange reserves increased well beyond $300 billion.         
	The countrys foreign exchange reserves stood at $266.55 billion at the end of December.

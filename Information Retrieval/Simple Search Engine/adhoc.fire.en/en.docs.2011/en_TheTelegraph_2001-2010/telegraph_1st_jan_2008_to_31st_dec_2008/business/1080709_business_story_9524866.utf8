          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Tech Savvy                                  
	New Delhi, July 8: Laptop sales have pushed the growth rate of the personal computer (PC) market in 2007-08.         
	The rise in the use of laptops was driven by affordability, mobility, sleek designs, enhanced security features and other in-built accessories.        
	According to data released by the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT), laptop sales grew at the rate of 114 per cent at 18 lakh units, while desktops grew by only 1 per cent at 55 lakh units in 2007-08.        
	The total PC sales  laptops and desktops  registered a growth rate of 16 per cent this year and is expected to retain this momentum next year with sales likely to hit 85 lakh units, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of MAIT.         
	A significant growth in laptops pushed total PC sales in the country to 73 lakh units in 2007-08 compared with over 63 lakh in the previous year, Mehta added.         
	At present, the ratio of laptops to desktops in India is 20:80. However, in Europe, West Asia and Singapore, the ratio is 60:40. In mature markets such as the US, the ratio stands at about 45:55 for laptops to desktops.        
	The ratio will become 50:50 in the next few years with more users preferring laptops for increased portability, said industry analysts.        
	Mehta said, Notebooks account for 25 per cent of the total PC market, up from less than 3-4 per cent four years ago. With shifting consumer preference in favour of notebooks, this proportion will only get larger.        
	Laptop prices are now on a par with desktops. HCL Infosystems laptops, for instance, are available for under Rs 14,000. The laptop prices have fallen because of the rise in the rupee against the dollar, making imports cheaper.         
	Most vendors such as HP, Dell and HCL Infosystems feel that the demand is stronger in the sub-Rs 25,000 range.         
	On the enterprise end, enhanced productivity with faster processors and increased portability and connectivity are going to be the prime drivers, said analysts.

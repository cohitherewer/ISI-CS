          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Raja in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The government is considering a proposal to extend the one-time spectrum fee to new telecom players.        
	It is likely to impose the fee on existing operators holding more than 6.2Mhz of spectrum next week as well.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) has proposed that new players holding 4.4Mhz of startup spectrum should also pay the fee. This will be in addition to the licence fee of Rs 1,650 crore.         
	A final decision will be taken next week by the Telecom Commission.         
	Following allegations that telecom minister A. Raja has favoured new players by underpricing the licences bundled with 2G spectrum, a charge on new players will be a perfect balancing act, DoT officials said.         
	If the DoT imposes the levy, firms such as Swan, Unitech, Datacom, STel and Loop Telecom will have to pay an additional Rs 1,500-2,000 crore, which will virtually double their licence fee. Unitech has paid Rs 1,651 crore for 22 circles, while Swan has paid Rs 1,537 crore for 13 circles.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 2: A committee appointed by the Planning Commission today asked the government to adopt a standard VAT rate of 12.5 per cent to bring down the cost of aviation turbine fuel (ATF).        
	The cost of aviation fuel has been rising because of spiralling crude oil prices. The problem has been intensified with state governments levying a higher sales tax.        
	The Centre should either bring ATF within the definition of declared goods or states should be persuaded to adopt a standard VAT rate of 12.5 per cent, the group headed by commission member Anwarul Hoda said in its report .        
	According to the recommendations submitted to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, sales tax on ATF is as high as 40 per cent in some cases, while petroleum products remain outside the purview of state VAT.        
	Higher taxes make Indian ATF prices dearer by 60 to 70 per cent compared with competing countries.        
	Higher ATF prices is one of the key factors responsible for rising domestic air fares. Hence, it is cheaper for an Indian tourist in north India to go to Malaysia or Thailand than south India, the report said.        
	On the acute shortage of accommodation, particularly in budget hotels, the report said central and state governments and concerned authorities should take a number of measures to increase the availability of land for the construction of hotels.

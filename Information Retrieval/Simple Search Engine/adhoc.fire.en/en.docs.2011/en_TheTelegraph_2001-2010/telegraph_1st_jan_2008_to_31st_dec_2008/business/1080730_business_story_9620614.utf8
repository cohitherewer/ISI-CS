          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The finance ministry has said the Reserve Bank of Indias latest move to tighten money supply will help moderate inflation.         
	Analysts, on the other hand, have forecast a further tightening of key rates to suck excess liquidity out of the system.        
	The government hopes that the steps taken by the RBI, in continuation with the measures already taken over the last two months, will help in moderating and containing inflation, the ministry said in a statement here.        
	The increase in the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate is a signal to the banks that credit growth must be moderated, the statement added. The finance ministry said if requests for loans were carefully appraised and credit was allocated judiciously, the banks would be able to ensure credit for the productive sectors.        
	According to Sonal Varma, an economist with Lehman Brothers, The policy statement is unambiguously hawkish and delivers a clear message that inflation concerns dominate growth and that a slowdown in demand is required to curtail inflation.         
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, said, The RBIs decision is motivated by two factors. The fiscal situation, particularly on account of the loan waiver and the implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission, is providing a demand stimulus, which can only intensify inflationary pressure. Moreover, since domestic fuel prices do not fully reflect the global situation, they are not helping in reducing the demand to the fullest possible extent.         
	Industry gave a thumbs down to the monetary policy. Assocham president Sajjan Jindal said, Tightening of money supply may lead to a fall in the overall business confidence with companies postponing their investment plans in the time to come.        
	Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said , Using these monetary tools could have a further negative impact on the southward movement of industrial activity. Uco chairman S.K. Goel said lending rates would go up by 0.5 to one per cent. Federation of Indian Export Organisations president Ganesh Gupta said the RBIs policy would hurt micro, small and medium enterprises.

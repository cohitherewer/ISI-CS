          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Chidambaram: Relief plan      
	New Delhi, April 22: The government will bring in more measures to check inflation, including possible curbs on exports.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the Rajya Sabha today that the recent fiscal and monetary steps of the government should rein in prices, though their impact would be felt after some time. It takes time for fiscal and monetary steps to take effect.        
	Indias headline inflation raced to 7.41 per cent in late March, the highest since November 2004, because of a rise in the prices of metals, food and fuel. As and when necessary more fiscal measures will be taken. We have taken some steps and some more are being contemplated, Chidambaram said.        
	He said monetary measures had also been taken, citing the hike in the cash reserve ratio by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) the day after the debate on inflation ended in Parliament.         
	The RBI on Thursday hiked the cash reserve ratio, or the amount of money banks must compulsorily keep with it, to reduce credit in the economy.         
	The monetary policy review is coming up on April 29 and one will have to wait to see what further steps the Reserve Bank takes, Chidambaram said.        
	The government would also consider proposals to ban exports of more commodities, if there was a need to boost domestic supplies.        
	Officials said futures trading in edible oils could be banned.        
	Since March, the government has slashed import duties on edible oils, banned the export of cement and non-basmati rice and withdrawn export incentives on steel to increase supplies and control inflation.        
	The cabinet committee on prices is also expected to decide on banning steel exports, slashing customs duty on steel and zinc to zero, reducing countervailing duty on construction steel and hiking export duties on iron ore.        
	Hoarding debate        
	During the question hour in the Rajya Sabha today, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh said that while the government acted against small hoarders, it has failed to nab the big fish.        
	States should take action against all, big or small, including the names mentioned (by Amar Singh), Chidambaram said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil firms rue loss of relief
                                                                                                               Oil firms rue loss of relief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 10: The withdrawal of a tax holiday to new refineries will affect their plans and dampen the enthusiasm of multinationals for the auction of Indian oil blocks.        
	The removal of the benefit, made in the budget, could spoil plans to add 2.14 million barrels per day to the existing 2.98 million-barrels-per-day capacity of oil firms in India by 2012.        
	Indian Oil has said the withdrawal would result in lower profitability. The rate of return on the Rs 24,000 crore invested in the 15mt-a-year Paradip refinery in Orissa will be lower by 1.5-2 per cent, IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said. ONGC chairman R. S. Sharma said, We are working on revised financials.        
	Global majors keen to participate in the auctions, under the seventh round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp), have expressed their disappointment over the development. BP exploration director for South Asia, Jonathan Evans, said, It (tax holiday) wont stop us from bidding but it will change the way we bid.         
	Niko resources vice-president Larry Fisher said the move would change the way companies constructed their bids.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram has proposed to end the seven-year income tax holiday for refineries that will be commissioned after April 2009.         
	The proposal will affect all new refineries except that of Reliance Petroleum, which is expected to commission a 580,000 barrels-per-day export-oriented unit at Jamnagar, Gujarat, by the third quarter of the next fiscal.        
	S. Sundareshan, additional secretary in the petroleum ministry, said the ministry had taken up the issue with the finance ministry as the new proposal was contrary to the fiscal regime promised in the earlier rounds of auctions.        
	He said government has postponed the last date of bidding for oil and gas blocks under the latest auction round to April 25 from April 11.

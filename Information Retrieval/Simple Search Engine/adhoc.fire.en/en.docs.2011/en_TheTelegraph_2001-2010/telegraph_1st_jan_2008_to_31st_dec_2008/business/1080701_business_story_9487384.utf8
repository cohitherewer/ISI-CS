                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil bid to blunt Mukesh move
          SIMI KAMBOJ                                             
	Mumbai, June 30: Anil Ambani will contest the 5 per cent stake sale in Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) to Chevron Inc of the US if brother Mukesh goes through with his threat to break his deal with MTN of South Africa.        
	Sources in Anils camp say that if Reliance Industries challenges the stake sale in Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com), it will dispute the sale of a 5 per cent holding in RPL to Chevron of the US in April 2006.        
	Chevron has the option to raise its stake by another 24 per cent. The US oil giant must indicate whether it wants to exercise the option by July 2009.        
	The Anil camp has rejected Mukeshs right of first refusal to any stake sale that stems from a proviso in the non-compete agreement that is linked to the process of demerger in 2006.        
	This is the first time that the younger scions side has indicated that it might use the same proviso in the agreement to nix Mukeshs deal with Chevron.        
	Early this month, Mukesh Ambani had threatened to haul Anil Ambani-owned R-Com to court to stall the deal that aims to create the worlds sixth largest telecom company.        
	The elder sibling has insisted that under the terms of the non-compete agreement between Reliance Industries (RIL) and the four companies that were spun off in January 2006, he had the right of first refusal to a stake sale in any of the companies within the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG).        
	The non-compete agreement confers a similar right on Anil if brother Mukesh decides to sell a substantial stake with controlling interest in any of the companies he controls.        
	Under the terms of demerger, 189 companies went to Anil Ambani and 52 to Mukesh Ambani.         
	The 10-year non-compete agreement was signed between RIL and the four demerged companies  Reliance Communications Ventures, Reliance Energy Ventures, Global Fuel Management Services (later renamed as Reliance Natural Resources Ltd) and Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd.        
	However, the scope of the agreement covers all the companies in the two groups, including the ones that might be set up in future.         
	The agreement came into effect from December 21, 2005.        
	Sources in R-Com said they were waiting for Mukesh Ambanis flagship Reliance Industries Ltd to go to the court to enforce its claim of a right of first refusal (ROFR) to a stake sale in R-Com.        
	Once they do so, the Anil camp will retaliate by challenging the stake sale to Chevron.        
	If the ROFR is binding between RIL as well as the four companies of the ADA Group formed after the demerger, then why didnt RIL make the first offer to ADAG companies before starting talks with Chevron for a stake sale? The issue will be raised in court, said an ADAG source.        
	R-Com and AAA Communications, another ADAG company, have already filed caveats in Bombay High Court to ensure that no ex-parte order is issued in case RIL attempts to enforce its ROFR in any deal with MTN.        
	On May 26, R-Com opened exclusive negotiations with MTN for a period of 45 days to see if they could work out a business combination.        
	The speculation is that Anil Ambani wants to sell close to 50 per cent of the promoters 66.12 per cent stake in R-Com to MTN in return for a 35 per cent stake in MTN. Such a deal would give him just over 33.5 per cent in R-Com  about 16 per cent held directly and another 17.5 through MTN.        
	MTN would have to come out with an open offer for another 20 per cent of R-Com under the terms of the takeover code. The ADAG stake in R-Com would rise in direct proportion to the minority shareholders response to such an offer.        
	On Monday, the RPL stock closed at Rs 170.90, sharply down from a high of Rs 267.55 last November.

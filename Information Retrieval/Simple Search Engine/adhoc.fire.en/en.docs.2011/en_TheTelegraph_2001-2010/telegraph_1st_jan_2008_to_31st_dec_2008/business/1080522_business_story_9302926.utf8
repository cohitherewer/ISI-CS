                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             State Bank U-turn on farm finance
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Corrective mode                                  
	Mumbai, May 21: The State Bank of India (SBI) today rescinded its recent directive to its branches to stop loans to farmers to buy tractors and other farm equipment.        
	The SBI move  prompted by a surge in bad loans in this segmenthad sparked a storm of protests from political parties.        
	 We regret that our circular, asking branches to put tractor loans on hold, has been misunderstood and has given rise to concern. The circular is withdrawn with immediate effect, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said.        
	The bank said the financing facility would recommence immediately.         
	On May 16, the SBI had issued a circular to its branches asking them to stop furnishing loans for purchasing new tractors after it faced rising defaults in the credit segment.        
	The bank manages the largest farm loan portfolio in the country, and during the period of April 2004 to March 2008, about 42 lakh new farmers were financed by the public sector giant, which aggregated to about Rs 70,000 crore. The decision to keep new farm-sector credit disbursals on hold drew huge protests from across the country.         
	At present, tractor and farm loans of the SBI stands at about Rs. 7,000 crore, while bad loans account for about 17 per cent of the total portfolio. The bank was trying to sell a government scheme that provided a waiver of 25 per cent on farm equipment loans.        
	Bhatt, in his earlier statement, said the bank aimed to sensitise its branches across the country about the rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) and help the farmers take advantage of the governments Rs 60,000-crore waiver programme.         
	The banks NPAs in the agriculture sector has risen significantly in the past year. We have pockets in the country where there are large overdues in tractor loans, Bhatt said.

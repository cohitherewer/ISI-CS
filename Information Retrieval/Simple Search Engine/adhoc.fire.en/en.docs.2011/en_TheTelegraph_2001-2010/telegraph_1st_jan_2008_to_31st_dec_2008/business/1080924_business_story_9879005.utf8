                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil goes on the offensive
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: Anil Ambani today blasted Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for reneging on the gas supply agreement with Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL).        
	The brothers are involved in a bitter court battle over the supply of 28 million cubic metres of gas a day from the Krishna-Godavari basin to RNRL.        
	Despite the clear-cut understanding between RIL and RNRL, it is unfortunate that RIL unilaterally finalised and signed a one-sided agreement with RNRL while RIL still had full and effective management control over RNRL, Ambani told shareholders of the company here today.        
	He accused RIL of using various stratagems to avoid paying profits from the gas field to the government by repeatedly inflating the development cost of the KG basin wells.        
	Refuting RILs claim that it could not supply gas at a price of $2.34 per million British thermal units since the governments gas pricing formula wouldnt allow it, Ambani said the price of gas for sale to RNRL and NTPC had been kept out of the purview of the governments decision. The dispute between RIL and NTPC is not about the price of gas, but about other terms and conditions, Ambani said.        
	He said that RIL had even agreed to the price of $2.34 per mBtu for the gas, maintaining that there was never any dispute about the price.

	New Delhi, Jan. 7: State-run Indian Oil Corporation, which is planning to venture into domestic oil and gas exploration and production, is increasing its staff strength.
    
	Sources said the company planned to recruit about 50 people at all levels to foray into the exploration and production (E amp;P) business.
    
	The company plans to bid for small blocks under the seventh Nelp (New Exploration Licensing Policy) round.
    
	Officials said the small blocks would offer the IOC an opportunity to participate on its own as the company had not managed to acquire assets as an operator due to the technical criterion prescribed.
    
	So far, the IOC participated in the bidding for oil blocks with ONGC and Oil India, among domestic majors. 
    
	In the latest round of bidding for oil and gas blocks, the government has introduced a new type of onland blocks called Type-S that cover small areas of up to 200 kilometres. There are nine such blocks in Cambay Basin.
    
	Company officials said strengthening of the E amp;P division in the company was part of the IOCs plan to enhance upstream integration. The company has been pursuing exploration and production activities both within and outside the country in collaborations with consortium partners. 
    
	In recent months, the Indian Oil-OIL combine has acquired participating interest in a block in Nigeria. In a consortium with OIL, Kuwait Energy and Medco Energi of Indonesia, it had acquired participating interest in two exploration blocks in Yemen, awarded through international bidding.
    
	According to a recent study by Assocham, the domestic oil-and-gas discovery and refining sector will witness large capacity additions from 2008 because of growing shortages of crude oil. The target for capacity expansion in the refining sector is 235 million tonnes in the next couple of years, which will require recruitment of petroleum engineers, drillers, physicians, geologists, geophysicists besides executives.
    
	The sector alone is expected to create job opportunities for nearly 10-15,000 people, including middle management officers.

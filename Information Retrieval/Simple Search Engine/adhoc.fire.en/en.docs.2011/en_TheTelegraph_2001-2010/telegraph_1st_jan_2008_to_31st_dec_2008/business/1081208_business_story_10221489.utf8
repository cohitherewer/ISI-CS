	New Delhi, Dec. 7 (PTI): The government today allowed up to a 10 per cent refund of the service tax on foreign agent commissions and a two per cent interest subsidy that could be raised further and extended till the next fiscal.        
	There is a good possibility that it (interest rate relief) will be extended, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.        
	As part of the economic stimulus package announced today, the government provided for the two per cent interest subvention (subsidy) till March 2009, subject to a minimum rate of seven per cent.        
	Pillai said the package would give exporters a little bit of a cushion.        
	The threshold limit of the refund of the service tax paid by exporters on foreign commission agent services has been enhanced from two per cent to 10 per cent of the freight-on- board value of export goods, an official statement said.        
	Textile gain        
	The government will make an additional allocation of Rs 1,400 crore to clear the entire backlog in the technology upgradation fund scheme.        
	The scheme was launched in April 1999 and aims to provide impetus to the modernisation of the textile and jute industries.        
	Under the scheme, a reimbursement of five per cent is given on the interest charged by financial institutions for capital loaned to textile and jute units for modernisation.

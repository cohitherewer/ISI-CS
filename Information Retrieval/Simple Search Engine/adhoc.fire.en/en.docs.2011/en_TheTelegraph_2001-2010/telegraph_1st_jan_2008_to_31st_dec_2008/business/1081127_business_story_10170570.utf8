                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sun Pharma acquires US drug facility
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries today said its US subsidiary had acquired Chattem Chemicals from Elcat Inc for an undisclosed sum.        
	The acquisition is expected to boost Sun Pharmas position in the pain management category.         
	The acquisition reflects our strategic resolve to be a more active player in the pain management segment in the US, Dilip Shanghvi, chairman and managing director of Sun Pharma, said.         
	Chattem is registered with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a narcotic raw material importer. Controlled substances are used for patients in severe pain.        
	This is Sun Pharmas third acquisition in the controlled substance segment. In 2005, Sun Pharma acquired facilities in Hungary and New Jersey that manufacture controlled substances in various forms.        
	Chattem employs 60 people at its Chattanooga unit in Tennessee. For the year ended June 2008, the companys sales stood around $26 million.        
	According to current regulations in the US, companies cannot import substances such as morphine. However, certain companies are permitted to import concentrated poppy straw (processed from poppy).         
	Sun Pharma plans to process poppy into poppy straw at its Hungary facility and then import it to the US. This will be later converted into an active pharmaceutical ingredient at the Chattem facility and later into a final dosage form at its New Jersey unit.        
	Sun Pharma shares soared on news of the acquisition. The scrip ended higher by 2.7 per cent at Rs 1,104.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

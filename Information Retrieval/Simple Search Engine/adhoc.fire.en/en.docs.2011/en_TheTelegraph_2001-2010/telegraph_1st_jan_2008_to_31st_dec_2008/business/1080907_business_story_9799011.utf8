	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Steel Authority of Indian Ltd (SAIL) has kick-started a planned Rs 1,900-crore modernisation and expansion of its Salem Steel Plant (SSP).        
	The plant, which started in 1970 as a stainless steel unit, has never done well as it remained dependent on raw materials from SAILs units in Durgapur. Prohibitive transportation costs also made output from the Tamil Nadu-based plant unviable.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while inaugurating the project, said initiatives such as this would see India emerge as the second largest steel producer in the world by 2015.        
	At one point there was talk of selling off SSP, but with steel prices soaring, it was decided that the unit would be turned into a full-fledged integrated steel plant with the capacity to produce 1.8 lakh tonnes per annum of stainless steel slabs. The plant will no longer depend on external sources to procure slabs for rolling as steel making facilities, including an electric arc furnace, ladle furnace and a refining unit, are being set up as part of the project.

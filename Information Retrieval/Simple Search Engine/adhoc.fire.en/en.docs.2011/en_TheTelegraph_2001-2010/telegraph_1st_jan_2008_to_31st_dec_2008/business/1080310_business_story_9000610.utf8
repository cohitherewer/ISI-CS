The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Share scenario
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Share scenario
                                I bought some shares around 20 years ago, which are held in six demat accounts in my wifes, my sons and my own names. What will be the income tax liability if I want to sell them now? We want to reduce the number of demat accounts to one or two by closing the others and then sell the shares. Can we do that?          Harish Swami, Behala
                    You can sell the shares from your existing demat accounts and none of you will have to pay any income tax on the capital gains, because your holding period of the shares is more than 12 months. So, sell off the holding stocks from your respective demat accounts first and then close those accounts.                                  Education loan      I took an education loan for my son in 2002 as a co-borrower along with him. The repayment, which was scheduled to start a year after the completion of the course or employment of my son, started from July last year. So far, I have paid the repayment amount from my taxable income. Can I claim deduction on the instalments paid for the loan for the assessment year 2008-09?        B. Sarkar, Burdwan
                    The rules of Section 80E of the Income Tax Act have been changed. No deduction is allowed on repayment of the principal amount.           Previously, a maximum of Rs 40,000 was allowed for deduction each financial year towards repayment of loan principal.           However, the entire amount of interest repayment in a financial year is allowed for deduction. As both of you are borrowers of the loan, any one who pays the instalments can claim deduction.                                  Dear wife      If I gift some money to my wife whose annual income is less than Rs 60,000, will the interest income on the gifted money be taxable? If so, who will have to pay the tax?        Ujjal Ganguly, Calcutta
                If the interest income is taxable, it will be taxed in your hand. The best way to do this is to invest the gifted money in assets that do not yield taxable income, such as PPF.

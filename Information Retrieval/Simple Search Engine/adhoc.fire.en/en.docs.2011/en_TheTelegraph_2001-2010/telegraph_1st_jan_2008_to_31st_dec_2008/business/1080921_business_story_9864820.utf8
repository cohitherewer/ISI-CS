          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Manmohan Singh with Planning Commission chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia (left) and Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in New Delhi on Saturday. (AP)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The government is set to form an integrated energy policy, including nuclear power, to enhance the countrys energy security.        
	The Planning Commission today said it would send a policy note on the proposals to the Union Cabinet next month.        
	The policy will lay emphasis on optimum exploitation of energy resources and acquiring energy assets abroad.        
	Chairing a meeting of the Planning Commission on the proposals for an integrated policy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, We are likely to depend more on imports for energy. This makes us vulnerable to the uncertainty in international prices and reliability of supplies.        
	The Prime Minister reviewed the draft integrated energy policy and said appropriate energy pricing was necessary to promote investment to expand supplies.        
	The draft paper seeks a competitive energy market. Prices should be market determined and subject to regulation to take care of anti-competitive behaviour.        
	The policies followed in different sectors are not always internally consistent. It is, therefore, critical that we evolve an integrated energy policy based on a consistent application of economic principles across different energy sources, Singh said.        
	Todays meeting was convened ahead of the Prime Ministers visit to the US next week where he is expected to sign the civil nuclear deal with President George Bush. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Anil Kakodkar was also present at the meet.        
	To meet our energy requirements, we need to expand all resources. There was a discussion on the importance of nuclear energy and the AEC chairman intervened to clarify what it was doing, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told reporters after the meeting.        
	He, however, said there was no discussion on private participation in the nuclear energy sector. Ahluwalia said the draft policy would lay down the principles to be followed by different ministries, including petroleum and natural gas, coal, power, water resources, atomic energy and finance.

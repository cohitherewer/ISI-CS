	New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): India has emerged as the most optimistic nation in terms of hiring intentions across the world but nonetheless the employment outlook seems challenging, global staffing services firm Manpower said.        
	While employers in India continue to show optimism in their hiring intent, the impact of the US slowdown has started showing its impact, Manpower India managing director Naresh Malhan said while releasing the latest Manpower Employment Outlook survey.        
	Future trends would be challenging and the October to December quarter would be a testing time largely due to rising crude oil prices, Malhan said        
	India is expected to report the most bullish hiring plans in the July-September period, followed by Singapore and Peru as the global slowdown impacted the hiring intentions in these countries, he said.        
	India has made a gradual upward movement since the last two quarters, as in the Manpower March-quarter survey, the country was at the second position while in the December-quarter it held the third spot.        
	Of the 5,636 employers surveyed, 45 per cent expected an increase in hiring activity in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 6 per cent on a quarterly basis and 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

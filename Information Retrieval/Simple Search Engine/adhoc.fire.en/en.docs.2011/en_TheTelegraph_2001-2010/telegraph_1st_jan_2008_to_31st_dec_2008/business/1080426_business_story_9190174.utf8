	Mumbai, April 25 (PTI): High operating costs combined with a higher indirect tax burden pulled down Ambuja Cements net profit by 42 per cent to Rs 326 crore in the January-March quarter from Rs 566.25 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The company, belonging to the Holcim group, however, achieved 17 per cent higher sales at Rs 1,655 crore during the period under review against Rs 1,419.51 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The company is facing an unprecedented increase in major operating costs, in particular for coal, power, raw materials and logistics, as well as a higher indirect tax burden due to a slew of fiscal impositions by state and central governments, managing director A.L. Kapur said.        
	Total income increased from Rs 1,452.49 crore to Rs 1,695.41 crore in the reporting quarter.

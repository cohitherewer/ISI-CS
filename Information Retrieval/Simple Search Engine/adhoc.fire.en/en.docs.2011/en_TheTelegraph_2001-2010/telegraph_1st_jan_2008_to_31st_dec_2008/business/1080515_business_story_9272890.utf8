	Mumbai, May 14: Satyam Computer Services has lost a case at the Court of Appeal, London. The court has upheld a London High Court order barring the Hyderabad-based companys move to block the online mobile payment company Upaids fraud and forgery claims against it in Texas, US.        
	The ruling allows Upaids lawsuit against Satyam alleging misrepresentation, forgery, fraud and a breach of contract to proceed in a Texan court.        
	Upaid Systems on Wednesday claimed in a statement that Satyam, too, had admitted that extremely large sums of money were involved in the case.        
	Upaid had originally filed a lawsuit in April last year following the revelation in Texas of forged documents being previously provided by Satyam to Upaid.        
	Satyam had sought a high court injunction in London on September 2007 to try and block the Texas case, arguing that a 2003 commercial agreement terminating the relationship between the two firms precluded all future claims against it for all past practices and that any residual claims against it had to be tried in London.        
	However, the high court refused Satyams request in January. After testimony from senior executives of both the firms and legal experts, the court ruled that the Texas claims could proceed. Satyam then appealed against the decision, which was again dismissed last Friday by the Court of Appeal, London.         
	Responding to the development, Satyam in a statement said that during 1997-1998, one of its subsidiaries was engaged by Intouch Technologies (currently Upaid Systems) for product development work.        
	It added that Upaid Systems wanted to patent this product and Satyam provided support as contractually required to Upaid for obtaining the patent. Some of the then Satyam employees were named as co-inventors to the patents.        
	In 2002, Satyam and Upaid concluded the business relationship and based on the settlement agreement signed then, any future disputes were to be tried under UK laws.        
	Subsequently in 2006, Upaid filed certain claims of infringement against some companies in the US and in the proceedings, two former Satyam employees denied signing the patent assignment documents.

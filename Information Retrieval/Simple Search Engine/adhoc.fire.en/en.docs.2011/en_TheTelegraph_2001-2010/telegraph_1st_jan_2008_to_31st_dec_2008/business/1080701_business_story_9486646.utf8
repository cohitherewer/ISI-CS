          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 30: Lakshmi Niwas Mittal could be gearing up for the largest-ever cross-border acquisition of his life, eclipsing the celebrated takeover battle for European steel maker Arcelor which he won in 2006.        
	Mittals company, the largest steel company in the world, is believed to be considering a bid for Rio Tinto, one of the largest producers of iron ore and coal globally.        
	If Mittal pitches for the entire Rio Tinto Group, which is headquartered in London, it could cost him a whopping $160 billion, almost five times more than the $33 billion he had spent for Arcelor to create steel powerhouse ArcelorMittal two years back.        
	Rio Tinto would not only give ArcelorMittal control over coal and iron ore but also open up new vistas in other minerals.        
	ArcelorMittal has 10 per cent share of worlds steel production with a capacity of 120 million tonnes across the globe.        
	Rio is the second largest producer of iron ore, accounting for 20 per cent of the global trade. It also accounts for 4 per cent of traded thermal coal and metallurgical coal.        
	Apart from these two crucial raw materials required for steel-making, Rio is the third largest producer of diamonds. It also owns large aluminium, copper, uranium, titanium dioxide, and borate assets globally.        
	ArcelorMittal declined to comment on its possible bid for Rio. However, there is a possibility that the Luxembourg-headquartered company could be angling only for Rios iron ore assets.        
	Rio Tinto is now trying to ward off a hostile takeover threat from BHP Billiton which made an unsolicited bid of $147 billion. Rio has rejected the BHP offer saying it significantly undervalues the company.        
	A possible Rio-BHP deal could be subjected to rigorous scrutiny by anti-trust authorities in the European Union and other regulators as the combine will control 36 per cent of global seaborne iron ore trade. Analysts view that Rios iron ore assets, mostly located in Western Australia, is valued at $50 billion.        
	There is a possibility that regulators may ask a Rio-BHP combine to sell the Pilbara asset in Western Australia, the largest iron ore mine in the world. Mittal may look to buy that if that scenario plays out.         
	A Mittal bid for Rio is in line with the companys strategy to raise captive sources of iron ore and coal in the face of unprecedented rise in prices.        
	Iron ore contract prices have doubled this year while the price of coking coal has gone up three times.         
	ArcelorMittal plans to secure 70 per cent of its iron ore requirement by 2012, up from 46 per cent at present.        
	After buying Arcelor, Mittal has concentrated on scooping up iron ore and coal assets across the globe.        
	ArcelorMittal announced yesterday that it had paid 212 million Australian dollars ($204million) to raise its stake in Australias Macarthur Coal, the largest exporter of pulverised coal used in steel-making, by 5 per cent to 19.9 per cent. Mittal also plans to set up two new plants in Orissa and Jharkhand in India at an investment of $20 billion. Both plants will have access to their own iron ore sources.

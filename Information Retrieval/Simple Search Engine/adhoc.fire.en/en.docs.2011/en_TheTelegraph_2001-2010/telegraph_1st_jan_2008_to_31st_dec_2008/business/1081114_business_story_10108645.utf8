The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loud buzz on more telecom deals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Loud buzz on more telecom deals
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Rush hour                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Following in the footsteps of Japans DoCoMo, which picked up a 26 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices yesterday, many other foreign mobile companies are set to enter India through merger deals.        
	AT amp;T, Deutsche Telekom AG and Qatar Telecom are scouting for partners, and deals could be struck over the next few months.        
	Foreign operators are looking for Indian allies to ensure that there are no security or policy barriers to their entry into the worlds fastest growing telecom market.        
	MTN Group, South Africas largest mobile service provider with operations in 21 countries, is waiting in the wings to enter after its attempts to do so failed on two earlier occasions, Bundeep Singh Rangar, chairman of IndusView Advisors, an advisory firm, told The Telegraph.        
	The department of telecom has allowed foreign firms to bid for 3G spectrum, but they need to form alliances with domestic players before the services are rolled out.        
	Tata Teles deal with NTT DoCoMo is the latest case of a foreign player seeking a toehold in the Indian market by partnering a domestic entity.         
	Wednesdays deal leaves Reliance Communications as the only incumbent player which has not sought any overseas alliance.        
	While Telekom Malaysia has a 19.99 per cent stake in Idea Cellular, Sistema of Russia has bought 10 per cent of Shyam Telelink in September for $11.4 million.        
	Videocon-owned Datacom Solutions, BPL Mobiles Loop Telecom, and S Tel, a joint venture between Skycity Foundations and Telecom Investments (Mauritius), are among the new firms that have spectrum rights without overseas partners.        
	Last month, Norwegian telecom company Telenor bought 60 per cent of Unitech Wireless for Rs 6,120 crore. Earlier, Swan Telecom divested a 45 per cent stake to UAE-based Etisalat for Rs 4,050 crore.         
	Unitech Wireless and Swan Telecom are new firms that received licences and spectrum rights earlier this year and are yet to build networks.        
	The investments in Tata Teleservices by NTT DoCoMo and the start-up operations of Swan Telecom by Etisalat and Telenor ASAs in Unitech Telecom show potential for growth in this market, said Rangar.        
	The sector, which has an annual subscriber growth of 21 per cent, requires investments to the tune of $73 billion over the next five years to achieve a teledensity of up to 45 per cent.

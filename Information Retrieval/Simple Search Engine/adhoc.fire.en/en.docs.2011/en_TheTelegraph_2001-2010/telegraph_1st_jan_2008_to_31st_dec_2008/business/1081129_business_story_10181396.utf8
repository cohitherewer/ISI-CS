          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A barricade in front of BSE to block the entry of vehicles in Mumbai on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 28: Investors showed no signs of panic on the third day of terror in the countrys commercial capital with the sensex  the markets bellwether  rising 66 points, or 0.73 per cent, to close at 9092.72 in thin trading.        
	Trading volume was extremely low at Rs 2,396.44 crore as many investors preferred to catch the unfolding drama on television screens rather than bet on the direction that stocks might take.        
	However, the rupee came under pressure on fears that the attacks could lead to higher outflows from foreign institutional investors in the near term. The Indian currency tumbled 57 paise to 50.10 against the dollar. Trading on the forex markets was suspended on Thursday because of the terrorist attacks.         
	The rupee opened weaker at 49.69 a dollar and gradually moved downwards in a lacklustre trade though state-owned banks were seen buying dollars during the days trading. Activity was low as many foreign banks stayed away.        
	On the equity markets, a positive feature of the days trade was the lack of any major negative reaction from investors to the terror attacks. Barring a minor knee-jerk reaction at the beginning, investors showed resilience throughout the trading session and were not spooked by the fact that the terrorists had not been completely neutralised at the end of another skittish day of trading.        
	The BSE benchmark index opened at 8889.18, a fall of 137 points from the previous close. However, it managed to erase these losses as buying came in at lower levels.         
	However, volatility was observed around noon as the sensex dipped once again to 8889.18  which was the intra-day low  before climbing amid alternate bouts of buying and selling.        
	Investors are hoping that the current crisis will blow over soon. One good thing was that there was no panic selling and the last day of the F amp; contract went off smoothly, said Jaysinh Kothari, director, Eastern Equities Ltd.        
	US stocks fall        
	US stocks swung lower at the opening today as the attacks in Mumbai rattled Wall Street and prompted profit taking from this weeks heavy gains.        
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.13 points (0.48 per cent) to 8684.48 in the first exchanges.

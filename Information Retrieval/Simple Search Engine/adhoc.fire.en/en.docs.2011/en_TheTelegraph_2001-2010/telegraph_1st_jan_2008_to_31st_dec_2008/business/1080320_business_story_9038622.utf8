	New Delhi, March 19: SAR Group company Luminous Power Technologies plans to make its foray into the electric two-wheeler segment in a few months.        
	The company expects its revenues to exceed Rs 1,500 crore in three years.        
	The two-wheeler will be of a different kind than the ones available. We are making more energy-efficient models, said Luminous Power managing director Rakesh Malhotra. We expect to treble our revenue to Rs 1,500 crore by 2011-12. We should close 2007-08 with a sales turnover of Rs 500 crore.         
	SAR Group is setting up a manufacturing facility for the electric two-wheeler in Himachal Pradesh.

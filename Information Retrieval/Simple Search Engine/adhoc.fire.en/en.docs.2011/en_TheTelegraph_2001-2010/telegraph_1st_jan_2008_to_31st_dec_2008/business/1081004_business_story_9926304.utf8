	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Inflation slipped below the 12-per-cent mark after a gap of over two months, raising hopes of the central bank easing its tight monetary policy.        
	It came down to 11.99 per cent for the week ended September 20 after remaining unchanged at 12.14 per cent for the past two weeks. Inflation was 3.51 per cent a year ago.        
	After breaching the 12-per-cent mark for the week ended July 26, inflation had peaked to 12.63 per cent for the week ended August 9.        
	Analysts said it was too early to conclude that inflation had peaked or believe that it had moderated. However, they said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) might relax its monetary policy. The RBIs policy on rates had forced banks to raise their prime lending rates to 14 per cent.        
	Inflation is still at a high level. It has slipped below the 12-per-cent mark because of the monetary measures taken by the RBI over a period of time, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said.        
	The finance ministry said the dip in inflation came on the back of a decline in the prices of food articles, manufactured goods, fuel and electricity.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      New Message                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The department of telecommunications (DoT) today made 3G players eligible for 2G spectrum, enabling them to seamlessly provide both basic and value-added mobile services.        
	However, given the scarcity of 2G spectrum, or radiowaves that carry mobile calls, it will take some time before 3G players are able to acquire spectrum.        
	2G spectrum, currently used by all telecom operators in India, is required to provide basic voice and data services. 3G radiowaves allow mobile phone users to surf the Internet, quickly download content and watch video and movies in real-time.        
	New 3G players will be eligible to get 2G spectrum, said R. Ashok, member finance of the Telecom Commission.         
	According to the 3G policy, new telecom players offering 3G services need to obtain a unified access service licence to provide mobile services. The licence, which costs Rs 1,651 crore, also gives firms 4.4 megahertz (MHz) of start-up 2G spectrum.         
	The DoT had earlier stated that standalone 3G telecom entrants, who apply and get a licence, would not be eligible for the start-up spectrum.        
	Standalone 3G players need 2G spectrum for the smooth rollout of services. Winners of 3G auction will initially get 5MHz of radiowaves, which are not sufficient. The DoT has also stated that no additional radiowaves would be allotted in the next 12 months.        
	However, with the DoT unable to make any headway in getting the defence forces to vacate spectrum for 2G and 3G, it will be a long time before any additional radiowaves are allocated to telecom players.         
	Ashok said that the government hoped to generate revenues at a reasonably higher value than the base price (Rs 2,020 crore) set for the 3G spectrum auction, which is slated for mid-January.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja is keen to raise Rs 40,000 crore from the auction.        
	The government may also come out with rules for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) by next month. DoT joint secretary J.S. Deepak said, We are hoping to come out with the policy on MVNO before the end of January 5, which is the deadline for (the) application of 3G spectrum.

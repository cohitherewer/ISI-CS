                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Assocham sees mixed impact of inflation
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI): The middle-income group has cut expenditure by nearly 49 per cent on entertainment, eating out and leisure shopping because of inflation but made no compromise on tobacco products, an Assocham study said.        
	However, inflation could not dent the spirit of the higher income group. An average high-heeled family continues to spend Rs 20,000 per month on leisure that includes movies and music.        
	The study, based on the response of 3,000 middle and high-income groups in cities, has recommended measures such as using car pools, public transport and restricting spendings to essential items.        
	It found that increase in inflation from 7 per cent to above 11 per cent has forced middle-class families to cut their average budget for entertainment, eating out and fancy shopping from Rs 5,000-6,000 per month to less than Rs 2,800 per month.

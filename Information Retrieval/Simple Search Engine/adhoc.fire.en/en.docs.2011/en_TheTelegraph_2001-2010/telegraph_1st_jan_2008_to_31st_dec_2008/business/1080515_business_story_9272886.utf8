	Mumbai, May 14: Baring Private Equity Asia has raised $1.5 billion through its Baring Asia Private Equity Fund IV, of which $750 million will be invested in India.         
	This is one of the largest growth fund. We are looking at investing mostly in India and China. We will be opening an office in Mumbai soon for the purpose, said Jean Eric Salata, founder and chief executive of Baring Private Equity Asia. The fund will target mid-sized companies.        
	Investor appetite for Asia remains strong despite a slowing global economy, Salata said. About 30 per cent of the fund has already been invested, he said, adding that investment flow was the strongest in many years as mid-market companies in Asia lack alternatives for funding amid volatile financial markets.         
	The IPO markets are essentially closed right now except for a limited number of companies ... and the banks have tightened credit both in China and India, Salata said.         
	Theres probably more demand than we anticipated. We feel the timing is quite good for this fund as far as the ability to invest is concerned, he added. He said the fund would invest $50-100 million in mid-cap companies. We are looking at infusing growth capital, that is capital for expansion in operation, he added.        
	The Baring Asia IV fund has mostly international investors. There were 40 new investors in this fund and existing investors invested 154 per cent in the fund, Salata added.        
	In India, the fund will invest in the infrastructure, financial services, education and energy sectors. We do not want to invest in export-oriented sectors, that is the reason why we are not looking at IT/ITeS, Salata said.        
	One of Barings earliest investment was in IT company Mphasis, which they exited when EDS bought over the company. That has been Barings only exit so far.         
	The company has invested $65 million in financial services firm Sharekhan and $44 million in Karvy Stock Broking Limited.        
	Transactions done by Baring Private Equity Asia this year included a $43-million investment in Chinas Solar Giga and the acquisition of Japanese payroll outsourcing company Pasona ADP Payroll from Automatic Data Processing Inc and Pasona Group Inc.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ramesh: Good neighbour                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: India is exploring the possibility of allowing investment from Pakistan on a case-by-case basis.        
	Security is a big concern, but we can consider FDI on a case-by-case basis if relations between the two countries improve, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce, said here today.        
	Pakistan is the only country on Indias negative FDI list.         
	After Bangladesh was recently removed from the negative list, many companies in Dhaka had expressed interest in setting up units in India, especially in the Northeast, Ramesh said.         
	Analysts feel South Asian nations cannot be isolated from the globalisation process and economic integration among them is necessary.         
	Ramesh said trade between India and Pakistan across the Line of Control would begin on October 21.         
	Around Rs 20 crore will be spent in the next 12 months to create trade infrastructure. A sum of Rs 5 crore has been sanctioned. Trade is scheduled to start on October 21 on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route and on October 28 on the Poonch-Rawalakot route.        
	India will formally sign a free trade agreement with Asean around December 18, Ramesh said. Talks on investment and services were expected to begin once the deal had been signed, he said.

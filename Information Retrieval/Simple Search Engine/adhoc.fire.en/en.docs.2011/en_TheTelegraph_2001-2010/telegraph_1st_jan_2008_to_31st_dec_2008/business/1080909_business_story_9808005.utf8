	Mumbai, Sept. 8: The son is rising at Sun Pharmaceuticals.        
	Aalok Shanghvi, son of Sun Pharma chairman Dilip Shanghvi, has been inducted into the company as a product executive. Aalok is said to be in his early 20s and his appointment was cleared by the shareholders of the company at the annual general meeting held on Saturday.        
	It is understood that Aalok will join Sun Pharmas marketing department. However, a spokesperson for the company declined to give any further details. Aalok holds 288,000 shares (or 0.18 per cent) in the company.

	Several companies have recently seen the induction of young scions, which is viewed as part of a succession plan.        
	Last year Wipro had announced that Rishad Premji, son of chairman Azim Premji, would join the company. The software services major had said Rishad, who earlier worked with Bain, a global consultancy firm in Europe, would join the company at a level commensurate with his background and experience.         
	Premjis younger son Tariq is reportedly involved with the Azim Premji Foundation.        
	In the pharmaceutical space, too, the younger generation has started to learn the ropes.         
	Nandini Piramal, daughter of Ajay Piramal, is understood to have joined the group in the business development segment at its overseas office. Piramals son Anand heads the groups e-Swasthya project where a nurse communicates ailments of the locals to the doctors, who then prescribe medicines which are later delivered to the people.         
	Sun Pharma was founded in 1983 and focuses on niche speciality segments such as psychiatry and the central nervous system. The company, which had earlier acquired Caraco, is now aiming to take control of Taro Pharmaceuticals, the Israeli drug firm. It recently spun off its research division into a separate company.

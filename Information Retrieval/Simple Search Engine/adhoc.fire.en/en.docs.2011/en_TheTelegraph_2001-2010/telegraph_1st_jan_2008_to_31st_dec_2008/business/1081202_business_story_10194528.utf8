          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Exports fell 12 per cent in October, the first decline in seven years caused by weak demand in the US and Europe.        
	Sources said the government was likely to come out with industry-specific sops this week to boost exports and limit job losses.        
	Exports in October fell to $12.82 billion from $14.59 billion in 2007, with tight credit conditions adding to the problem of weak demand. Imports were up 10.6 per cent to $23.36 billion, pushing trade deficit higher by over 61 per cent to $10.53 billion.        
	The the fall in exports in October is an aberration which will correct in subsequent months. But the export target of $200 billion wont be met this year, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil.        
	Exports during April to October were up 23.7 per cent to $107.8 billion. During this period, trade deficit stood at $73 billion against $45.64 billion a year ago.        
	The (export) target will not be achieved. The grim situation will continue, especially in sectors such as handicrafts, textiles, carpets, marine products, leather and agri products, said Ajay Sahai, director-general of Fieo.        
	D.H. Pai Panandiker, president of the RPG Foundation, said overseas buyers would avoid India for some time because of the Mumbai attacks. Exports are unlikely to pick up fast until the recession in the US and Europe reverses. A fiscal package from the government for exporters looks imminent, he said.        
	Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura, said the demand from developed countries had slackened and the trend was likely to persist in 2009. We expect year-on-year export growth to remain negative until mid-2009, she said.        
	Amit Mitra, secretary- general of Ficci, said, Unless the government comes out with a complete package immediately we may see a further fall in exports in the current year.        
	Sources said the government was likely to offer interest relief to exporters. Leather, textile, gems and jewellery may get more rate relief.        
	Relief on the duty drawback scheme and easy access to long-term credit are also on the cards. Insurance companies offering cover to consignments to risky regions may get incentives.        
	The government will also take steps to promote exports to West Asia and Africa, which have been less affected by the global financial crisis.

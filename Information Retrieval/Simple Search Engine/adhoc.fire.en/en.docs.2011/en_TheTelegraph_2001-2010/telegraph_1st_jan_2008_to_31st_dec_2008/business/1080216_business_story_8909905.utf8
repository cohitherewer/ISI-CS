          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Joining hands                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 15: NPIL Research amp; Development Ltd has entered into an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company to develop and commercialise, in some regions, a select group of Lillys pre-clinical drug candidates covering multiple therapeutic areas.        
	NPIL Research has been recently demerged from Nicholas Piramal India Ltd.         
	In a statement today, NPIL Research said Eli Lilly would pay it $110 million in milestone payments and royalties on sales.        
	According to NPIL Research, the new alliance follows the framework established by an earlier agreement between the duo entered in January last year.         
	It aims to increase productivity in drug development by synergising the strengths of both the companies and equitably sharing risk and reward.        
	The agreement has an innovative component that may improve the chances of success of the programme.         
	Under the terms of the alliance, both NPIL Research and Eli Lilly will independently carry out early clinical development of two separate candidate compounds directed against the same target.         
	Following the evaluation of data from the proof-of-concept studies  trials on a small number of patients  one or more of the drug candidates may be selected for further development.        
	Somesh Sharma, chief executive officer of NPIL Research, said: We are indeed pleased that Lilly has chosen to partner us.

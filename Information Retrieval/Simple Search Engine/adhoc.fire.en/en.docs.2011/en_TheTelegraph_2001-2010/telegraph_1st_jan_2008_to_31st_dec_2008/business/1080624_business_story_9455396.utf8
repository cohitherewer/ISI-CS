                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bunge likes the taste of Corn Products
                              FOOD FOR THOUGHT                            
	New York, June 23 (Reuters): The US fertiliser producer and oilseed processor Bunge Ltd has agreed to buy Corn Products International Inc for $4.4 billion in stock.        
	The company also raised its 2008 earnings forecast range by more than $2 a share.        
	The deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, unites two of the oldest US agricultural businesses and puts Bunge squarely in the business of finished corn products such as starches and sweeteners. The deal will also expand Bunges operations in growth markets and diversify its sources of revenue with a solid cash-flow business, chief executive Alberto Weisser said in a statement.        
	Bunge will exchange each share of Corn Products for $56 in stock. It expects the deal will lead to annual synergy benefits of $100-120 million.        
	Bunge is paying nine times Corn Products expected 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, the journal reported, roughly in line with other recent transactions in the sector.        
	The deal comes as demand for food in developing economies such as India and China is driving up prices for grains such as wheat, corn and soybeans, the journal reported.        
	More demand for fuel and corn for ethanol production is also pushing up prices, something that has led to big profits for major agricultural companies, the report added.        
	The deal is valued at $4.8 billion, including about $414 million of Corn Products net debt. The deal is expected to add to Bunges earnings in 2010. Corn Products shareholders will own about 21 per cent of Bunge once the deal closes.         
	Separately, Bunge raised its 2008 earnings forecast to $9.35-9.65 per share from $7.10-7.40, not counting the effects of the acquisition. Analysts were expecting Bunge to earn $7.59 a share in 2008.        
	We continue to benefit from good fundamentals in our core markets, chief financial officer Jacqualyn Fouse said. Despite higher commodity prices, customer demand has been firm, she added. Still, she said, high prices created challenges in food production and that Bunge would find prudent management of working capital and risk essential in coming months.        
	Bunge, based in White Plains, New York, is the No. 3 player in global farm business by revenue behind Cargill and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. It has more than 25,000 employees. Westchester, Illinois-based Corn Products provides corn syrup to beverage makers such as Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Unilever and Nestle.

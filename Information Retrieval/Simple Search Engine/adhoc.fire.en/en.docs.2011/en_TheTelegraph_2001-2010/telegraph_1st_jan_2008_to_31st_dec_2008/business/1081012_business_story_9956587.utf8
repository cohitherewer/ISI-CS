                              Subbarao in Washington on Saturday. (AP)                            
	Washington, Oct. 11 (PTI): Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao today assured depositors that their money was safe in banks and said the central bank was geared up to inject more liquidity into the countrys financial system.        
	Our banking system is stable and sound. There is no reason for any anxiety or uncertainty, he told reporters here.         
	Subbarao said, We are monitoring the situation on a continuous basis and stand ready to take appropriate, effective and swift action.        
	On the Indian banking system, the governor said they did not have any direct exposure to sub-prime mortgages.         
	The banking sector, through its overseas branches, has some exposure to distressed financial instruments and troubled financial institutions.         
	But this exposure is part of the normal course of their business and is quite small relative to the size of their overall business, said Subbarao, who is here to attend the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.        
	Defunct mortgage loans are the primary reason for the financial crisis sweeping the world.        
	Referring to the turmoil in the stock market, the RBI governor said, What we are witnessing is an indirect knock-on effect of the global financial situation. This is only a reflection of the uncertainty and anxiety in the global financial markets.                           
	Subbarao said, The fundamentals of the Indian economy have been strong and continue to be strong. Our forex and money markets have been functioning in an orderly manner.         
	The RBI governor is expected to make his formal statement to the international monetary and financial committee on Saturday after finance minister P. Chidambaram cancelled his visit at the last minute because of developments back home concerning the ongoing global meltdown and the financial carnage unleashed on Wall Street.

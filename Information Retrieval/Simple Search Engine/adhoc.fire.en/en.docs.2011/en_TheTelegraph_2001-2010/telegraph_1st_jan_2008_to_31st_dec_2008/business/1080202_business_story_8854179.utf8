     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Feb. 1: The sensex surged 584.71 points today, inspired by positive Asian markets and fresh settlements in the futures and options segment. 
    
	The market ended 3.3 per cent up at 18233.42 even though midcap and smallcap stocks suffered marginal losses today. 
    
	The 50-share Nifty at the National Stock Exchange also surged about 180 points to close at 5317.25. 
    
	After opening flat at 17820.67, the market gained huge momentum during the later half of the day as most of the Asian markets gained. Yesterday, the Nasdaq and the S amp;P ended with mixed gains of about 2 per cent each. 
    
	The expiry of F amp; unwinding yesterday also helped the market gain some fresh momentum today, although the amount of rollover was low. 
    
	However, stocks in the midcap and smallcap indices could not match the sort of buying in largecap counters. Market analysts feel that whenever a fresh rollover starts, the first recovery takes place in largecap stocks and then gradually in midcap and smallcap segments. 
    
	The market normally doesnt carry too much of leveraged positions after an F amp; settlement. Moreover, a lot of money that has been refunded to investors today by Reliance Power may have made their way to the secondary market. At these levels, the market looks sustainable unless some global worries again hit it, said Nilesh Shah, deputy managing director of ICICI Prudential MF. 
    
	IT stocks recorded the biggest rally today with gains of 5.77 per cent, led by heavyweights such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro whose stocks jumped by about 6 per cent each. While auto and metals were the other significant gainers today, realty stocks dipped. 
    
	Future Capital debut
    
	Kishore Biyanis Future Capital Holdings today closed its debut trade at an 18.78 per cent premium on the BSE. 
    
	The company listed at Rs 1,081  a premium of Rs 316, or 41.3 per cent, over the issue price of Rs 765  on the NSE.
    
	However, the stock could not sustain its listing gains and drifted lower. 
    
	On the BSE, the stock opened at Rs 1,044, a premium of 36.47 per cent, or Rs 279. It touched a high of Rs 1,100 and a low of Rs 826.10.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infosys guidance fails to lift spirits
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 11: Bangalore-based Infosys Technologies today disappointed despite posting a net profit growth rate of 20.7 per cent for the first quarter ended June 30 that was in line with expectations. The disenchantment came when the IT bellwether did not raise its dollar revenue guidance for the fiscal, though the rupee guidance was revised upwards.        
	Analysts said that the upward revision in the rupee guidance for 2008-09 was entirely because of the depreciation of the rupee and that the environment for IT companies remained challenging.         
	Even the rupee guidance was muted, the analysts said. Infosys has raised it by just 7 per cent compared with the guidance of Rs 19,894 crore given at the end of the last quarter of 2008.        
	It is now between Rs 21,278 crore and Rs 21, 622 crore, a year-on-year expected growth rate of 27.5 per cent to 29.5 per cent.        
	The company also said conditions would be challenging in the future.         
	IT spending among its clients was flat or had decreased marginally.         
	Most of Infosys clients are from the financial services sector which has been hit by the credit crisis.         
	Chief operating officer S.D. Shibulal said the prospect was also not encouraging for its retail vertical.         
	In the current environment, we do not see any opportunity for pricing increases, he said.        
	For the year, Infosys said its earning per share would be between Rs 99.34 and Rs 101.06, a year-on-year growth rate of 21.9 per cent to 24 per cent.         
	According to Rajiv Mehta, research analyst, India Infoline, Overall the performance has been in line with market expectations, except the fact that the bottomline was hit by a Rs 31-crore tax reversal, but that is a very non-business factor.        
	For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, Infosys declared a net profit after tax of Rs 1,302 crore, a year-on-year growth rate of 20.7 per cent.         
	Income grew 28.7 per cent to Rs 4,854 crore.        
	The company added 49 clients during the quarter. There has been a gross addition of 7,182 employees, taking total employee strength to 94,379 as on June 23, 2008.

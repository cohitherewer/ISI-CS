The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude hits $100 a barrel
                                                                                                            Crude hits $100 a barrel
                            
	New York, Jan. 2 (Reuters): Oil vaulted to a record $100 a barrel on Wednesday as violence in Nigeria, tight energy stockpiles and a weaker dollar triggered a surge of speculative buying, dealers said.        
	Oils climb to the psychological triple-digit price sent stocks tumbling on Wall Street and darkened an already gloomy economic outlook in the United States, battered by a housing crisis and credit crunch.        
	Oil hitting $100 a barrel has sparked some concerns about the consumer and inflation, said Todd Salamone, vice-president of research at Schaeffers Investment Research.        
	US crude traded once at $100 a barrel, up $4.02, then eased back to $99.32 during late afternoon trading. London Brent crude rose $3.78 to $97.63.        
	Oil could rise further from here. Its simple supply and demand fundamentals, said Kris Voorspools, energy analyst at Fortis in Brussels.        
	The White House said it would not open up the emergency crude oil reserve to lower prices, while an Opec member said the cartel was powerless to bring the market down from its lofty height.        
	Crude oil prices jumped 58 per cent in 2007, the biggest annual gain this decade, driven by rising demand in China and other developing countries, tight stockpile levels and increased economic turmoil.        
	Weakness in the dollar has added to gains across the commodity sector as investors supported the underlying value of products denominated in the softening currency. Wednesdays price surge of more than 4 per cent came after suspected militant attacks in Nigerias oil city Port Harcourt heightened concern over the potential for further disruptions in shipments from the eighth largest world oil exporter.        
	With the military and the militant warlords engaged in a violent tit-for-tat, the risk for oil disruptions in Nigeria remains higher than in the past few months, said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix.        
	Frequent attacks by militant groups since February 2006 have driven thousands of foreign oil workers from the oil-rich Niger Delta and cut oil exports by about 20 per cent.        
	Investors are also particularly sensitive to signs of further fund investment in commodities at the start of the year. The broad Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index rose nearly 17 per cent in 2007 as the sector rebounded from a loss in 2006.        
	A further decline in US crude stockpiles  already running at a three-year low  was also expected. Weekly government data will be released Thursday, a day later than usual due to the New Year holiday.

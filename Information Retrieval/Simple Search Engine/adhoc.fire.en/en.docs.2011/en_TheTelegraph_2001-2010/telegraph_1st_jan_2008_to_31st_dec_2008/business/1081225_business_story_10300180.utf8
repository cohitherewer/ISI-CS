          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Maruti Suzuki India will consider a further production cut if the market conditions do not improve.        
	Managing director Shinzo Nakanishi said there had been a slowdown in demand across the world, including China, India and other BRIC countries (Brazil and Russia).        
	I hope not, but if we are obliged, then we will do it (cut production), he said.        
	The company had already trimmed production in November by 6.29 per cent to 63,431 units against 67,690 units in the same month last year.        
	Nakanishi said the company did not want inventories to pile up, especially at the dealers end.        
	We are focusing on the network stock. If the stock overflows, we will have to readjust production, he said.        
	Asked if the quantum of the cut would be the same in December, Nakanishi said, I dont think so. I hope it will be less than that in November.        
	He said the company would produce a few per cent less in December compared with the same month last year.        
	In November, the companys passenger car sales dipped 24.88 per cent to 52,097 units.        
	The company, which is negotiating contract manufacturing deals for its A-star with Nissan, expects to start exports for the Japanese car major by February-March next year.        
	We have not finalised the supply volume to Nissan but expect to start by February-March, Nakanishi said.        
	The company had struck a deal in 2006 to make 50,000 cars for Nissan. However, last month chairman R.C. Bhargava said the volume was yet to be finalised.        
	There have been reports that a slowdown in Europe had forced Nissan to cut its sourcing from Maruti to just 10,000 cars.        
	Exports of the A-star for parent Suzuki Motor Corporation will start from January. Japans Suzuki Motor owns 54.2 per cent of Maruti.         
	Automobile sales in India have fallen this year as buyers were put off by a credit crunch, high borrowing costs and a slowing economy, forcing car makers such as Tata Motors to cut output.        
	On the backlog for its hatchback Swift and sedan Dzire, Bhargava said, We are increasing the production of the Swift and the Dzire and that may require some Swifts to be produced in Gurgaon.        
	He, however, said it was just an option that the company was considering at the moment.         
	If we find we cant produce enough in Manesar, we may have to move it, but I dont think it has happened yet. But thats an option that has to be examined, he said.

	Ashok Leyland has cut perks across various levels and is renegotiating pricing contracts with vendors.        
	While we are paying workmen their full wages even during non-working days, their income will be less than what they earned by way of incentives when market demand was high, a company spokesperson said.

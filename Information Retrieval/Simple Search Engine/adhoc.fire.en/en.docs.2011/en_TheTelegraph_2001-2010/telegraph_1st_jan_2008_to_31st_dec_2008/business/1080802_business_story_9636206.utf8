                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata firm for global assets 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chatterjee: Strategic move                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 1: Tata Steel has created an international holding company  Tata Steel Global  which will hold all its overseas steel and mining assets.         
	These include its interest in Corus Group Plc, NatSteel and Tata Steel Thailand (formerly Millennium Steel) apart from its mining properties in countries such as Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Oman and Australia.        
	Singapore-based Tata Steel Global will be a subsidiary of Tata Steel.        
	Tata Steel Global has come into effect today. We will transfer all our existing and future overseas assets and operations to it, Koushik Chatterjee, group chief financial officer, told reporters here today.         
	The holding company, which will have a lean structure, is expected to bring other benefits for the group.        
	Tata Steel Global will be in a better position to raise funds because of its size and diversified spread, Chatterjee said, indicating that the holding company should be in a position to raise finance at attractive rates if Tata Steel decides to go in for more overseas acquisitions.        
	While the enterprise book value of the firm would be around $13 billion, Chatterjee said the group would take a final call on funding any future acquisitions depending on the opportunity and size.         
	It is being speculated that the Tatas may consider unlocking value of this holding company at a later date.        
	The group is, however, on the prowl not only for raw material assets, but also smaller steel units in various geographies that include Asia. Tata Steel has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Vietnam government to set up a 4.5-million-tonne per annum steel plant.        
	Chatterjee said operating profits at both Tata Steel Thailand and NatSteel had increased significantly during the first quarter of this year. Sounding optimistic for the current quarter, he said the international price of the commodity had firmed up. Further, the cash cost for non-integrated steel manufacturers has also risen, putting greater pressure on prices.        
	The current quarter is robust and the group has made a strong start, he said.        
	When asked whether the steel major would raise prices with the commitment given to the government ending next week, Chatterjee said the company was not in a hurry and that a price increase should not necessarily happen next week.

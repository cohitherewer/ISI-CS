  NTPC starts coal mine drill          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, May 12: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) plans to buy majority stakes in Indonesian coal mines by the end of this fiscal.        
	Sources said NTPC was planning to buy a stake in PT Berau, which has reserves of over 550 million tonnes (mt) in East Kalimantan.        
	The state-owned firm has identified three merchant bankers to advise it on the acquisition. However, it did not identify the bankers.        
	We have already appointed three merchant bankers for this and our endeavour is to finalise the stake purchase by the end of this financial year, NTPC chairman R.S. Sharma said.        
	Indonesia has 5.9 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Sumatra has roughly two-thirds of the countrys total reserves. Other mines are at Kalimantan, west Java, and Sulawesi.        
	Sharma said majority stakes in the mines would give the company control over quantity and price.        
	NTPC has also floated a joint venture firm called Coal Ventures International Ltd in partnership with Steel Authority of India Ltd, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd, Coal India Ltd and the National Mineral Development Corporation to secure coal mines abroad.        
	The company plans to add 22,430 megawatt (MW) by 2012 and take its total capacity to 75,000MW by 2017 to meet the countrys rapidly surging power demands.         
	NTPC has a generation capacity of 29,144MW.         
	Sharma said the companys need for coal would more than double in the next five years to about 400 mt. It will need up to 130 mt this fiscal against 122 mt a year ago.        
	The company is also looking at engineering procurement construction contracts in West Asia.        
	Among the Indian firms, Tata Power has acquired a 30 per cent stake in PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin. Reliance Power has also signed a pact to acquire three Indonesian coal mines.        
	Cement maker Binani Group, JSW Energy, Coal India, Lanco Infratech, Madhucon Projects, PTC India, and MMTC are some of the other firms that are depending on Indonesia to source coal.        
	NTPC is also planning to acquire majority stakes in coal blocks in Mozambique and South Africa to bridge a fuel supply shortfall from domestic sources. It is looking at coal mines abroad that can give up to 20 mt of coal per annum.        
	Meanwhile, the company plans to set aside 0.5 per cent of its profits to conduct research on clean coal technology.        
	We will put aside 0.5 per cent (approximately Rs 30 crore) of our annual net profit for this climate research fund, Sharma said.

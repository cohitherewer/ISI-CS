                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Banks lobby for PSU surplus cash
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Chidambaram: Pathfinder                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has invited the heads of some public sector companies to attend a meeting where bank chiefs will also be present.         
	State-run banks have complained that public sector undertakings (PSUs) often disregard government rules and keep their short-term funds with private banks.         
	Under the current policy, PSUs should park surplus funds in term deposits of any scheduled commercial bank that has a paid-up capital of at least Rs 100 crore.         
	According to state-run banks, this business often goes to private banks, which undercut them on interest rates.         
	During the meeting, which is likely to be held tomorrow, public sector banks may ask state-run firms to agree to a cut in deposit rates as they had recently reduced their lending rates.        
	The finance ministry wants at least 60 per cent of the surplus PSU funds to be parked with public sector banks.        
	Public sector units have over Rs 3,00,000 crore of investible reserves which are mostly kept in gilts and fixed deposits till they are used for expansions or other planned expenditure.         
	Many see the finance ministrys move as an effort to shore up the money available with state-run banks.         
	The government wants these banks to lend to several key sectors such as infrastructure and export-oriented industries but banks have been avoiding, citing liquidity problem.        
	Though the Reserve Bank has released over Rs 1,80,000 crore through various measures in recent times, state-run banks are complaining about tight liquidity in the market.        
	Call money rates or the interest on the money lent by banks for overnight use rose to 8 per cent today, while the repo (the rate at which the central bank lends to banks) is 5.5 per cent.         
	Many PSUs invite bids for their short-term deposits. Private banks often undercut state-run rivals in these bidding by over 1 per cent.

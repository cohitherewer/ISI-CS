	Total standalone income rose to rs 3,175.45 crore for the quarter under review from rs 2,758.83 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Surging raw material prices pulled operating profit margin in the automotive segment down to 10.9 per cent from 11.5 per cent a year ago.         
	the company has announced a dividend of 115 per cent  comprising a dividend of 100 per cent and a special dividend of 15 per cent  at the rate of rs 11.5 on shares of face value of rs 10 each.        
	The vehicle maker today said it would invest around Rs 2,000 crore this fiscal, mostly to expand the capacity of its manufacturing plant at Chakan near Pune.         
	Maintaining growth will be challenging in an environment of rising oil prices and volatile steel prices. But we will try not to pass on the entire burden to the customers. Utility vehicles manufactured at M amp;M are always tested for optimum fuel efficiency. The recent rise in oil prices should not be a very big concern for our customers, said Bharat Doshi, executive director and group CFO of M amp;M.         
	The company is also weighing options to enter the two-wheeler segment.         
	We are planning to enter the two-wheeler segment, but it is too early to make any comment. We have to analyse the value proposition before considering any option, Doshi said.         
	The company clocked a net profit of Rs 1,103.4 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2008. Revenues for the fiscal stood at Rs 13,238 crore.         
	The companys automotive segment grew 17.8 per cent in revenues to Rs 7,179.24 crore during the year. In the utility vehicle segment, Mahindras market share increased to 51.5 per cent from 46.6 per cent a year ago.         
	High interest rates and stringent lending norms slackened the companys tractor sales during 2007-08. It sold 90,509 tractors against 95,006 in the previous year, recording a decline of about 4.7 per cent.         
	Sources said M amp;M, which would start selling its Scorpio in the US from 2009, aimed to double its domestic sales and quadruple exports by 2010. The company is focusing on markets in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, and has set up assembly units in Egypt and Brazil.         
	The M amp;M Group reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,571.12 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008.

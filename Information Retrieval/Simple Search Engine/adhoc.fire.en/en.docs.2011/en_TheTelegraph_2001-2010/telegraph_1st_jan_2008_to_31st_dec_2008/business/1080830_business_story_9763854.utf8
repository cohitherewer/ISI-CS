                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata Steel shifts gear at Kalinganagar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Muthuraman in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: Tata Steel has finally started work at its Kalinganagar project in Orissa.        
	B. Muthuraman, managing director of the company, said preliminary work had begun a few weeks back. The company hopes to start production in three years.        
	We started construction in a small way. Boundary wall is being erected, structural fabrication is being done, Muthuraman said on the sidelines of the Tinplate annual general meeting in Calcutta.        
	Tata Steel is running way behind schedule at Kalinganagar as about 700 families refused to vacate the site.        
	However, some of the families have moved out and work has started on the land where they used to reside. The affected families had even taken part in construction work. They are the people who are doing the work, Muthuraman said.        
	The company has placed orders worth Rs 6,500 crore for the first phase of the six-million-tonne plant.        
	On allocation of iron ore mines for the project, Muthuraman said the state government would give its recommendation to the Centre in the next two to three months.        
	Tinplate recast        
	Muthuraman said Tinplate planned to restructure its balance sheet, though he declined to give any details.         
	Tinplate director Koushik Chatterjee said the aim of restructuring was to ensure that the company could take up bigger projects on its own.        
	The process could be completed by next fiscal, he said.        
	On Tinplate merging with parent Tata Steel, Muthuraman said he could not comment.        
	He said last fiscal was an unusual year for the company because of an increase in the prices of raw materials.        
	Globally, most other tinplate firms suffered losses. Corus (a Tata Steel entity) closed its tinplate facility. Given the scenario, Tinplate has done well, he said.

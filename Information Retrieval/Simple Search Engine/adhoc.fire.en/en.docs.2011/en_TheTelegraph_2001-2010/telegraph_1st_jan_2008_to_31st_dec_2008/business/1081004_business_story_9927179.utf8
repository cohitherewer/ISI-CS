          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 3: The sensex today lost 529.35 points as investors fretted over the goings-on in the US.        
	Shares today moved in tandem with the Asian and European bourses. The BSE bellwether slipped below the 13000-mark and closed at 12526.32, a fall of 4.05 per cent from its previous close.         
	Foreign funds were aggressive sellers in heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, Infosys Technologies and ICICI Bank. Reliance tanked Rs 146.30 to close at Rs 1,760.95.        
	The 30-share sensex opened weak at 12899.62 and hit an intra-day low of 12472.61 as weak global trends dampened sentiment.         
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a triple-digit loss because of apprehensions that the $700-billion rescue package is unlikely to revive the troubled financial markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price spiral gives govt a headache
                                                                                                               Price spiral gives govt a headache
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 14: Inflation rose further above 5 per cent in end-February to a nine-month high, and analysts said mounting price pressures would keep monetary policy tight despite more signs this week of slowing growth.        
	The widely watched wholesale price index rose 5.11 per cent in the 12 months to March 1, higher than the previous weeks 5.02 per cent and well above a market forecast of 4.97 per cent.         
	It was the highest since a reading of 5.15 per cent on May 26, 2007, and the second consecutive week above 5 per cent, the level at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wants to limit inflation in the fiscal that ends in March.        
	Inflation is on the rise. It is a matter that causes worry to any government. We are ready to take any fiscal step to keep inflation under check, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, adding the government was willing to take measures on monetary and other front also.        
	He said interest rate was one of the effective steps that could contain inflation and the RBI should be trusted to use it as an instrument to bring the price rise under control.        
	There is scope to reduce interest rate. We must trust the RBI to use the interest rate as an instrument to contain inflation, he said.        
	We seem to be heading towards higher levels of inflation, particularly post-March, when the base effect support withers out, a banking expert said. That will imply that the monetary policy would have to remain restrictive, he added.        
	Highlighting the dilemma facing policymakers, industrial output continued to lose strength in January, growing 5.3 per cent from a year earlier, well below both economists projections and market forecasts of 8 per cent, as the impact of tight monetary policy took its toll on consumer demand.

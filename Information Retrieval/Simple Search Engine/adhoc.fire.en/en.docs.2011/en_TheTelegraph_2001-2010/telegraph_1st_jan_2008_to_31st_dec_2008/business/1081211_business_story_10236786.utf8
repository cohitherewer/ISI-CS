  Apex bank to review growth forecast          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: The Reserve Bank of India is turning increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of the economy.        
	The central bank may lower its growth forecast for 2008-09 in January, during the quarterly review of its policy, and governor Duvvuri Subbarao warned that the worst was yet to come.         
	The next financial year, that is 2009-10, will be a more difficult year, Subbarao said here today after a meeting with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Though the central bank and the government had taken steps to shield the economy from the effects of the global crisis, there would be a period of painful adjustment. Fiscal 2008-09 would be difficult and 2009-10 would also be a difficult year, perhaps more difficult, he said.         
	In the October review of its policy, the RBI had projected a growth rate between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent with a downward bias. Earlier in July, it had revised the rate to 8 per cent from 8.5 per cent.        
	Subbarao said the RBI would take a fresh look at its projections for 2008-09 and 2009-10 when its board meets for the scheduled quarterly review of the monetary policy on January 27.        
	All indications are that it (growth projection for 2008-09) may be revised downwards, Subbarao said.         
	The International Monetary Fund has revised its forecast for global economic growth and for emerging economies, significantly. Reflecting that, we will be reviewing our own numbers when we do policy adjustments in January, the RBI governor said.         
	The IMF has lowered its forecast for the world economy to 2.2 per cent in 2009 from 3 per cent.         
	Subbaraos gloomy outlook came three days after the central bank fired a growth salvo in the form of cuts in the repo and reverse repo rates, which were both reduced by 100 basis points. The repo is short-term borrowings of banks from the RBI, while the reverse repo is bank lending to the RBI.        
	A day after the RBI went on the overdrive, the government, on Sunday, announced a Rs 20,000-crore expenditure programme, a 4 per cent reduction in excise duties plus many other reliefs.        
	Mirroring the RBIs mood, Morgan Stanley today cut its India growth forecast for 2009-10 to 5.3 per cent from 5.7 per cent.        
	The RBI board of governors is meeting here tomorrow to take stock of the economy.        
	World Bank view        
	With global trade expected to contract in 2009 for the first time since 1982, the World Bank has projected that the Indian economy will grow at 5.8 per cent in 2009 from 6.3 per cent estimated for 2008.         
	The impact of the global financial crisis had spread to formerly resilient developing countries, the World Bank said, adding that the slowdown was most pronounced in India and Pakistan among the South Asian countries.         
	However, the Indian economy will revive somewhat to expand by 7.7 per cent in 2010, the World Bank said in its report, Global Economic Prospects, 2009, released yesterday.        
	Global GDP growth will slip from 2.5 per cent in 2008 to 0.9 per cent in 2009, the report said.

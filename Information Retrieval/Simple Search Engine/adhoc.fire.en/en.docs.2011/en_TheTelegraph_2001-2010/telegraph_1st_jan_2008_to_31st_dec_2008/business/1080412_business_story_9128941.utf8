	New Delhi, April 11: The Centre today banned the export of cement and withdrew incentives on steel as part of a desperate effort to tame inflation which hit a 40-month high of 7.41 per cent, drawing sharp criticism from gleeful political opponents.         
	The annual foreign trade policy, announced today by commerce minister Kamal Nath, focused this time more on busting the price spiral rather than on incentives to help exporters hit by the rising rupee.        
	If there is a supply side constraint in a country, leading to rise in prices in cement and steel, we dont want to incentivise it. So, all incentives on steel are being withdrawn, Nath told reporters.        
	Officials said more steps were in the works that could include higher duties on iron ore exports and importing cement from Pakistan.        
	The latest decisions were seen as baby steps that could at best arrest rising prices rather than reverse them. The impact could at best be marginal... not much cement was being exported and the move on steel will not make a great difference, said D. Joshi, chief economist with market research agency Crisil.        
	But todays inflation figures rode on the back of a sharp rise in the prices of both vegetables and metals. Vegetable prices rose the highest by 4.1 per cent within the space of one week ended March 29  a factor that may well weigh on the minds of many a voter when Karnataka goes to elections next month.         
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: It is now clear that the government has failed miserably to control inflation ... it (the cause) is gross mismanagement of the food economy which it is not even trying to correct.         
	The central government threatened to crack down on hoarders and sought to get state governments moving on this. The Centre also announced the import of more food to help cool prices.         
	We are not only concerned but also taking steps, said Kapil Sibal, minister for science and technology, adding: Some of the steps we have taken such as reducing import duty on edible oil has had a salutary impact on prices.         
	The government also trotted out Food and Agriculture Organisation statistics to show Indias inflation figures were lower than that of most BRIC (Brazil, Russia, Indian and China) economies, which are all growing fast. China is facing an inflation rate of 8.7 per cent and Russia 11.9 per cent. Its a global phenomenon, Sibal said.         
	Analysts said while the contention that Indias inflationary spiral was part of a global phenomenon was correct, it would hardly sell with voters hit by a shrinking kitchen basket. Inflation is real and faced with such a situation, people rarely listen to slogans explaining it away, said S.P. Gupta, a former member of the Planning Commission.         
	Hot-rolled steel prices are now ruling at over Rs 42,000 a tonne and is not expected to come down. Several steel companies are threatening to raise prices on the back of rising input costs, unless the government reduces railway freight and grants other concessions.

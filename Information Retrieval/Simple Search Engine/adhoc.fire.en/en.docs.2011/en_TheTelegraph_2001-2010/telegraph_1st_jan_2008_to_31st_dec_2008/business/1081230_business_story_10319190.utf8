          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today discussed the economy with RBI governor D. Subbarao amid heightened expectations over the central bank cutting rates.         
	Singh is believed to have heard out Subbarao for more than an hour.        
	Top finance ministry officials said they were in favour of a cut in key overnight lending rates as inflation was expected to come down to near 6 per cent this week.        
	Subbarao did not speak to reporters after coming out of the Prime Ministers residence.        
	The officials said any rate cut should coincide with the governments second stimulus package which was expected this week.        
	They said overall GDP growth in the second half could slow down to just over 6 per cent, necessitating stimuli in the form of interest rate and tax cuts.        
	The RBI has already cut its overnight lending rate, known as the repo, to 6.5 per cent and the reverse repo, or the rate at which the central bank borrows from other banks, to 5 per cent.        
	Growth in 2006-07 and 2007-08 had been around 9 per cent, but was expected to be around 7 per cent this fiscal.        
	Industry, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the gross domestic product, grew by a mere 4.8 per cent in April-September and was likely to maintain the rate in the third quarter.

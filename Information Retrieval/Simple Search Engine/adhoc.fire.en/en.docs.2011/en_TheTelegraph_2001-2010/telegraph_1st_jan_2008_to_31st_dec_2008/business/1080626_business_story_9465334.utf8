	Mumbai, June 25: Short-covering today came to the rescue of stock markets, which went into a tailspin following last nights hike in the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio by the Reserve Bank of India.         
	After hitting a years low, the BSE bellwether staged a turnaround to end higher by 113.49 points, or 0.80 per cent, at 14220.07 points.        
	Most of the sectoral indices of the BSE barring FMCG, banking and IT ended in the green. Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries ended higher.        
	Experts, however, remain cautious. They said stocks were not yet out of the woods.

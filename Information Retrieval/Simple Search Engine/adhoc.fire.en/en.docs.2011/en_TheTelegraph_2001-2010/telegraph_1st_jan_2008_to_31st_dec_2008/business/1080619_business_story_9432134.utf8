The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Indian firm counts Lipitor gain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indian firm counts Lipitor gain
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 18: Ranbaxy Laboratories stands to rake in at least $1.5 billion once it starts selling the generic version of Lipitor in the US and seven other countries from November 2011.        
	Ranbaxy will get a 180-day exclusivity period in the US and a first mover advantage of around four months in other nations.        
	Industry experts say the settlement of the patent spat is the biggest in the pharmaceutical industry  and it will free Ranbaxy from a crippling burden of legal costs.        
	At the same time, Pfizer also stands to gain. Analysts had estimated that Ranbaxy would enter the generic Lipitor market in March 2010, when the main patent expires. Therefore, Pfizer will get an additional 20 months from this period.        
	Pfizer has been under pressure in recent times. Even as it halted tests on Torcetrapib  another cholesterol-lowering drug which is expected to replace Lipitor, it decided not to go ahead with sales of its inhaled insulin Exubera.         
	Analysts have been pointing out that the company now has a lower number of new molecules that are undergoing clinical tests than earlier.        
	The deal is positive as there is certainty about the launch now and moreover, Ranbaxy will not have any legal hurdles even as it saves on legal costs, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, pharmaceutical analyst at Angel Broking.        
	Market circles say the deal with Pfizer should see the Ranbaxy stock climbing on the stock exchanges in the next few days.         
	The share closed today at Rs 598.20, a gain of nearly 3 per cent over its previous close.

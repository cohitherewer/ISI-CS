The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance flags off KG drill with oil
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reliance flags off KG drill with oil
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Mukesh and Nita Ambani hold bottles of crude oil from the KG basin in Thane on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 21: Reliance Industries  the countrys largest private company  today announced that it had started pumping crude oil in a small way from its Dhirubhai-6 field in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin but had decided to delay gas production at least till January.         
	Chairman Mukesh Ambani told reporters here today that RIL had started producing crude oil at the rate of 5,000 barrels a day but would ramp up production to 550,000 barrels a day over the next six to eight quarters.         
	The KG basin has some of the largest gas fields in the country. Dhirubhai-6 is the biggest gusher in the basin where 90 per cent of the reserves are in the form of gas.         
	The D6 block will bring down Indias import bill by $20 billion, Ambani said.         
	Over the last two years, RIL has been embroiled in lawsuits with Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) over the pricing of gas and assured supplies.         
	Mukesh Ambani said the gas flowing out of the production wells was being pumped back into the ground through a reverse injection process, presumably until the courts came up with their verdict on the lawsuits.        
	The delay in gas production is not under our control. We have a tight supply chain. We also believe the courts will decide on the cases in the near future  sooner than later, said RIL (oil and gas) president and chief executive officer P.M.S. Prasad, referring to Bombay High Courts stay on RILs sale of gas.         
	On how the company would progress if the court refused to lift the stay on the sale of gas, he said, We still have faith in the system.         
	RIL had set an internal target of starting production by the third quarter of this year, while the official target had always been the second half of 2008-2009, said Prasad.         
	In 2002, RIL had agreed to supply gas to NTPC at a price of $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu). Just before the Reliance empire formally split in January 2006, it agreed to supply 28 million cubic metres of gas a day to RNRL at the same price.         
	The petroleum ministry rejected the price, saying it was not arrived at through an arms length pricing mechanism. Last year, the government approved a selling price of $4.21 per mBtu for the gas.         
	Meanwhile, RIL will sell oil in small amounts initially by signing spot contracts with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited  the two companies who have bid for deliveries on the east coast.         
	We will take a further call after we raise production to over 40,000 barrels a day, Prasad said. On whether the company would bring in an equity partner for the KG basin, he said we might, if we see a value proposition.         
	Dig at Anil         
	Mukesh Ambani couldnt resist a dig at younger brother Anil Ambani.         
	I learnt from my father that the challenge of value creation lies in building real assets. He taught me to keep away from the attraction of paper wealth. That is why I have always dismissed much advertised attention towards financial gamesmanship, Ambani said.         
	This (KG basin) is an unparalleled feat because it is the result of a vision realised by commitment and hard work with internal resources and risk capital. Not with borrowings and collaterals, he said.         
	RIL has submitted two development plans for the fields it operates in the KG basin, which have estimated reserves of 2.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.         
	The company is preparing a third development plan in which it talks of eight new finds. The KG-D6 block was awarded to RIL under Nelp-I. RIL holds a 90 per cent participating interest while Niko Resources of Canada holds the rest.

	New Delhi, June 2: The Congress-led government is unwilling to go with the Lefts demand of imposing a tax on the windfall profits of private refiners.        
	Top officials said the government preferred reducing customs duties, releasing more debt bonds to state-run oil companies and selective, though marginal, price increases of petroleum products to bail out the companies who have been buying crude at high rates globally and selling them cheap in India.         
	However, the officials said the exact contours of the formula had till now remained elusive because of differences between the Congress-led coalition and the Left as well as within the coalition. They, however, expected a resolution within this week.         
	The government feels a tax on the profits of private refiners will merely act as a disincentive to export which various government committees have sought to encourage.         
	The CPM has, however, been arguing in favour of the tax on the profits, which companies such as Reliance and Essar have managed to earn through exports by taking advantage of the global oil price surge.        
	The Left and several economists justify the tax, imposed once in the US in 1980, on the grounds of the Indian refiners receiving oil and gas acreages when global crude oil prices stood at $30-35 a barrel against prices of around $130 a barrel now.         
	Analysts said the move, if accepted, would be similar to the tax imposed on steel exports or on basmati exports  an attempt to get something out of the windfall profit which companies are earning on account of a sudden surge in global commodity prices.        
	North Block (finance ministry) is unlikely to agree with the profit tax or a price stabilisation fund we have been suggesting, said Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader. The Left has tried to be constructive this time round with its formulations on oil. Instead of just demanding steps by the Centre, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has said that the party has asked the Left-ruled states to do something on duty cuts.        
	The government is also considering an increase in petrol prices by Rs 2-4 a litre and domestic LPG prices by Rs 20 a cylinder.         
	It is likely to leave the diesel rates unchanged. Higher diesel prices tend to make essential commodities costlier as these are carried by trucks which run on diesel.        
	Sources said the petroleum ministry and the finance ministry were still discussing the extent of the import duty cut and the amount of bonds for the state-owned oil companies.         
	The petroleum ministry is demanding the import duty to be reduced from five per cent to zero, while the finance ministry favours a cut of 2 per cent.        
	Officials said the amount of oil bonds would depend on the duty cut and the hike in the prices of petrol and diesel.         
	The petroleum ministry is demanding an increase of Rs 10 a litre for petrol, Rs 5 a litre for diesel and Rs 50 for a domestic LPG cylinder.        
	The state-owned oil marketing companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd  are projecting an under-recovery, or the difference between the global price of crude and the domestic retail price of petroleum products, at Rs 2,35,000 crore in 2008-09, three times more than what it was last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal India fares well
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coal India fares well
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 6: Coal India today reported a profit before tax of Rs 9,576.22 crore for 2007-08 on the back of a 5.1 per cent increase in production to 379.49 million tonnes over the previous year.        
	The profit figure is provisional, pending the final audit of accounts and without provisioning for wage revision, said Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya. However, on a like-to-like basis, this is 12.37 per cent more than the Rs 8,522.22-crore profit in the previous fiscal, he added.        
	A wage revision is under negotiation and, if agreed upon, Coal India will have to pay the arrear of the past 21 months. A 15 per cent increase in salary will mean an expenditure of Rs 1,400 crore towards the arrear payment. A 22 per cent increase in wages was agreed upon at the last settlement, Bhattacharyya said.         
	Coal Indias sales revenue in 2007-08 is also expected to be more than Rs 40,000 crore compared with Rs 35,000 crore a year ago. The company has already paid the government an interim dividend of Rs 1,705 crore.        
	However, Coal Indias performance was dampened by Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL), one of its nine coal producing subsidiaries. While all the other subsidiaries posted an improved performance in terms of production and profitability, ECL suffered a loss of Rs 647 crore after a 9.35-million-tonne (mt) shortfall in production from the target. ECL produced 24.06 mt last fiscal, which was 6.41 mt less than in 2006-07.         
	ECL could not achieve its production target because the outsourcing contract for the Rajmahal project could not be finalised. Bid prices were not remunerative, Bhattacharyya said.         
	The subsidiary also failed to do some preparatory work. This problem (relating to hired patches) was mostly solved in the last financial year and ECL is expected to achieve its production target of 31 mt in 2008-09, the chairman added.        
	Coal India aims to produce 520.5 mt in the last year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12), 44.2 per cent more than the 360.9 mt it produced in 2006-07, the final year of the Tenth Plan. This means the company will have to increase its raw coal production at the rate of 7.6 per cent in every year of the Eleventh Plan.

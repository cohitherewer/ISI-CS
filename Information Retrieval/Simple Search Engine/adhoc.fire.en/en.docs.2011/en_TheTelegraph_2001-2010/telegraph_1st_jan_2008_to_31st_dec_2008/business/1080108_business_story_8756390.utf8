     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: Companies will be looking to lure investors with a wide range of stock offerings this year. The forecast: a capital raising of Rs 75,000 crore from anywhere between 150 to 175 public issues.
    
	Prime, which tracks capital market issues, says 2008 will go down as the year when companies will seek to raise the highest amount of capital from the markets.
    
	During 2007, companies raised Rs 45,176 crore.
    
	The year begins with Reliance Powers initial public offering (IPO), which is touted as the biggest public issue of all time: at least Rs 10,500 crore. Until now, realty player DLF raised the most amount from a public issue at Rs 9,187.5 crore last year.
    
	The buoyant secondary markets and handsome post-listing gains on almost all the IPOs in the last two years are only seen as an additional incentive for IPOs and the follow-on public offerings (FPOs) during this year.
    
	Prithvi Haldea of Prime says companies will raise about Rs 60,000 crore through IPOs and the remaining Rs 15,000 crore through FPOs. 
    
	He pointed out that even if only the 70 documents filed with market regulator Sebi were to materialise, they would mobilise over Rs 35,000 crore.
    
	Analysts feel the cumulative market capitalisation of all the listed companies in India will grow to Rs 100,00,000 crore from more than Rs 75,00,000 crore.
    
	The IPOs are coming at a time when the secondary markets are poised at record levels and they have decoupled from overseas developments. Haldea said while the issuer pipeline was strong, the investors appetite was also huge. 
    
	The myth of the shallowness of the Indian market has been totally dispelled; almost all the issues over past three years have received very high oversubscriptions, he said.
    
	Haldea said unlike in the past, almost all prospective issuers are well established companies and/or promoters, planning to raise fresh capital for expansion or there are divestments by venture capitalists and in some cases follow-on offerings, all auguring well for the investors, the capital market and the economy.
    
	The other mega issues that are expected to hit the market this year include Emaar MFG, UTI AMC, Sterlite Energy, JSW Energy and Oil India. 
    
	Power, real estate and financial services are expected to dominate the primary market issues.

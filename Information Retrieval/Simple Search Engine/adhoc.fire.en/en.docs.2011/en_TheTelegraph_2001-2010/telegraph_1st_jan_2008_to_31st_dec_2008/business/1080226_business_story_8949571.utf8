The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Push for Goa SEZ consensus
                                                                                                               Push for Goa SEZ consensus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pillai: Seeking solution                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The board of approval for special economic zones (SEZs) today decided to hold discussions with the Goa government on the future of the three notified SEZs in the state.        
	On December 31, the Goa government had asked the Centre to scrap all SEZs in the state, following political opposition and charges of irregularities in the allocation of land.        
	Besides the three notified SEZs, the board also issued showcause notices to the 12 developers who had received formal approvals to set up SEZs in the state. They would have to explain why the permission granted to them should not be cancelled.        
	According to commerce secretary G.K. Pillai, (As regards) all the formal and in-principle approvals given to SEZs in Goa, the board will issue showcause notices to them (developers) in the light of the recommendation of the state government following the principle of natural justice. quot;        
	The three notified SEZs are Meditab Specialities, Peninsula Pharma Research Centre and K Raheja Corp.        
	Meditab, promoted by Cipla, has already started work on its SEZ and reportedly pumped in about Rs 500 crore.         
	Compensation call        
	Sources said the law ministry had recommended discussions on compensation to the SEZ developers.         
	In its discussions with the state government, the Centre will look for solutions that do not affect investor confidence, while ensuring an out of court settlement.        
	Officials said the commerce ministry was in favour of a denotification but wanted industry in the zones to carry on their operations.        
	Pillai said that the SEZ proposals that had earlier been recommended by the state government to the Centre but were yet to come before the board would be treated as withdrawn.        
	Goa is the first Congress-ruled state to have gone back on SEZs. There have been protests against SEZs in several states, including West Bengal, Maharashtra and Haryana.        
	When Goa demanded the scrapping of SEZs, the Centre had initially maintained that there was no provision in the SEZ Act to denotify these zones. However, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath had subsequently said that the government could review the act.        
	Formal approvals        
	The government today approved 10 more proposals for SEZs, including those of Videocon Realty and Mahindra World City.         
	Videocons is for a 10-hectare zone in Siliguri for IT and ITeS firms and electronic hardware units. Videocon had earlier received an in-principle approval and got the formal approval today.        
	The board of approval, chaired by Pillai, met here and took up 14 proposals, including three in-principle conversions to formal approval.        
	Formal approval was granted to the 103-hectare transport engineering goods zone of State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd (Sipcot) as well as to a mineral-based products SEZ of Madhya Pradesh Audyogik Kendra Vikas Ltd.        
	Wardha Power Companys 102-hectare SEZ in Maharashtra and Anant Raj Industries IT zone in Haryana were also given formal approvals. Mahindra World Citys 103-hectare handicraft and 104-hectare light engineering zones in Rajasthan were also approved.        
	So far the board has given formal approvals to 439 SEZs, of which the government has notified 201.

          ANIRUDH LASKAR                           Mehrotra: Hopeful                                  
	Mumbai, May 25: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) aims to garner Rs 57,000 crore in new business premium in 2008-09, about 30 per cent more than the Rs 43,812.86 crore it had mopped up in the previous fiscal.        
	The insurer, which is expanding its presence in Southeast Asia and the West, expects about 5 per cent of the overall premium to come from its overseas businesses.        
	We have started operations in Sri Lanka and want to give impetus to our international business. We will soon open a representative office in Singapore, which will be followed by offices in New Zealand and the US. Our overseas operations contribute a very small portion to the overall premium collection, but we expect to scale up the contribution to at least 5 per cent this year, managing director D. K. Mehrotra told The Telegraph.         
	The insurance company recently announced that it would shift focus from unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) to traditional insurance plans to ensure long-term growth.         
	Ulips contributed Rs 37,667.66 crore, or about 86 per cent, to the LICs income from new business premium in 2007-08. The company sold 1.79 crore conventional policies in the year, reaping a first premium of just Rs 6,145.19 crore.         
	We are concentrating more on selling conventional plans than Ulips now. Our target is to attain a ratio of 70:30 between Ulips and traditional products, respectively, this year. To achieve this, we will reposition our old trustworthy brands and emphasise more on selling them. Traditional products ensure long-term growth for the company as well as the industry, Mehrotra said.         
	Market Plus, a unit-linked plan from the LIC now closed for sale, was the companys best-selling product in 2007-08. It alone collected about 53.61 per cent of the companys premia in 2007-08.         
	Money Plus and New Bima Gold were also very popular and made 16.76 per cent and 2.09 per cent, respectively, of the insurers new business premium during the year. Of the total number of policies sold by the LIC during the last fiscal, 22.34 per cent were Market Plus, 19.54 per cent were Money Plus and 10.23 per cent were New Bima Gold.

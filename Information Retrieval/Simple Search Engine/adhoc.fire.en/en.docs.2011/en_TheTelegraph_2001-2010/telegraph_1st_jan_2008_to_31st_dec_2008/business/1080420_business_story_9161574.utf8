          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          SWALLOW THIS                                  
	New Delhi, April 19: Dabur Pharma today said its promoters and other shareholders have agreed to sell 73.27 per cent in the company to Fresenius Kabi, the Singapore arm of German healthcare major Fresenius SE.         
	Dabur Pharma is an associate company of Dabur India. Five years back, Dabur had spun off its pharma business into a separate entity.         
	Dabur officials refused to reveal the details of the deal. They, however, confirmed that it was on. Fresenius SE will be announcing the deal at a conference in Germany on Monday, the officials said.        
	Earlier this year, Dabur Pharma, which specialises in anti-cancer drugs, had denied that it was in talks with a foreign drug maker for a partnership or sale.         
	The deal with Fresenius values the Dabur company at about 10 per cent higher than its current market capitalisation of $273 million.        
	Last year, the Delhi-based company had sold its non oncology formulations business to Ahmedabad-based Alembic for Rs 159 crore.         
	Fresenius Kabi, the 100 per cent subsidiary of healthcare major Fresenius SE, recorded sales of 2 billion euros and an operating income of 332 million euros in 2007. The company focuses on segments such as oncology and diabetes.         
	Dabur has a good pipeline of drugs in the anti-cancer segment.         
	The company recently launched its rectum-cancer injection Irinotecan in the US  its fourth product in the North American market. The company has around 12 abbreviated new drug application filings in the US, including a para-IV application.

	New Delhi, June 6: Nissan-Renault Automotive India today started construction of its Rs 4,500-crore passenger car plant in Chennai.         
	This is an important day for Renault, Nissan, our local employees and the community. The new project is a tangible result of the strength and success of the Nissan-Renault alliance and is a clear indicator of the companys long-term strategy for this important market, said Shohei Kimura, managing director of Nissan-Renault.        
	The factory is expected to roll out cars by 2010. It will produce four lakh units annually for the domestic as well as the foreign market.        
	Nissan-Renault is a 50:50 joint venture between Nissan and Renault to manufacture passenger cars in India. The company has a minimum investment plan of Rs 4,500 crore.        
	Last month, the Nissan-Renault alliance entered into a joint venture with two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto to develop, produce and market a low-cost car priced at $2,500 by 2011.        
	Renault also plans to produce cars on the Logan as well as other platforms. It is currently developing a product range to match the needs, tastes and dreams of the Indian customer, the company said.        
	Nissan will produce a family of models, including its compact car Micra based on its new A-platform.         
	While Suzuki has a 50 per cent share of the market, Renault and Nissan have lagged behind rivals in expanding their footprint in India. Renault has a 2.2 per cent share.        
	Other automobile manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have announced a combined investment of $6 billion for India, where car sales are expected to double by 2013.

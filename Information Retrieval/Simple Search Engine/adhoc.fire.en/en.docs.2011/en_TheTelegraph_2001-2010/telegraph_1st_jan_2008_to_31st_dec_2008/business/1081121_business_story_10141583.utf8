	Calcutta, Nov. 20: The Orissa Mining Corporation, one of the leading suppliers of iron ore to domestic industry, plans to reduce prices by 40-50 per cent following the global trend.        
	The Orissa government undertaking, which sold 4.5 million tonnes of iron ore last year in the spot market, is still holding on to the heady heights that ore prices reached earlier this year.        
	Santosh Sarangi, managing director of Orissa Mining, said he expected prices to come down in the fresh tenders.        
	The price cut will provide a much needed relief to the steel industry, which has reduced production amid low profitability.         
	Many sponge iron units have downed shutters as they could not compete with the free fall in international scrap prices.        
	Sponge iron and scrap can both be used as raw material to make steel through an electric arc furnace.         
	Reduced iron ore prices will revive the fortunes of the sponge iron makers in the eastern region.        
	A cut in prices by the Orissa Mining is expected to boost demand and may help it to achieve its target of 6 million tonnes of production in 2007-08.        
	However, the company has braced itself for lower sales turnover in this fiscal.        
	We will clock a turnover of Rs 2,000-2200 crore compared with the earlier target of Rs 3,000 crore, Sarangi said.         
	He was in Calcutta to participate in the Biz-Bridge Resurgent East seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	Orissa Mining will enter coal mining next year, Sarangi said. It has received three shared coal blocks.

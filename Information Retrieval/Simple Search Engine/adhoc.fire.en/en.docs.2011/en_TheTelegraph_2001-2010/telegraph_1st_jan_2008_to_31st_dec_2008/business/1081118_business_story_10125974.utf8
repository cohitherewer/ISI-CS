	Nov. 17: Vikram Pandit-led financial services giant Citigroup today said it would cut more than 52,000 jobs in the coming months and reduce expenses by 20 per cent in 2009.        
	Citi today said it intended to reduce the total head count to less than 300,000 in the near term. The financial services leader had a workforce of 352,000 in the third quarter of 2008.        
	The head count is expected to be down 20 per cent in the near term from peak levels, the company said today.        
	The bank, severely battered by the financial crisis, has suffered huge losses in recent quarters. In the third quarter, Citi had a loss of $2.8 billion.        
	In terms of expenses, the financial services firm aims to save $50-52 billion in 2009. Expenses are expected to be down 20 per cent from peak levels, the firm said.        
	Citi has lost $20.3 billion last year, and analysts expect it to lose money this quarter, while some believe it may not be profitable in 2009 as well.        
	However, Citi said underlying business remained strong and that revenues were stable.        
	At the end of the fourth quarter of 2007, the companys head count stood at 3,75,000. In the first three quarters of this year, the company has reduced its workforce by about 23,000.         
	Citigroup has also axed several employees across businesses and management cadres in India.         
	Sources said, Each country has to come up with its numbers. There have been redundancies where there is a duplication of job descriptions. Employees have been asked to go from different Citigroup entities in India. Some of them have got a golden handshake.         
	Citigroups entities in India include Citibank NA, Citi Corp Finance Limited, Citigroup Global Markets, CitiFinancial, Citigroup private bank and Citigroup Technology Services. Citigroup has 11,000 employees in India.        
	Pandit became Citigroup chief executive last December, and has faced much criticism from investors and others for failing to implement a workable turnaround plan.

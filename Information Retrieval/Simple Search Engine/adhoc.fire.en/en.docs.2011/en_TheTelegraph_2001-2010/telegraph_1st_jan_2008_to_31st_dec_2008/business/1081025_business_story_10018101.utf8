										      GUEST COLUMN - Amitabh Chakraborty                        
	The Indian markets opened for trading with a negative bias as Sony and Toyota raised concerns about their future earnings because of a looming recession. Inevitably, the Asian markets traded lower. The Korean economy grew at the slowest pace, resulting in a 10 per cent fall in the Kospi.         
	During the day, the Reserve Bank of India maintained status quo in its credit policy, belying the expectations of a further rate cut. This exacerbated the selling pressure on the sensex, which plunged 1070 points, closing 11 per cent down at 8701.         
	There was some serious selling pressure in the latter part of the trade once European markets opened in the negative zone after the UK reported lower than estimated GDP numbers, which was indicative of a recession. That sparked an earnings downgrade.         
	Meanwhile, the dollar has gained against all currencies except the yen even as the carry trades are being unwound and leverage pulled.         
	Heres how Investopedia defines a yen carry trade: a trader borrows 1,000 yen from a Japanese bank, converts the funds into US dollars and buys a bond for the equivalent amount. Lets assume that the bond pays 4.5 per cent and the Japanese interest rate is set at zero per cent.         
	The trader stands to make a profit of 4.5 per cent as long as the exchange rate between the countries does not change. Many professional traders use this trade because the gains can become very large when leverage is taken into consideration. If the trader in our example uses a common leverage factor of 10:1, he can stand to make a profit of 45 per cent.         
	The big risk in a carry trade is the uncertainty of exchange rates. Using the example above, if the US dollar was to fall in value relative to the Japanese yen, then the trader would run the risk of losing money. Also, these transactions are generally done with a lot of leverage, so a small movement in exchange rates can result in huge losses unless hedged appropriately.        
	The unwinding of the yen carry trades has sparked aggressive selling by the FIIs in India, who are facing wide-scale margin calls. Some companies are also facing margin calls from local brokers, with very little buying support coming in from the domestic insurance entities.         
	Trading was halted in the Dow and S amp;P futures, adding to the gloom that hovers over the Indian markets. Fresh shorts have been created as the Nifty discount has widened.         
	There was selling pressure from arbitrageurs who unloaded cash positions, unable to roll over the position due to uncertainty ahead of a truncated settlement next week. With FIIs forced to sell because of redemption pressure and little buying support from other quarter, stocks such as Unitech, Suzlon, IVRCL and DLF plunged more than 24 per cent each.         
	But it now seems we are very near to the bottom and risk-reward is finally turning favourable. One could start deploying 10 to 15 per cent of liquidity in frontline bluechips such as L amp;T, SBI, HDFC Bank and Bhel with a 15 to 20 per cent return expectation in three to six months time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax sops for tech firms on agenda
                                                                                                            Tax sops for tech firms on agenda
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: The government may consider extending the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) scheme beyond March 2009 in the coming budget.         
	Under the STPI scheme, software companies enjoy a 100 per cent tax deduction on profits under Section 10A and Section 10B of the income tax act. However, the facility is scheduled to be withdrawn after March 31, 2009.         
	The finance ministry is also exploring the possibility of extending the service tax exemptions for special economic zones to software parks and IT export units. The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has appealed to the finance ministry to extend the duration of the tax exemptions under the software parks scheme in its pre-budget memorandum.         
	According to Nasscom president Som Mittal, The STPI scheme has helped in the growth of small and medium software and BPO companies. Doing away with the tax exemptions at this juncture will hurt the IT sectors long-term growth prospects, he added.         
	Nasscom is of the view that an extension is important for India to remain competitive on the global platform. China and the Philippines are offering 10-year tax holidays, Mittal said.         
	The department of information technology is also pushing for a two-year extension of the tax sops.         
	We are asking the finance ministry to extend these sops for at least two years. This is important for the smaller players, said officials. In the absence of these deductions, they said, companies will have to pay taxes at a rate of 33.99 per cent that is applicable for Indian companies.        
	At present, IT companies are paying only a minimum alternate tax of 11.33 per cent.         
	Communications and information technology minister A. Raja has also written to finance minister P. Chidambaram for a 10-year extension of the scheme. Officials said the finance ministry was likely to take a favourable decision.         
	An Indian Council of Research on International Economic Relations study has also recommended the continuation of the income tax exemptions.

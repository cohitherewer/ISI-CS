          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The government is mulling a cut in fuel prices before Diwali, though a final decision will hinge on the outcome of tomorrows meeting of the crude oil cartel and the movement of the rupee against the dollar.         
	The matter (fuel price cut) is being examined and an announcement will be made within a week, petroleum minister Murli Deora said in the Lok Sabha today.        
	The ministers comments sparked off speculation that prices could be slashed before Diwali, a politically expedient move given that six states are going to the polls next month.         
	Deora, however, later clarified that the government had not committed itself to reducing prices and tomorrows meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) would be crucial.        
	Opec is likely to agree on a production cut to shore up global crude prices which have fallen from their peak of about $150 a barrel in July to $67 a barrel now.        
	We are watching the international oil price trend very closely. Opec is meeting tomorrow and we will see what happens, Deora said.        
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said any reduction would be a marginal one.         
	Govinda Rao, member of the Prime Ministers economic advisory panel, ruled out any reduction in prices.         
	The global crude prices have fallen, but the rupee has weakened sharply. The crude prices have fallen in dollar terms, but in rupee terms they have not. So there is no case for any reduction in petroleum prices now, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Naik in Mumbai on Thursday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, May 29: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T), the Rs 25,187-crore engineering major, today announced a 1:1 bonus issue  its second in as many years  after notching up 55 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 2,173.42 crore for the year ended March 31.        
	The company will issue one bonus share of Rs 2 each for every equity share held. It is spicing up the offer with a final dividend of Rs 15 per share and a special dividend of Rs 2 per share.        
	Company officials said the windfall gain for shareholders was a result of the company creating a cash mountain of over Rs 10,000 crore this year.        
	The companys equity capital hovers around Rs 60 crore, which will go up marginally with this issue. It also happens to be the companys 70th year of operation, the official added.         
	In June 2006, the company made a bonus issue in the ratio 1:1, the first in 20 years.        
	The L amp;T stock rose Rs 180, or 6.64 per cent, to close at Rs 2,889.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	The company will list its IT arm L amp;T Infotech in financial year 2009-2010, said company chairman and managing director A.M. Naik.        
	It then plans to list the financial services arm and the developmental projects holding company with a gap of one year between them.        
	L amp;T posted a profit after tax of Rs 967 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, a 38 per cent growth rate, compared with Rs 710 crore posted in the same quarter a year ago.         
	Operating profit for the year grew 54 per cent to Rs 3,405 crore, an improvement of one per cent in operating margins over the previous year.        
	The order book for the companys flagship engineering division was at Rs 50,931 crore. A capital expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore has been earmarked for the current fiscal.        
	On whether the company was affected by rising inflation, Naik said, We work in priority sectors and have reorganised ourselves into 15 operating companies to hedge against a slowdown.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 1: The State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys largest lender, today said it might decide to increase the interest rate on housing loan by up to 50 basis points in a weeks time.        
	It had raised its prime lending rate (PLR) by 50 basis points to 12.75 per cent last week, after the Reserve Bank of Indias aggressive tightened monetary policy manoeuvres.         
	The PLR is the reference rate for determining all loans.        
	We raised the prime lending rate by 50 basis points so the rise (in home loan rate) will not be more than that, said .P. Bhatt, chairman of the SBI.        
	An increase in the interest rate by half a percentage point on a 20-year home loan leads to an equated monthly instalment (EMI) increase of about 4 per cent.         
	In the last three years, home loans have soared from 7.5 per cent to 11.5 per cent. This has led to an increase in EMI by almost 35 per cent.         
	Four state-run banks on Monday said they would raise their prime lending rates from today. Apart from Vijaya Bank, which raised its PLR by 25 basis points to 13.25 per cent, the increase is 50 basis points for the remaining banks.         
	While the Bank of India has increased its PLR to 13.25 per cent from 12.75 per cent, Allahabad Bank and Dena Bank raised their rates to 13.50 per cent each.         
	The increase in PLR would get reflected in these banks floating and fixed home loan rates.         
	Our home loan rates will increase in tandem with the PLR hike, which is 25 basis points, said Prakash P. Mallya, chairman and managing director, Vijaya Bank. We are not looking at any additional rate hike, he added.        
	Bhatt said if the home loan rates were revised, it would be applicable on new borrowers and not existing ones.        
	Bhatt, however, said he did not expect a decline in home loan growth as data for the first two months of the fiscal showed strong growth.        
	In the two months of April and May, for which I have data, we have disbursed more money on account of home loans than we did in the corresponding period of last year, he said.

	Mumbai, July 30: Strong global cues and lower crude oil prices today prompted investors to overlook the implications of higher interest rates posed by the Reserve Banks steep rate hike yesterday.         
	The 30-share benchmark sensex today surged nearly 496 points erasing most of the losses suffered yesterday.         
	Strong global markets set the stage for the rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index were up 2.39 per cent and 2.45 per cent, respectively, following a jump in US consumer confidence and a fall in global crude oil prices to around $122 a barrel. Most of the Asian bourses were also in the green.        
	The momentum was sustained in the day and the markets took the sharp rate increase by the Reserve Bank in its stride today. Therefore, the key to markets remains crude oil prices, an analyst said.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchange sensex opened at 14007.32 and hit an intra-day high of 14322.67 to close at 14287.21, a gain of 495.67 points, or 3.59 per cent, over the previous close.        
	Though the RBI move could affect the balance sheets of banks, there was brisk buying in the banking stocks. The BSE Bankex led the pack of gainers with a rise of 5.21 per cent. Among the key gainers were HDFC, which shot up nearly 8 per cent to Rs 2,273.95, ICICI Bank, which spurted 4.6 per cent to Rs 635.30, and HDFC Bank, which rose 6.2 per cent.        
	Other interest rate sensitive sectors such as realty and auto counters also saw buying interest among investors. Broking circles added that a 3.7 per cent rise in heavyweight Reliance Industries Ltd also contributed to the strong close.        
	On the BSE, market breadth turned sharply positive with 1,784 scrips gaining against 857 losing ground. The trading volume improved further to Rs 5,353.98 crore from Rs 5,103.03 on Tuesday.

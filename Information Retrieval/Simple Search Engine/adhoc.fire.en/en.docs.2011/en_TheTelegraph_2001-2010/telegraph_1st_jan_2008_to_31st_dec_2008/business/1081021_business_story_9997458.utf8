  RBI cuts repo rate to 8%           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 20: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sprang a major surprise on Monday when it slashed the repo rate by 100 basis points to 8 per cent to maintain financial stability and alleviate pressures caused by the global credit crisis.        
	This is the first repo rate cut since March 2004 and only the second in over eight years.         
	The repo is the rate at which the central bank provides overnight loans to banks against government securities.         
	Bankers had not anticipated a cut in the repo rate since inflation is still running at double-digit levels.         
	The repo rate cut is a welcome move by the RBI...this clearly marks an easing of monetary policy but the impact on lending and deposit rates will have to be seen over time, said Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director, ICICI Bank.        
	Over the past fortnight, the central bank had taken a number of measures to inject liquidity into the system.         
	It had injected over Rs 1,45,000 crore into the banking system through a 250-basis-point cut in the cash reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio.        
	Observers said the reduction was a clear signal to banks that interest rates were headed lower and that the central bank was now more concerned about growth.        
	The RBI said it had taken a number of measures over the past month to augment domestic and forex liquidity, but the global situation remained uncertain.        
	Even as countries directly affected by the turmoil have taken aggressive action to manage the crisis, confidence and calm is yet to be fully restored in the financial markets. Because of financial integration, this uncertainty is transmitting to countries outside the epicentre of the crisis. the apex bank said.        
	Tushar Poddar of Goldman Sachs said the repo rate cut marked a major turnaround in monetary policy.         
	With this move, the RBI has decisively come on the side of growth and financial stability against inflation.        
	Rupa Rege Nitsure of Bank of Baroda said the repo rate cut was an admission from the central bank that it was not expecting inflation  which is currently ruling at 11.44 per cent  to rise from here on.        
	Sensex gains        
	The repo rate cut did not, however, trigger a major buying spree on the stock markets. The bellwether sensex snapped a three-day losing streak and rose 247.74 points to 10223.09 at the close of trading. Infotech and banking stocks were in demand.        
	The rupee today closed at a eight-year low against the dollar. It fell 11 paise to close at Rs 49. In volatile trading, the Indian currency moved in the range of Rs 48.70 to Rs 49.10.

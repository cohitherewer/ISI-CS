          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          FUTUREs BRIGHT                                  
	Mumbai, April 9: Brokerages expect infotech giants to post a decent set of numbers in the fourth quarter despite the rumble about a recession in the US and its impact on Indian software companies.        
	The outlook in terms of guidance for fiscal 2008-09 is expected to be muted.        
	Forecasts by four brokerages show Infosys posting a 20-22 per cent growth in net profit for the quarter ended March 31. The Bangalore-based IT bellwether, whose numbers are treated as a benchmark for the entire industry, is expected to report a net profit of between Rs 1,227 crore and Rs 1,362 crore.        
	Margins are likely to be stable for the sector as a whole. The expectation is that good volumes and stable pricing will aid the topline.         
	On the margin front, a key factor helping IT companies is the depreciation of the rupee. The thumb-rule in the industry is that if the rupee is to appreciate by 100 basis points, margins will crimp by around 40 basis points.        
	Rupee depreciation by an average of about 1 per cent should help companies in improving revenue growth and also EBIDTA margins, Kotak Securities said in a report.        
	Religare Securities is of the opinion that profit margins can increase by 100 to 200 basis points because of higher utilisation rates and rupee depreciation.        
	However, there is a flip side to the depreciation of the rupee.         
	According to JP Morgan, Indian IT companies have increased their hedges significantly over the last few quarters, and this could lead to foreign exchange losses.         
	Though leading IT companies such as Infosys, Wipro and Satyam Computers are forecast to post higher net profit numbers during the fourth quarter, there are divergent views when it comes to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Kotak Securities and JP Morgan fear that TCS can post a lower quarter-on-quarter net profit.

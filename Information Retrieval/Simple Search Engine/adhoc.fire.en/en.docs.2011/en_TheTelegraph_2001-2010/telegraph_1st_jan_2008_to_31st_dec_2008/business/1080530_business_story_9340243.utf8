                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FII rules relaxed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 29: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today relaxed investment norms for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and non-resident Indians looking to invest in Indian equities. Pension funds, mutual funds, investment trusts, insurance companies, foundations, charitable trusts and charitable societies will be allowed to invest as FIIs even if they are not subject to overseas regulatory scrutiny.        
	The capital market regulator said the much maligned sovereign wealth funds would also be allowed to invest as FIIs.        
	Modifying its earlier circular on foreign investments in India, Sebi said an asset management company, or an institutional portfolio manager owned by NRIs would also be eligible to get FII status. But there are riders: they can do so only on the condition that they shall not invest their proprietary funds. They also must have a net worth of at least $50 million.         
	Sebi said foreign corporates seeking to open sub-accounts must have an asset base of at least $2 billion and an average net profit of at least $50 million in the last three financial years.         
	Broad based funds which have a single investor holding more than 49 per cent will also be granted FII status. Earlier, no investor was permitted to hold more than 10 per cent. These funds must have at least 20 investors.        
	Till now, FIIs were allowed to invest in the units of domestic mutual funds, apart from shares, debentures and warrants. Now, they would be allowed to invest in collective investment schemes also.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 29: The pharmaceutical sector seems to have some of its wishes granted, although too little, too late.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram has reduced the excise duty on all goods produced in the pharmaceutical sector from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.         
	The net result of this will be a cut in drug prices, believe some, while the others argue that it will not have an impact.        
	The finance ministers decision to cut down customs duty and exempt excise duty on life-saving drugs is a laudable move. The move to reduce excise duty on all goods in the pharma sector from 16 per cent to 8 per cent is welcome. It was our long standing demand. This should bring down the cost of medicines, believes Ranjit Shahani, vice-chairman and managing director, Novartis India Ltd.        
	However, Swati Piramal, director (strategic alliance and communications), Nicholas Piramal, said, Reducing the excise duty on certain specified life-saving drugs and on the bulk drugs used for the manufacture of such drugs has been a long standing demand of the pharma sector and I welcome the move. But I dont think this will, in anyway, reduce the prices of drugs.

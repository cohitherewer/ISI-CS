The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Local tech firms refuse to lose sleep
                                                                                                            Local tech firms refuse to lose sleep
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: Indian IT companies are willing to wait and watch for positive signals from the US services sector and refuse to ring the alarm bells just yet.         
	We are keeping a close watch on the developments. There is not much to suggest a further drop in the situation in the coming three months. Business from foreign clients has been growing at a healthy rate, said Sudip Banerjee of Wipro.        
	However, the share of US revenues in the total pie has come down from 64-65 per cent three years ago to 60 per cent now, he added.        
	Stocks of Wipro, along with Satyam, Infosys, TCS and Rolta, were clobbered on the bourses today.        
	TCS, whose exposure to the US, as a percentage of total revenues, is much lower than its competitors, is hoping to maintain its growth rate of 41 per cent in dollar terms and 25 per cent in rupee terms like in the nine months last year.        
	We are watching the situation as it evolves but as far as geographies are concerned we are quite balanced, said Pradipta Bagchi of TCS.        
	Cognizant, which earns around 82 per cent of its revenues from the US, said, Despite the uncertainty in the market, 92 per cent of our clients do not expect their overall IT budgets to decline in 2008.        
	Satyam is upbeat about India providing talent and cost arbitrage. We dont see much of an impact of the slowdown on the Indian IT industry. The new IT budgets of our clients show a 4-5 per cent increase compared with last year, said CFO Srinivas Vadlamani.

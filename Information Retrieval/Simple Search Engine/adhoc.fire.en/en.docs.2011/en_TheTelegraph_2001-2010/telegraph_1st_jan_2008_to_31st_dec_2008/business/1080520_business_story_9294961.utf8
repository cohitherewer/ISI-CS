          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      TOUGH CALL                                
	Mumbai, May 19: The State Bank of India (SBI) has put on hold the financing of new tractors and farm equipment, including power tiller and combine harvester.        
	This comes at a time when Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has asked banks to lend more to farmers.        
	The bank had to resort to this measure because of its high non-performing assets in agriculture. Sources, however, said the bank remained committed to the farming community.        
	The SBI has expanded rapidly in rural areas over the past one year.         
	In the current year, it plans to set up more than 1,000 branches in rural areas and tap individuals who do not have a bank account. This is higher than the 400 branches that the bank had set up in 2007-08.         
	This year the bank has set a growth target of 36 per cent and 34 per cent in deposits and advances, respectively, in rural areas.        
	Recently, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said the bank planned to open 10,000 branches over the next two years in rural areas.        
	The SBI issued a circular to all its branches, saying the bank will stop financing new tractors along with farm mechanisation activities with immediate effect.         
	It cited high dues of farmers as the main reason to stall financing, temporarily.        
	The bank asked its branches to contact tractor dealers to get details of the borrowers and inform them about the benefits under the one-time settlement scheme announced by the government for distressed farmers.        
	Our bank has a large portfolio of tractor loan accounts with overdues and farmers in distress can avail the benefit under these schemes, the SBI circular said.         
	The nationalised bank also asked the branches to keep customer details secret, keeping in view its obligations.         
	However, the decision is expected to be reviewed based on the progress in lowering non-performing assets.         
	In the Union budget, Chidambaram had announced a Rs 60,000-crore debt waiver for distressed farmers.         
	The finance minister had waived all loans overdue as on December 2007 for small and marginal farmers owning less than two hectares and proposed a one-time settlement for large farmers.        
	Sources said the banks non-performing assets increased to Rs 12,800 crore at the end of March this year compared with about Rs 10,000 crore a year ago.         
	According to an SBI spokesperson, non-performing assets in tractor financing has increased about 17 per cent and hence the decision to put on hold the financing of this segment for the time being.

	Calcutta, Nov. 21: Braving the economic downturn, Parle Agro has entered the 100 per cent pure juice category with the launch of Saint Juice.         
	Frooti and Appy are the other two popular beverages from the Parle Agro house.        
	I believe domestic consumption of food items will not be hurt in the economic downturn. Juice as a category is at a nascent stage of development in India and has a long way to go, Nadia Chauhan, director of Parle Agro, said.        
	The 100 per cent pure juice category has a market size of Rs 150 crore and is growing at the rate of 35 per cent.        
	Nadia, daughter of Parle Agro chairman Prakash Chauhan, said new products would help expand the companys beverage portfolio.         
	The company is also looking to ramp up its distribution network.        
	Parle Agros products fall under three categories  beverages, water and confectionery.        
	We do not foresee any drop in demand for these products in the future, Nadia said.        
	Saint Juice  available in mixed fruit, orange and grape flavours is a more expensive option for consumers.         
	A one-litre pack is priced at Rs 95-100 compared with Rs 85 for a Tropicana pack. The company, however, believes the superior quality of its product will justify the cost.        
	Most of the fruits for the juice are being imported from South America and Europe.

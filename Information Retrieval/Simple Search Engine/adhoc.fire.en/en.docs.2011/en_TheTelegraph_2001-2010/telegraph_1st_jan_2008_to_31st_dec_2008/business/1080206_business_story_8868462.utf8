The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Laptop beats desktop in computer sales race
                                                                                                            Laptop beats desktop in computer sales race
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                SLIM amp; POWERFUL		    
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Laptops have outnumbered desktops in sales during the first half of 2007-08.         
	The market for laptops witnessed growth of 59 per cent at over 6.8 lakh units, while that for desktops grew 3 per cent at 25 lakh units in the first half of 2007-08, according to data released by the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT).        
	Laptops have emerged as a significant driver, accounting for 21 per cent of the total personal computer market in the country compared with less than 3 per cent four years ago, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of MAIT.        
	Personal computer sales between April and September 2007 were 32.8 lakh units, a growth rate of 11 per cent over the same period last fiscal.        
	At present, the ratio of laptops to desktops in India is 20:80. However, in West Europe, West Asia and Singapore, the ratio is 60:40. In the US, the ratio is about 45:55.         
	The ratio in India will become 50:50 in the next few years with more and more users preferring laptops for greater portability, said industry analysts.        
	We do expect laptops to overtake desktops sales in a few years though we cannot give a time frame, said Mehta.         
	Laptop prices have also come on a par with desktops. HCL Infosystems, for instance, has launched a laptop for Rs 14,000.        
	Laptop prices have fallen recently because of the rise in the rupee against the dollar, making component imports cheaper and a duty reduction on laptops possible.        
	At the enterprise end, enhanced productivity with faster processors and increased portability and connectivity are going to be the prime drivers for greater adoption, said the analysts.         
	Notebook sales were driven by the household segment, which witnessed 164 per cent growth in consumption.

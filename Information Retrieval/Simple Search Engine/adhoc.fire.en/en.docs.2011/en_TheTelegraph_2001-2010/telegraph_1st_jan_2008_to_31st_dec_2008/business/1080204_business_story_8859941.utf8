    Avoid loans on credit card, use it prudently and never roll over your balance, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay
                      
	Those who are in thrall to plastic money and easy availability of collateral-free credit, beware! Failing to comprehend the cost implications of using credit cards  be it for purchases, cash withdrawals or taking a loan  can get you mired in debt.
    
	The problem is so harrowing that early last week the State Bank of India launched a campaign to educate people about the financial risks of high interest rates on credit cards.
    
	All over the world people have fallen into this debt-trap time and again. There were large-scale payment defaults by credit cardholders in Hong Kong in 2002, in Korea in 2003 and in Taiwan in 2006. 
    
	The US also was plagued by a similar situation during a savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s. In recent times, the sub-prime mortgage problem in the US is spilling over to credit card payments.
    
	According to the Reserve Bank of India, banks and non-banking financial institutions have issued 2.59 crore credit cards till November last year. Between April and November, payments worth Rs 48,746.17 crore had been made through credit cards.
    
	Although spending by using the plastic is only 2.7 per cent of the total personal consumption expenditure, retail credit has gone up to one-third of the total bank credit in the country. This means people are now saddled with financial liabilities and are more prone to financial risks. 
    
	Therefore, it can be disastrous to use the plastic injudiciously without a proper understanding of how interest rates for debts on credit cards are calculated and of ones repayment capability after servicing other loan liabilities. 
    
	Intricate calculations
    
	Card issuers often do not explain intricate interest computations to customers, adding to their misery.
    
	Tapas Kumar Deb, a 55-year-old resident of Beleghata, holds an SBI credit card for the past eight years. In December 2006, he finally yielded to persistent calls from SBI Credit Card telemarketers for a personal loan at a monthly interest rate of 1.5 per cent that the bank had pre-approved considering his good repayment history. Deb needed the money for a heart surgery.
    
	His nightmare began a few months after he started repaying the equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for the loan.
    
	They charged me an EMI of Rs 2,481.11 for the Rs 58,000 loan that I took for three years, Deb said. Even at an annual interest rate of 18 per cent, the EMI should have been Rs 2,097. When I enquired, they said it was a flat interest rate. Anyway, I decided to prepay the loan. 
    
	Debs prepayment will not be painless. He will have to pay a 3 per cent penalty on the outstanding loan.
    
	Flat rate
    
	With a flat interest rate, the EMI is arrived at by calculating the simple interest on the loan and then dividing the amount (principal plus interest) by the number of months for which the loan was taken (see table 1).
    
	It is important to note that in this method the interest is calculated on the entire loan amount and for the entire loan period. It does not consider the principal repaid during the repayment period. Therefore, under the flat interest computation one continues to pay interest on the principal that has already been repaid.
    
	Reducing balance
    
	However, if you take a loan from a bank, interest will be calculated under the reducing balance method (see table 2). This means, you will not have to pay interest on the principal being repaid and on the same loan you would have to pay an EMI of Rs 2,097 instead of Rs 2481.11 under the flat rate.
    
	Penal interest
    
	In case of a credit card loan, if you fail to pay your bills on time, you will be charged with a penal interest rate and a late payment fine that a bank loan generally doesnt attract. Cash withdrawals or loans on credit cards attract a higher rate of interest than purchases on the same card. 
    
	Do not revolve debt
    
	Till the time you do not revolve debt on your credit card, it is worth using. But if you decide to pay the minimum due to be paid against a credit card bill, you will be in a soup. 
    
	For example, if you spend Rs 50,000 on a credit card that charges a monthly interest of 2.85 per cent and pay only the minimum 5 per cent of the due every month, it will take you around 12 years to fully repay the dues (See table 3). 
    
	Moreover, the interest you will pay will be nearly Rs 58,000  more than what you had originally borrowed!

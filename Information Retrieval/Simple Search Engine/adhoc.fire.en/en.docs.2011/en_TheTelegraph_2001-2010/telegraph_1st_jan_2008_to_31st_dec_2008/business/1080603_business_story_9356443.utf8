          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Bhatt: Personal touch		      
	Mumbai, June 2: The State Bank of India (SBI) today kicked off the process of implementing the farm loan waiver scheme.        
	Commercial banks like the SBI have been told to implement the Rs 71,680-crore loan waiver scheme by June 30.        
	At SBI, the loan waiver scheme was kicked off at its Jamli rural branch in Madhya Pradesh. While the branch issued fresh loan eligibility letters to farmers under the scheme, the SBI said loanees would not have to apply for a debt waiver and the bank would do it for them. The SBI is the first bank in the country to start implementing the debt waiver scheme.         
	Chairman . P. Bhatt, who visited the Jamli branch to assess at first hand the level of preparedness, issued fresh loan eligibility letters to farmers under the scheme. Bhatt was on a visit to Indore to attend the annual general meeting of the State Bank of Indore.        
	SBIs Bhopal circle, covering Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, has an estimated 1.8 lakh and 67,000 farmers in the two states, respectively, eligible for the scheme.        
	The SBI chief asked bank personnel to implement the scheme within the deadline and also extend fresh loans for the ensuing kharif season as required by the farmers.        
	The SBI is expected to expedite the process of implementing the scheme in other states. However, estimates of the amount involved could not be obtained.        
	Late last week, finance minister P. Chidambaram had asked banks to add pace to the implementation of the package and complete the scheme within the deadline so that farmers could be eligible for fresh credit for the kharif crop.        
	The scheme size was initially put at Rs 60,000 crore. This was based on an estimate of 30 million small and marginal farmers and 10 million other growers in the country.        
	However, the finance minister recently estimated that the number of small and marginal farmers was more than 30 million and the number of other farmers was about 5.97 million.

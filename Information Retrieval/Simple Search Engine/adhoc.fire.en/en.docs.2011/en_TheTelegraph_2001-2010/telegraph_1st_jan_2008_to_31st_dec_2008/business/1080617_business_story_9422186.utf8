          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, June 16: Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo today made an open offer to pick up another 20 per cent stake in Ranbaxy Laboratories at Rs 737 a share.        
	The offer is scheduled to open on August 8 and close on August 27.         
	Daiichi said it was ready to fork out up to Rs 6,819 crore for the offer, comprising about 9.25 crore fully paid-up equity shares of the domestic pharma major.         
	Daiichi has also set up an escrow account of Rs 700 crore as a security measure.        
	ICICI Securities Ltd will act as the manager for the public offer and Nomura Securities Co Ltd of Japan will be adviser to the issue.        
	Last week, Daiichi had entered into a share purchase and share subscription agreement with the promoters of Ranbaxy to acquire a 34.81 per cent stake in the company.         
	With this open offer, the Japanese firm will hold a total equity stake of 54.81 per cent in Ranbaxy.        
	Daiichi said it would take necessary approvals from the Reserve Bank of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the anti-trust authorities in Japan, the US, the European Union, China, Taiwan, Ukraine, South Africa and any other jurisdiction as might be required.        
	The acquisition will be completed by the end of March 2009. After the transaction, Ranbaxy will become a subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo.        
	The deal will bring together the synergies of Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy together and leverage the strengths of each other.        
	While Daiichi is regarded as a global innovator, the strength of the Indian company is in producing generics.         
	The Ranbaxy share today closed at Rs 567.75, up 0.15 per cent on the BSE.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insurers turn saviour
                                                                                                               Insurers turn saviour
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 10: The stock markets went through another roller-coaster ride on Monday.        
	The bellwether index went into a deep dive soon after the market opened for trading, plunging almost 600 points at one stage because of weak global cues and the lack of buying sentiment.         
	The clawback started late in the afternoon on the back of short covering and buying support from insurance companies.         
	The index finally settled at 15923.72, down 51.80 points from Fridays close after investors started scooping up metals, and oil and gas shares. The 50-share broader market index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also displayed a 180 point recovery from its intra-day low of 4620.50. It closed up 29 points at 4800.40.         
	The market recovered its losses because of short covering and buying support from some of the leading insurance companies such as the LIC. At these levels, investors should start buying. If the US Fed cuts rates, we might see an improvement in sentiment, said Amitabh Chakraborty of Religare Enterprises Ltd.         
	The Indian shares have performed comparatively better than other Asian markets that mostly ended with losses a day earlier reflecting the ongoing weakness of the US economy.

                                If a husband gifts his wife in a crossed cheque to purchase units in an equity-linked mutual fund scheme, would there be any tax liability either for the husband or the wife? The mutual fund units are held for more than 12 months and the dividends are tax-free under Section 10.          K.K. Dutta, Calcutta
                    A husband can gift as much he wants to his wife. But any income on the gifted amount would be clubbed with the husbands income for tax calculation. However, since there is no capital gains tax on units of equity-linked mutual fund schemes held for more than 12 months and the dividends thereon are tax-free, it would not be included in the income of the husband.                                  Tuition tax      I would like to know the limitation on tax exemption for tuition fees for children under the Finance Act 2007?         Nitya Nanda Majumder, Calcutta
                    Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows for deduction up to Rs 1 lakh paid as tuition fees, excluding any payment towards any development fee or donation or payment of a similar nature, whether at the time of admission or thereafter to any university, college, school or other educational institutions within India. The tuition fee must be paid for full-time education of any two children of an individual. The principle requirement for qualifying for deduction under this provision would be that the payment should be in the nature of tuition fee only.                                   Early exit      I had invested Rs 30,000 each in IDBI Infrastructure (Tax Saving) Bonds (2005B) under Option A and Option B in 2005. The maturity of the same is April 2010. I dont want to hold the bonds till April 2010. How can I exit early from these bonds?        Sumita Guha, Khardalia
                    These bonds are for five years and there is no early redemption option as mentioned clearly in the offer document. Neither an investor can exercise a put (read, sell) option nor IDBI will give any call (read, buyback) option. You have to hold it till maturity.

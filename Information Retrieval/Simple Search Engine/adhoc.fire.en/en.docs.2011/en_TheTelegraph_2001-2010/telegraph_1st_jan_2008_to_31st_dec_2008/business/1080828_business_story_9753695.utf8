	New Delhi, Aug. 27: State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Videocon Industries have picked up a 10 per cent stake each in an offshore oil exploration block in Mozambique.         
	Bharat PetroResources Limited, a unit of BPCL, and Videocon Energy Ventures Limited, the overseas arm of Videocon Industries, have signed separate agreements with Anadarko Mozambique Limited to acquire a 10 per cent participating interest each in Offshore Area 1 of the Rovuma block in the African nation, a statement said.        
	Videocon said its capital outlay for the transaction was estimated at $75 million.         
	Anadarko has a 36.8 per cent stake in the exploration block, while Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos, a state-owned firm of Mozambique, holds a 15 per cent stake.         
	Artumas of Mozambique has 8.5 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent is with the UK-based Mitsui E amp;P.         
	The stake acquisition by the Indian oil firms comes a day after ONGC Videsh made a successful bid to take over the UK-listed Imperial Energy for 1.4 billion.

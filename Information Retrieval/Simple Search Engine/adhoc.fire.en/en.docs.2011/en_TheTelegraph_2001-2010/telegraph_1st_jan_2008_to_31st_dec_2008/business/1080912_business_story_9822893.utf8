	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Inflation fell for the third week running to 12.1 per cent for the week ended August 30.        
	However, analysts predicted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could tighten its monetary policy in October as inflation was much above the central banks comfort zone of five per cent. A week ago inflation was at 12.34 per cent.        
	According to the finance ministry, inflation of 30 essential commodities declined to 7.52 per cent from 6.90 per cent a week ago.         
	The head of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, Suresh Tendulkar, said inflation appeared to have peaked and it would settle at around eight to nine per cent by the end of this fiscal year, as projected by the council.        
	However, D.K. Joshi, an analyst with Crisil, said inflation was above the RBIs comfort zone and the central bank might raise its repurchase rate by 25 basis points next month.

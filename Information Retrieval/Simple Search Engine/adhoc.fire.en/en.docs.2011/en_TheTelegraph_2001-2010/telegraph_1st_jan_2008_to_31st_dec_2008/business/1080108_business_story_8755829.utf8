	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Indian Cars and Motors Limited (ICML), part of the Sonalika group, has tied up with Pininfarina  an Italian automobile design house  to develop a family of world cars that will be launched in India and other countries by 2010.
    
	The company is co-developing a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and a passenger car with Pininfarina that will be priced between Rs 8-10 lakh.
    
	Our intention is to develop a family of global cars which will include an SUV and luxury vehicles. We have tied up with Italys Pininfarina for developing these cars and are planning a global launch some time in 2010, said Deepak Mittal, managing director of ICML.
    
	The company today launched a variant of its multi-utility vehicle Rhino at a starting price of Rs 6 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). ICML expects to sell 5,000 units of the Rhino this financial year and is targeting sales of 24,000 in 2008-09.
    
	We are yet to launch the Rhino all over India and once that is done we will comfortably touch a sales figure of 24,000 units. The national roll out would be within this fiscal and we intend to have 170 dealers across the country, said Mittal.
    
	ICMLs Rhino has been designed by UK-based design house Lotus and is powered by a two-litre MG Rover engine.
    
	Asked about ICMLs parent Indian Tractors plans to raise Rs 800 crore through an IPO, Mittal said the company was likely to take a final decision in 2008.

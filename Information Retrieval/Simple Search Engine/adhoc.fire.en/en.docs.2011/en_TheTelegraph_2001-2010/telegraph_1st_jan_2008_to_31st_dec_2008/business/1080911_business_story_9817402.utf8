          JAYATI GHOSE                          Call divert                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Foreign telecom operators are mulling a change in their entry strategy following moves by the government to increase the fee for 3G spectrum.        
	Players such as Americas AT amp;T, the UAEs Etisalat, Telecom Italia and Japans NTT DoCoMo, who were queuing up to offer 3G services, are now gearing up to seal stake deals with new and existing operators such as Unitech Wireless, Essar groups Loop Telecom, Videocons Datacom Solutions and Tata Teleservices.         
	The uncertainty over the fee for 3G spectrum plus a need for both 2G and 3G spectrum to efficiently provide basic as well as value-added services have prompted the foreign players to revise their strategy.        
	It will be easier and financially more viable for foreign players to pick up a stake in an Indian player  which has 2G spectrum and will also bid for a 3G licence  than to pay Rs 2,020 crore for a pan-India 3G licence and invest additional amount in network rollout, said Sudipto Basu, a telecom analyst.        
	The governments plans to allow the auction of fresh spectrum for 2G services and permit mobile virtual network operators are yet to take off.        
	The finance ministry has demanded that the base price for pan-India 3G spectrum be raised to Rs 2,500 crore from Rs 2,020 crore, while the department of telecom has suggested that spectrum charges be increased one per cent every year for 3G operators.        
	Four global majors  Etisalat, Turkcell, an unnamed European firm and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slims America Movil  are in race for a 51 per cent stake in Datacom Solutions.         
	Japans biggest mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo and France Telecom are frontrunners in picking up a stake  between 12 per cent and 26 per cent  in Tata Tele- services.        
	The race to grab a piece of the telecom pie is fetching better enterprise valuations for new players.        
	Datacom, in which consumer electronics firm Videocon holds a majority stake, is being valued at around $3 billion by its four prospective buyers.         
	It is one of the six companies that were successful in winning GSM licences earlier this year. The others include Unitech, Loop Telecom, S Tel and Swan. All these companies are scouting for funds and are at various stages of negotiations to strike deals.

                                Is the interest on deposits in post office monthly income schemes taxable if it exceeds Rs 1,50,000 a year? Is the pension income taxable if it exceeds Rs 1,50,00 a year?          M.L. Das, Purulia
                    terest earned on deposits in post office monthly income scheme as well as pension income are both taxable, provided your total income exceeds the basic exemption limit for income tax purpose. The basic exemption limit for men below 65 years of age is Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 2,25,000 for those who are above 65 years. However, in the case of post office monthly income schemes, the tax is not deducted at source. The onus of paying the tax is on you.                                     Delay dallying      I had invested in Government of India 6.5 per cent Savings Bonds (non-taxable), 2003 from HDFC Bank in Mumbai. The bank paid the money on maturity of those bonds through ECS to the HDFC Bank branch at Chennai. I didnt opt for the ECS facility. There was a delay of three days in the money transfer. Will it be considered as a fault by the HDFC Bank?        P.K. Kundu, 24 Parganas
                    You first write a complaint letter to the HDFC Bank, Mumbai, about the delay in the money transfer. If the bank fails to give you a satisfactory reply within a month, you can approach the banking ombudsman at a regional office of the RBI with a copy of your original complaint letter.                                  Taxing times      One must file Form 15G to avoid TDS while making a bank fixed deposit even if the interest income is less than Rs 10,000 in a financial year. I understand that tax is deducted at source under Section 194A of the Income Tax Act if interest is more than Rs 10,000 in a financial year. Please clarify?        Nirmal Kumar Ghiya, Calcutta
                    TDS is applicable if the interest in a financial year is more than Rs 10,000. However, the interest amount considered for TDS refers to the total interest accrued in all savings, recurring, current and fixed deposit accounts in single as well as in joint names of the depositor in a particular branch of a bank. Is it possible for a bank to calculate the interest of all the accounts for each of its customers for the TDS? Its more convenient that the depositor furnishes a Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source.

	Calcutta, April 29: Berger Paints India Ltd today said that it had entered into an agreement to acquire all the shares of Poland-based Bolix S.A. from Advent International, a global private equity player, for $38.6 million.         
	Bolix is a leading provider of external insulation finishing system and manufactures dry plaster mixes and acrylic colours in Poland. It also exports to neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, Russia and the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The annual turnover of the company was more than $45.5 million in 2007.        
	The acquisition will be made through Berger Paints wholly owned subsidiary in Cyprus, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The agreement was signed on April 28 and the acquisition would be conditional upon the fulfilment of certain conditions, including a clearance from the Polish anti-monopoly office.         
	Ernst and Young Private Limited, India, were the financial advisors to Berger on the transaction.        
	Berger Paints share price today closed at Rs 43.90, or 6.17 per cent, above its previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	External insulation finishing system is a comprehensive solution for both the insulation and decorative requirements of external walls of buildings. Bolixs products provide significant insulation solutions, while at the same time offering a decorative finish suitable for traditional brick or concrete structures.        
	Besides synergy benefits, the acquisition will open up business opportunities and regional markets to Berger. The technology and products of Bolix complement Bergers existing businesses.

  HDFC Bank, IDBI loans get costlier          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Finance minister P. Chidambaram with State Bank of India chairman O. P. Bhatt in New Delhi on Tuesday. (Fotocorp)                                
	Mumbai, July 1: HDFC Bank today raised its prime lending rate (PLR) by 75 basis points to 16 per cent.         
	This is the second time within a fortnight that HDFC Bank is increasing its benchmark rate. It had hiked its PLR by 25 basis points around mid-June.        
	The private sector bank also raised its deposit rates by 50 to 100 basis points across various maturities. While the PLR hike is with immediate effect, the deposit rate hikes will be effective from July 3.        
	IDBI Bank, another private sector bank, also reviewed its benchmark prime lending rate. The bank said this decision was taken in view of the current interest rate environment.        
	It raised the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 13.75 per cent with effect from July 1. Simultaneously, term deposit rates were also increased by 25 to 75 basis points across various maturity buckets, with effect from July 4.        
	Ashish Parthasarathy, deputy treasurer of HDFC Bank, said the bank reviewed the situation after the half a percentage increase in the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by the Reserve Bank and it decided to revise rates in line with prevailing market conditions.        
	Parthasarathy added that the RBI move was an indication that while inflation in the economy would remain high, interest rates also needed to be high. Further, with other banks also moving ahead with rate hikes, HDFC Bank reacted to the situation, he said.         
	The hike in PLR will impact loans that are linked to the benchmark rate. New borrowings and those coming up for repricing will also be impacted.        
	Nobody expected global oil prices to flare up as they have done nor did anybody expect inflation to increase to such a high level, Parthasarathy said.        
	On Monday, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and ICICI Bank increased their benchmark rates by 50 and 75 basis points, respectively. At HDFC, existing floating rate home loans will turn dearer by half a percentage point, while new home loan borrowers will have to pay a higher interest rate of 75 basis points. The corporation had also increased its rates on deposits by 50 basis points across most maturities.        
	ICICI Bank had announced a sharper hike of 75 basis points in its floating reference rate for consumer loans, including home loans. The countrys largest private sector bank said the revised floating rate would be 13.50 per cent against 12.75 per cent earlier.        
	Some of the other banks that have increased their PLRs include Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and Yes Bank.        
	While it is felt in some quarters that non-performing assets can rise because of higher rates, Parthasarathy said the number of defaulters would rise across the banking industry but HDFC Bank wasnt unduly worried on this score.        
	It wont be a matter of great concern. The economy is growing and credit is growing, though the pace of growth is small, he added.        
	On IDBI Banks move, its chief financial officer R.K. Bansal said, We decided to hike our lending rates after most of our peer banks did so. Also, there was an urgent need to hike the deposit rates given the impact of high inflation rates on customers.

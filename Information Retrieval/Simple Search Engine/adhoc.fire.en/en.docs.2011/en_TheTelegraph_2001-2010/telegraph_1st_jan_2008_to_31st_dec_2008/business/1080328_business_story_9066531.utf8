The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ore price cut next on agenda
                                                                                                               Ore price cut next on agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pillai: Hopeful                                  
	New Delhi, March 27: The government plans to ask iron ore producers to lower the prices of the mineral for domestic steel makers.        
	We have called a meeting of iron ore producers on April 1. We will persuade them to reduce the prices, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. The move is part of the governments efforts to rein in the sharp rise in steel prices.        
	However, miners are likely to oppose such a move. According to Rahul Baldota, president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the price of iron ore should be decided by the market.        
	We believe some formulae to define the prices of iron ore and value addition by mine owners for better use of fines are becoming a necessity, P.R. Dhariwal, chairman of the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association (SIMA), said in a letter to steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	Dhariwal pointed out that state-run NMDC had increased prices by 47.5 per cent since October 2007 and another upward revision of prices was expected next month.        
	Private miners in Orissa, Jharkhand and Karnataka have also increased prices by over 73 per cent since April last year, Dhariwal added.        
	Export subsidy        
	The government today suspended export subsidy for the steel sector under the duty entitlement pass book scheme (DEPB), a move that will deplete the coffers of exporters of the alloy by about Rs 600 crore.        
	The government also withdrew depb benefits on the export of non-basmati rice.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TAKING WINGS                                  
	New Delhi, April 24: The Union cabinet today cleared a greenfield airport policy and approved rules allowing the construction of airstrips and helipads by companies and individuals for private use.         
	After the cabinet meeting, information minister P.R. Das Munshi said, it has been decided that no greenfield (new) airport will be allowed within an aerial distance of 150 km of an existing civilian airport.         
	If there is a proposal to build one within 150 km, the government will assess the impact on the existing airport.        
	The cabinet also approved guidelines for the construction of airports, airstrips and helipads for private use. Such facilities will reduce the burden on other airports, the minister said.        
	The government felt it was necessary to encourage private facilities as existing airports were stretched beyond capacity and, therefore, were in no position to accommodate the growing number of private aircraft and helicopters.        
	The number of aircraft for private use have increased to 229 in September 2007 from 96 in December 1997, a growth rate of 139 per cent, while those for non-scheduled use have increased to 196 from 46, a growth rate of 326 per cent. This growth is placing an additional burden on existing airports, many a time coming in the way of accommodating scheduled passenger traffic, an official said.         
	This decision of the government will be immediately implemented. Relevant guidelines and regulations will be amended to provide for a security clearance through the home ministry.        
	For new airports, the official said that since the grant of a licence involved several agencies, a steering committee would be set up under the chairmanship of the civil aviation secretary to co-ordinate and monitor the clearances.         
	According to the official, approval from the central government is not required for a new airport that conforms to the norms and abides by the 150-kilometre rule. The directorate general of civil aviation is the competent authority.        
	The guidelines on new airports allow state governments to give land, real estate development rights and fiscal incentives to airport developers.         
	Global players interested in airports include Fraport of Germany which operates the Frankfurt airport; Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (Kuala Lumpur airport); and Changi Airport Singapore.         
	Among domestic firms, Hyderabad-based Maytas Infra Ltd is keen on the business.

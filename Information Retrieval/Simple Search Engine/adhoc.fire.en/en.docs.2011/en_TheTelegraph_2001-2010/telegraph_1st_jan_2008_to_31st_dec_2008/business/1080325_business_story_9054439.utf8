The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal claim trips on power output

	Calcutta, March 24: The monthly generation of electricity in Bengal is fast falling from the peak recorded in 2005. The state, however, claims it has surplus power and that every household will get an electricity connection by 2012. But the numbers have a different story to tell.         
	The economic survey 2007-08 released by Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta on March 17 showed that the monthly generation of electricity in the state (excluding central power sector units) during January to November last year was significantly down from the corresponding period in 2005.         
	The monthly generation rose sharply between 2004 and 2005. However, power generation on a month-to-month basis declined in 2006 and the trend continued in 2007.         
	In five of the reported 11 months in 2007, power generation was lower than the corresponding months in 2006. Only in October and November last year, power generation was higher than the levels recorded in 2006. But they were still far below the 2005 levels.        
	Apart from West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL), all other power producing units in the state recorded lower generation in the current financial year till November. Power generation in Durgapur Projects stood at 961 million units till November 2007 compared with 1781 million units in 2006-07.         
	In Durgapur Projects, the fall in generation was mainly because of forced shutdown of a 110MW unit of the power station since October 29, 2006, the survey said. The survey did not explain the lower generation by other power companies in the state.         
	The total installed capacity of all power units, however, has steadily increased over the last few years. In 2003-04, the total installed capacity of power stations in the state was 7,330MW. It increased to 8,034MW by November 2007 after the start of three units of 225MW each at Purulia Pump Storage Project.         
	The number of consumers has also grown to 87,78,992 till November 2007 from 67,94,426 at the end of 2003-04.        
	According to Malay Kumar De, chairman of WBSEDCL, Bengal can still be called a power surplus state because we have power generation in excess of demand at times during non-peak hours.         
	Electricity has to be consumed soon after its generation. It cannot be stored. Hence, during non-peak hours, when we have surplus generation, we export it to other states. During peak hours, when the demand is greater than generation, we purchase it from the central projects and other states, he said.         
	However, he added that with more power projects in the pipeline, Bengal would soon have surplus generation throughout the year.

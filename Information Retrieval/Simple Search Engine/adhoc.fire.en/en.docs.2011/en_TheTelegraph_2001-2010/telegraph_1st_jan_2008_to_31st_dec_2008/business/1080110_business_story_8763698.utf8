	New Delhi, Jan. 9: General Motors India today launched its premier sports utility vehicle (SUV) Chevrolet Captiva.
 
	The car will have a two-litre in-line four-cylinder, single overhead cam 16-valve diesel engine. 
 
	Combined with a common-rail direct injection system and a variable geometry turbo (VGT) system, the engine produces 150 PS of peak power at 4,000 rpm and 320 Newton metre of torque at 2,000 rpm. 
 
	Torque is produced through a very flat curve, ensuring ample reserves to make frequent downshifting redundant, whether on the highway or in city traffic. The car comes with a price tag of Rs 17.74 lakh.
 
	The two-litre diesel engine-powered Captiva has everything that a premium SUV customer in India wants, said Karl Slym, president and managing director of GM India. 
 
	The car is expected to compete with Hondas best selling SUV CR-V and Mitsubishis Pajero. The former comes at Rs 19.1 lakh and the latter at Rs 18.1 lakh.
 
	Slym said GM India would invest Rs 700 crore in a new plant at Talegaon, Maharashtra. The company aims to have a capacity of 2,25,000 vehicles per annum with this second plant. Its first plant at Halol, Gujarat, manufactures 85,000 units annually. 
 
	The company is also planning to launch alternative fuel-powered variants of its mid-size sedan Aveo. 
 
	It is finalising plans to set up a power train (engine and transmissions) manufacturing facility in the country as well.

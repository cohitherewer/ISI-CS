          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Money Matters                                  
	Mumbai, Dec.26: Wockhardt wants to mobilise Rs 500 crore through the issue of redeemable preference shares. The pharmaceutical company is planning to tap investors such as mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, foreign institutional investors and overseas corporate bodies, among others.        
	Sources said that the proceeds could be used to meet Wockhardts foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) outstandings. The $100m bond issue matures in October next year.        
	However, in a notice sent to the stock exchanges, Wockhardt said that the issue was being done to meet its fund requirements for the expansion of business, capital expenditure, working capital requirements, the repayment of debt and general corporate objectives.        
	In view of the preference issue, Wockhardt wants to increase its authorised share capital to Rs 175 crore from Rs 125 crore, which will include the creation of around 10 crore preference shares. The company will take shareholders permission for these two proposals at an extraordinary general meeting on January 19.        
	It could not be immediately ascertained if Wockhardt was planning to buy back the FCCBs. However, there are reports that the company may sell two of its overseas arms  Negma Laboratories in France and Irish subsidiary Pinewood to repay its debt. At the BSE today, the Wockhardt share ended 3.5 per cent lower at Rs 106.80.        
	With FCCBs quoting at a significant discount, many companies have announced plans to buy back these bonds.

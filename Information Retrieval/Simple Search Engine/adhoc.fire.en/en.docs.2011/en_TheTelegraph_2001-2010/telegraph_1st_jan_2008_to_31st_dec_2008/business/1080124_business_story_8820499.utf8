	Mumbai, Jan. 23: The nine-day wobble on the markets saw the sensex tumble almost 20 per cent mdash; and that sent a rumble through the equity mutual funds industry as well.
 
	After the eye-popping returns the mutual funds have provided in the past year, the industry was unnerved by the shakedown in stock values. 
 
	But after todays rally, the sun is beginning to shine again. Fund managers say they have seen an upsurge in the sale of equity funds even as investors who had pumped money directly into stock markets were wringing their hands over their losses. 
 
	With equity markets surging after the Fed rate cut, asset management companies (AMCs) were crowing that investments through mutuals would always fetch better returns than direct bets on shares. Some of the frontline sensex stocks have tumbled 30 per cent in the last few days, but almost none of the funds has seen their one-year returns fall by the same margin.
 
	Our retail investors respond positively to such corrections. We have seen a higher daily cash flow figure in sales of equity funds in the past two days. We advise long-term investors to stay put and entrants to invest, said Nimesh Shah, managing director and CEO at ICICI Prudential Asset Management. We have seen daily cash flows at Rs 70 crore to Rs 100 crore over the last four days, an official at a leading AMC said. 
 
	During the crash between January 10 and January 22, the sensex had plunged 18.71 per cent, and the Nifty fell 20.42 per cent. Although the average return of diversified equity funds during this period dipped by 19.62 per cent, the annualised returns of the top five equity funds continued to be impressive at 46 per cent. 
 
	On January 10, StanChart Premier Equity was the best performing diversified equity fund in terms of one-year returns. Next was JM Basic Fund, followed by DWS Investment Opportunity Fund.
 
	Rajiv Anand of StanChart Mutual feels investors need to take advantage of the volatility and look for diversified stocks. 
 
	As of January 22, the one-year return of the Premier Equity fund stood at 69.68 per cent, followed by JM Basic and DWS Investment Opportunity with returns at 56.94 per cent and 52.93 per cent, respectively. Although lower than the January 10 figures, these rates of returns could still be considered attractive.
 
	The state of equity-oriented funds is a lot better than that of stocks, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research Online.

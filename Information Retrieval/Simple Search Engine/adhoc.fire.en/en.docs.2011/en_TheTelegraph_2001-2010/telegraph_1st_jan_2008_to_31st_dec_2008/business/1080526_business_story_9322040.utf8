The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Refiners see capacity surge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Refiners see capacity surge

	New Delhi, May 25: India is emerging as a hub of oil refining, with many new projects set to commence production by 2012, and not many nations are expanding their capacities.         
	The country is offering tax benefits to refineries coming up by 2012, giving a competitive advantage to them vis--vis other nations. However, the surging price of crude oil and the Indian governments policy of subsidised sale of fuel could mar the investment plans of the refineries.         
	Officials said the new refineries would have to earn a margin of at least $10 per barrel to meet their capital needs. To cover operational costs, a margin of another $3-4 per barrel is required. Hence, a new refinery will have to earn a gross margin of around $13-14 per barrel to be financially viable. This can only be achieved if the refineries are set up by 2012, the deadline for tax benefits.        
	Firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, HPCL-Mittal and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited plan to come up with their units by 2012. Private entity Essar Oil could miss the deadline set by the government. Essar Oil plans to more than treble its refinery capacity at Vadinar, Gujarat.         
	Reliances Jamnagar refinery, which will start operations by the third quarter of this year, will be the first to commence production.        
	India plans to add 2.14 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2012 to its existing capacity of 2.98 million bpd.         
	However, the plans of the state-owned oil companies will depend on the additional funds available with them as they are selling fuel below costs, which is increasing their debt.        
	Industry sources said the oil firms could review their refinery plans as the soaring crude import bill was squeezing their operating capital.        
	According to the latest budget proposal, refining firms in which the government does not have a majority stake may be eligible for tax relief if they start production by March 2010.        
	However, the benefit will be available till 2012 for refineries in which the state-owned companies have a 100 per cent stake. Section 80-IB of the Income Tax Act provides for a seven-year tax holiday to entities refining mineral oil. In the Union budget, the finance minister proposed to withdraw the exemption from March 31, 2009. As many companies had already announced their plans to set up refineries, the government decided to extend the deadline to March 31, 2012, with specific conditions.        
	The petroleum planning and analysis cell, the research unit of the petroleum ministry, has said in a study that India had certain advantages over other countries to become a global refinery hub. It said economic and commercial factors could enable India to create substantial refining capacity in the near future.        
	The International Energy Agency has projected that world crude oil distillation capacity should rise to 93 million bpd by 2010 to meet the rising demand. This is an average growth of 1.8 per cent per year.        
	According to the study by the petroleum ministrys research wing, refineries are coming up more in the developing countries.         
	In the countries of the OECD (Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development), which largely comprises the rich nations, there are difficulties in setting up new refineries or expanding capacities.         
	In North America, there will be a small increase in capacity to 22.1 million bpd by 2010 and 25.6 million bpd by 2030. Despite these additions and a massive conversion of existing capacities to meet new fuel specifications, OECD countries will still have to import refined products in 2030, the study added.

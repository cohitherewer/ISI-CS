	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Industry feels the package on rate cuts and steps to boost housing and small and medium industries announced by the Reserve Bank today is not enough and expects the government to come out with more stimulants.        
	While welcoming the RBI measures, apex trade and industry chambers said sectors such as automobiles and white goods needed more support.        
	The central bank could have gone a step further by cutting the CRR and SLR rates to send a stronger signal of liquidity support to corporate houses, Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said. He, however, described the package as a good start in the right direction.        
	While welcoming the RBIs move to roll back monetary tightening measures, Ficci president Rajeev Chandrasekhar felt the increased government borrowing from credit markets (to the tune of Rs 45,000 crore) would crowd out other borrowers.         
	The cut in rates is not enough as the economic situation calls for drastic fiscal measures, Assocham president Sajjan Jindal said.        
	We now expect some fiscal stimulus from the government, which would help complete the package, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said.        
	The government has deferred by a day its Rs 17,000-crore stimulus package for auto, housing and exports and is likely to make an announcement tomorrow.        
	Disappointed that there were no major relief for automobiles and white goods, Mitra said the cut in short-term lending rate (repo) to 6.5 per cent and the borrowing (reverse repo) rate to 5 per cent with effect from December 8 was not enough.        
	Assocham said cuts in repo and reverse repo rates will give relief to interest-sensitive sectors such as automobiles, real estate and infrastructure but said much more was needed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt in no mood to cut fuel prices
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Firm stand                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The government today ruled out reduction in petrol and diesel prices though global crude has fallen to around $98 a barrel.         
	However, state-owned oil marketing companies today reduced domestic aviation fuel prices by about Rs 3,300 per kilolitre in tandem with the falling crude.         
	Airlines are unlikely to pass on the relief to passengers as they want to recoup past losses.        
	Per barrel reduction in global price is a myth and it does not mean that fuel prices have gone down as the government is still matching the losses worth Rs 168 lakh crore suffered by oil companies, said petroleum minister Murli Deora.        
	He said the financial position of oil firms was a matter of concern. Though crude price has softened, oil companies continue to bleed.         
	For jet fuel, the price in Calcutta has been reduced by Rs 3,328.38 per kilo litre to Rs 65,677.52.         
	Spiralling crude oil prices, till early July, had led to jet fuel prices rising 50 per cent. Jet fuel makes up 45 per cent of an Indian carriers cost against 20 per cent for international airlines.        
	Unlike jet fuel, the oil retailers want the government to consider raising petrol and diesel prices. They have also requested the government to issue long pending bonds under the special market operation scheme. Oil companies can exchange their bonds for foreign currency under the scheme.        
	Any further delay in the issue of bonds could affect capital expenditures of the companies whose oil import bill is also rising because of the fall in the value of the rupee.        
	The government has not allowed the oil companies to raise fuel prices in line with the cost, compensating half of their losses through oil bonds.        
	As a consequence of large under-recovery on fuel sales, the borrowings have increased at an alarming rate, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation chairman and managing director Arun Balakrishnan said in a letter to the petroleum secretary.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 24: Jet Airways today reported its first full-year loss since 2003 at Rs 253.06 crore for the year ended March 31, indicating how the turbulence sparked by rising fuel costs has sent Indias airline industry into a deep nosedive.        
	Last year, Jet Airways had reported losses in the first two quarters but then made a nifty profit in the last quarter to close 2006-07 with a profit of Rs 27.94 crore. The last time Jet Airways ended in the red was in March 2003 when it reported a loss of Rs 244.5 crore.        
	Jetlite (formerly Sahara Airlines), which it acquired last year, proved to be an even bigger drag on its performance. On a consolidated basis, Jet Airways reported a loss of Rs 653.87 crore for the year, which is far higher than the analysts estimate of around Rs 450 crore.        
	Rising fuel costs  triggered by the surge in global crude oil prices  saw the net loss leaping to Rs 221.18 crore in the fourth quarter (January to March 2008) compared with a profit of Rs 88.01 crore in the same period a year before.        
	Jet Airways blamed the loss on the increase in fuel prices and other operating expenses, pressures on yields and variations in passenger load factors on various routes.        
	Aircraft fuel expenses jumped to Rs 1080.2 crore (Rs 551.1 crore) in the fourth quarter. Fuel expenditure for the full year rose 35.64 per cent to Rs 3293.03 crore from Rs 2427.64 crore in the previous year. Jet Airways said mark-to-market provisioning on losses arising from derivative transactions had impacted the result to the extent of Rs 69.01 crore. Foreign exchange losses were put at Rs 11.06 crore in the fourth quarter.        
	The airline said growth in demand had also tapered off because of the increase in fuel surcharge, which has started affecting the lowest price paying segment in the market.        
	Jet Airways said a consistent hike in fuel surcharge had crimped traffic growth from a high of over 40 per cent in 2007, forcing airlines to sell more tickets at cheaper basic fares.         
	According to the airline, industry losses are estimated at $1 billion for 2007-08. In a warning, Jet Airways said if the current trends continued, losses in 2008-09 could double to $2 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Equity done, now its time for efficiency
                                                                                                               Equity done, now its time for efficiency
        Guest Column - RAJEEV GUPTA                        
	Soon after the budget speech, many commentators swore on TV that they had clearly seen the devil called electoral politics peeping out of it. I saw nothing but a restoration of equity. And a long overdue restoration at that, which was needed to address some of our famous policy failures of the seventies and early eighties.         
	The only question I asked myself after hearing the speech was would the FM also address efficiency in a similarly brilliant manner, and do it soon?        
	The loudest criticism by a large majority is on the $15 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) debt relief for farmers. This is a small number for a $1-trillion economy. And it is an overdue action by civil society. If a democracy spends 1.5 per cent of its GDP to address a severe and unanticipated hazard which suddenly visits nearly two-thirds of its population, how can that be unfair or ill advised? Something not dis-similar is being debated in the US for households on mortgage default.        
	On the fiscal side, nothing illustrates equity more than the across-the-board reduction of excise duty. In a low per capita income country, a 16 per cent excise duty on consumption items is like a 16 per cent flat tax on everyone and in fact, a higher than 16 per cent on poor and lower than 16 per cent on rich because consumption proportion of income is higher for the former.        
	Therefore, high excise tax levels in India are a very regressive tax and if a sweeping cut has been proposed in them it makes for equity. There couldnt have been a fairer tax reduction proposal than this.         
	These are the reasons I see this budget as a restoration of equity. The FM let slip his sequencing strategy when he quoted Nehru on his first wealth and then equity speech. The last 15 years have seen growth and creation of wealth and now that times are better, equity must be the next important goal for the government.        
	My fond hope is that the FM, brilliant as he is, has also devised in his mind a strategy for efficiency which he will unfold soon. We had a failed economic strategy right till 1991 and a large country is never easy to govern from Delhi. How do we enhance the efficiency of many of the pre-1991 delivery systems? Some ready examples of our clogged delivery systems can be seen in the contradictions we encounter every day. We are the second most populous country in the world, have a low per capita income and large unemployment but we also have one of the highest salary inflation in the world because educated manpower is in short supply.         
	We are one of the largest markets in the world for agricultural goods, but farming has been rendered unviable. We are one of the largest global consumers of fertilisers but no investment has taken place in this sector for the last 15 years in India. These are instances of failure of government delivery systems.        
	Education is under the stranglehold of the government and no amount of midday meals schemes are ever going to improve the quality of education delivered by the government set-up.         
	We see a successful highway development programme being overseen by the government. The lessons are very clear. The government must oversee but not implement. A delivery mechanism under the government would work well if it is in a public-private-partnership (PPP) format and would be an utter failure if it were in government administered format. Many details have to be ironed out to extend the PPP format to the increased outlays on education and health and more.        
	But then we dont have the best FM in the world for nothing.                    THE AUTHOR IS CARLYLE MD

	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Telecom minister A. Raja has sought the finance ministrys suggestion on the number of 3G operators in a telecom circle. Sources said the finance ministry was expected to respond soon. The telecom minister wants to consult the finance ministry before taking a final decision on the number of 3G slots for each circle, the sources said.         
	Earlier, the department of telecommunications had said that only five players would be permitted per circle, including Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telecom Nigam.         
	Details on the availability of 3G (third generation) spectrum indicate that Delhi and Gujarat can have two operators each, Uttar Pradesh (west) and Himachal Pradesh 3, and Bengal, 1. Spectrum is not available for Rajasthan and the Northeast. All the other circles can have a maximum of four service providers.

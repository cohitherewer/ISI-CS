                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airlines in fare hike push
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Take off                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 28: Airlines are preparing to raise fares at a time of falling jet fuel prices.         
	The price of aviation turbine fuel is expected to fall considerably as the crude oil price for Indian state-owned oil marketing companies has come down to about $97.12 a barrel from $113.65 last month.         
	Adjustments in the jet fuel price is usually made in the beginning of a month. The marketing companies had slashed the prices by 16 per cent in September after the crude price plunged from a peak of $147 per barrel.        
	However, airlines have decided to hike fares to cash in on the higher demand for air travel during the festive season.         
	Besides, a hike would help them recover some of their earlier losses.        
	Jet Airways has announced a 10 per cent hike in fares. Kingfisher Airlines has also decided to revise its basic fares from October 1.         
	There are indications of Air India raising ticket prices as well, but the national carrier will wait for the oil companies decision on jet fuel.        
	According to Partha Sarathi Basu, chief financial officer of SpiceJet, crude oil prices have doubled in the last year, and the current decline will not help reduce the burden of airlines.        
	Analysts say airlines have not passed on the earlier hikes in jet fuel prices completely to the consumers and are, therefore, unlikely to reduce the fares now.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has demanded a reduction in the sales tax on aviation fuel to help the airlines come out of losses.        
	According to Patel, states cannot afford to extract the maximum revenue from airlines. A high sales tax makes a state less attractive to airlines, affecting their investment potential.         
	The high rate of sales tax on jet fuel, which varies from 4 per cent to 29 per cent, is a major reason for the high price of the fuel.        
	Airlines have demanded a uniform sales tax rate of 4 per cent, while the ministry has proposed an upper ceiling of 12.5 per cent.        
	Andhra Pradesh has the lowest sales tax of 4 per cent, while Tamil Nadu and Bihar charge 29 per cent. Madhya Pradesh is marginally lower at 28.75 per cent. Bengal charges 25 per cent and Delhi, 20 per cent.        
	Unlike aviation, officials in the petroleum ministry said, there was not much talk of a reduction in the sales tax on diesel.         
	Any reduction in the tax on diesel, the preferred fuel of truckers, will have a direct impact on inflation.        
	Manipur has the lowest tax at 6 per cent, while Maharashtra charges 26 per cent.

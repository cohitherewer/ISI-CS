          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          PEACE AT LAST                                  
	New Delhi, July 11: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today agreed to a proposal of the department of telecommunications (DoT) for a higher all-India licence fee for 3G services at Rs 2,200 crore.        
	The increase had been sought by the telecom and finance ministries and paves the way for the finalisation of the 3G policy.         
	We have agreed to the DoTs recommendations that the reserve price should be raised, said Nripendra Misra, chairman of Trai.         
	In its policy recommendations, the DoT had fixed a reserve price of about Rs 2,200 crore. Trai, which had submitted its recommendations in September 2006, had proposed a reserve price of Rs 1,400 crore.        
	Officials of the DoT said the telecom ministry was also likely to allow each GSM operator to bid for 10 Mhz of spectrum against 5 Mhz proposed by Trai.        
	Trai also agreed to another DoT proposal that says successful bidders will have to match the highest bid. The regulators guidelines said the successful bidders should match the second highest bid.        
	On foreign participation in the bidding, Trai said since the DoT had referred the 3G auction and pricing proposal to the regulator twice, it was now free to go ahead with an open auction for 3G if it so desired.         
	The differences between the DoT and Trai had forced the government to hold back the 3G policy announcement for more than three months.         
	With the regulator deciding to put the issue to rest, the DoT may kickstart the auction process soon. DoT officials said the final policy might be announced by the end of this month. However, Misra said the telecom regulator continued to be against the international auctioning of 3G spectrum. Existing operators such as Bharti, Vodafone, Idea and the Tatas are not pleased by the hike in the base price.         
	They are also against the global auctioning of 3G licence. They perceive the real threat in 3G bidding to come from global majors such as Etisalat and other European and American companies.

	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Siemens Ltd today said it was open to renegotiating old contracts and that delayed payments might pose a challenge.        
	However, the company will not cut expenditure, Armin Bruck, managing director of Siemens, said.         
	It has been investing around Rs 200 crore over the past couple of years, and this is likely to continue in the current year as well.         
	Bruck was speaking to reporters after the company declared its results for the year ended September 30. Siemens net profit for the quarter dropped to Rs 225.2 crore from Rs 308.6 crore in the same period last year, a fall of 27 per cent.         
	The impact on the profitability was because of the provisions booked to cover the costs overrun on certain large projects, Bruck said.         
	For the year, the profit after tax stood at Rs 593.3 crore against Rs 596.5 crore a year ago. Sales turnover increased 7 per cent to Rs 8,295.5 crore (Rs 7,726.8 crore). The key drivers were power, industrial solutions amp; services, and the automation and drives businesses.         
	It received new orders of Rs 8,718.2 crore compared with Rs 10,108.5 crore a year ago, a drop of 14 per cent. For the quarter ended September 30, new orders rose 86 per cent and stood at Rs 2,385.1 crore against Rs 1,279.7 crore in the same period last year.

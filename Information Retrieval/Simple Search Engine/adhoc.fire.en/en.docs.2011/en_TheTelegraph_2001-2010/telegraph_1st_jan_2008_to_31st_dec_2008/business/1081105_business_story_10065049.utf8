The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom players face extra spectrum levy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Telecom players face extra spectrum levy
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Costly Proposition                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Telecom operators may have to shell out more for additional spectrum.        
	They pay a percentage of their revenue, annually, as fee for using 2G spectrum, and the government is exploring the possibility of charging 2 per cent extra for every megahertz (MHz) of spectrum held beyond 8MHz.         
	At present, GSM players pay 4 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue as fee for holding 10MHz of spectrum. This will go up to 6 per cent if the new rule takes effect.        
	The department of telecommunications also plans to levy a one-time charge of 1 per cent of the revenue for spectrum beyond 8MHz, sources said.         
	A meeting on spectrum was held today among Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and telecom minister A. Raja.        
	Earlier, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh had written to the Prime Minister and demanded that GSM operators pay an extra one-time fee for spectrum beyond 6.2MHz.         
	If implemented, the move would hit companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea and Vodafone-Essar who hold 10MHz of spectrum in metros.         
	At present, on paying Rs 1,651 crore as licence fee, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4MHz and 2.5 MHz, respectively, of spectrum per circle to launch operations. Beyond the initial allocation, operators get extra spectrum if they fulfil subscriber criteria.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had proposed that spectrum charges be increased if operators held more than 10 MHz in a circle        
	Mobile operators said higher spectrum charges could result in an increase in tariffs.         
	Operators are already working on low margins. The Indian telecom sector is the most heavily taxed. These charges, if revised upwards, will have implications on operators revenues which can impact tariffs, said a spokesperson for a GSM firm.

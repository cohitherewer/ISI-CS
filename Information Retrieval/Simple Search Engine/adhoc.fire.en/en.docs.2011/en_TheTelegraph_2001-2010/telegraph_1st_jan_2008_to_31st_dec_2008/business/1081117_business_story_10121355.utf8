	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Bankers are hoping for more rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as inflation recedes.        
	Interest rates are still high. Inflation has fallen to single digit. I think that will give confidence (to the RBI) to signal a drop in interest rates, ICICI Bank CEO and managing director K.V. Kamath said at the India Economic Summit. The summit, which started today, is organised by the World Economic Forum (WEF).         
	He said the government should work towards reducing interest rates by 200-300 basis points.         
	The RBI has already reduced the repo rate to 7.5 per cent from 9 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 5.5 per cent from 9 per cent. Repo is the rate at which the central bank offers very short-term loans to banks, while CRR is the portion of a deposit which banks must keep with the RBI.        
	CRR and repo cuts have prompted many banks to reduce their benchmark lending rates, leading to cheaper home, car and personal loans as well as lower interest costs for companies.        
	S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Calcutta-based Uco Bank, expects the RBI to cut CRR and the repo rate by 100 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively.         
	According to M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of the Union Bank of India, banks are likely to review their rates if the cost of funds comes down further.         
	Analysts also said that with inflation going down, the RBI would try to increase liquidity.         
	We see inflation at 5.5-6 per cent by March. The RBI can now cut rates more aggressively, said Crisils principal economist D.K. Joshi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toyota charts jet flight path
                                                                                                               Toyota charts jet flight path
                              HIGH FLIER                            
	Tokyo, March 5 (Agencies): Japans Toyota Motor, which is widely expected to overtake General Motors this year as the worlds top-selling auto maker, is considering entering the aircraft industry, a spokesperson said today.        
	Toyota may invest in a company to be set up by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for its passenger jet project, Toyota spokesperson Kayo Doi said.        
	Mitsubishi Heavy has invited us to invest (in the venture) and we are considering it, she said, while adding nothing has been decided yet.        
	The comment came after a report today in the Asahi Shimbun daily said Toyota planned to put up $97 million in the venture to be set up in April.        
	Under the regional jet project, Mitsubishi will develop small planes, which is expected to seat 70 to 90 passengers and start operations in 2012.         
	Two trading houses, Mitsubishi Corp, which has historical ties with Mitsubishi Heavy, and Sumitomo Corp, also said they were considering requests to invest in the jet project.        
	A final decision on whether to go ahead with the project is expected in the next month or two. The participation of major companies will boost its chances of getting the green light as well as offset development costs for Mitsubishi Heavy.        
	Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman Hideo Ikuno said his company had reached out to several companies to invest in the project, but declined further comment.        
	Toyota rival Honda Motor forayed into the aviation market over a year ago and now sells a seven-person micro-jet, but Toyotas interest may not extend that far.        
	We are looking at investing from the standpoint of participating in a national project, Jiji news agency quoted a Toyota source as saying, adding that the auto maker had no plans to make a full-fledged entry into the aviation industry.         
	Japans largest heavy machinery maker wants to use the jet to enter a market dominated by Brazils Embraer and Canadas Bombardier Inc.

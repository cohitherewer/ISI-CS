	Mumbai, March 31: The Oberois and Hilton International Company today formally dissolved their alliance  marking the end of a five-year association that ran into trouble last year after Hilton chose to set up a chain of hotels with real estate giant DLF.        
	The Oberoi group has decided to rename Hilton Towers at Nariman Point as Trident Nariman Point. East India Hotels  the holding company for a number of Oberoi properties  owns the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains.        
	The termination of our strategic alliance with Hilton was primarily because of Hiltons unexpected move to form a joint venture with a real estate company. The joint venture was announced after our alliance with Hilton. Moreover, they are also exploring opportunities in the 3-star segment, said P.R.S. Oberoi, chairman of the Oberoi Group.        
	The Trident Hilton hotels in Gurgaon, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Cochin, Bhubaneswar and Chennai will be rebranded Trident hotels and will carry a new logo.        
	Hilton International Co (Hilton International) and Oberois hospitality arm, EIH Ltd, had entered into a strategic alliance for co-branding hotels in India under the Trident Hilton brand. The alliance covered nine hotels with approximately 1900 rooms across India, including the Oberoi Towers in Mumbai, which was later re-branded as Hilton Towers.         
	The group is in the process of setting up three more Trident hotels in the next two years. The plan includes a 436-key Trident hotel at Mumbais Bandra Kurla, and one each at Bangalore and Hyderabad.         
	The Bandra Kurla Trident is scheduled to open in the last quarter of 2008. We expect this hotel to be the market leader in north Mumbai, the company said.

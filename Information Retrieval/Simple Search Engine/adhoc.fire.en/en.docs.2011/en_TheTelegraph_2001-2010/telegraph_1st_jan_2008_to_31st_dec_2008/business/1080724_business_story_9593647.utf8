The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vodafone prop for shares
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vodafone prop for shares
                              SURPRISE MOVE                            
	London, July 23 (Reuters): Mobile phone group Vodafone moved quickly to defend its share price on Wednesday, announcing a surprise 1-billion ($2 billion) buyback programme after its stock crashed a day earlier on a weaker-than-expected trading update.        
	Vodafone shares slumped almost 14 per cent on Tuesday, wiping nearly 11 billion of its market value, after the group said its full-year revenue would be at the bottom of a previously stated forecast range.         
	The news dented hopes that the Britain-based firm would be relatively resilient to an economic downturn and cast a shadow over the telecom sector.        
	The board of Vodafone Group Plc has considered the market reaction ... and has decided to introduce a 1-billion share repurchase programme with immediate effect, Vodafone said in a statement.        
	This action reflects the boards belief that the share price significantly undervalues Vodafone, it added.        
	Shares in the group were 2.5 per cent higher in early trading on Wednesday, in an overall higher market, valuing the company at 81 billion.        
	Collins Stewart analyst Mark James said he expected a relief rally in the telecom sector on Wednesday, helped by the Vodafone buyback and positive news from the Dutch Telecom group KPN, but he remained concerned about the future.        
	We believe that the medium-term outlook for telecom company cash generation is deteriorating, he said in a note to clients.         
	Spectrum auctions, mergers and acquisitions, increasing competition or regulation and convergent business models may all dent cash generation, and as Vodafone first-quarter results have shown, not even telecom companies are immune to an economic slowdown. We believe underperformance is set to continue, he said.         
	Vodafone lowered its outlook on Tuesday citing economic weakness, particularly in Spain, which was resulting in fewer customers buying and using new handsets.        
	Shareholder support        
	Vodafone said the buyback would need shareholder approval at its annual general meeting on July 29.         
	It will pay up to 105 per cent of the shares average closing price on the five business days before the buyback.        
	Analysts at Cazenove said despite the surprising move, it was difficult to see the groups shares staging any immediate recovery.         
	This amounts to around 1.5 per cent of Vodafones outstanding share capital or 775 million shares at yesterdays close. The financial implications are not material with sentiment and managements confidence being more important, the analysts wrote.

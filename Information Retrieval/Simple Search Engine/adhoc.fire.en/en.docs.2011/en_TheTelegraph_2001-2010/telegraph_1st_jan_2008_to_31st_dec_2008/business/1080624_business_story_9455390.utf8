          SIMI KAMBOJ                          WARMING UP                                  
	Nashik, June 23: Samsonite is planning to diversify in a big way.        
	Our vision is to grow beyond travel goods and diversify into other travel-related merchandise, Subrata Dutta, chief operating officer of Samsonite (Asia Pacific), said.        
	After launching travel shoes recently, the American luggage major is planning to introduce eyewear and watches next. The collection could arrive in India in a year, Dutta said.        
	Designed by Italian shoe designer Alberto Del Biondi for high-flying business executives, Samsonite travel shoes use a technology that allows the footwear to expand and contract according to the need of the feet during air travel.        
	Samsonite shoes were introduced in Italy, Germany and Korea before they were launched here.        
	We want shoes to be the second pillar of the company. Over the next three years, we see shoes accounting for 25 per cent of our business in India, Dutta said.         
	Though shoes at present account for just about 5 per cent of Samsonites business, it is planning to spend 50 per cent of its advertisement budget on footwear.        
	Once Samsonite shoes find a foothold in the Indian market, the company will look to launch more travel-related products here, Dutta said.         
	The $1-billion companys twin brands Samsonite and American Tourister  enjoy a 36 per cent market share in the Rs 950-crore Indian organised luggage industry.         
	Both brands together witnessed 42 per cent growth during the last year, beating the industry average of 15 per cent, officials said.        
	With air travel growing at 25 per cent annually, Samsonite expects the demand for its products to remain firm in India. The company also plans to scale up its retail network with more stores across the country.        
	We have 180 exclusive retail stores. We would like to take the number up to 250 by the end of 2009, Dutta said.        
	Samsonite started its India operations in 1995 as a 60:40 joint venture with the Tainwala family. Its unit in Nashik, the companys only hard-luggage plant outside Belgium, is Samsonites biggest manufacturing facility in the world.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Sibal in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The Union cabinet today referred to the committee of secretaries a proposal to allow Air India to set up a joint venture with a Singapore aviation firm. The proposed venture will manage cargo operations and ground handling facilities at major international airports.        
	The cabinet decided to refer the matter to the committee of secretaries to work out the details, Kapil Sibal, Union science and technology minister, said after the meeting.        
	The committee will decide on the structure of the proposed joint venture firm.        
	Air India had mooted a proposal several months ago to enter into a joint venture with Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) for providing ground and cargo handling facilities at Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and some other airports.         
	The company also planned to extend the joint venture arrangement beyond the Indian airports.        
	Air India already provides ground handling services with SATS at the two new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad.        
	Air India, which earns over Rs 700 crore annually by providing ground handling services to international carriers, plans to expand its base in the Rs 3,000-crore ground-handling segment.        
	Under the civil aviation ministrys new ground handling policy, which is likely to take effect next year, only three agencies  Air India, the airport operator and an entity selected by the airport operator through competitive bidding will be authorised to offer the services.        
	The new policy does not allow private domestic carriers to provide the services.

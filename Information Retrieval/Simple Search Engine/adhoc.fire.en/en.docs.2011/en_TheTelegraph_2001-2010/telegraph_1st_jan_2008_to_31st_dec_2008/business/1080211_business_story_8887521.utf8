	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The government is working on fresh norms for the allocation of spectrum to new telecom companies.        
	Existing rules make new companies eligible for 4.4MHz of GSM spectrum along with licences. According to officials of the department of telecom (DoT), Usually, the first to get a telecom licence has priority over spectrum. However, we need to establish a criterion to allocate start-up spectrum to new telecom operators because of a large number of players.         
	The DoT plans to come up with a start-up spectrum allocation formula before it grants licences to the nine companies who were issued letters of intent (LoIs) last month.        
	It will take at least two months to decide on the criterion to allocate spectrum, the officials said.        
	While issuing the LoIs, the DoT had said the first company to submit a licence fee against the issue of an LoI would also be the first in a queue for spectrum.        
	This led to a scramble among the aspirants to deposit licence fees.        
	To ensure spectrum, all the new players paid licence fees on the very day they got their LoIs.        
	However, the plans of the new telecom players hinge on the availability of spectrum, the officials said.        
	While the DoT claims it has over 35MHz of spectrum both for new and existing operators, actual allocations depend on when the defence authorities agree to hand over the scarce resource.        
	Officials of the DoTs wireless planning cell said, After spectrum is allocated to existing players such as Aircel for 14 circles, Idea for two circles and Vodafone for six circles, not more than two aspirants will be able to get start-up spectrum.        
	Of the nine new companies to hold the letters of intent, property developer Unitech Ltd, HFCL concern Datacom and Loop Telecom Private Ltd, an affiliate of the Essar group, got permission to offer telecom services on a pan-India basis.

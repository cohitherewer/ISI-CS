	New Delhi, April 4: Inflation spiralled to a more-than- three-year high of 7 per cent for the week ended March 22, setting alarm bells ringing within the ruling alliance, which decided to crack down on hoarding.        
	Rising vegetable and cooking oil prices were behind the high rate of inflation.        
	Vegetable prices shot up by nearly 5 per cent in just one week, while onion prices rose 22 per cent in two months.         
	Ten years ago, when onion prices rose sixfold, the BJP was voted out of power in two states.        
	According to Arun Jaitley, spokesperson for the BJP, which now hopes to play the price card in coming elections, Inflation is a UPA tax on the aam aadmi.        
	 This year will see elections in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Jammu amp; Kashmir, while the Lok Sabha polls will be held next year.        
	Besides onions and vegetables, grain prices have jumped 17-20 per cent, pulses by 20-35 per cent and sugar by over 18 per cent in a little over two months.         
	Rising food prices have cost politicians their jobs in the past.         
	Inflation has always proved to be a vote loser for ruling parties. India Shining or aam aadmi rarely work in inflationary situations, said S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission.        
	The Congress, the main party in the ruling coalition, is positioning itself as the common mans party by announcing a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver package for small farmers and a job guarantee scheme for the rural poor.         
	Its please all budget and the announcement to give civil servants pay hikes are seen as moves to win popular approval before elections.         
	Profiteering war        
	Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said the government would prevent profiteering in essential commodities.        
	Top officials said the central government would write letters to state chief secretaries seeking a crackdown on speculation and food hoarding.         
	The Centre recently invoked rules that allowed states to set limits on food stocks private traders can keep with them. In the last few weeks, it took many other steps to check inflation.        
	You have to wait for a few weeks before you can see the impact of all this on the ground, said Abhishek Singhvi, the spokesperson for the Congress.         
	Party workers, however, said the high prices could take a toll on the party in next months Karnataka elections.         
	The Left parties, which support the ruling coalition from the outside, also feels that rising prices will hit the Congress.         
	According to D.Raja, national secretary of the CPI, Despite our warnings, the government has failed to check the price rise. The aam admi plank will not work. The Congress will have to face the wrath of the electorate.         
	There could be more steps to curb inflation. Goldman Sachs analyst Tushar Poddar said, We expect strong action by the government including reducing import duties, imposing export taxes and clamping down on commodity prices.

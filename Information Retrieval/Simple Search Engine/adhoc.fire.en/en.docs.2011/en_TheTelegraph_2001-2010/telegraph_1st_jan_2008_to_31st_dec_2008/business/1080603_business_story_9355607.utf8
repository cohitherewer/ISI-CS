                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Input cost eats into McLeod net 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            McLeod chairman Deepak Khaitan (left) with CFO   Kamal Baheti in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture        
	Calcutta, June 2: McLeod Russel India Limited has reported a lower consolidated net profit at Rs 46.41 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008 against Rs 79.57 crore a year ago.        
	However, the total income of the company increased to Rs 702.18 crore from Rs 670.92 crore in the year.        
	Our overall results have been good and we are gradually building a good base for the company. Rising input costs have contributed to a lower net profit with a net increase of Rs 2.50 per kg. For the industry, the increase is as high as Rs 4 per kg, said Deepak Khaitan, vice-chairman of McLeod Russel.        
	The year had begun on a promising note, but the rising oil prices pushed up the costs of inputs such as fertilisers and chemicals.        
	Tea prices were marginally up during 2007-08 to Rs 87.21 per kg from Rs 86.19 per kg.        
	For this year, production is expected to increase to 77 million kg from 75 million kg, with export rising to 30 million kg from 27 million kg.         
	In the last fiscal, McLeod had earmarked a capital expenditure of Rs 30 crore for the upgradation of its units.         
	It plans to invest around Rs 25 crore in the factories this year.        
	The total debt of the company as on March 31, 2008 stood at Rs 457 crore, of which around Rs 57 crore may be offset this year. Most of our acquisitions were funded through debts, Khaitan said.         
	McLeod is the largest tea producing company globally with 75 million kg capacity. It is looking to increase its production by increasing orthodox output to 7 million kg from 3.5 million kg.        
	It today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) that it would conduct a postal ballot of its shareholders for raising the limit of the holding of foreign institutional investors in the company to 40 per cent of the paid-up capital.        
	Price outlook        
	Based on estimated production and consumption for 2007, tea stocks at the beginning of 2008 are at their lowest in the last six to 10 years.         
	Prices of the commodity in Kenya and Sri Lanka are ruling higher by 25 to 30 per cent over last year because of lower production in Kenya and higher demand of the orthodox variety in the first three months of this year.         
	Jatropha business        
	D1 Williamson Magor Bio Fuels Ltd, a 50-50 joint venture between D1 Oil Plc of the UK and McLeod Russel, plans to bring another 70,000 hectares under jatropha cultivation in the Northeast and Jharkhand.

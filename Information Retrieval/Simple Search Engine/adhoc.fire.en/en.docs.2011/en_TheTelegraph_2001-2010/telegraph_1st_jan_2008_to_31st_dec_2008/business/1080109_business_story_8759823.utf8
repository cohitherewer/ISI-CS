The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SC backs spectrum norm
                                                                                                            SC backs spectrum norm
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Supreme Court today refused to place any bar on spectrum allocation, giving the government a free hand to grant radiowaves to new telecom licence applicants.        
	The apex bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said the government could not be prevented from taking a policy decision.        
	The government is in the best position to decide who is the best bidder. Judiciary cannot decide this, said the bench, which was passing an order on a petition filed by an NGO, Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar, seeking a direction that the allocation of spectrum be done through auction and not on first come, first served basis.        
	DoT officials said as there was no stay they would go ahead with the announced policy wherein spectrum would be allotted first to existing operators, then to GSM players who had applied in 2006 for expanding into new circles and then to those CDMA mobile service providers who wanted to offer GSM services.         
	Last week, Delhi High Court had also refrained from stopping the spectrum allocation exercise initiated by the government, but had said that the distribution of frequency depended on the final outcome of the petition filed by GSM operators lobby COAI. Both the courts have, however, mentioned that any decision taken by the government, in terms of granting GSM spectrum to CDMA players, can be challenged by opposing parties.         
	Reacting to the order, COAI officials said, The court has made it clear that in case the government decides to issue spectrum to crossover technology companies, we can immediately go back to court. Our affidavits to oppose such a move are ready.        
	The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) had in December filed a petition seeking a stay on the issue of fresh spectrum to Reliance Communications under the crossover policy. The final hearing of this petition is scheduled for January 31, when Delhi High Court will take a definite decision on the spectrum allocation policy.        
	COAI petition        
	The COAIs petition challenging the governments decision to allow CDMA players to offer GSM mobile services will come up for hearing in the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) tomorrow. The telecom tribunal had last month refused to stay the process of spectrum allocation to telecom players who have been allowed to offer services on dual technology platforms, forcing GSM operators to approach Delhi High Court.        
	Spectrum, or radiowaves, over which mobile services travel is a scarce commodity, and both CDMA and GSM players have been at loggerheads ever since the government proposed the new norms for allocating additional spectrum that are crucial for expanding services.

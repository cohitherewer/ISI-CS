The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Volatility index on Sebi agenda
                                                                                                            Volatility index on Sebi agenda
                            
	Chennai, Jan. 5 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will launch long-dated futures and volatility index within a month, according to its chairman M. Damodaran.        
	The market regulator has recently introduced mini contracts in equity indices.        
	The long-dated futures will be introduced in ten days, Damodaran said here today.        
	The other one that I am looking forward to is the volatility index, which might take a month. It is something on which the stock exchanges are working on at this point of time, he told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on corporate governance organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.        
	It is a very good product. There are some products where we have to consult the Reserve Bank and we are in that process. There are now seven products of which two to three need clearance from the RBI, he said.        
	The Sebi chairman said some of the mature markets used the the volatility index.        
	On Clause 49 (of the listing agreement), Damodaran said there would be no dilution until an amendment is passed in Parliament. I see no essential contradiction with what the JJ Irani committee has recommended for the company law bill, he said.

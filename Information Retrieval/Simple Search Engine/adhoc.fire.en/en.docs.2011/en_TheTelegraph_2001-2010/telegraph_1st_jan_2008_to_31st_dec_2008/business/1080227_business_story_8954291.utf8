	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Tata Communications will offer the WiMAX broadband service in Calcutta in the second half of this year.
    
	The company is set to invest $500 million in the next three years in the WiMAX project. In these three years, Tata Communications hopes to expand to 35 cities.
    
	We have already started providing WiMAX wireless broadband in Bangalore. We will focus on 15 metros and mini metros this year. Calcutta will be part of the first phase of expansion. We will be using the existing towers of Tata Teleservices to offer WiMAX services. The operation will commence with 300 to 500 cell sites in each metro, said Srinivasa Addepalli, senior vice-president (corporate strategy), Tata Communications.
    
	WiMAX is a technology that offers last mile wireless connectivity at higher bandwidths. It is necessary in a country such as India where there is a lack of planning on how fibres and copper pipes should be laid. It is also difficult to connect remote areas through fibre optic and copper cables. 
    
	Since the connection is delivered wirelessly there is no fear of flooding, or of copper or fibre optic cables being cut, said Addepalli.
    
	Tata Communications had earlier announced that it was looking at seven to nine million subscribers, or 25 per cent of the broadband market, by 2010.
    
	Addepalli said prices would range between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per month depending on the plan and usage.
    
	The government is likely to come up with a pricing policy and spectrum issue guidelines for retail WiMAX in the next few months.
    
	We would then have a clear indication on the pricing and will also be able to cut costs to make it more accessible, said Addepalli.
    
	Global plans
    
	The company has entered into a joint venture with China Entercom which will give it ready access to 347 cities in China.

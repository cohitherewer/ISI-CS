The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tug-of-war over TNS control
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Tug-of-war over TNS control
										                        Sorrell: Turned down				                           
	London, July 9 (Reuters): Germanys GfK Holdings AG is considering a cash offer for Britains Taylor Nelson Sofres after Martin Sorrells advertising group WPP muscled in on their original merger plan.        
	WPP Group, the worlds second-largest advertising company, made a hostile 1.08 billion ($2.13 billion) bid for market research group TNS earlier on Wednesday, after its previous proposals were rejected.         
	TNS, which is the worlds third biggest market research company with clients such as Procter amp; Gamble, again advised its shareholders to ignore the WPP bid. It noted that GfK was in discussions with an identified potential source of equity.        
	TNS and GfK had been previously working on a merger of equals but GfK said it had now received a strong indication of interest in the cash proposal. The form of consideration being considered is all cash, although the formal right to vary this is reserved, it said in a statement.        
	TNS shares rose 10.5 per cent to 274 pence in early morning trading on Wednesday. WPP was down 2.4 per cent at 453.5 pence. WPP is offering 173 pence in cash and 0.1889 of a new WPP share which, based on Tuesdays closing WPP price of 464 pence, values each TNS share at 260.60 pence.        
	Analysts had expected some TNS shareholders to be tempted by WPPs offer, which has a high cash component at a time of economic and stock market uncertainty, but also say WPP could return with a higher bid  between 280 pence and 300 pence. Presumably GfK would not offer a premium to the WPP given the suggested all-cash basis, analysts at Kaupthing said in a note to clients before the GfK statement. Whether a bidding war (GFK counter and then WPP counter) is generated from this situation is difficult to guess at this stage given the macro backdrop.        
	Buying time        
	TNS and GfK had previously said a merger would result in the worlds second biggest market research company with a market value of about $4 billion and expertise in the consumer, technology, media and healthcare sectors.        
	A combined group would also have good coverage in faster growing markets of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients before the GfK announcement that WPP was buying itself time with its bid.It will likely come back with a higher bid, it said.         
	The WPP offer represented a premium of 52 per cent to where TNS shares stood before news of its planned merger with GfK in late April.

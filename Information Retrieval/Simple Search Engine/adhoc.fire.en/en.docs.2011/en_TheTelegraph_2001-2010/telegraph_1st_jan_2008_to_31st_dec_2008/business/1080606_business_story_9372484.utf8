          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Biding time                                  
	Mumbai, June 5: Inflation looks set to top 9 per cent in the weeks ahead but the financial sector mavens expect the Reserve Bank to wait till July 29 when it makes its quarterly monetary policy review before raising benchmark interest rates.        
	Most bankers feel that with liquidity already drained due to twin hikes in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in April, the central bank will not use this device in a hurry.        
	The RBI is likely to raise the repo rate by 25 basis points. The repo rate  which is the rate at which the RBI provides money to banks  currently stands at 7.75 per cent.        
	The prospect of inflation crossing the 9-per-cent-mark has arisen after the sharp increase in petrol and diesel prices yesterday.        
	Most of the economists reckoned that inflation could top 9 per cent in a two-step process  first because of the direct impact on goods and services and later when the indirect impact of the price hike starts to creep in.        
	Some feel that inflation could even hit 10 per cent.         
	In a report released today, Standard Chartered forecast that headline inflation would be pushed up by 116 basis points because of the revision in fuel prices.         
	This is sharply higher than the 85 to 95 basis points jump in inflation expected by other entities.        
	We expect headline inflation to be pushed up by 116 basis points on these measures. Further to this, an increase in ATF prices by 20 per cent announced earlier should add yet another 13 basis points, pushing inflation to 10.06 per cent for the week ending June 7 from the current 8.1 per cent, said the banks economists Shuchita Mehta and Anubhuti Sahay.        
	Standard Chartered has also changed its forecast for average inflation for the rest of the curent financial year. It now feels that average inflation will rise to 8.45 per cent for the first quarter, 9.65 per cent for the next quarter, 9.60 per cent for the third quarter and 7.19 per cent for the three months after that.        
	The risks to these numbers remain skewed on the upside as secondary effects are yet to be factored in and oil prices do not show any signs of relenting, they pointed out.         
	The RBI has been in a monetary tightening mode since the past three years to combat inflation. Despite the worrisome inflation numbers being feared, it was largely felt that the central bank was unlikely to take any policy action before July 29.        
	The RBI is unlikely to take any hasty decision. It will wait for more numbers to come in. Therefore, any policy action will only come on July 29. There could be a repo rate hike. Given the existing liquidity situation, CRR will not be raised, said a treasury chief at a private sector bank.        
	Standard Chartered is of the opinion that the central bank will raise the reverse repo (6 per cent) in the quarterly policy meeting next month. The reverse repo helps the RBI soak up liquidity from banks.

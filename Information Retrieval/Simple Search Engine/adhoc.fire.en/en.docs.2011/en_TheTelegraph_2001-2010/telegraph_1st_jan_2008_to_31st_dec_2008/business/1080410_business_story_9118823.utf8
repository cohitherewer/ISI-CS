          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                            
	New Delhi, April 9: The government is likely to slash the customs duty on steel and zinc to zero, impose an ad valorem tax on iron ore exports, reduce the countervailing duty on construction steel imports and suspend futures trading in steel.         
	It will also import cement from Pakistan, increase the price at which it buys grain from farmers for distribution through ration shops and crack down on traders hoarding food.         
	These measures are part of a larger attempt to control rising prices and have been finalised after a series of inter-ministry parleys.         
	Steel and zinc        
	Top officials said the government would soon come out with rules reducing the duty on all finished steel and zinc imports to zero. It would also reduce the countervailing duty on TMT bars used in construction and impose a 16 per cent export duty on finished steel.         
	These measures are expected to improve the availability of steel in the domestic market and force manufacturers to hold prices of steel products, which have increased 50 per cent this year.         
	Iron ore exports        
	The government plans to replace the fixed export duty of Rs 300-a-tonne for high-grade iron ore exports and Rs 50-a-tonne for low-grade exports with a single ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. This move, which had long been demanded by steel makers, will curb the sale of iron ore abroad and force miners to sell larger quantities at home.        
	Semi-finished steel        
	The government is also considering a proposal to reduce the excise duty on semi-finished steel products to help steel makers who have been complaining of escalating input costs.         
	The measures are expected to be revenue-neutral as the taxes sacrificed will be made up by higher receipts from the ad valorem tax on ore exports.         
	Wheat price        
	The government will also increase the procurement price of wheat to ensure that farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh sell sufficient grains to it. It had earlier fixed a procurement price of Rs 1,000 a quintal and was mulling a Rs 100-a-quintal bonus on this. The cabinet is likely to now announce a bonus of Rs 200 a quintal.         
	Pak cement        
	The government will also consider importing cement from Pakistan to cool down prices of the commodity, which have gone up fivefold over the last three years. The Minerals amp; Metals Trading Corporation could be asked to import cement at Rs 170-180 per 50-kg bag against the domestic price of over Rs 230.        
	Check on hoarding        
	The Centre will ask states to check the hoarding of food by traders. Much of the price increase in food products is because of speculative hoarding. We want a sharp curb in that, officials said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BSNL dials mega float number
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The government is keen to dilute a 10 per cent stake in state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), which can lead to the countrys largest initial public offering (IPO) of around Rs 40,000 crore.         
	However, BSNL unions have threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the PSU goes ahead with the IPO. The government has decided to discuss the issue with union leaders to convince them of the merits of listing.        
	After negotiations with union leaders are concluded, the government can take any decision on the IPO, telecom minister A. Raja said.        
	BSNLs 3.04 lakh employees have been offered 500 shares each at Rs 10 apiece, while the price for others will be in the range of Rs 300-400 per share, Raja said.        
	Unions, however, have been lukewarm in their response. Union leader V.N. Namboodiri said: We are totally opposed to the IPO and any offer of 500 shares is not going to change it. We are also not convinced with the argument that a stake dilution is necessary for expansion, growth and the grant of navaratna status to BSNL.        
	Faced with opposition from the unions and the Left parties, the government had twice shelved BSNLs IPO plans.        
	Analysts said that when listed, the market capitalisation of BSNL could be as high as Rs 400,000 crore, much more than Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications, whose market capitalisations were Rs 183,283 crore and Rs 163,683 crore, respectively.         
	BSNL director finance S.D. Saxena said the IPO could happen in six months. We will not rush into it. We will try to convince everyone. If there is a delay in the issue it is better. The valuation may go up.        
	3G spectrum        
	The government today allocated 5 MHz of third generation (3G) spectrum to BSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL)        
	Raja also approved the release of 20 MHz of broadband and WiMax spectrum each to both the PSUs.         
	The department of telecommunications (DoT) today also granted Rs 2,000 crore to BSNL, the amount it lost after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India scrapped the access deficit charge. This is a levy on private operators that goes to meet BSNLs rural commitments.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 14: Spencers, the retail arm of RPG Enterprises, is set to announce its initiative to roll out a coffee chain in India tomorrow.         
	The company is going to partner one of the top coffee houses of the world to enter the fast growing business in India, dominated by Barista and Caf Coffee Day.         
	Even as company officials remained tightlipped about the possible joint venture partner, the name of the USs second largest coffee retailer Caribou was doing the rounds. However, it could not be confirmed. When contacted, an official of Caribou Coffee said, We have no comments to make at this time.         
	In late June, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka had said negotiations were at an advanced stage. It is going to be a joint venture. We are looking at 400 stores in the next three years, Goenka had said.         
	The coffee deal, to be announced tomorrow, would be one of the four tie-ups Spencers is pursuing with foreign majors in the retail space.         
	In May, it tied up with the UK s Chad Valley , the globally famous toy brand from the house of Woolworths. This is the first foray for Chad Valley into the Indian market.

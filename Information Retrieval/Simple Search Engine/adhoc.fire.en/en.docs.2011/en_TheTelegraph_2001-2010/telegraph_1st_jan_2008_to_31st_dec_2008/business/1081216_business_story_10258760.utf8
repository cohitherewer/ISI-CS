                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       More banks reveal Madoff exposure
                              Madoff: Deep trouble                            
	London/Tokyo, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Banks and investment funds across the world lined up on Monday to admit investing billions of dollars in the companies of Bernard Madoff, whom the US authorities accused of masterminding a massive fraud.        
	Britains HSBC Holdings Plc was the latest bank to join the growing list, saying it had an exposure of around $1 billion, making it one of the biggest victims of the alleged $50-billion fraud.        
	The Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group in the UK, Japans Nomura and Frances Natixis also said they were hit by the worldwide scandal.        
	Financial companies, reeling after a year of enormous writedowns on bad credit assets, have so far tallied up more than $10 billion in direct and indirect exposure to the possible fraud by Madoff, the 70-year old trader who was arrested on Thursday.        
	There is a broader danger here for the industry, an equity analyst at a large European bank said.        
	This huge fraud, supposedly in blue-chip funds, is going to make people nervous, and youve already seen massive redemptions, he said.        
	Shares in Frances Natixis were down 4.7 per cent after it said it had as much as 450 million euros ($605 million) of exposure to the fiasco. The wider DJ Stoxx banking index was 0.9 per cent lower.        
	The US prosecutors and regulators have accused Madoff, a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, of running the fraud through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund.        
	Man Group, the worlds largest listed hedge fund manager, said it was exposed to Madoff through its fund of funds business RMF, which has $360 million invested in funds directly or indirectly sub-advised by Madoff.        
	Swiss private bank Benedict Hentsch has undone its recent merger with alternative investment specialist Fairfield Greenwich, which said it had put half of its assets in one of the funds set up by Madoff.        
	Numbers rise        
	A rising number of banks across Europe detailed their potential losses from Madoff, who allegedly set up a so-called Ponzi scheme, in which existing investors are paid out with money from new clients, not from actual investment returns.        
	BNP Paribas and Santander detailed potential losses on Sunday, and others joined at the start of the trading week, with Italys UniCredit SpA revealing exposure of around 75 million euros.        
	RBS said its potential loss could amount to some 400 million ($595 million), if it assumed that the value of its assets in Madoffs firm were nil.        
	Its exposure to the scandal was through trading and collateralised lending to funds of hedge funds invested in the group, the bank said.

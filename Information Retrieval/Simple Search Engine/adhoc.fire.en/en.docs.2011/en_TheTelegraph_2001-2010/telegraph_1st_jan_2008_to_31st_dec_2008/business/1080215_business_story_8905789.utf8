          OUR CORRESPONDENT                        Paswan: Winning ways                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Major steel producers, including SAIL, Tata Steel and Jindal Steel amp; Power, today agreed to roll back prices but asked the government to consider matching cut in excise duty to maintain margins.        
	The price of hot-rolled coils has been reduced by Rs 500 a tonne to Rs 27,500, while that of TMT bars has been cut by Rs 1,000 per tonne to Rs 28,000.        
	Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who met manufacturers today to voice his concern over a rise in prices, said, The industry has voluntarily agreed to roll back the increase in prices for the benefit of the common man.        
	TMT bars are an item of mass consumption, therefore, rolling back its price was necessary, he added.        
	However, sources said the decision to cut prices came after several rounds of talks between steel producers and the government and took all the persuasive skills of the officials as well as promises of future excise cuts.         
	Most steel producers had increased prices by an average of Rs 2,500 a tonne from February 1. In January, too, prices were hiked by Rs 600-900 a tonne. Steel producers had said the price hike was necessary because of a rise of Rs 6,000-7,000 in the costs of iron ore and coking coal - the two main inputs in steel making.        
	Paswan has agreed to talk to the finance ministry for a cut in excise duty on steel to 8 per cent from 16 per cent. Moreover, we (steel ministry) will take up the issue of rising freight rates with the railway ministry, he said.        
	S.K. Roongta, chairman of Steel Authority of India Limited, said, Steel producers were constrained to increase prices because of a hike in input costs but have agreed to roll them back in the interest of the common man.        
	On the ministers appeal, we have agreed to reduce the price of TMT bars and hot-rolled coils to neutralise the impression that the industry was arbitrarily raising prices, said Navin Jindal, managing director of Jindal Steel and Power.        
	However, a section of the industry is not happy with the days developments. This is autocracy. The government forced us to take a price cut, said an official of a domestic steel firm. The official cautioned that if raw material prices continued to rise, the industry would have to hike prices again next month.        
	Another source said Paswan appreciated the fact that steel prices had been increased only partially compared with raw materials such as iron ore. He also assured us he would ask his colleagues in the ministry to look into the hike in raw material prices, the source added.

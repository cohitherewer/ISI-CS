	Calcutta, Feb. 3: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will start selling its first stand-alone health insurance product, Health Plus, this week. 
    
	The unit-linked plan, designed by international reinsurer Munich Re, offers premium holidays and a facility to increase or decrease annual premium amounts.
    
	Health Plus is a reimbursement plan. Therefore, a policyholder will not need prior approval from the insurer for hospitalisation. 
    
	However, hospitalisation within the first six months of buying the product will not be covered unless it is because of an accident. 
    
	Under the plan, the LIC will not pay any cash benefit for the first 48 hours of hospitalisation. The benefit will be paid if one is admitted for more than 48 hours, and the amount calculated for every 4 hours of stay after that. 
    
	The cash benefit will be given for a maximum of 18 days hospitalisation in the first year and 60 days thereafter. 
    
	The plan also offers benefits for three major surgeries during the entire term of the policy. Each surgical benefit is 200 times the daily hospital cash benefit initially opted for. 
    
	Therefore, if one initially opts for a hospital cash benefit of Rs 1,000 per day, the entitlement on account of surgical benefits is Rs 6 lakh until the age of 65. 
    
	The policy will not be renewable after that.
    
	Health Plus can be bought for a personal cover as well as a family floater plan, in which case ones spouse and children above three months can be included. However, once the child becomes 25, the cover will be withdrawn. The surgical benefit will not accrue until the child becomes 18. 
    
	However, except for the first six months, the child will get the hospital cash benefit from the commencement of the policy. The premium of the policy is calculated on the basis of the hospital cash benefit chosen. The premium will be six times the hospital cash benefit for the principal insured and three times each for the spouse and children. 
    
	The premium will remain constant throughout the entire term and will not increase with the renewal of the policy every year.
    
	Moreover, the insurer will give a grace period of 30 days to renew the policy. After paying the premium regularly for three years, one can skip paying it. In that case, the premium will be deducted from the accumulated fund value. 
    
	The plan also gives benefits for domiciliary treatment, but this will be available after three years from the initiation of the policy.

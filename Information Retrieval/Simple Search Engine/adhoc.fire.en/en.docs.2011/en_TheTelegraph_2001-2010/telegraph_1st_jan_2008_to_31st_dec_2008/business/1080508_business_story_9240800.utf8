          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today proposed that subscribers of one operator should be able to select another operator to make STD and ISD calls by using calling cards.         
	Telecom service providers have welcomed the idea provided issues such as the estimation and the recovery of the cost for upgradation, interconnection and billing are clarified.        
	Calling cards could be introduced by long distance operators that can be used by an Airtel subscriber to make STD or ISD calls using a Vodafone card, Trai chairman Nripendra Misra said. At present, a customer has to make long distance calls through the subscribed operator and pay the prescribed tariff. Moreover, a calling card of one operator cannot be used to make long distance calls from the telephone connection of another operator.        
	Carrier selection through use of calling cards will help consumers select the service provider best suited to their needs, particularly in terms of price and quality, Trai stated in its consultation paper on carrier selection issued today.        
	Misra said other possibilities include a call-by-call carrier selection or a carrier pre-selection method that customers can utilise to select a particular mobile operator for making STD calls. The calling cards can also be used to make long distance calls even from an STD-barred phone, Misra added. Carrier selection will bring in competition, spur investment and innovation, improve operational efficiencies and lower cost, said Misra.        
	This is the second time Trai has initiated a process to allow subscribers to choose service providers.         
	Last time, the regulator had consulted the industry in December 2001 but its proposal could not be implemented as state-owned BSNL was not ready to offer the facility. The main reasons for the non-implementation seemed to be the cost involved and the non-availability of proper billing system with BSNL. To ensure a level-playing field, Trai had then deferred the implementation of carrier selection by all other service providers.

   Big relief on loans up to Rs 20 lakh           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 15: State-owned banks today slashed interest rates and margin requirements for borrowers looking for home loans up to Rs 20 lakh.        
	Under a new home loan package devised in consultation with the government, banks will offer an interest rate of 8.5 per cent on home loans up to Rs 5 lakh and 9.25 per cent on loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.        
	As a result, borrowers will have to pay lower equated monthly instalments (EMIs). Take an illustration: the State Bank of India currently disburses a 15-year loan at 10 per cent. At this rate, a borrower of a Rs 20-lakh loan has to pay an EMI of Rs 21,492. This will now come down to Rs 20,583.        
	The interest rates will be frozen for a period of five years, but borrowers will get the benefit of rate cuts during that period. If the rates go up, borrowers will not be asked to shoulder the burden. The scheme will run till June 30 next year.        
	At present, interest rates on home loans across various public sector banks vary between 9.75 and 10.5 per cent.        
	The banks have also trimmed the margin requirement for borrowers  the sum they must stump up first to become eligible for the loans. The margin requirement has been scaled down to 10 per cent for borrowers of home loans up to Rs 5 lakh. Thus if a borrower is looking to buy a property worth Rs 5 lakh, he will have to put up only Rs 50,000 and the rest can be financed from the bank.        
	In the case of loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh, the margin requirement has been capped at 15 per cent. At present, the margin requirement on home loans hovers between 20 and 25 per cent.        
	Home loans up to Rs 20 lakh constitute nearly 80 per cent of PSU banks total housing loan book. It is expected that the incremental home loan disbursements of these banks will go up by Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.        
	However, benefits of the scheme will not apply to existing home loan borrowers who will have to wait for banks to bring down their prime lending rates (PLRs). This will hinge on further rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Announcing the package, SBI chairman . P. Bhatt said the scheme had been drawn up with a focus on smaller value housing.         
	He said the most attractive feature was the freeze on interest rates. Borrowers can therefore take comfort from the fact that the EMI will not go up for five years but it can go down if benchmark interest rates dip.        
	A borrower also has been given the flexibility of opting for a fixed or floating scheme after the period of five years.        
	Borrowers will also have access to a free life insurance cover. While the cost of the insurance cover will be borne by banks, IBA chairman T.S. Narayanasami said if the borrower died during the tenure of the loan, the insurance company would settle the loan and the title deed of the property would pass on to the borrowers heirs. It is therefore great for borrowers and their families, he said.        
	Narayanasami said the package had been designed to take care of the housing requirements of the common man.         
	It is difficult for the common man to think of a house if the cost is beyond Rs 20 lakh, because then he will be bound by the EMIs that he has to pay, the IBA chief said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Team to monitor Nano cost
                                                                                                               Team to monitor Nano cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CLOSE WATCH                                  
	Mumbai, March 24: Tata Motors has formed a team which will ensure that the price of its small car Nano does not rise in tandem with input costs.        
	We have formed a team. The input costs have gone up, Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant said. The team is based in Pune. Nanos ex-factory price is Rs 1 lakh, making it the worlds cheapest car.         
	When the Nano was unveiled on January 10 this year, Tata group chairman Ratan Tata had said that it would have a dealer price of Rs 1 lakh as promised around five years ago. The car will be launched later this year.        
	While some critics were sceptical about the car meeting safety and emission norms, a few analysts were also worried that the price of the vehicle would not stay within the Rs 1-lakh price point due to rising input costs.         
	Prices of steel, one of the key raw materials, have increased by around Rs 5,000 per tonne over the past few months.        
	The Nano will be manufactured at the companys upcoming facility in Singur and the first car from the plant is expected to roll out in October. Bookings for Nano are expected to start in three months. In the first phase, Tata Motors will make 2.5 lakh Nanos, while in the second phase, the capacity at Singur will be ramped up by a lakh.        
	Ravi Kant ruled out the possibility of the small car being made at the companys Ranjangaon factory in Pune.         
	Fiat India plan        
	At Pune, the Tatas and Fiat have a 50:50 joint venture manufacturing plant.         
	Today both players announced that they were ramping up capacity at the plant.         
	Fiat India, the joint venture, will invest Rs 2,341 crore in the plant. This will take the companys overall investment in Pune to Rs 4,020 crore. It had already invested Rs 1,679 crore.        
	Fiat makes the Palio hatchback and has plans to start producing the Linea sedan and the Grande Punto at the Ranjangaon facility.         
	The company today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Maharashtra government for the investment.         
	Tata Motors and Fiat will invest Rs 650 crore each and the remaining amount will come from debt, Fiat India CEO Rajeev Kapoor said.        
	Fiat India plans to ramp up its capacity to two lakh cars, three lakh engines and three lakh parts and accessories a year, the company said.        
	Fiat now has the capacity to manufacture 1 lakh cars and 2 lakh engines.

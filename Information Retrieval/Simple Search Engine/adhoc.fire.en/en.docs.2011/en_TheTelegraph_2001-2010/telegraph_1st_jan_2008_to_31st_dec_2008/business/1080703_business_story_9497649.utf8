The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Balco flotation on cabinet agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Balco flotation on cabinet agenda

	New Delhi, July 2: The cabinet will take a decision tomorrow on whether the share market is conducive enough for the government to float an initial public offering for Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (Balco).        
	If the cabinet gives a go-ahead to the Balco flotation, this will be the first public sector divestment this year.        
	The government wants to come out with the Balco flotation  where it intends to offload a 10 per cent stake  in order to discover the right price at which it can sell its residual holding in the aluminium maker.        
	At present, Sterlite Industries owns a controlling 51 per cent equity in the highly profitable company and wants to buy the rump 49 per cent stake from the government.        
	Top finance ministry officials said a committee of secretaries, which has been negotiating with Sterlite on the rump share sale, had recommended to the cabinet that price discovery be done by listing Balco through an IPO.        
	However, the problem is that the stock market is currently experiencing a meltdown and this may not be the right time to come out with the flotation, officials said.         
	At tomorrows meeting, officials expect the cabinet to allow the government to go ahead with the formalities of the IPO without actually specifying the timing of the public issue. The exact launch date will depend on the health of the stock market.         
	Though the stock market is currently looking very anaemic, analysts expect it to regain its strength by October.         
	During the previous BJP-led NDA regime, the government had sold the controlling stake in Balco to Sterlite.         
	Under the shareholders agreement that was signed during the stake sale, Sterlite had the option to call for the remaining shares after a certain period of time.        
	Two years back, Sterlite exercised that option and, on its own volition, offered a cheque of Rs 1,098 crore to the government for the 49 per cent stake of Balco.         
	But the central government refused the cheque, partly because it felt the offer price was too low and partly because attorney-general Milon Banerjee had ruled that the government was not bound to sell the residual stake to Sterlite under Indian law.         
	According to the attorney-general, the government had three options on the Balco residual stake: it can negotiate with Sterlite or any other third party based on market rate, go in for a public issue or not sell at all.        
	In a renewed bid to buy the rump stake, Sterlite revised its offer and agreed to pay Rs 78 per Balco share to the government plus interest at the rate of 14 per cent per annum on this price from March 31, 2004. But the government had rejected this offer, too.         
	The government had even tried to convince Sterlite to come out with a public offer for Balco to discover the price before selling its own stake. But Sterlite did not agree.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Racing ahead      
	New Delhi, May 14: France today said it was keen to participate in New Delhis ambitious venture to launch a slew of high-speed trains connecting major metropolises.        
	It is for India to take a call  we have the technology. We can build the train here or just import it and make it run, Dominique Bussereau, minister of state for transport of France, said.        
	He said Paris was helping several countries build or install such high-speed trains. French companies are building the trains in Argentina, Morocco and China, he said.        
	I see it (high-speed train) coming to the Indian sub-continent soon, he said.        
	Bussereau said such trains had to run on dedicated tracks. Modernisation of existing tracks for such high-speed trains would not be compatible, he added.        
	The Indian Railways has an ambitious plan of network expansion. We want to increase rolling stock capacity and provide world-class passenger terminals. The country requires high-speed passenger services in the future, minister of state for railways Naranbhai Rathwa said.        
	Bussereau said France was interested in forging ties with Indian Railways in specific areas such as freight corridor, safety telecommunications, rolling stocks, locomotives and rakes and high-speed train.        
	The railways have already invited global tenders for conducting a pre-feasibility study of a high-speed train on the Delhi-Chandigarh-Amritsar route. The project aims at cutting travel time among the cities by nearly half.         
	Japan and France are world leaders in high-speed train technology. While the Japanese are known for their Bullet trains, the French have the TGVs.        
	Besides the Delhi-Amritsar route, the Railways plan to conduct pre-feasibility studies for three more high-speed passenger routes  Mumbai-Baroda-Ahmedabad, Chennai-Bangalore-Coimbatore and Howrah-Asansol-Patna.        
	Since the corridor is expected to cost over Rs 600 crore per km, officials said state governments would also be asked to share the cost.

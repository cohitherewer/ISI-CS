The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Philips to set up R amp;D centre
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Philips to set up R amp;D centre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 10: Philips will set up a global research and development (R amp;D) centre for lighting electronics in India, its third such unit in the world.        
	The facility will come up in Gurgaon, catering not only to the specific needs of the Indian market but also the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America.        
	The other R amp;D centres are located at Eindhoven in the Netherlands and in Shanghai, China.        
	Lighting electronic is a key area for us. Given the talent pool in India and the opportunity the country will provide, we have decided to build the centre here, Herbert Willmy, CEO and executive vice-president of Philips (Lighting), said.        
	One of the primary research areas for the centre will be to develop products that take care of high voltage fluctuations in India. High levels of voltage fluctuation are frequent in India. This leads to a shorter life span of lamps. One of the efforts of the centre will be to develop products that can adapt to such voltage changes, said V. K. Gupta, director (lighting electronics) of Philips India.         
	The centre currently employs 35 engineers and the headcount will increase with the unit taking up more work.        
	The latest move reveals the importance of the lighting division to Philips India, in particular, and to its global parent as a whole.        
	Around 40 per cent of Philips revenue in India comes from the lighting business comprising lamps, luminaire, lighting electronics, automotive and special lighting.        
	Of the companys total workforce of 4,500 in India, 3,000 work in the lighting division of the company.         
	Globally, 28 per cent of Philips business comes from lighting.         
	Apart from lights, the company has consumer electronics and healthcare (medical instrument) businesses in India.        
	Willmy said the focus of the company was to develop energy efficient products for all categories and for all markets.        
	We think energy prices will go up. So, there is an urgent need of products that save energy, he said.        
	The current trend in lighting electronics is to move from analog technology to digital and then to software, with an aim to become energy efficient.        
	In India, the company is in the process of expanding the plant at Mohali to produce more compact fluorescent lamps.        
	In India, Philips occupies 30 per cent of the $1.2-billion lighting market.

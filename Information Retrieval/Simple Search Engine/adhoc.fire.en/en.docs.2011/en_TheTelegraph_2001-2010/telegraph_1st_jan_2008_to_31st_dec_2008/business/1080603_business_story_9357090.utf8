	Mumbai, June 2: Sujana Metal Products Ltd, of the Rs 3,000-crore Sujana group, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a sponge iron unit and a billet plant in Hyderabad.         
	The acquisition forms part of its strategy to expand its capacity to one million tonne over the next couple of years.        
	The company recently bought three steel making companies for Rs 180 crore. The acquired units  Saritha Steels, Glade Steels and Sree Ganga Steels  are located in Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Chennai, respectively.        
	Group chairman Y. S. Chowdhary said the company had also taken up a modernisation-cum-expansion programme of the acquired units, in addition to a similar exercise at its existing facilities. Sujana Metal has earmarked an investment of Rs 800 crore for the purpose.        
	On further acquisitions, group director V. S. R. Murthy said it would be done in the next two months. The sponge iron plant has a capacity of 67,000 tonnes which Sujana Metal wants to increase to over 1.20 lakh tonnes. The unit will help the firm have its own iron ore mine in the country.

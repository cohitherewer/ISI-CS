The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pension pangs haunt buyout barons
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pension pangs haunt buyout barons
          PIYA SINGH              CASH SQUEEZE              What is pension deficit?
  Pension fund deficit occurs when value of  asset is lower than payouts        Why the hullabaloo about it?
  Funds having equity exposure are groaning  under heavy deficit because of mayhem in  world stock markets      How does it affect India Inc?
  Indian firms have made some foreign buys.  Pension funds of some target companies  comprise defined benefit schemes, meaning  certain pension payment is guaranteed      Who are feeling the heat?
  Tata Motors (acquired Jaguar Land Rover  for $2.3 billion) and Hindalco (bought  Novelis for $6.4 billion) face potential deficit                          
	Mumbai, Nov. 9: Indias buyout barons were chuffed with their big-ticket overseas acquisitions over the past 18 months. But they now face the prospect of having to shovel truckloads of cash to fill the gaping deficits in the employee pension funds.        
	Blame it all on the global market meltdown.        
	The pension funds had invested in equities that have been badly roiled in the current crisis. Result: the value of the assets owned by these pension funds has shrunk over the past few months. The deficits occur when the value of the assets is lower than the payout that these funds have to make to meet their liabilities.        
	There is one caveat here: the deficits will only hurt those Indian companies that acquired overseas entities which offered their employees defined benefit plans or guaranteed a certain level of pension payment regardless of the returns on investment.        
	Under the terms of the buyout agreements, the acquirers will have to paper over the deficits in the employee pension funds that carry such guarantees.        
	Tata Motors, which bought Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in June for $2.3 billion, is one of the companies that may have to wrestle with the problem of a pension deficit sometime next year.        
	A report put out by foreign brokerage CLSA on November 3 says that one of the factors that can weigh on the Tata Motors stock will be the potential deficit in JLRs pension fund.        
	The report doesnt quantify the amount that Tata Motors will have to stump up. This will be known only when the actuaries carry out their valuation next April. If the dog days for the global markets drag on because of the mounting fears of a recession, this can throw up another funding problem for the Tatas.        
	Tata Motors is already struggling to come up with the cash to pay off the huge debts it took to pay for Jaguar Land Rover. Recently, the companys rights issue met with a very poor response, forcing the company and the underwriters to cough up the money.        
	The Indian companies are aware of the looming danger.        
	In the letter of offer for its rights issue that devolved recently, Hindalco said Novelis  the US-based aluminium maker that it bought for $6.4 billion in February 2007  might have to make unexpected contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets.        
	If the assets of Novelis pension plans do not achieve assumed investment returns for any period, such deficiency could result in one or more charges against its earning for that period, the document said.         
	Companies suffering from mark-to-market losses will be doubly hit as pension plans that are guaranteed suffer deficits because of the market meltdown. The consolidated earnings per share (EPS) of Indian companies that have made large buyouts will go down further, said Girish Vanvari, head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG.        
	Tata Steel might be better placed with its pension fund at Corus, the UK-based steel maker it acquired in January 2007 for $12.3 billion.        
	Earlier this year, several brokerages had pointed out that Corus surplus pension fund with an asset base of Rs 1,200 billion witnessed a decline of Rs 53 billion for the first quarter of this financial year. The management subsequently clarified that they would not have to make additional cash contributions as the pension fund still had a surplus.        
	It is difficult to assess the extent of potential deficits in the pension funds as actuaries calculate the mismatch of the asset and liabilities on a pre-determined date.         
	In the case of the JLR pension fund, the actuarial valuation is scheduled for April 2009. CLSA says this process takes around six months. The extent of the potential deficit, if any, and the details of the plan to finance it will be known only by the end of 2009.        
	It is not possible for any one to estimate at this point of time what the value (of the pension fund) will be at a future date, said a Tata Motors spokesperson when asked about the potential JLR pension fund deficit.        
	Deficits in pension funds are soaring in the United Kingdom and the United States. According to estimates put out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in September, pension deficits in the UK have more than tripled to 20 billion since the start of 2008.        
	UK pension schemes are facing the triple pressure of declining equity values, lower income from dividends and increasingly cash-strapped employers, the report said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Wobbly base                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 17: The rating knife continues to fall on realty companies.         
	ICRA today cut its rating for DLF by a notch to A1 from A1+ because of the slowdown in the domestic real estate market.        
	However, the revised rating for an enhanced amount of Rs 3,000 crore (Rs 2,000 crore) still denotes highest credit quality on the short-term scale.        
	Instruments rated in this category carry the lowest credit risk in the short term. Within this category, certain instruments are assigned a rating of A1+ to reflect their relatively stronger credit quality.        
	ICRA said the rating revision reflected the adverse impact on the liquidity profile of real estate companies because of the current slowdown in the domestic real estate market, prompted largely by a slowing economy, elevated property prices and high interest rates.        
	Along with the difficulty that all corporate houses in general and real estate players in particular are facing in raising funds either through loans or equity, this has significantly increased funding risks for such companies, the rating agency said.        
	ICRA observed that the rating action also took into account higher than anticipated debt levels, build-up of receivables, significant repayment obligations in the short term and the deferment of planned Real Estate Investment Trust listing in DLF Assets Ltd.        
	The rating agency also felt that the aversion of banks to lend to real estate companies and the higher perceived risk now being attached to this sector had increased refinancing risks for companies such as DLF.        
	It added that the rating continued to draw comfort from DLFs leading market position and its diversified presence across all segments in the domestic real estate sector, its track record of successful project management and execution, its low-cost geographically diversified landholdings, and the diversity of its product offerings.        
	DLF is not alone in facing a rating downgrade. Recently, Fitch Ratings downgraded Unitech Ltds national long-term issuer rating to A- from A+ and revised its outlook to negative from stable.        
	Fitch had said the downgrade primarily reflected the rapidly deteriorating real estate sector and the likely negative impact it could have on Unitechs ability to service debt.

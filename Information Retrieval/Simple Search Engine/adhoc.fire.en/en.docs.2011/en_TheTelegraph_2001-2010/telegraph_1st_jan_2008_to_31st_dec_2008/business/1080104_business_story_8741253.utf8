     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: The State Bank of India today increased interest rates on domestic fixed deposits by 25 to 175 basis points (100 basis points is equal to one percentage point). The hike will take effect from Friday. 
    
	The countrys largest commercial bank had slashed its term deposit rates by 25 basis points less than a month ago. 
    
	Following the latest rate revision, new fixed deposits with maturity between 91 days and 180 days will carry an interest rate of 7 per cent against 5.25 per cent earlier. However, the bank has not changed the interest rates on fixed deposits with lower maturity. 
    
	The SBI had regrouped different maturity slabs when it revised interest rates on fixed deposits effective from December 17 last year. It had created three maturity slabs  15 days to 45 days earning an interest rate of 4.75 per cent, 46 days to 270 days with a 5.25 per cent interest rate and 271 days to less than one year earning 6.50 per cent.
    
	The bank has again reclassified the slabs into four  15 days to 45 days (4.75 per cent), 46 days to 90 days (5.25 per cent), 91 days to 180 days (7 per cent) and 181 days to less than one year (7.50 per cent).
    
	Beyond one year, the bank has also regrouped the maturity slabs. Now there will be only two slabs  one year to less than two years and two years to 10 years. 
    
	While the interest rate for deposits of one year to less than 2 years has been increased to 8.75 per cent from 8.50 per cent, the rate for deposits above two years and up to 10 years has been kept unchanged at 8.50 per cent. 
    
	Senior citizens will get 0.50 percentage point higher interest.
    
	State Banks rate hike comes at a time when every bank is feeling pressure on profit margins in the face of sluggish growth in credit offtake and high cost of deposit mobilisation.

	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The department of telecom has asked the department of space and telecom operators to vacate around 40MHz of spectrum in the 2.5GHz frequency band for use in wireless broadband services or WiMax.
    
	Mobile service providers, who use the 2.5 GHz band for back-end operations, will have to shift to the 2.7-2.9 GHz band. 
    
	Operations of the department of space (DoS) will have to move to the 3.3-3.4GHz band. The DoT has already provided the substitute spectrum bands to both the telecom operators and the DoS.
    
	They have a deadline of February 28, fixed by the wireless planning and coordination wing of the DoT, for relocating to the new bands.
    
	However, the DoS fears the move will hit its satellite-based mobile and broadcast applications, such as for disaster warning, which use the 2.5GHz band. Besides, all the satellite services of the country run on the 2.5-2.69GHz band.
    
	In its note to the group of ministers set up for the vacation of spectrum, the DoT said multi-media satellite services could be provided more effectively through WiMax.
    
	Officials of the DoT said, The use of satellites for mobile and broadcasting service is limited, and spectrum released by moving these services to a different frequency could be gainfully used for wireless broadband. 
    
	The telecom operators do not have any objections to vacating the spectrum. However, they are seeking more time for the shift.
    
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has emphasised on wireless broadband to increase broadband penetration in the country.
    
	Wireless broadband will enable telecom service providers to deploy high-speed Internet connections faster and at much lower costs compared with fixed line connections.
    
	Technologies such as WiMax or wirelesss broadband will increase the speed of surfing the Internet apart from bringing in new applications like online education, said DoT officials. 
    
	So far, broadband growth in the country has been very sluggish. At the end of June 2007, there were 2.42 million broadband subscribers, well short of the target of 9 million for the year.
    
	Last year, the WiMAX Forum, a global body, had cautioned that India could miss the wireless broadband revolution, unless the country allocated spectrum in the 2.5GHz band for broadband activities.
    
	In November 2007, the government announced that spectrum for providing broadband wireless access services would be released in the 2.5GHz band and there would be an auction for allocating spectrum in this band. 
    
	Annual charge
    
	The government has deferred a decision on increasing annual spectrum charges as a percentage of the gross revenue of a mobile operator.
    
	A committee on spectrum pricing had recommended a flat rate of an 8 per cent annual charge for up to 5MHz of spectrum held by service providers and subsequently 1 per cent for every additional mega watt of frequency.
    
	The Telecom Commission met here today to discuss the committees report, official sources said, but decision had been taken on the issue. The commission is meeting again on January 22 to discuss the issue.

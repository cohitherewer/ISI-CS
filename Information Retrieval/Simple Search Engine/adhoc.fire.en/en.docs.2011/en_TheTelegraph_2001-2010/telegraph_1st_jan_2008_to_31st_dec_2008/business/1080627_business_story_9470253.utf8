	Calcutta, June 26: Basant Kumar Birla, the grand old man of Indian industry, has reiterated his plan to pass on the jewel in his crown to grandson Kumar Mangalam, but with a difference.        
	He has proposed that Kesoram Industries Ltd  the flagship of his empire  will go Kumars way, though daughter Manjushree Khaitan will have a role.        
	It would be Kumar. But Manjushree would be there too. They will jointly manage the company, BK Babu, as he is affectionately called in corporate circles, said in Calcutta today.        
	Meeting the media after the 89th annual general meeting of the company, Birla suggested that Kumar could be the next chairman and Manjushree, vice-chairman. Birla, 87, ruled out any division of Kesoram between Kumar and Khaitan. They would look after different businesses within the company, he said. Cement and tyre make up almost the entire topline of Kesoram, with rayon and spun pipe contributing a paltry sum.        
	Who will look after what would be left to them. They have to manage together, said Birla, whose son, and Kumars father, Aditya Vikram had died 13 years ago from a tragic illness.         
	Khaitan is already a director on the board of Kesoram. She was tipped to take over the reigns of the Calcutta-headquartered company in the past but Birla later changed his mind.        
	Asked if Kumar Mangalam, who heads the vast AV Birla group from Mumbai, would join the Kesoram board soon, Birla said no.        
	He said if he joined, he would have to come to Calcutta to attend board meetings every three months. He is so busy and cant make it. Kumar says that I should run the company for the next 10 years, Birla clarified.        
	The development comes at a time when the company has undertaken major expansion. S.K. Parik, director of Kesoram, said the company was investing Rs 1,900 crore in the tyre and cement divisions to upgrade capacity.

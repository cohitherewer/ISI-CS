	 Mumbai, March 16: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will submit its recommendations on mobile number portability to the government by the first week of April. The government will then start the tendering process to issue licences to set up a central clearing agency, Trai member R.N. Prabhakar said. The central clearing agency would create a central data base for ported numbers and facilitate the process of porting. Number portability enables a subscriber to port a mobile number to another service provider in the same area.

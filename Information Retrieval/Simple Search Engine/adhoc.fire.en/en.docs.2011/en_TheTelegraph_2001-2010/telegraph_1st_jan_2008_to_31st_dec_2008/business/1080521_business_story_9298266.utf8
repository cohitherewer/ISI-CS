	Mumbai, May 20: Future Generali will enter the health insurance business by the next month.         
	The company, a joint venture between Kishore Biyani-led Future Group and Italys Generali Insurance, will start with cashless health insurance products  covering fourteen critical ailments  with a family floater option.         
	The policies will be available at annualised premia starting at around Rs 1,000, with the sum assured varying in the range of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, depending on the age of the policyholder.         
	The company today launched mallassurance, an initiative to sell insurance policies at shopping malls.        
	We have already received regulatory approvals from the IRDA to launch health insurance policies, and expect to introduce our first pure health insurance product before June 30 this year. The first set of products will provide health cover up to the age of 55 years, with the premium renewable till the age of 75 years, a senior official of Future Generali India Life Insurance told The Telegraph.         
	Sources said the insurer might introduce health policies for senior citizens in the future.         
	Under a cashless health policy, the insurer bears the actual hospital expenses depending on the available claim benefits of the policy.

          ARUNDHATI BAKSHI-DIGHE                                    
	Mumbai, June 6: Small companies are having to offer high interest rates on inter-corporate deposits (ICD) as liquidity crunch and a poor ride on the stock markets send them scurrying to raise money from alternative sources.        
	Analysts say that in sectors such as realty, the rates have shot up to 17 to 18 per cent from 8 to 9 per cent a short while ago.        
	ICDs are basically unsecured loans extended by one corporate to another. This mostly happens when there is a certain amount of tightness in the liquidity situation in the market. Right now, the realty market is going through a bad situation, the ICD rates are up 1.5 to 2 per cent to almost 12 per cent, said Mukesh Patel, head of Mumbai-based Neelkanth Group.         
	The real estate sector has been going through very lean times recently. From the first trading day of this year till date, the Bombay Stock Exchange realty index has dipped 52.33 per cent to end at 6210.30 today.         
	According to analysts, there has been an overall decline of 30 to 50 per cent in sales in the realty sector since January. Sales in the sector are expected to further decline with most banks hinting at tighter lending norms and higher deposits.        
	Every year, around June 15, which is the last date for the payment of advance tax by companies, there is tightness in the market. As liquidity tightens, interest rates go up. Therefore, its not surprising that the ICD rates are heading north, said Arun Kaul, CFO at Punjab National Bank.        
	After the Reserve Bank tightened the lending norms for the realty sector, many developers have been facing a severe liquidity crunch.         
	While the big players have gone ahead and raised money through global flotations, the pipeline has dried up for the small players.        
	Small companies have had to pay interest rates close to 18 to 20 per cent, says Sourav Chandra, deputy manager of Birla Global Finance Corporation Ltd.        
	Overall, we have seen the G-Sec rates going up to a 10-year high. The short-term rates have also seen a record high. The market is expecting another rate hike; there is already a liquidity crunch. So, it isnt surprising that the ICD rates have also risen, he said.        
	ICDs are not rated transactions, they are mostly unsecured loans, so it is very difficult to get an overall perspective, said Vibha Batra of ICRA.

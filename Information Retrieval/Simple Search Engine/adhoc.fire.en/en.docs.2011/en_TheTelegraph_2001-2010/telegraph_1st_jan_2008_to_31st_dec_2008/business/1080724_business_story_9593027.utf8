          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Dinesh Keskar in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, July 23: US aircraft maker Boeing has raised its forecast for aircraft sales in the country, providing some comfort to the beleaguered domestic aviation industry, which has been savaged by high jet fuel prices.        
	Boeing has projected that India would need 1,001 new commercial airplanes worth more than $105 billion over 2008-2027.         
	This marks an increase of nearly 10 per cent from its forecast last year of 911 aircraft at $86 billion over 2007-2026.         
	Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president, sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said strong economic growth would result in an increase in air travel in India.         
	The companys forecast takes into account the industrys near-term challenges, including a slowing world economy, rising fuel prices, slow traffic growth and moves by airlines to balance costs and revenues.         
	We have developed the forecast in a manner that considers todays market environment but more importantly, takes a long-term view of this dynamic industry and the fundamentals that drive commercial aviation. These drivers include economic growth, world trade, aviation market liberalisation and new aircraft capabilities, he said.         
	Boeing, which has 103 aircraft for delivery to Indian firms till 2014, has not seen any cancellations or deferrals from its customers.        
	According to the company, the 2008 forecast for India includes 728 single-aisle, 203 twin-aisle and 11 747-larger airplanes. With the induction of new aircraft, the airplane fleet of Indian firms is expected to almost quadruple to 1,204 over the next 20 years.         
	Keskar, however, said that critical infrastructure improvements are needed to sustain growth. He said airlines could trim costs and this could help them in navigating through difficult times.         
	Losses in the domestic airline industry are estimated to double to $2 billion this year from around $1 billion last fiscal. This can be attributed to the jump in domestic jet fuel prices which have gone up from $3.54 per gallon in 2007 to over $6.15 per gallon in July this year. Keskar said that overcapacity was also one of the major reasons for the losses suffered by the industry.

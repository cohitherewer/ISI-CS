          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Roy: Strategy shift                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: SBI Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between the State Bank of India and Frances BNP Paribas Assurance, is reworking its capital infusion plan for 2009-10.         
	The change in strategy comes in the wake of the insurance regulators decision to reduce solvency margins for traditional products by a percentage point.        
	Solvency margin is the percentage of capital an insurer has to set aside to underwrite policies. The new solvency norm will be effective from January.         
	The revised solvency margin norm will certainly save our cost of capital. Now, well not need to pump in as much capital as we are earlier planning to support growth next year, said U.S. Roy, managing director and chief executive of SBI Life.         
	Earlier, the life insurer had said its promoters would need to pump in Rs 500-600 crore to support 100 per cent growth in new businesses.         
	At present, the company has a paid-up capital of Rs 1,000 crore.         
	As of now, we have a solvency ratio of 2.2 per cent against the regulatory requirement of 1.5 per cent. This means were well capitalised till March 2009. The revised norm will also free some capital. But we have not yet worked out how much more capital we need to pump in next year, Roy said.        
	The insurance arm of the State Bank has reported an impressive all-round performance till November.         
	New business annualised premium equivalent, a measure of new business sales, jumped 144 per cent to Rs 2,832.21 crore till the end of November compared with Rs 1,160.35 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	In the first six months of the current financial year, premium income from new businesses went up 78 per cent to Rs 3,291.99 crore over the same period a year ago.         
	Total premium (including renewal premium) income during the same period grew 86 per cent to Rs 4,051.44 crore from Rs 2,173.02 crore last year.         
	Assets under management of the companys unit-linked insurance plans have grown 93 per cent to Rs 13,214 crore.        
	SBI Life is also planning to get listed next year. We are preparing for the listing of the company. The company is expected to go public during the second half of 2009, Roy said. A public float will depend on market conditions and other considerations, including regulatory clearances.        
	The SBI has a 76 per cent stake in the life insurance firm, with BNP Paribas entity holding the rest.

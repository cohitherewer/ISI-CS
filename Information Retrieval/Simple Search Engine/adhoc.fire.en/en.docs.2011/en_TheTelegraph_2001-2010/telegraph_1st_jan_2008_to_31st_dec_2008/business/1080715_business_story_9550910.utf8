          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 14: IFCI is planning to start afresh the process of inducting a strategic investor later this year.        
	We believe that a strategic investor should be able to give crucial direction to the company and should also be able to bring in a managerial competence and depth to the company, said Atul Kumar Rai, CEO and managing director of IFCI.        
	However, he said, It would not be possible to revive the earlier process as the proposition, companys capital needs and the investment environment have changed. Rai said a complete clarity regarding IFCIs capital structure was a precondition for the strategic investors to take an interest.        
	Analysts feel the lack of clarity over the governments debenture holding and the Life Insurance Corporations (LIC) stake in the financial institution may dampen the interest of potential investors.         
	The government owns convertible debentures of Rs 923 crore that can be converted into equity shares at a later date. However, there is no clarity on whether the Centre is planning to change its optional convertible debentures into equity, adding to the uncertainty factor for many bidders.         
	In the LIC, sources said the insurer might reconvert part of its equity stake into optionally convertible debentures to reduce its stake in the financial institution to 8.39 per cent from 11.35 per cent.         
	Last year, when IFCI was trying to induct a strategic investor, IFCI had converted the LICs debentures into equity shares to enable the insurance company retain its stake at 8.39 per cent after the share allotment to the strategic investor.         
	However, no investor was inducted as the talks with the Sterlite-led consortium had collapsed. Without the induction of an investor, the LICs stake had increased to 11.35 per cent. The LIC has now requested the IFCI management to reduce its stake to 8.39 per cent.         
	IFCI will reduce its paid-up capital by about 3 per cent to accommodate LICs request and convert the shares underlying the paid-up capital into debt instruments, sources said.         
	IFCI, which was running at a loss until 2005-06, began considering a stake sale in 2006 when its capital base got eroded by 40 per cent.        
	But with a current capital adequacy ratio of 19 per cent, raising capital is no longer imperative, Rai said.

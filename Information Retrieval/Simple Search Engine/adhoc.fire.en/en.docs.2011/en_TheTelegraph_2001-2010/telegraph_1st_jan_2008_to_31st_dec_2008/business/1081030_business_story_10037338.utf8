	Mumbai, Oct. 29: Profit booking kept a tight leash on share surge today, and investors turned cautious preferring to take cues from the US Federal Reserve.        
	After a rousing start to Samvat 2065 on Tuesday, shares were very volatile today, with investors indulging in alternative bouts of buying and selling.        
	The sensex gained just 36.43 points, or 0.40 per cent. The benchmark index opened higher by 290 points at 9297.76 but then came under selling pressure.         
	It touched an intra-day low of 8894.34, a drop of 113 points over the previous close. However, buying from domestic institutional investors saw the index ending at 9044.51.         
	The 50-issue benchmark Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also rose marginally by 12.45 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 2,697.05 from its last close.         
	Observers said Indian stocks were mirroring the trend in the Asian markets.        
	The rupee today gained for the second successive trading session. The Indian currency rose 21 paise to close at 49.68 against the dollar because of dollar selling by some banks amidst lack of any major buying by oil refiners.

	Calcutta, Jan. 16: JSW Steel and Tata Steel today announced acquisitions of overseas raw material assets.
    
	Sajjan Jindal-owned JSW Steel has obtained a mining lease for iron ore in Chile, while Tata Steel has acquired a stake in an Oman company having limestone deposits. 
    
	JSW Steel has acquired eight mining concessions in a greenfield area spanning over 1,200 hectares in the region of Atacama in the north of Chile. 
    
	The area is said to possess magnetite iron ore deposits. The company took over these concessions for a total consideration of $52 million.
    
	The deal was done through its Netherlands-based wholly owned subsidiary. 
    
	Sajjan Jindal, vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel, said: These mines are expected to have good quality magnetite iron ore deposits located near the Pacific Coast, facilitating the shipment of ore at competitive cost. 
    
	They will act as a natural hedge against high-cost iron ore procured from third parties in India once these mines are operational, he said. 
    
	Jindal said he was in negotiations for a joint venture to develop various iron ore mining projects in South America. 
    
	Tata Steels acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in Al Rimal Mining, a member of Omans Al Bahja Group, was another step in securing a crucial raw material asset.
    
	The company, Corus included, requires about 25 million tonnes of limestone every year. But it does not have any operating mines at present.
    
	We value our partnership with Al Bahja Group, and we are sure that this partnership will play a significant role in the mineral development of the Sultanate of Oman, B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, said.
    
	Al Rimal Mining will execute the development and the operation of the Uyun mine. The initial phase will involve exploration and detailed feasibility studies. 
    
	The plan is to mine limestone in the Uyun region, which lies in the Salalah province of Oman and has large deposits of limestone.

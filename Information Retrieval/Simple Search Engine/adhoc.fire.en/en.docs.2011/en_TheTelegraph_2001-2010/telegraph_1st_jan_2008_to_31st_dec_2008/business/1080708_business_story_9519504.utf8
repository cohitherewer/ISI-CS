	Calcutta, July 7: Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister of state for commerce and power, wants the supply chain of tea distribution to be revamped as it has too many segmented players.         
	The e-auctioning of tea, set to start by November, is expected to reduce the transaction cost and improve the efficiency of the supply chain.        
	We have to think of a system which incorporates all these elements while bringing about maximum efficiency. We have to be competitive in the global market and processes such as e-auction will help eliminate a lot of these inefficiencies, the minister said.         
	Ramesh was speaking at the 115th annual general meeting of the Calcutta Tea Traders Association (CTTA).        
	The Tea Board has appointed AF Ferguson to develop a business model for running the e-auction system. The Tea Board will fund the process in the first three years.

	The Tea Board is looking for land in Howrah to set up a warehousing facility for storing and packaging.        
	We are in talks with the Howrah district magistrate and have asked him to locate a suitable plot. The land requirement will be around 50 acres, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.        
	The board is also developing a tea park in Siliguri on land offered by the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority on a public-private-partnership model.

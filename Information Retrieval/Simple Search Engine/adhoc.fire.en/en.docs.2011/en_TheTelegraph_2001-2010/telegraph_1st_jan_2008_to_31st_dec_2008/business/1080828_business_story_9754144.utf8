	Mumbai, Aug. 27: Meghalaya plans to bring in private investments worth Rs 2,000 crore over the next three years to provide a boost to its economy, which is growing at around 5.6 per cent annually.         
	The northeastern state is looking at investments in areas such as tourism, infrastructure, horticulture, farm and mineral-based industries, information technology and IT-enabled services.         
	Meghalaya chief minister Donkupar Roy is currently on a visit to Mumbai to project the state as an attractive investment destination.         
	Roy will interact with various industrialists here tomorrow and highlight the business opportunities in the hill state.         
	Ranjan Chatterjee, chief secretary, government of Meghalaya, said the state aims to grow by around 9.9 per cent.        
	Chatterjee added that Meghalaya is emerging as an important educational hub in the Northeast with the Indian Institute of Management and the National Institute of Fashion coming up in the state.        
	The state government is looking for private sector participation to set up engineering and medical colleges and other technical institutions.         
	According to Chatterjee, various entities have shown interest in setting up facilities in the state.         
	While Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is keen on building a helicopter maintainance facility, a delegation from a Swedish toy company is also scouting for opportunities in the state.         
	Chatterjee said Meghalayas tourism sector had a huge potential for investment, adding that the hospitality segment suffered from a shortage of rooms. Against a requirement of 1,200 rooms, Shillong has only 600 rooms.         
	Roy today met Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh to discuss the possibilities of the two states working together towards the economic co-operation and development of tourism.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          In queue                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: Car makers are preparing a grand spread of new models to rekindle the waning interest of buyers in the wake of rising interest rates and inflation.        
	In July, car sales dropped for the first time in three years.         
	Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motors India, Fiat, Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M), Toyota and Honda are all planning to roll out new models and tweak existing ones.         
	Tata Motors will launch the peoples car, Nano, while Maruti Suzuki will roll out its indigenously developed small car, the A Star, within the next few months. The company will also bring the hatchback Splash by the end of this year.         
	Hyundai Motor plans to introduce the i20, with which the company will complete its product portfolio in compact-car segment, by year-end.        
	With i20, Hyundai will complete its portfolio in the compact car segment. The Santro, i10 and the i20 will cater to the lower, middle and upper-end segments, respectively, in the compact car market, said H.S. Lheem, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd.        
	The company recently launched the i10, powered by the 1.2 litre Kappa engine and priced between Rs 3.99 lakh and Rs 5.43 lakh. The i20 will also be powered by a similar engine and sold in domestic and global markets.        
	M amp;M is planning a start-stop version of its Scorpio diesel-electric hybrid by the end of the current year. We plan to launch the start-stop option of the Scorpio hybrid before the end of this year since it is fuel efficient without adding on too much cost, said Pawan Goenka, president, automotive sector, M amp;M.         
	In the start-stop process, the engine stops automatically when the vehicle is at a standstill. The vehicle starts automatically the moment drivers take their feet off the brakes. This technology leads to lower fuel consumption.        
	At present, the Honda Civic hybrid is the only fully hybrid version in the market. Priced at Rs 22 lakh, the car is imported as a completely built unit from Japan.        
	Italian auto major Fiat Spa is trying to stage a comeback with two of its bestsellers  the Linea, which is scheduled for a launch during the festive season, and the hatchback Grand Punto, which will be on road next year.         
	Recognising the market for luxury and sports cars, Fiat will bring such vehicles via the import route.

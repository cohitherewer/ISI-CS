          OUR CORRESPONDENT                         
	Mumbai, June 11: Retail investors will make a killing if they sell their shares to Daiichi at the open offer price of Rs 737, according to analysts.              
	Even three months back, the Ranbaxy scrip was trading at merely Rs 430, and the investors would get a premium of around 70 per cent.        
	Its a fantastic price to redeem the shares, considering the levels at which the Ranbaxy stock was trading three months ago.         
	In an uncertain environment, the chance of redemption at a premium of such a scale is always a good option for short- and medium-term investors, an analyst told The Telegraph.         
	Investors planning long term for a period of 3-5 years will also benefit from the price to earnings reratings that will happen post the deal, the analyst said. The investors will actually get the advantage of trading in an international stock in a way.         
	Buoyed by talks of a stake sale to Daiichi, the Ranbaxy stock closed positive at Rs 560.80 today on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).         
	Group firms gain        
	The entire pack of Ranbaxy promoted-companies and those where the drug-maker holds stake reaped windfall gains on their stocks today after the markets gathered news of a substantial investment from the Rs 10,000-crore chunk, which is to be received by Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo.         
	Shares of Ranbaxy-promoted Fortis Healthcare and Religare Enterprises leapt about 18.37 per cent and 8.53 per cent, respectively, on the BSE. Healthcare stocks are considered as defensive stocks in the equity market, and the prices of such stocks usually remain within a moderate range.         
	But, todays deal appears to have exhilarated the investors on hopes that the promoters of Ranbaxy would shell out sizeable funds during the coming months towards business expansion of the group companies.         
	Shares of Jupiter Biosciences, Krebs Bioscience, Orchid Chemicals and Zenotech Laboratories soared.         
	Stocks of Orchid Chemicals, where Ranbaxy Laboratories holds over a 14 per cent stake, rallied by nearly 14 per cent to Rs 260.82.        
	Earlier this year, Ranbaxy through its group firm Solrex Pharma, picked up the stake in Chennai-based Orchid.

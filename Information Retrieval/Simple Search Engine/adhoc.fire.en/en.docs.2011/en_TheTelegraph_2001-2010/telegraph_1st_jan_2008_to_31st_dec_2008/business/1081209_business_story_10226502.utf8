          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nair in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Market regulator Sebi will permit the trading of corporate bonds on exchanges within the next 2-3 months, to help firms raise funds at cheaper rates. It will also allow interest rate futures on the bourses from January.        
	Sebi will not only permit interest rate futures from January 2009 but also allow corporate bonds to be traded on exchanges in the next 3-4 months, T.C. Nair, wholetime member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, said.        
	We are looking at an exchange-traded corporate bond market because there is more transparency and clearing of settlements, he said.         
	Nair also said that there could be a fourth exchange for currency futures. There are some banks and financial institutions that have applied and we are considering their proposal, he said.         
	At present, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange and the Multi Commodity Exchange of India trade in currency futures.         
	The government has been trying to introduce trading in corporate bonds for three years.

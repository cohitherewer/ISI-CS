The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hike in rice export price hits Bangla

	New Delhi, March 10: Indias decision to increase the minimum export price of rice has put neighbours such as Bangladesh in a quandary.        
	Faced with rising prices of foodgrains at home, the Indian government has increased the minimum export price of rice to Rs 26 a kilogram for non-basmati rice and Rs 36 a kilogram for basmati rice.         
	Bangladesh imports low and medium grade rice from India to meet a severe shortfall in its own production.         
	According to Paresh Biswas, chief executive of JM Enterprise, a Calcutta-based rice exporter, Bangladesh will face a shortage because of this decision to restrict flow. I, alone, export 12,000 tonnes of rice to our neighbour in a season.        
	Private Indian traders account for a sizeable chunk of the over 3 million tonnes of rice which Bangladesh will import this year.         
	Indian traders also worry that this can hurt their long-run relationship with their Bangladeshi counterparts. It could impact trade in the long run. The governments decision is a bad one. Traders who have been hit by a fall in dollar prices will be affected even more, said Rohit Mathur, managing director, Jyotishree Overseas Private Limited, which also exports rice to Bangladesh.         
	The price of rice in India has shot up by a massive 30 per cent over the last one year, forcing the government to restrict exports.        
	With production stagnant at 91-92 million tonnes over the last three years, and demand rising, a shortage may well be in the offing in India.         
	For 2007-08, production is expected to be nearly a million tonne less than 2006-07.         
	India exported 3.2 million tonnes of non-basmati rice during the first eight months of the current fiscal against 2.1 million tonnes in the corresponding period of 2006-07 and 1.7 million tonnes in 2005-06.

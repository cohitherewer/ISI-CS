     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
             Chidambaram: Soft stand
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The government today said it might look at moderating the tax burden if compliance improved. 
    
	If voluntary compliance (in taxes) increases, there is a case for moderation. That does not mean the case has been accepted, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today. 
    
	Though Chidambaram did not exactly say that tax compliance had improved, he cited statistics which showed that in the first nine months of this fiscal, direct tax collections  after refunds  crossed Rs 2,05,000 crore, a growth of 42.36 per cent.
    
	Corporate tax collections grew 39.84 per cent to Rs 1,27,683 crore, while personal income tax  including security transaction tax, fringe benefit tax and banking cash transaction tax  grew 50.06 per cent to Rs 77,380 crore.
    
	For the first time, direct tax collections will surpass indirect tax collections, Chidambaram said. 
    
	With 59 days left for the budget, the question uppermost on the minds of tax-payers is whether rates will be lowered.
    
	Finance ministry officials said the government was already thinking of changing income tax slabs that would give considerable relief to tax-payers, if accepted by the government.
    
	However, changes in tax rates, if any, would be minor, they said.
    
	Parthasarathy Shome, who had recently resigned as adviser to the finance minister, had indicated earlier that voluntary compliance had indeed improved. 
    
	The growth rate in tax collection should have been two times the growth rate of the nominal value of the gross domestic product (GDP) but is actually three times the growth rate of GDP.
    
	According to the finance minister, the much awaited draft income tax code, which is expected to simplify and replace the existing law, is ready and will be released along with a discussion paper.

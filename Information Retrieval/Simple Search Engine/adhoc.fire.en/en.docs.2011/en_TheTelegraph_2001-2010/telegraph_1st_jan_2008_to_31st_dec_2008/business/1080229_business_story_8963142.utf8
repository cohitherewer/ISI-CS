          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: Finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram today held out a red rag for the Leftist allies of the UPA government by spelling out his resolve to fast track reforms in financial services and organised retailing even as he unfurled plans to dilute the governments stake in state-owned companies.         
	These are areas where Prakash Karat and his cohorts have fought pitched battles with the Manmohan Singh government over the past four years.        
	The annual economic survey  a ritualistic report on the state of the economy  dropped the bombshell by talking about raising the foreign direct investment limit in insurance to 49 per cent, allowing 100 per cent FDI in specialised retail chains besides permitting a share of FDI in all retail trade, privatising coal mining, and diluting around 10 per cent stake in unlisted public sector units.        
	The other policy reform options are privatising coal mining and permitting 100 per cent FDI in new agriculture banks.        
	Left ire        
	The Left immediately attacked the survey. The entire thrust of the economic survey is to encourage FDI or pursue the public-private partnership route. This sort of economic process, which created the divide between the rich and the poor, will spell a greater disaster for the Indian economy, said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.        
	CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta made it clear the Left would not provide the legislative support needed to pass amendments to the banking and insurance acts, which are treated as money bills and can be passed only when they have majority support in the lower House.        
	Factory workers         
	The survey proposed to usher in labour reforms by seeking to allow a 60-hour work week against 48 hours at present by amending the factories act. Factory workers would then be able to do four hours of overtime a day to meet seasonal demand for products.        
	Many of the reforms highlighted in the survey are unlikely to be pushed by the government, which has a mandate that runs till May 2009  though the speculation is that the UPA government may call polls sooner.        
	The government buttressed its stand by stating in the survey that raising growth to double digits will require additional reforms.        
	All these suggested reforms are actually part of the unfinished agenda of the UPA government, said Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG.         
	Other worries        
	The survey also articulated other worries. An appreciation of the rupee, a slowdown in industry and infrastructure constraints remained of concern, the survey added.        
	Indias national income, which grew 9.7 per cent last year, is likely to surge by 9 per cent in 2007-08. The countrys domestic output, however, grew slower at 8.7 per cent, partly because of high interest rates which slowed down industrial expansion and forced companies to stall plans to put up new factories.         
	Challenges ahead        
	The new challenge is to maintain growth at these levels, not to speak of raising it further to double-digit levels, the survey said.        
	Analysts also expect Chidambaram, who will unveil the budget for the financial year tomorrow, to slash duties on stressed sectors hit by lower demand at home and abroad in a bid to push up manufacturing growth.         
	It will be my priority to continue to provide a conducive investment climate and manage the macro economy to facilitate non-inflationary growth, quot; Chidambaram told reporters in New Delhi. quot;If you wish me to sum up in one phrase the outlook for 2008-09, I would say optimism but with caution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Realtors look beyond city
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Realtors look beyond city
          SAMBIT SAHA                                        WIDENING REACH      
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: The stagnating property market in Calcutta has prompted real estate developers to look outside the city.         
	Two housing companies  Bengal Shelter and Bengal Shristi  are set to launch many projects in various towns of Bengal and on the outskirts of Calcutta. Samar Nag, managing director of Bengal Shelter, said his company would come up with a huge stock of apartments in the next few months.        
	We are planning to launch five projects offering 5,768 flats. We plan to keep the price affordable, Nag said. He has zeroed in on Krishnanagar, Chandannagar, Thakurpukur, Barasat and Jessore Road (near the airport). Bengal Shristi has lined up projects in Asansol, Raniganj, Krishnanagar and Haldia.        
	Hemant Kanoria, managing director of the company, said the projects would have commercial and residential components, and were an exercise in infrastructure development. In all these towns, we will usher in a new dimension to development. We believe there is a lot of latent demand, he said.        
	Both Kanoria and Nag are confident of selling the projects in the depressed market.         
	Prices have not fallen much in district towns. Moreover, there is no such quality development, Kanoria said.        
	He plans to come up with a hotel, a mall and housing, all rolled into one. He is betting on composite development to sell flats at rates 20 per cent higher than the local developers. Nag, on the other hand, is banking on affordability.         
	The prices are not going up. Home loan rates are coming down. Is it not the best time to buy? This is what we are telling the customers, he said.        
	According to analysts, the lack of quality development on the outskirts of Calcutta and in towns will spur demand, but sale will depend on proper pricing.        
	Nag and Kanoria agree that the district projects are offering a breathing space to the city developers who are reeling under the impact of the slide in prices.        
	Another realtor, Merlin Group, has launched a project in the UttarparaKonnagar stretch, with prices ranging from Rs 1022 lakh.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CRR cut to hinge on fiscal trend
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Y.V. Reddy in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: The Reserve Bank today said any move to reduce the cash reserve ratio would depend on the countrys fiscal situation, including the fiscal deficit which might be understated.        
	The cash reserve ratio (CRR) is the portion of deposits that banks must keep with the central bank.        
	RBI governor Y. V. Reddy said the governments fiscal situation is improving, but there are several underlying pressures not entirely evident in the numbers.        
	The government has projected a fiscal deficit of 2.5 per cent for the current fiscal.         
	However, it has neither factored in higher food and oil subsidy bills nor the farm loan waiver scheme and a projected increase in salaries of civil servants.         
	A wider budget gap may lead to higher government borrowing, which can prevent a decline in interest rates.         
	Some economists believe that the real fiscal deficit may be nearer to 3.5 per cent of GDP considering the off-budget expenses.         
	The fiscal responsibility bill introduced by the government a few years ago aimed a zero-deficit budget next year.         
	However, most analysts believe it will take many more years to achieve the goal.         
	Global credit rating agencies have refrained from raising Indias credit rating in financial markets because of its high fiscal deficit.         
	At a function organised by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, Reddy said, Any further movement on CRR will depend on liquidity conditions.         
	Recently, the central bank had increased CRR by 0.75 per cent to suck more than Rs 27,000 crore out of the banking system in a bid to curb rising prices.        
	The Reserve Bank is fine-tuning its monetary policy to meet the twin challenges posed by the rising rupee and rising prices. On the other hand, industry is lobbying for cheaper credit.         
	However, a high fiscal deficit can mean that even if the RBI relents and allows more money into the system by reducing CRR, the government borrowing could still keep interest rates high.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, July 2: After the recent carnage on the markets, the promoters are stepping in to prop up the battered stocks of their companies.        
	Realty major DLF today announced that its board would meet on July 10 to consider a proposal to buy back its shares, sending the stock soaring by over 15 per cent.        
	Shareholders of DLF have been among the worst hit in the bear hug that has gripped stock markets since mid-January.         
	From a 52-week high of over Rs 1,225, the DLF share ended at Rs 368.40 on Monday, a drop of nearly 70 per cent. Shares of the company are ruling below its IPO price of Rs 525 per share because of worries over the impact of high interest rates.        
	DLFs buyback announcement perked up the stock which closed today at Rs 423.95, a rise of nearly 15.1 per cent over its last close.        
	A senior DLF official told The Telegraph: We think this is the right time to buy back shares as we have excess cash sitting on our books and all our land banks have been paid for. The price has not been decided as yet. It will be fixed at our board meeting. We have a land bank of 750 million square feet.        
	Sources close to DLF added that the company felt that the current market price did not reflect its true fundamentals. The buyback is expected to reduce the floating stock, thereby ensuring higher valuations.        
	Stock market observers are, however, divided over the possibility of other promoters using a buyback route to ignite the values of their crumbling stocks.         
	However, some analysts believed other realty companies would follow DLFs lead.        
	The DLF buyback will start a trend in the realty sector, said a realty analyst who did not wish to be identified.        
	However, P. Phani Sekhar of Angel Broking said only cash-rich companies would be able to fund buyback operations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Operators, users await telecom treat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Operators, users await telecom treat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          NETWORK CLEAR        
	New Delhi, June 16: The government is planning to allow mobile operators enter into agreements for intra-circle roaming within a particular service area.        
	This is expected to help operators save nearly 30 per cent of their costs resulting in lower tariffs for consumers. Officials said the move would also help new players roll out services in rural areas which involve greater capital expenditure for setting up telecom infrastructure.        
	According to an internal note prepared by the department of telecom (DoT), a mobile operator can enter into mutual commercial agreements with existing service providers to use their network and infrastructure.        
	For instance, a new telecom player such as Unitech, which plans to roll out services in the Tamil Nadu circle, can enter into a roaming deal with Bharti or Vodafone within the same circle.        
	Moreover, companies like Unitech and Videocon  both new entrants in the Tamil Nadu circle  can even have an agreement which allows them to divide the circle into two and save costs by setting up infrastructure in their half and using the others infrastructure in the other half, explained officials.        
	At present, roaming arrangements are inked by mobile service providers for telecom circles in which they do not have a licence.        
	While the DoT has proposed the move to help new players trim expenditure, industry analysts said it would also improve network utilisation.        
	If a network is congested, users can switch to other operators within the circle that may have spare capacity, creating some breathing space for the jammed network. This will improve network utilisation, said Nadeem A, research engineer at the Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology, an independent telecom research firm.         
	The proposed policy also implies that new operators can use the infrastructure of existing players and launch services within a short span.         
	However, there is lack of clarity on how the services will be priced.         
	Some analysts feel there can be interconnection and other settlement charges which may make local calls costlier when an user switches network.

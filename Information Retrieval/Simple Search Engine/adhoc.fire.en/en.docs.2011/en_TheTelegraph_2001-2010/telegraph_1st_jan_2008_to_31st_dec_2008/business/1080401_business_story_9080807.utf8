The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nokia bets on tech prop
                                                                                                               Nokia bets on tech prop
          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                                                Think big        
	Goa, March 31: Nokia India expects its revenues to increase in the next 18 to 24 months with the launch of Ovi, a global consumer services platform.        
	Ovi will provide games, music, along with image sharing and navigation services seamlessly from any device, be it phones or computers. Nokia now plans to offer more services instead of selling only handsets.        
	The image sharing service as part of Ovi will be launched soon. This will impact our revenues from the next 18 to 24 months. We are in talks with all major service providers and the response has been positive, said D. Shivakumar, vice-president and MD of Nokia India. The company closed last year with a turnover of 3.6 billion euros against 2.7 billion euros in 2006. This year, Nokia India also undertook an internal restructuring exercise to focus on service-rich handsets.         
	Earlier, the business structure was divided into enterprise, multimedia and devices based on different handset models.        
	Now the company has a group executive board which comprises the top management, followed by the services and software division, the devices division, corporate development and corporation function divisions.        
	The company will also double its research and development team, which currently has 1000 employees.        
	At a time when average revenue per user is taking a beating, like Nokia, its partners like the telecom service providers are also focusing on providing value added services to subscribers in various forms.

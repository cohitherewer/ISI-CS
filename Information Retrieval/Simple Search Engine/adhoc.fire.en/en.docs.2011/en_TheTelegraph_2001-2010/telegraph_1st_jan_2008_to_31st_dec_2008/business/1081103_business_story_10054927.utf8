	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The government can cut fuel prices marginally later this month.        
	A fall in the global price of crude oil along with the ebbing of inflation pressure can goad the government towards cutting prices. This will also improve the UPAs chances in the six assembly polls in November- December.         
	Besides, it will be a fitting riposte to the Oppositions allegation that the government is making profit from the sale of petrol.        
	The three state-run oil marketing companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited  will make a profit of Rs 4.12 per litre from the sale of petrol, based on the average price of crude oil in the second fortnight of October. They will lose 96 paise on diesel sales.         
	The average price of the Indian basket of crude in the second fortnight of October was about $63 a barrel.        
	The companies will lose Rs 22.40 a litre on kerosene and Rs 343.49 on every domestic LPG cylinder.         
	In any decision on prices, the government will consider the performance of the three companies who have posted combined losses of about Rs 13,000 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal.        
	According to Sarthak Behuria, chairman of Indian Oil Corporation, We will be finishing this fiscal in the red, unless more oil bonds are issued to us. Any price cut has to be on the monthly average price of crude in the international market and not on daily changes.         
	For a price cut to happen, Behuria said, international crude prices will have to sustain at levels lower than the break-even point for at least a month. I do not see a trigger, unless political, for a reduction in fuel prices.         
	Petroleum ministry officials said cutting fuel prices at this stage would increase the revenue loss of the three firms. Oil minister Murli Deora had met finance minister P. Chidambaram to seek more oil bonds for the three companies.

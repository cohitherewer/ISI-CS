          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, April 30: Essar Steel has agreed to the terms proposed by US steel firm Esmark to merge with the Indian company for an estimated $1.1 billion (about Rs 4,500 crore) at a price of $17 per share of Esmark.        
	With this proposed acquisition, Essar will have nearly 7-million-tonne capacity in the US and Canada, making it a significant player in those two markets.        
	The proposed tender offer was unanimously accepted by the Esmark board and is subject to customary approvals, including those of the US government and United Steelworkers, an Essar release said. Nasdaq-listed Esmark said it had also entered into a binding commitment with Essar for a $110-million term loan likely to be ensured by next month. The proceeds of the loan will be used to refinance the existing term loan and provide additional liquidity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fillip for imports from Bangladesh
                                                                                                               Fillip for imports from Bangladesh
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta, March 20: Imports from Bangladesh will increase by $70-80 million every year after the Indian government allows duty-free entry of eight million garment items from the neighbouring country.        
	Moreover, permitting foreign direct investment (FDI) on a case-to-case basis is likely to encourage Bangladeshi companies to invest in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, textiles and food processing in regions such as the Northeast.        
	At present, India has a huge trade surplus with Bangladesh. Indian exports amount to $2 billion, while imports from Bangladesh are at $250 million. The recent steps taken by the Indian government will pave the way to clear trade imbalances, Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of state for commerce and industry, said here today.        
	In a letter to the external affairs ministry, Ramesh had called for allowing FDI from Pakistan in India. The matter is being discussed at the highest level. Lets see how it goes, said Ramesh.        
	The green signal to FDI from Bangladesh is also likely to make it easy for the Tatas to go ahead with the $3-billion investment plan for the country.        
	Tea grant        
	The cabinet committee for economic affairs has approved a Rs 230-crore grant over the next five years to improve the quality of tea.

	The e-auction for tobacco will be launched in the first week of April, while that for tea will be operational by Diwali.        
	Closed gardens

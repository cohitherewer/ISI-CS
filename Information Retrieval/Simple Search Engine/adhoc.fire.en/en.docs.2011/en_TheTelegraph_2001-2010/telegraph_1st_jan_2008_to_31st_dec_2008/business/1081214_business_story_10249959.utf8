The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mill strike hurts jute bags
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mill strike hurts jute bags
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Union textile ministry has allowed the use of 1.6 lakh bales of HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bags as an emergency measure to meet any shortfall in jute bags because of the indefinite strike in Bengal mills.        
	Around 2.5 lakh jute mill workers in Bengal have gone on an indefinite strike from December 1 demanding full payment of their statutory dues, including pending dearness allowance.        
	Fearing a shortage of bags, the ministry had initially allowed the use of 85,000 bales of HDPE bags. Each bale comprises 500 bags. It later provided a cushion of another 80,000 bales to ensure adequate packing material for foodgrains. HDPE bags are made of high-density polyethylene and serve as an alternative to jute.         
	The demand for jute bags is high, with the procurement of foodgrain for the kharif season, that ended in November, and that for the rabi season starting this month. The kharif procurement will continue for another fortnight, while the rabi procurement will continue till the third week of this month.        
	The strike has severely compromised the rule that makes packing in jute bags mandatory for foodgrains and sugar. In 1987, as part of a development package for Bengal, the Rajiv Gandhi government had promulgated the mandatory jute packaging material order.        
	The state labour department has convened a meeting of mill owners and trade union representatives on December 15 to find a solution to the ongoing impasse.

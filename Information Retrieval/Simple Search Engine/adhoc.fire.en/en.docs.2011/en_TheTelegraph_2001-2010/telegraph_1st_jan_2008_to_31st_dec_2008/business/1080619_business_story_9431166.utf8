          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 18: Canara Robeco Mutual Fund plans to come out with its first equity scheme in six to eight weeks.         
	Canara Robeco Asset Management Company came into being in September last year after Canara Bank sold 49 per cent of its stake in wholly owned subsidiary Canbank Mutual Fund to the Netherlands-based Robeco Groep, the asset management arm of Rabo Bank.        
	We are planning to launch eight to nine equity schemes on a sequential basis over the current financial year, said Rajnish Narula, chief executive officer of Canara Robeco Asset Management Company.        
	Well file this week the draft prospectus with the market regulator (Sebi) for the first equity scheme and we expect to launch the fund in another six to eight weeks, Narula added.        
	The fund house is looking at two funds  a domestic fund and an international fund.        
	The domestic fund will invest in three areas  financial services, retail consumption and entertainment.         
	Through the international fund, we plan to bring in the product offerings of Zurich-based Sustainable Asset Management Company (SAM) that Robeco had bought out sometime ago, said Narula.        
	According to Narula, there will be two options in the international fund. The first will be a feeder fund that will invest the entire amount in an SAM scheme. Under the second option, 65 per cent of the corpus will be invested in domestic equities and the remaining in overseas stocks.        
	Only investors in the second option can claim long-term capital gains tax benefit.

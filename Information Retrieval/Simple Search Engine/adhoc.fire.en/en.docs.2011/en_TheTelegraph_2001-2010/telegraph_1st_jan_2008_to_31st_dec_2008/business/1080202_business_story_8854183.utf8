             Birla: New destination
                 
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: CK Birla group company Avtec Ltd is set to commission its auto component plant in Kharagpur in a few months.
    
	Avtec has started construction at the site. The company will invest Rs 150 crore in the project.
    
	Today C.K. Birla met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings and apprised him of the groups activity, which includes Hindustan Motors, in Bengal.
    
	Ravi Santhanam, managing director of Hindustan Motors, accompanied Birla to the meeting. We are planning to make machine casting and forging there (in Kharagpur), Santhanam said.
    
	Kharagpur will be the fourth plant of Avtec, which has units in Hosur, Indore and Chennai. 
    
	The company was formed in 2005 by hiving off the auto components business from Hindustan Motors and partnering with private equity player Actis.
    
	Avtec reported a turnover of Rs 570 crore last year.

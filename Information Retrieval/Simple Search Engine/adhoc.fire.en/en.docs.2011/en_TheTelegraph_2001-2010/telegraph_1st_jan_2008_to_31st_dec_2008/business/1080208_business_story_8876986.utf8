The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wockhardt issue bombs
                                                                                                            Wockhardt issue bombs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 7: Wockhardt Hospitals is the first initial public offering (IPO) that has bombed this year.        
	The healthcare outfit today withdrew its public issue after obtaining bids for just 19.55 per cent of the 2.5 crore shares it had offered to the public.        
	Under Sebi rules, an issuer has to return the money to investors if it fails to obtain bids for 90 per cent of the shares offered (including 10 per cent devolution on issue managers).        
	In a late night press release, the company said it would refund the amount in the next 15 days. The company, which floated its IPO on January 31 in the price band of Rs 280 to Rs 310, had extended its offer closure date by two days till February 7 after trimming the price band to Rs 225-260.         
	The decision not to proceed with the IPO was made in the light of the continued global and domestic market volatility and poor market sentiments and the resultant effect on the subscription levels in the IPO, the statement said.        
	The January fiasco in the bourses has taken a huge toll on recent IPOs, which includes the issue of Emaar MGF. Emaar had to extend its issue period till February 11 and lower the offer price to Rs 530 from Rs 540 at the lower band. Even till the closing date, Wockhardt failed to attract a single bid from any mutual fund.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Glad Tidings      
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The government today discussed some changes in the third-generation (3G) mobile policy to pave the way for the entry of foreign operators.        
	The department of telecom (DoT), which expects to mop up around Rs 20,000 crore by auctioning 3G radiowaves (spectrum), wants to ensure the participation of foreign firms to earn maximum revenue.        
	In the absence of foreign players, the auction of 3G spectrum will be restricted to existing domestic players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar, which will reduce the level of competition and yield lower revenues for the government.         
	While at the macro level the policy remains the same, small changes are being worked out to accommodate domestic and foreign telecom companies interested in bidding for 3G spectrum, said DoT officials.        
	The entry of foreign players will bring in expertise and increase competition in the 3G space and, thereby, reduce service rates for the consumer, the officials said.        
	Global telecom operators, including Americas AT amp;T, Germanys Deutsche Telecom and Frances Orange, had earlier expressed their reservations on certain provisions of the 3G policy.        
	They demanded that the DoT should allow them to merge with existing 2G players to launch their services instead of having to acquire a separate licence from the government.         
	If the merger rules cannot be changed, foreign firms want the entry cost of a unified access licence without 2G spectrum be reduced to Rs 80 crore instead of Rs 1,650 crore. Moreover, they have also urged the DoT to reconsider the option of auctioning 2G spectrum.         
	Foreign firms want a combination of 2G and 3G radiowaves to be able to compete with existing companies.         
	The department has discussed all the options and some changes will be incorporated in the 3G policy in the best interest of all participants, said the officials.        
	3G services, being high-end value-added offerings such as real-time transactions and video streaming, would add to the profitability of all telecom players.        
	The average revenue per user for 3G services could range anywhere between Rs 500 and Rs 700, depending on the pricing strategies adopted by the operators, estimate analysts.

	The sensex vaulted over 461 points, or 3.2 per cent, to close at 14944.97 as the shares of power, engineering and construction companies surged on the hope of growing business opportunities. Investor sentiment was also upbeat because of the US governments decision to take over mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The development had a positive impact on global indices with both Asian and European indices rising.

Larsen amp; Toubro jumped 4.6 per cent, Bhel was up 3.4 per cent and Areva T amp;D gained 3.5 per cent as investors felt that these companies could win nuclear energy deals. The BSE power index rose 3.36 per cent and the capital goods index was up 3.70 per cent.        
	Banking stocks, which have been under pressure because of high inflation, ended in the positive on expectations that the global economy could now weather the sub-prime crisis following the US governments takeover of the two mortgage companies. The SBI scrip was up 4.8 per cent, while ICICI Bank ended nearly 5 per cent higher than its previous close on Friday.        
	The suspension of the siege at the Singur plant saw the Tata Motors stock gaining nearly four per cent.

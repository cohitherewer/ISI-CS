										      Guest Column - Sitaram Yechury                        
	This is the fifth and last budget of the UPA government and being that, it is naturally reflective of the fact that before the next budget will be the general elections.         
	There was, therefore, an expectation that the unfulfilled path of the common minimum programme (CMP) will be taken. There was also expectation from the people for immediate relief from price rise and continuing agrarian distress.        
	In this backdrop, the debt relief announced for the farmers is a long overdue measure which is welcome. However, there are two caveats. First, this covers only those who have taken loans from government or cooperative institutions and leaves out the nearly two-thirds of farmers who remain at the mercy of private moneylenders and their usurious interest rates. The bulk of the suicides are taking place among this section. Some relief for them must be considered.        
	And second, there is no distinction between farmers owning irrigated land and dry land. The budget provides relief to those owning two or less hectares of land. There are many who own more than two hectares of dry land but are in severe distress. This relief must be extended to them as well.        
	The glaring deficiency of the budget is its inability to contain the current price rise. This could have been done through the strengthening of the public distribution system by ensuring the distribution of essential commodities at regulated prices. This would have meant a higher food subsidy. The budget increases this by about 3.5 per cent which in real terms may well see a reduction given the inflation rate.        
	Clearly, the PDS is not destined to be strengthened. Given the decline in agricultural production, particularly foodgrains, much of the food subsidy may well go to finance higher-priced food imports. The food subsidy, therefore, in real terms may well reduce even the existing levels of relief being provided to the people.         
	While the middle class has been given tax relief in some measure, there has been a series of concessions to big business like the reduction in the Cenvat from 16 per cent to 14 per cent  a measure that does not benefit the consumer at all.        
	There are increases in the allocations to various social sectors. The increased allocations for SC/ST, women and particularly minorities are a welcome development. However, the increase in education and health are not commensurate either with the promises made in the CMP or with the potential offered by the budget itself.        
	The budget has seen approximately an 18 per cent increase in tax revenues. Against this, the capital expenditure is slated to increase by close to 9 per cent. Instead of utilising these increased revenue collections for stepping up public investment in both the social sector and infrastructure development, the finance minister chose to use this to reduce the fiscal and revenue deficits to levels even lower than those projected in the last budget.        
	Sustaining deficits in a period of revenue buoyancy is not bad economics: it, in fact, gives the required impetus through higher levels of investment, enlarging employment and hence boosting domestic demand. This would have given the required drive for manufacturing to overcome its present sluggishness.        
	Further, in a situation where a global economic slowdown is imminent, given the US economys performance, such a domestic fiscal impulse would have protected Indian industry and manufacturing from adverse consequences.        
	The finance minister has thus continued the adherence to fiscal fundamentalism and chosen not to use increased revenues to enlarge public investment.         
	A more substantial hike in allocations to education and health would have enabled the UPA government to achieve its CMP targets of spending 6 per cent of GDP on education and 3 per cent on public health.         
	This was the last year that these promises could have been redeemed. Alas, they shall remain unfulfilled.                    
	The Left parties in the pre-budget consultations had suggested an increase in the gross budgetary support to the Eleventh Plan of Rs 60,000 crore. The finance minister has chosen to increase this by Rs 38,286 crore. Given the revenue buoyancy, it was perfectly possible to increase this to the levels that would have provided gainful economic opportunities to the people.        
	Finally, some of the suggestions made by the Left parties, like a capital gains tax and the restructuring of the ad valorem taxes on petroleum products, have only been partially accepted. The former was meant to raise revenues further from those who were making massive profits on the stock markets; and the latter to ease the pressure of rising fuel prices on the common man.        
	On the former, though the short-term capital gains tax has been increased, there is no long-term capital gains tax. As for the latter, the ad valorem tax has been restructured on excise duties but not on custom duties which are a more significant contributor to price rise.        
	On the whole, this budget represents a criminal waste of opportunities that should have been utilised to provide greater relief to the people and redeem the promises made to the aam aadmi in the CMP.

	Mumbai, July 25: The Tatas are taking their hoteliering expertise to China.        
	Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL)  the groups hotels and hospitality arm  has signed a partnership with Cuiting Hotspring Hotel Management Company Ltd to run two properties in China. This is not only IHCLs first foray into China, but it is also the first Indian hospitality chain to forge a partnership in the country.        
	Under the deal between Taj International Hong Kong Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of IHCL, and Cuiting, which is a subsidiary of Zhong Qi International Investment Company, the Tatas will operate the latters Temple of Heaven Park property in Beijing and the Hainan hotel project.        
	The first site is close to the landmark heritage site of The Temple of Heaven where a deluxe luxury hotel with 46 rooms is to be developed in traditional Chinese style. Sixty rooms will be added shortly thereafter. The first phase is expected to be ready in around six months.        
	A major tourist destination, The Temple of Heaven Park, also known as Tiantan park, is a UNESCO world heritage site. It was constructed between 1406 and 1420. It was used by the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties.        
	The Zhong Qi group is also planning to develop a 500-key resort across 60 acres in Hainan land, the premium resort destination in China. This site is expected to be ready in another three years.        
	Raymond Bickson, managing director of IHCL, said the company was attaching huge importance to these projects.        
	China, which is amongst the top 10 global tourism markets in the world, saw 135 million tourists last year. IHCL believes that the partnership will not only benefit its overseas customers, but also the 10 million outbound Indians. One cannot become a global brand without looking what both countries will bring to the table, Bickson said.

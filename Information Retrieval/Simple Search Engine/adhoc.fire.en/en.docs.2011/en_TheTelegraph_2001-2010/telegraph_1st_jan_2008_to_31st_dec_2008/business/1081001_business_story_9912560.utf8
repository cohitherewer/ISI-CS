          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said ICICI Bank had sufficient liquidity to meet the requirements of depositors as it sought to quell rumours about the banks financial health.        
	On its part, ICICI Bank has urged the Securities and Exchange Board of India to probe the recent hammering of its share price.        
	Shares of Indias largest private bank tanked 12 per cent yesterday, and the bank claimed that this was a case of market manipulation, which occurs when operators attack a scrip by spreading rumours. Today, the share gained 8.42 per cent to close at Rs 534.85, on the back of assurances from the RBI.         
	The central bank, in a statement, said ICIC Bank had enough liquidity, including in its current account with the RBI.         
	The RBI is monitoring the developments and has arranged to provide adequate cash to ICICI Bank to meet the demands of its customers at its branches or ATMs. The ICICI Bank and its subsidiary banks abroad are well capitalised, the apex bank said.        
	K. V. Kamath, chief executive officer and managing director of the bank, said rumours regarding ICICI Banks financial health were baseless. I do not want to comment on this. It is for the market regulator and the government to find out.        
	The bank said it had a net worth of over Rs 47,000 crore ($10 billion) and a capital adequacy ratio of 13.4 per cent as on June 30, against the regulatory requirement of 9 per cent.        
	This reflects the healthy capital position and comfortable level of leverage. Its banking and non-banking subsidiaries are also well-capitalised, the bank said in the statement.        
	Rejecting speculations that there could be a run on deposits, the bank said it had consolidated total assets of over Rs 484,000 crore.

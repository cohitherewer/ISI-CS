          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 24: The London-based Vedanta group today announced its decision to defer the corporate restructuring plan it unveiled just two weeks ago  and blamed the global financial turmoil for the volte-face.        
	The decision took the pressure off its Indian subsidiary, Sterlite Industries, whose shares gained over 8 per cent after the mid-morning announcement.        
	The restructuring announced by Vedanta Resources on September 9 was in direct response to shareholder requests to simplify the current corporate structure and eliminate conflicts of interest. In view of the recent changes in global financial markets and investor feedback, Vedanta has decided not to pursue the proposed group restructuring, said the company in a statement.        
	The Sterlite stock opened at Rs 455 and rallied further to touch an intra-day high of Rs 517.70, up 15.05 per cent from yesterdays close on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The stock closed at Rs 487.10, a gain of 8.26 per cent.        
	The Vedanta group was planning to restructure its operations in India into three commodity-specific entities, creating one group for copper and zinc, one for aluminium and energy, and another for iron ore.         
	Under the plan, Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd would have held all the copper, zinc and lead assets that are now strewn across the group, while it would demerge its aluminium and energy business to Madras Aluminium Company (Malco), which would be rechristened Sterlite Aluminium.        
	Vedanta unveiled the restructuring, due to have been completed by March 2009, along with a plan to invest $9.8 billion to boost aluminium smelting capacity in early September.        
	Analysts said the company management was probably betting on the increasing Asian demand for the metal. However, Sterlites stock fell 7.5 per cent the day it announced the restructuring plans. It has since slumped by around 20 per cent with investors considering copper and zinc to be less profitable than aluminium and power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil demand growth slows
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil demand growth slows
                                  
	London/Vienna, Aug. 16 (Agencies): The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) has cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2008 for the fifth month. The oil cartel said production was more than adequate, signalling a more comfortable supply and demand balance.        
	The 13-member group, source of two in every five barrels of oil, also said higher Opec production, easing political tension and a stronger US dollar indicated a weaker outlook for the oil market.        
	Given these trends, risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside, Opec said in its market report for August.        
	The softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth.        
	Opecs outlook adds to evidence that slowing economies are eroding fuel use. Oil has fallen sharply to about $113 a barrel from a record $147.27 a barrel on July 11, pressured in part by the weakening outlook for demand.        
	Oil demand will rise by 1.0 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, 30,000 bpd less than the previous forecast, Opec said in the report.

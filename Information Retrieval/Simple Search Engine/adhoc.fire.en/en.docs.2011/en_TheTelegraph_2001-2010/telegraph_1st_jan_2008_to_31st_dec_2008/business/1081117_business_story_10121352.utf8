          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Nilekani: Hopeful                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The IT industry is confident of overcoming the economic turmoil, though its growth will suffer in the short term.        
	Growth will be slower. There is an overall slowdown, which is understandable given the crisis, Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys Technologies, told reporters at the India Economic Summit, organised by the World Economic Forum.         
	He said it was not possible to repeat the high growth rates of the last four to five years. Infosys had earlier scaled down its dollar guidance by about 3 per cent for the full year.         
	Nilekani, however, said the industry was resilient enough to meet the challenges posed by the turmoil.         
	B. Ramalinga Raju, founder and chairman of Satyam Computer Services, said, The IT sector has always managed to lay a stronger foundation for a better future from any crisis it faces.         
	IT firms, Nilekani said, had weathered a downturn in 2001. We not only got out of that but also took advantage of the situation. So, I am sure the companies are following the right strategies. They are waiting for the things to subside and take advantage of the next cycle of growth, he said.         
	The sector had registered 30-32 per cent growth in the previous year but has shown signs of slowing down under the impact of the credit crunch in the US, which fetches 60 per cent of its revenue. Industry association Nasscom has already scaled down the growth rate to 21-24 per cent for this fiscal.         
	Nilekani allayed fears of job losses. Companies will continue to recruit. We are going ahead with recruitment. I think it will continue.         
	Tata Consultancy Services, Indias No. 1 IT firm, plans to hire 30,000-35,000 this fiscal.

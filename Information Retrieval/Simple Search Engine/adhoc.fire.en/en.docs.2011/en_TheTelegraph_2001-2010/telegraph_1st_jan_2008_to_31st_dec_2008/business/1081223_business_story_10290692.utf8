The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Clamour for global oil regulator
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clamour for global oil regulator

	New Delhi, Dec. 22: India today demanded an international regulator to keep global crude prices at a realistic level as wide fluctuations were affecting the economies of both the oil producers and consumers.        
	We need an international regulator. There should be transparency in investment, oil futures and price determination, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said.        
	In the last six months, crude prices have dropped from a high of $145 a barrel in July to about $34.        
	State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd said it would review its investments if the slump continued for a longer period.        
	We wont have to put investments on hold if the current prices continue for another three-four months. But if they stretch beyond that, we will certainly have to review our plans, said R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC.        
	Todays price is not comfortable as our margins are under severe pressure. A price of $75 a barrel is reasonable for upstream companies to keep investing, he said.        
	The fall in crude prices is affecting the mechanism for subsidy to state-owned oil marketing companies.        
	Upstream oil firms ONGC and Oil India  which foot 33 per cent of the subsidy bill, with the government paying the rest  have said that they were in no position to contribute because of falling crude prices. The duos contribution was by selling crude at a discount.         
	The upstream companies have approached us to say that they cannot contribute Rs 45,000 crore this year, and the matter is under consideration, Pandey said.        
	Biggest exploration        
	Falling crude price notwithstanding, India plans to go ahead with its biggest programme of oil and gas exploration in February, under the eighth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp). Over 100 blocks will be offered for global bidding.        
	It would be our endeavour to launch Nelp-VIII in the first quarter of 2009, petroleum minister Murli Deora said on the occasion of the signing of contracts for 44 blocks awarded under the recently concluded Nelp-VII.        
	Pandey said the bidding would start in February, while director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said 100 blocks spread over 400,000 square km would be offered.        
	Nelp-VII was our largest round so far with 150,000 sq km offered. Nelp-VIII would be even larger, Sibal said.        
	A total of 57 blocks were offered in the previous auction, but bids were received only for 45 blocks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IFCI in no hurry to decide on stake sale
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 23: IFCI Ltd is unlikely to take any decision on stake sale in its board meeting on April 29.        
	In December last year, the company went back on offloading a 26 per cent stake even after seeking bids from prospective partners.        
	Our capital adequacy ratio is at 17 per cent. So we dont need capital infusion at this stage, an IFCI official said.         
	Moreover, the non-banking finance company is expecting a net profit growth rate of about 20 per cent for 2007-08.        
	IFCIs net profit trebled to Rs 668 crore in 2006-07. The companys board will meet on April 29 to finalise the financial results for the year ended March 2008.        
	According to analysts, market conditions are not conducive for a stake sale. The sensex, after its record-breaking fall in January, is yet to recover.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had earlier supported IFCIs decision to reject the bid offer in December, but said the company could get more offers when a rebidding is initiated.         
	He did not give a time frame for the rebidding.        
	By inducting a strategic investor, IFCI had hoped to bolster its equity base and leverage it to raise more debt and get back to full-fledged lending.

                                I had invested Rs 1,00,000 in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) in April this year. Can I avail deduction under Section 80C on this investment in the current financial year?          Nilotpal Talukdar, Calcutta
                    vestments in SCSS have been brought under the ambit of Section 80C of the income tax act from assessment year 2008-09, that is financial year 2007-08. Please refer to the release issued by the income tax department in this regard. The release can be accessed through the following link:             http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/archive/PressRelease_02012008.pdf. It says that investments made by an individual or a Hindu undivided family in an SCSS on or after April 01, 2007 shall be eligible for deduction under Section 80C. So, you can claim deduction on your investment in SCSS in 2008-09.                                   Tax for agents      What type of income tax return form should be used by agents selling post office small savings and deposit schemes?        Nitaynanda Majumdar, Thakurpukur
                    Commissions received by agents is treated as business income. Hence, youll have to file your income tax return in Form ITR-4.                                  Bank was right      I am a senior citizen. My gross income is much less than Rs 1,95,000 per annum. Yet the bank has deducted tax on interest income for non-submission of Form 15G. Shall I get back the deducted amount on submission of Form 15G during the current financial year? Should they not issue the required certificate showing the tax deduction?        A.K. Halder, Calcutta
                    The bank was right in deducting tax on interest income at source as you had not submitted Form 15G.           By submitting Form 15G now, the bank will not refund you the deducted tax at source. But it will not deduct           y tax further after getting the Form 15G. For the tax already deducted, the bank will issue you a TDS certificate in Form 16A. You will have to file income tax return and show this tax deduction in the same if you want to get refund of the tax deducted from the income tax department

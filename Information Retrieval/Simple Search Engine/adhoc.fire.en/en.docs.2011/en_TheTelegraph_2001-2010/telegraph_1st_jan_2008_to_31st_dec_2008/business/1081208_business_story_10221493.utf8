          OUR BUREAU                                              STILL HUNGRY      
	Dec. 7: Industry was happy with the government stimulus package but said more relief measures were necessary to maintain the high growth rates of the previous years.        
	Realty players, including DLF and Unitech, said the measures would have a good impact, particularly in the non-metros.         
	However, they felt the proposed package for home loans by banks should have been for borrowings up to Rs 50 lakh instead of Rs 20 lakh.        
	The apex chambers of commerce and industry felt that the incentives for the infrastructure projects as also the automobile sector should have been more.        
	Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said, The package has enough punch to restart overall economic activity. It also seeks to create an additional demand through a cut in cenvat. It has taken a number of steps to support exports in the face of sagging global demand.        
	CII director-general Chandrajit Bannerjee said, The most important point is proper usage of the stimulus package.        
	Assocham, however, was unhappy with the size of the package.         
	According to Assocham president Sajjan Jindal, The industry was anticipating a booster package of Rs 70,000 crore. He expected the government to take more drastic measures to create demand and ensure that the economy bounces back to its previous growth speed.         
	Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said he expected car prices to come down by four per cent following the duty cuts.        
	However, M amp;M president (automotive sector) Pawan Goenka said it was little disappointing that the stimulus package had not addressed the specific issue of the availability of funds for automobile sector.        
	Steel manufacturer Ispat Industries welcomed the cut in the export duty of iron ore, saying it will enable Indian iron ore companies sell more abroad. JSW Steel saw the step against the industrys interest.        
	It is a welcome move. Iron ore demand is shrinking in the domestic market. The industry would now be able to export more of their output. In the long run, if the move hits our interest, we will approach the government, Ispat Industries vice-chairman and managing director Vinod Mittal said.        
	Rahul Baldota, executive director, the Federation of Indian Minerals Industries, said, We are happy that the government has listened to the federation. This move is going to help the industry. However, we will be happier if the duty on lumps is also removed.         
	JSW group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao said, I think the move will hurt the steel industry as iron ore prices will increase with the changes in the duty structure. It will be interesting to see by what percentage iron ore exports increase with the step.        
	Suggesting upper limit for home loans in the range of Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, realty firms said the package would bring growth momentum to the economy.        
	DLF group executive director Rajeev Talwar said the upper limit for home loans should have been fixed at Rs 45-50 lakh, while Unitech managing director Sanjay Chandra suggested a limit of Rs 30 lakh.        
	Parsvnath Developers chairman Pradeep Jain, however, said, Its an eyewash. It is not going to spur demand, while Omaxe called the package disappointing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank trio in rate-cut race
                                                                                                               Bank trio in rate-cut race
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 18: Public sector banks are going in for a second round of interest rate reduction on home loans below Rs 20 lakh. However, in most cases, only new borrowers will enjoy the lower rates.         
	While Allahabad Bank and the Central Bank of India today announced 25-50 basis points cut in their home loans, Uco Bank reduced its rates by 25 basis points yesterday. The new rates will come into effect from April 1.        
	One basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point.        
	After reducing its interest rates on housing loans by 50-75 basis points in February, Allahabad Bank today again slashed its lending rate by 25 basis points, bringing down the floating interest rate on new home loans for five years to 9.5 per cent and for 15 to 20 years to 10.5 per cent.        
	Our board will consider reducing the banks benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) at its next meeting. It will reduce the interest rate for existing home loan borrowers, an Allahabad Bank official said.         
	The banks board will meet next week. Any reduction in the BPLR will be effective from April 1.         
	The reduction in interest rate has been possible as the bank has been able to reduce the cost of incremental deposits. It is also being done to boost the demand for housing loan particularly among small and medium category borrowers, Allahabad Bank said in a release to the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	On March 17, city-based Uco Bank reduced its rates by 25 basis points to 9.25 per cent for new home loans repayable in five years.         
	For loans of longer tenure, the interest rate will be 11.75 per cent.         
	It will give relief to new home loan borrowers and make our rates more attractive, said S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Uco Bank.        
	The Central Bank of India also reduced its interest rates on retail loans, including home loans, to spur consumer demand.         
	The bank said the floating interest rate has been reduced by 25 basis points to 9.25 per cent and the fixed interest rate has been brought down by 50 basis points to 10 per cent in case of housing loans. The bank last reduced its home loan rates in October 2007 by 50 basis points.         
	 The revised interest rates will come into effect from April and will be applicable to new accounts.        
	With respect to other retail loans, the bank said interest rates had been reduced by 50 to 200 basis points.

	Mumbai, Oct. 1: Banking and capital market regulators are considering the possibility of relaxing norms for currency futures.        
	C.B. Bhave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said market participants had started clamouring for a relaxation in the regulations  just over a month after currency futures debuted on the National Stock Exchange.         
	On Wednesday, the Bombay Stock Exchange also started trading in currency futures. The Reserve Bank of India and Sebi are working together to relax the norms, Bhave said without elaborating on the specific nature of these demands.        
	Currency futures represent a foreign exchange derivative contract to buy or sell one currency against another on a specified future date, at a price decided in the contract. Current regulations stipulate that the minimum size of the contract must be $1000 and it must increase in the same multiple.        
	The National Stock Exchange (NSE) began trading in currency futures on August 29. The Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) is expected to start trading in currency futures shortly.        
	Although trading in currency futures began on a brisk note, the intensity has come down significantly with market participants blaming it on regulations that include tough margin requirements.        
	A further relaxation in currency trading norms is expected to enable all category of market participants to trade in currency futures. At present, only a selected group of players are allowed to trade.        
	Bhave said the regulators were trying to ensure the transparency and timely settlement of transactions. The present financial crisis in the global markets is an outcome of a lack of faith in these principles, he said.        
	The BSE today launched currency derivatives segment (BSE-CDX) that would enable participants to hedge their currency risks by trading on the US dollar-rupee platform.        
	M.L. Soneji, chief operating officer of BSE, said, Exchange-traded currency derivatives market will provide an excellent opportunity to hedge currency risk for different participants. We are offering the unique facility of buying positions in one month and selling in the next. We expect good transaction volumes on this platform.        
	RBI meet        
	A high-level committee on capital markets today met to assess the financial situation in the domestic market in the face of the global financial turbulence.        
	The meeting was attended by top finance ministry officials and regulators, including Bhave, finance secretary Arun Ramanathan, Sebi member T.C. Nair and IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayanan.        
	The details of the closed-door meeting, which lasted for more than two hours, are not known.

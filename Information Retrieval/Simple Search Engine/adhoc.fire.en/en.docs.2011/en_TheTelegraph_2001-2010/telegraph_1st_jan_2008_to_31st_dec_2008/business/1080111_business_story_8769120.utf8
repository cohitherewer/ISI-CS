	Mumbai, Jan. 10: Pharma firm Wockhardt is planning to demerge its new chemical entities R amp;D business into a separate company. 
    
	Sun Pharmaceutical, Nicholas Piramal and Ranbaxy did the same a few months ago. 
    
	Wockhardt is also planning to demerge certain high-value products into the new entity. Though details of these products are not available, the company informed the stock exchanges that its board would meet on January 18 to consider the demerger proposal. It is also planning to raise funds through an issue of equity shares. 
    
	In R amp;D, the company focuses on three areas: recombinant biopharmaceuticals, generics or off-patented products and new drug discoveries. In new drug discoveries, Wockhardt has developed lead molecules mainly in the anti-infective field that are currently in various stages of development. According to Wockhardt, the most advanced of these new chemical entities (NCE) is WCK 771, which has commenced Phase II human clinical trials. WCK 771 is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. 
    
	Another entity in the process of development is WCK 1152, a lead molecule to treat respiratory tract infections, including hospital-acquired infections. It is undergoing Phase I clinical trials.
    
	Pharmaceutical companies have been looking to demerge their R amp;D units. They have different business dynamics than formulations. Apart from the risk factor, a longer time is taken for identified molecules to enter the market. 
    
	In such circumstances, a separate company enables a sharper focus in research. 
    
	In August last year, Nicholas Piramal announced it was demerging its NCE research unit into a separate company called NPRC. Shareholders of Nicholas Piramal would get one share of the new company for every 10 shares held. Post listing later this year, the new company will look at various options for raising funds to meet its business requirements. 
    
	Apart from raising funds from the market, NPRC may bring in a strategic or a financial investor.
    
	Earlier, Sun Pharma had demerged its innovative research and development division into a new company called Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company. Similarly, last October, Ranbaxy had announced it would demerge the R amp;D division to unlock value for its shareholders. The new entity is expected to be listed during this calendar year.

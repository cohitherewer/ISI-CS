                                                                                                            Centre takes over 4 tea gardens
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Centre has taken over four tea gardens, two each in Bengal and Kerala, and called for expressions of interest from interested parties to run them.        
	This is the first time Section 16(E) of the Tea Act 1953 has been invoked to take over gardens. Section 16(E) allows the Tea Board to take over gardens that are lying closed for more than three months and find new owners.        
	The EoIs have been invited for two gardens in Jalpaiguri  Chinchula owned by Shimansu Vyaparik Kendra and Bamandanga Tondoo owned by Tondoo Tea Co. The two gardens in Kerala are Peermade and Lone Tree, both controlled by Peermade Tea Company in Idukki district.        
	Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of state for commerce, confirmed that EoIs had been sought. There are seven more gardens in Bengal which are in various stages of litigation and the government will move swiftly to clear the legal hurdles to reopen them.        
	The minister said negotiations were on to revive Samsing and Raipur gardens.         
	The problem faced by the Raipur owners has been resolved and negotiations will proceed at a fast pace, he said.        
	The minister is expected to visit Bengal next week to review the conditions of all the gardens that are closed.

	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Russian government have cleared the air over the Indian companys acquisition of UKs Imperial Energy, which has substantial reserves in Siberia.        
	The PSU would complete the acquisition of Imperial by June 2009; Russian authorities said they would not set any precondition such as a stake for its state-run firms in return for approval to the acquisition.        
	The entire transaction has to be closed by June 2009. We are well on track, said ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma.        
	ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the overseas arm of ONGC, has time till December 9 to make an offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Imperial. The offer will remain open for 28 days.        
	OVL officials said the company would not revise its offer price of 1,250 pence per share for Imperial.         
	The total acquisition cost will be 1.4 billion, and OVL had bid when global crude prices were $128 per barrel compared with $50 per barrel now.        
	On the acquisition, Russian energy minister Sergey Shmatko said, Our approach towards this deal is quite liberal and if the Indian company would like to acquire Imperial Energy, we are not going to put forward any demands.         
	ONGC was expecting that it would have to divest a 25-40 per cent stake in Imperial to Russias Rosneft in return of regulatory approvals from Moscow.

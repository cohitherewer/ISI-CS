	New Delhi, Aug. 1: To help Indian companies raise funds from overseas security markets at competitive rates, the finance ministry has proposed to relax the norms for the pricing of American depository receipts (ADRs) and global depository receipts (GDRs).        
	The decision follows the submission of a report by an expert committee headed by Prime Ministers economic advisory council member Saumitra Choudhury that was set up to review the ADR, GDR and FCCB policy.        
	At present, the issue price of ADRs/GDRs  financial instruments used by companies to raise funds in foreign exchange  is determined on the basis of the higher of the last six months average price or last 15 days average price, in the domestic market, before the issue.        
	Following representations from companies that during falling stock markets, it was not possible to raise funds, the finance ministry has proposed to reduce it to two months average price.        
	The average price could be considered preceding the date of shareholders meeting, which authorises the company to raise funds through ADRs or GDRs, said a finance ministry statement while inviting public comments in the next 15 days on the proposed norms.         
	The government move will help companies access foreign markets more easily to raise working capital as in the domestic market, bank rates are going up leading to a liquidity crunch, a market observer said.

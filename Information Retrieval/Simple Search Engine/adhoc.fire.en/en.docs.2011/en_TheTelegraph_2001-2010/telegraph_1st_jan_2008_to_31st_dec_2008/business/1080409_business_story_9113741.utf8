          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 8: Russian conglomerate Sistema has tied up with Shyam Telecom to enter the Indian realty market with an initial investment kitty of $200 million.        
	The joint venture plans to develop hotels, offices and residential complexes in major cities.         
	It will develop a 22-acre property in Gurgaon, industry sources said. The land is owned by Shyam group promoter Rajiv Mehrotra, and the two parties are negotiating their investment contribution.        
	The venture is Sistemas first undertaking in construction and real estate outside Russia and Ukraine.        
	The Indian real estate market is similar to Russia although the costing may be different, said Yevgeny Kolodkin, vice-president (strategy and business development) of Sistemas construction subsidiary.         
	Asked whether the Shyam group would be Sistemas partner in all future real estate projects, Kolodkin said, No final decision has been taken. We are in talks with small to medium developers to partner with us for the sector.         
	Sources feel the tieup will also boost the companys telecom plans.        
	The department of telecommunications has allocated 2.5 MHz of start-up spectrum to Sistema-Shyam Telelink to start CDMA-based mobile services in the country.        
	Sistema, which is the majority stake holder in the venture, has already announced an investment of Rs 20,000 crore in a pan India mobile network.        
	Sources said the joint venture in the realty sector would try to tap the market ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.         
	We are finalising the details and the first project will start by end of 2008 or early 2009, Kolodkin said.         
	Sistemas construction subsidiary, Sistema Hals, plans to invest in other Indian cities, including Mumbai and Calcutta, apart from Delhi.        
	Spooked by the sub-prime crisis and the slowdown in the US economy, global players are focusing on India, which is growing at over 8 per cent.        
	The realty sector has attracted CalPERS, the largest US pension fund, hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, the US-based developer Tishman Speyer and NRI-promoted Trikona Capital, Emmar and Salim group.

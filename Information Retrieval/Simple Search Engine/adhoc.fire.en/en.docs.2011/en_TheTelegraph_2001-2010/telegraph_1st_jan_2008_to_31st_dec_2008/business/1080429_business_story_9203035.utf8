                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SBI Life turns health conscious
          ANIRUDH LASKAR                           Roy: Fitness formula                                  
	Mumbai, April 28: SBI Life Insurance plans to offer health insurance covers in the next one to two months.        
	A highly placed official with SBI Life told The Telegraph that the insurer would begin its health business with a critical illness policy offering a cover for 9 to 10 critical ailments with a hospital cash feature.         
	The insurer is seeking regulatory approvals for its proposal. It will shortly file the required applications with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. The company is in talks with various reinsurers to finalise the premium and sum-assured structures for the policy.         
	We have done an extensive market research to ensure that the health product suits the customers need without skewing the claims ratio. We are discussing with reinsurers like Swiss Re and Munich Re, but have not shortlisted any one so far. Once we finalise a reinsurer, we will be able to decide the premium and the sum-assured under our health product. We are trying to keep the product as cheap as possible,said U.S. Roy, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Life Insurance.         
	The health policy is most likely to be a hospital cash product, where a lumpsum is paid to the insured each time an ailment, which is covered under the policy, is detected, Roy added.         
	SBIs health product has been designed as a family floater plan where several members of a family are insured under a single premium. The stand-alone health insurance product would also provide a cover for life-threatening diseases such as cancer.         
	The company would launch two sets of health insurance policies during the financial year 2008-09.        
	It has not tied up with any third party administrator (TPA) to distribute its health products. The first set of products will be distributed through the insurers branch network.         
	For the second set of products, the company is planning to tie up with hospitals directly to keep the premium lower than the policies of rivals.         
	We are putting in a lot of innovation for our second set of products. Instead of tying up with TPAs, we are considering the possibility of distributing the policy directly through hospitals, which in turn will ensure that the expenses are minimised for the policyholders, Roy added.         
	SBI Life recorded 92 per cent growth in total premium at Rs 5,622 crore for the year ending March 31, 2008. The companys net profit stood at Rs 34 crore for the year, with total assets under management at Rs 10,493 crore.        
	Unit-linked products contributed almost 70 per cent to the total premium income.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Tax worry
                                Are profits on redemption of mutual fund units, dividend and gain on surrender of units in a three-year close-ended scheme taxable?          Suresh Shah, Kidderpore
                    While dividend income on mutual fund units in the hands of unit holders is tax-free (dividend distribution tax is paid by the fund house), profits on redemption or surrender of units are taxable in some cases depending on whether the scheme invests at least 65 per cent of its corpus in domestic equities and when you are redeeming the units.  If a mutual fund scheme invests at least 65 per cent of its corpus in domestic equities, selling those units after 12 months of its purchase attracts no capital gains tax. Non-equity schemes attracts capital gains tax irrespective of whether you hold them for less or more than 12 months. Selling units of equity-related schemes within 12 months of their purchase attracts short-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent.                                     From a friend      I am a senior citizen with investments in banks and post offices. My late friend in his will gave me 10,000 that I have not yet received. What will be my tax liability on acceptance of this money?        Anonymous, Calcutta
                  Donor-based gift tax was abolished with effect from October 1, 1998, and it was proposed to be substituted by donee-based gift tax. However, for several reasons, including serious anomalies in the donee-based gift tax, it was not approved. Finance minister P. Chidambaram in his budget of July 2004 brought back the donee-based gift tax through the backdoor by treating certain gifts as income of the recipient and recovering income tax on such amounts.                 Money received after September 1, 2004, as gifts from non-relatives now attract income tax. These are included as income under section 56(2)(v) of the Act. The basic exemption initially was Rs 25,000, which has been raised to Rs 50,000 from April 2006.               However, gifts from relatives are exempt without any limit. The purpose of the provision is to tax primarily gifts from non-relatives, including from friends living abroad. But the catch here is that since the cash gift becomes a part of the individuals income, there is actually no exemption.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Wobbly base                          
	Mumbai, June 10: The bears prowled Dalal Street today after investors pounded the sensex to send it to a nine-month low at 14645.31 in morning trades. At the end of another torrid day of trading, the sensex stayed below 15000 amid fears that the US would raise interest rates once again.        
	Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke spooked markets around the world yesterday when he hinted at a rate hike to rein in inflation in the US. After last weeks surge in US unemployment numbers, the markets had discounted the possibility of a rate hike  but Bernankes comments doused the hopes. The Shanghai Composite index swooned by 7.73 per cent as the Peoples Bank of China raised the interest rates by a massive 100 basis points, which supplemented fears of a similar hike across other Asian economies.         
	Chinas action accentuated fears of a response from the Reserve Bank of India, with marketmen speculating about another hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which is currently ruling at 8.25 per cent. The RBI has raised CRR twice already  by 50 basis points in two stages in April and by another 25 basis points from May 24.        
	Inflation and fears of liquidity tightening have become a macro-economic issue now. India and China have similar problems. After the Fed hinted at a rate hike and China raised its interest rates, there is a strong possibility of a CRR hike in India to counter inflationary pressures, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president, equity strategy, at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.         
	The market, however, gained momentum during the last one-and-a-half hour of its trade on the back of short-covering, and finally closed with losses of 176.85 points at 14889.25 today. The Nifty ended 51.15 points down at 4,449.80.         
	Zandu spurt        
	Zandu Pharmaceuticals stock hit a one-year high today despite the gloom in the broader market. The companys stock zoomed to Rs 10,700 before closing at Rs 10,500.55, up 6.96 per cent, or Rs 683.10. Emami is slated to launch an open offer to acquire a 20 per cent stake in Zandu.

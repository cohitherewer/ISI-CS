	Mumbai, May 9: MAN Group, the German manufacturer of trucks and diesel engines, expects India to substantially contribute to each of its businesses during this year.        
	While production from its joint venture with Force Motors will rise to 6,800 vehicles from 800 at present, MAN expects the local sourcing of diesel engines will rise to a great extent.        
	This was disclosed by Georg Pachta-Reyhofen, member of the MAN executive board, while speaking to reporters here today.        
	MAN today opened its new headquarters in Mumbai.        
	With the new MAN house opened in Mumbai, we intend to strengthen our presence in India. Specialists from diesel engines, commercial vehicles, turbo machinery and industrial services would form a strong team for addressing customer needs and requirements, Reyhofen, said.        
	During 2007, MANs India operations saw sales of 90 million euros.         
	The group expects sales to grow by at least 10 per cent during this year.        
	MAN has a joint venture with Force Motors to build heavy-duty trucks.         
	According to Abhay Firodia, chairman and managing director of Force Motors, the joint venture should produce 24,000 units annually by 2010.

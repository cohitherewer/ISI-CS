          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mao Siwei in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, June 21: China wants India to either issue work visas for its nationals and businessmen here or allow their renewal in this country to save costs, a Chinese diplomat said today.        
	At present, Chinese nationals working in India have to get their visas renewed from the Indian embassy in China every six months which is very costly and time consuming, said Mao Siwei, consul general of the Peoples Republic of China.        
	If India offers work visas, then the problem faced by Chinese businessmen can be addressed, Siwei said on the sidelines of an interactive session with the members of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce.        
	Siwei said his country allowed Indian businessmen and workers in China to renew their visas there.        
	He said the matter was being discussed at a high level.        
	According to Siwei, the Chinese consulate in Calcutta has started issuing visas to non-resident Indians travelling to China via India.        
	Six out of the top ten Indian IT companies are present in China, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro.         
	There are more than 154 Indian companies in China, including Ranbaxy, SAIL and Reliance. On the other hand, more than 60 Chinese companies, such as TCL, Huawei, Haier and Lenovo, have operations in India.        
	Siwei expects Sino-Indian trade to double during the current fiscal.         
	Trade between the two countries has grown from $1.9 billion in 1998 to $18.8 billion in the first four months of the current year.        
	About Chinese interest in the eastern region, he said they were interested in investing in steel and automotive businesses.

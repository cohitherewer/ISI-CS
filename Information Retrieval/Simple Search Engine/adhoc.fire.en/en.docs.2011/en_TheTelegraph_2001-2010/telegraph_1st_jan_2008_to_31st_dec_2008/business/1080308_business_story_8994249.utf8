                                                                                                               Tata Tele to sell 49% of tower arm
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 7: CDMA player Tata Teleservices will divest up to 49 per cent in its tower subsidiary Wireless Tata Telecom Infrastructure in the next two months.        
	We will sell a 26-49 per cent stake in our tower company to a strategic investor. We have already started negotiations and the deal is likely to be completed by the end of May, Tata Teleservices (TTSL) managing director Anil Sardana told reporters.        
	He said the company had shortlisted 15 strategic investors for selling the stake. The players include Quippo and GTL.        
	Asked about the valuation of the tower arm, Sardana did not give any figure, but said the valuation would be similar, if not better, to its competitors because of the quality of the towers.        
	TTSL has 10,000 towers, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) has 3,500 towers.                          
	On the listing of TTSLs tower subsidiary, Sardana said it would be decided after the strategic stake sale.        
	We will also add 3,000 towers every year for the next five years, he added.

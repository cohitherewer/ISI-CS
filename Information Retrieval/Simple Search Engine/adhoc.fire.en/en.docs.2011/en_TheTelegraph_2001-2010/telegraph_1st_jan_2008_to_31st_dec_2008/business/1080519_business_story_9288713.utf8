	New Delhi, May 18 (PTI): The Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council has recommended imposition of 10 per cent minimum alternative tax (MAT) on industrial units in special economic zones (SEZ) as a compromise to end the spat between the ministries of commerce and finance over sops to these tax-free zones.        
	The council, headed by noted economist and former RBI governor C. Rangarajan, has however shot down the proposal of the finance ministry to slap an export obligation of 51 per cent on the SEZ units.        
	The Economic Advisory Council has recommended to the Prime Minister that there is no need to put a cap on these zones, rather finance ministry should bring units in these zones under MAT that could be adjusted for tax on sales in the domestic market, official sources said.

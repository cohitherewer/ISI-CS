                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Review of SEZ act on govt agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nath in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, April 29: The government today said it was open to reviewing the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act but ruled out foreign direct investment in the retail sector.        
	In the Rajya Sabha today, Union commerce Minister Kamal Nath said, We will review the SEZ Act if we find it requires revision.        
	Only 80 to 90 SEZs have become operational and once the number touches the 100-mark, the government will carry out a detailed review to find out whether the law has been misused, the minister said.        
	Opposition members questioned the reckless approval of tax-free zones, with BJP alleging that most of the land was being grabbed by land sharks to set up hotels and malls in the name of SEZs.        
	BJP member Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned the earmarking of 60,000 hectares of land for these zones, saying it was far beyond necessity.        
	The board of approval has cleared more than 450 such zones, of which 206 have been notified. The SEZ Act of 2005, that came into effect on February 10, 2006, sought to provide various incentives and tax sops to the units in a SEZ to attract large-scale domestic as well as foreign capital.         
	Over Rs 67,347 crores have been invested in these notified SEZs. Direct employment has been provided to over 97,478 people.        
	On the impact of FDI in retail on small traders, Nath said, We cannot have anything which rocks the boat of existing employment.

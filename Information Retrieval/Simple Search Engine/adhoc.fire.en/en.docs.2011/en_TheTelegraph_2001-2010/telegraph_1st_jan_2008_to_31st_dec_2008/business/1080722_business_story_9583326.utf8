          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 21: Stocks today swayed to the political winds blowing from New Delhi, with the sensex dipping and then perking up to gain nearly 215 points as the mood in Dalal Street lifted following indications that the UPA will sail through the trust vote tomorrow because of abstentions.         
	Investors, cautious early in the day, bought stocks towards the latter half of the trading session following reports that Trinamul Congresss Mamata Banerjee and some other members of the NDA may choose to abstain from voting.        
	The mood was guarded at the beginning over apprehensions that the trust vote is likely to be a close call for the government.         
	While this resulted in the benchmark index dipping during the day, sharp spikes were also observed as prospects of the government surviving improved. The sensex, which opened at 13782.13, hit an intra-day low of 13581.19 in early session.        
	Though it recovered, market circles said that political uncertainty kept most investors away from making any significant purchases.         
	It was only towards the last hour of trade that a spike was seen after reports came in about the possible abstentions. The benchmark index finally ended at 13850.04, a rise of 214.64 points, or 1.57 per cent.        
	There was some optimism that the government may manage to survive the trust vote because of abstentions and this led the markets to end with a gain of over 200 points. However, many are still cautious, an analyst with a foreign brokerage said.         
	The sensex has gained more than 1000 points in the last two trading sessions. It is largely felt that shares can stage a rally if the government survives the trust vote.         
	There could be another 500-point rally if the government stays on, a broker said.        
	He said that todays gains were also on account of some short-covering in bank and realty stocks.         
	These sectors have borne the brunt of the recent bear phase that engulfed the domestic stock markets because of high oil prices. Select FMCG, PSU, metal and auto stocks also ended higher.         
	However, Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, is among those who feel that notwithstanding reports of abstentions, it will still be tight for the government.         
	There will be some nervousness tomorrow. If the government survives, there will be a rally. But a correction is likely to follow as the index has risen by more than 1000 points, he said.        
	CEOs see status quo        
	A majority of chief executives of Indian companies expect the UPA to win the trust vote, a survey said on Monday.        
	The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry said 72 per cent of the 400 CEOs polled expected the government would also speed up unfinished reforms in pension, insurance and civil aviation sectors, and even labour reforms, if it wins Tuesdays vote.

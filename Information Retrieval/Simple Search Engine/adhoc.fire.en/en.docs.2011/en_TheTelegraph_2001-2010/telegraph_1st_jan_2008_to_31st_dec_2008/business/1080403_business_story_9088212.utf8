          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 2: Mahindra amp; Mahindra has teamed up with ICICI Venture Funds Managements to acquire Italian gear manufacturer Metalcastello.        
	Though the deal size has not been revealed, it is estimated to be little over 100 million euros. The transaction is, however, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.        
	While the top management of Metalcastello currently holds 15.3 per cent stake in the company, the remaining 84.7 per cent is held by the financial investors.        
	Metalcastello, based near Bologna, has revenues of around $100 million. The company, founded in 1952, is one of the top gear manufacturers in Europe, focused largely on the off-highway segment. The companys products include complex gears and shafts used in vehicle transmission.        
	Commenting on the acquisition, Ananad Mahindra, vice-chairman of the Mahindra group, said, Mahindra Systech has the mandate to build globally competitive businesses in selected verticals and this acquisition greatly enhances our capability to do so.        
	Hemant Luthra, president of Mahindra Systech, said, Together with ICICI Venture we expect Metalcastello, an outstanding company with a 50 years history of serving its customers profitably, to help replicate in the gear vertical what Mahindra Forging has achieved in the forgings space.         
	The customer base of both Mahindra Forging and Metalcastello is complementary and will enhance the synergies that we are already harvesting, he added.

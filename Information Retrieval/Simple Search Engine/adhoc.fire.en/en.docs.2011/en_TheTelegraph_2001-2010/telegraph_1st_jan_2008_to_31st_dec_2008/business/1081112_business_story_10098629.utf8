	New Delhi, Nov. 11: India is set to sign two free trade pacts  with the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).        
	The agreement with Asean is expected to be signed in the third week of December in Bangkok. The pact with the GCC is likely to be inked next year.         
	The trade pact with Asean is expected to improve Indias trade deficit with the region. It is also likely to give a boost to the Look-East policy of the government. Exports to Asean were $16 billion in 2007-08, while imports were $24 billion.         
	Goods, services and investment are the focus areas in the proposed deal with the GCC.        
	Sources said there were some areas of dispute regarding lower tariffs on goods in the proposed deal with the GCC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude marches forward
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crude marches forward
                                          
	London, May 21 (Reuters): Oil prices surged more than $3 to a record above $132 a barrel on Wednesday after US data revealed a sharp drop in fuel inventories.        
	US crude gained $2.53 to $131.51 a barrel by 1625 GMT after hitting a fresh peak of $132.08. London Brent rose $3.56 to $131.40. London brent gained $3.56 to $131.40.         
	Weekly data from the US government showed stocks of crude had fallen by 5.4 million barrels. The market is in a very bullish mood and these statistics will do nothing to change that, said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc.        
	The fall in weekly inventories is matched by concerns that supply problems will continue for years, which have pushed future prices to record highs both in the very long-term as well as in the near term. Oil for delivery in 2016 rose above $142 a barrel on Wednesday.        
	Investors have also been drawn into the market by a weak US currency, which has made dollar-denominated commodities relatively cheap for holders of other currencies. The dollar slid to a one-month low against the euro on Wednesday, which was pushed upwards by expectations of higher euro zone interest rates.        
	Abdullah al-Badri, secretary- general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), said the soft dollar was one of the factors that could keep pushing oil higher. Opec has kept official policy unchanged, but its biggest producer Saudi Arabia has raised production and other members have overcome problems that had reduced supplies.        
	US move        
	The US House of Representatives (Congress) approved legislation on Tuesday allowing the US justice department to sue Opec members for limiting oil supplies, but the White House threatened to veto the measure because it could spur retaliatory action against American interests in those countries.        
	Persistent robust diesel imports into China, the worlds second-biggest energy user, have fuelled prices around the globe. European gas oils premium to London brent crude hit a peak of $40 last week, boosting margins for refineries.        
	Oil prices have risen six-fold since 2002 as surging demand in China and other developing economies strained supplies and drew in a wave of investor interest. Billionaire investor T. Boone Pickens said on Tuesday he expected oil to hit $150 a barrel this year.         
	The prediction came on the same day two investment banks raised their 2008 crude price forecasts and two weeks after Goldman Sachs said a barrel could fetch $200 by 2010.        
	Investment banks Societe Generale and Credit Suisse raised their oil price forecasts for 2008 on Tuesday by $14 to $115 a barrel and by $29 to $120 a barrel, respectively.

	New Delhi, July 23: Emboldened by the trust vote victory, the government is planning to look afresh at insurance and pension reforms, consolidate some state-run banks and sell equity in select PSUs.         
	However, these moves will try to address some of the objections of the Left parties as the Congress-led coalition may be interested in an alliance with them after next years general elections.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram has indicated that the insurance amendment bill, pending in Parliament, will be back on the agenda, saying the Left objected only to a clause which sought to increase FDI in entities to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.         
	On other clauses, I do not think anyone has any serious objection, he said.        
	Top finance ministry officials said the draft would remove a restriction on stake sale by Indian promoters. They will now be permitted to dilute their holdings in the first 10 years of operations of their firms.         
	Since the insurance bill needs a majority for its passage in Parliament, the Congress needs to dispel the misgivings of some of its allies. Though the Samajwadi Party has said that it is willing to look afresh at the stalled insurance and pension bills, others such as the RJD may not be receptive to the provisions.        
	The draft also changes the definition of foreign companies to specifically permit Lloyds of London to enter India.         
	Lloyds has been unable to enter because it is not a company but a council set up by a separate act of the UK parliament.         
	Another change is the proposed opening up of the reinsurance sector, which is now restricted to just the state-run General Insurance Corporation.        
	The draft seeks to make the underwriting of third party motor insurance compulsory. Third party motor cover is the most unprofitable segment in non-life insurance.        
	Besides, the draft may remove obligations to do insurance work in rural areas and among the poor.        
	In pension, the government would push for capping foreign investment at 26 per cent and licence preference to funds guaranteeing fixed returns.         
	These moves are expected to satisfy the swadeshi lobby, which has in its ranks not only the BJP but also the RJD and the Samajwadi Party. The Left also conforms to this view.        
	The way we are designing pension reforms we can force private pension funds to give to subscribers the option of parking their savings in rock solid government securities as against risking them in the stock or debt markets, the officials said.         
	They said that the moves to push share sales in state-run companies would be handled with kid gloves as such moves are never popular in an election year. However, small public issues in PSUs such as Oil India, NHPC and Air India or in former PSUs such as Balco and Hindustan Zinc could come through.

	London/Hong Kong, Dec. 5 (Reuters): The US economy suffered its worst monthly job losses since 1974, data showed on Friday, underscoring the depth of the global financial crisis, which prompted a slew of interest rate cuts worldwide.        
	Payrolls were cut by 533,000  much worse than the forecast for a reduction of 340,000 jobs. Market reaction was immediate, with shares, oil and the dollar falling, and US treasury prices leaping.        
	This is an economy that is in absolute free-fall right now. Confidence has collapsed, said Nigel Gault, chief US economist at Global Insight.        
	Signs of tension marked two days of talks between China and the US. The Americans fretted that China might be losing the stomach to let its currency keep rising in value and Beijing voiced concern about Washingtons management of the worlds largest economy in which China has a huge financial stake.        
	US treasury secretary Henry Paulson described the talks as robust and characterised by straightforward back-and-forth exchanges.        
	At the end of the meeting, the governments agreed to make an extra $20 billion of credit available to finance US and Chinese exports to developing countries struggling to get access to trade credit.        
	With many developed countries either in recession or heading that way, central banks have cut interest rates close to the bone and attention is now starting to focus on what happens if they get to zero.

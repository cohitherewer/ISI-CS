	Calcutta, June 17: The Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is planning to float a subsidiary to tap the capital market. It intends to focus primarily on setting up power plants using super-critical technology for which it needs a strategic technology partner.         
	The DVC cannot come out with a public issue on its own as it was incorporated under a central act. However, we can tap the capital market through a subsidiary, said A.K. Burman, chairman, the DVC.         
	The corporation had earlier appointed consultant firm KPMG to advise it on the ways it can access the capital market. KPMG had submitted its report in which it categorically mentioned that the DVC could set up a subsidiary, which in turn could come out with a public issue. Our board of directors, at its meeting yesterday, has considered the KPMG report and has given an in-principle approval to the proposal, Burman said.         
	He, however, added that further details for setting up a subsidiary were being worked out. Well decide on the formation of the new company and areas of business it will engage into, Burman said. As for the new power projects during the Eleventh Five Year Plan, almost everything, including funding, equipment suppliers and order placements have been finalised. The subsidiary will take up projects that will come up in the Twelfth Five Year Plan, he added.        
	According to T. K. Gupta, director (accounts), DVC, there may be more than one subsidiary taking care of different business verticals such as operations and maintenance, project consultancy, project implementation and generation. We are examining all areas, he said. The DVC will primarily focus on setting up power projects using super-critical plants, each having a capacity of 500 MW or more. Well not go for sub-critical units unless it is geographically restrictive, Burman said.         
	The DVC has chalked out five projects, each having a generation capacity of 1,320 MW (2 X 660 MW), for the Twelfth Five Year Plan. These include Kodarma, Ramgarh, Panchet and Raghunathpur. Besides, we also have got proposals from Tata Power to set up a 2 X 550 MW power project at Maithon. The proposal is under consideration. There is another proposal for a super-critical unit, Burman added.

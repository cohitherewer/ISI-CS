The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude touches $102
                                                                                                               Crude touches $102
                            
	London, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Oil powered to a new record of above $102 a barrel today, closing in on its inflation-adjusted lifetime peak, as an ailing dollar on worsening US economic data triggered a surge across commodities markets.        
	The US crude stood 15 cents higher at $101.03 a barrel at 1300 GMT, off its new record high of $102.08 and its 1980 inflation-adjusted peak of $102.53. London Brent crude climbed 16 cents to $99.63 a barrel, after earlier hitting a record of $100.30.        
	The dollar slumped to an all-time low against the euro as well as a basket of major currencies after data from the US highlighted a gloomy outlook for the economy, raising the spectre of more rate cuts.        
	A weak dollar can trigger buying in commodities as investors seek to preserve their nominal value in other currencies. The price of oil has risen nearly 66 per cent in the past year in dollar terms, whereas in terms of euros, the rise has only been around 47 per cent.

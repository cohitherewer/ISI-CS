          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, May 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could soon convene a meeting to resolve the differences between the finance and petroleum ministries about the subsidy to state-owned oil marketing companies.        
	With the global price of crude oil touching $125 per barrel, oil companies are incurring heavy losses as the gap between the costs of acquiring crude and the lower price at which the companies sell petrol and diesel is increasing.         
	There are fears that the losses could derail the expansion and investment plans of the companies.        
	Singhs intervention looks inevitable as the finance ministry has turned down the petroleum ministrys request to cover 57 per cent of the losses suffered by oil retailers in the last fiscal through the issue of oil bonds. North Block prefers to stick to the present policy of covering 42 per cent of the losses through oil bonds.        
	The government also needs to look at other options to tide over the surge in global oil prices as it cannot increase fuel prices, which can have a negative political impact.        
	We have asked for 57.1 per cent oil bonds. And they (the finance ministry) are not ready for it. So we have requested the finance minister (P. Chidambaram) to issue as much as possible, petroleum minister Murli Deora said after the meeting with Chidambaram.        
	When asked about the deliberations at the meeting, Chidambaram declined to make any comment.        
	Sources said the finance ministry had not agreed to calculation of under- recoveries made by the petroleum ministry and has asked the latter to rework the losses.        
	Officials said banks, which mainly buy these bonds, were unwilling to purchase more bonds as they already have a high exposure to oil and fertiliser bonds.        
	Credit rating of banks also goes down if too much of funds are parked in these bonds, which are for a period of 25 years with an interest rate of around 8 per cent.        
	Sonal Varma, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said the global crude prices had touched new levels and was likely to increase the subsidy burden of the government.         
	The fiscal deficit is expected to go up to 3.5 per cent of the gross domestic product from the governments projection of 2.5 per cent, she said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BOOSTER DOSE                                  
	Mumbai, April 7: The Ranbaxy group appears to have set its sights on the Rs 952-crore Orchid Chemicals amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd.        
	Speculation about Ranbaxys intentions mounted on Monday after a firm controlled by Ranbaxy promoters picked up a little over 8 per cent in Orchid. Orchid Chemicals was in the news recently when a couple of lenders sold over 7 per cent of the promoters stake in the market.         
	In April 2007, the Orchid promoters had borrowed funds from Indiabulls Financial Services and Religare Enterprises to raise their stake in the company to 24 per cent from 17 per cent.        
	While the promoters had pledged shares with these lenders, these were sold after Orchids promoters failed to stump up the money to meet margin calls.         
	A margin call is issued when the value of securities that a borrower has pledged as collateral against a loan diminishes. The borrower can either come up with cash or securities to meet the demand.        
	The trigger for this development was the liquidation of Orchid Chemicals shares by Bear Stearns, the troubled US brokerage. When the lenders sold the shares, Orchid promoters stake fell to just over 16 per cent.        
	The share sale by Bear Stearns and later by Indiabulls and Religare sent the Orchid stock skidding on the bourses last month.         
	The stock has slumped from Rs 188 on March 16  the day before Bear Stearns sold the shares  to a low of Rs 111 on March 25.        
	It now transpires that privately-held Solrex Pharmaceuticals Company had bought 8.1 per cent of Orchid Chemicals, taking advantage of the low prices. Solrex is believed to be a partnership firm floated by the promoters of Ranbaxy.        
	Incidentally, the Orchid counter has been witnessing several block deals over the past few weeks. Solrex and a couple of foreign institutional investors have been purchasing the stock.        
	Solrex bought Orchid shares at prices ranging between Rs 161 and Rs 175 in transactions between March 31 and April 3.        
	The intention of the Ranbaxy promoters in buying the Orchid stock isnt known. The development led to a flare-up in the Orchid shares on the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, it ended 15.5 per cent higher at Rs 207.15.

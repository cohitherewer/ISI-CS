The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mutuals show little appetite for stocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mutuals show little appetite for stocks

	Calcutta, Oct. 28: In the glitter of Muhurat trading for Samvat 2065, one cannot ignore the worrying fact that mutual funds are hardly showing any appetite for equities and continue to be reluctant in investing their idle funds.        
	According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India, net inflow into equity schemes (including equity-linked tax saving schemes) till September this year was Rs 30,746 crore.        
	Against this, mutual funds bought equities worth Rs 13,340 crore till October 24 net of their selling during this period, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).         
	This means that mutual funds are sitting on Rs 17,406 crore of cash which is yet to be invested in the domestic stock markets.         
	Fund houses are not buying stocks even at such low levels for two reasons  first, they are anticipating redemption pressure on their equity schemes, and second, fund managers are waiting for lower valuations, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research Online, a New Delhi-based firm that tracks asset management frims.        
	According to Kumar, mutual funds are now sitting on a cash level of 10 per cent of their overall asset under management.         
	The idle cash component of equity mutual funds at present would be in the range of Rs 13,000 crore to Rs 14,000 crore. Most of the funds are invested to the tune of 90 per cent of their corpus under different equity schemes, he said.        
	However, Kumar said the apprehension of large-scale redemption in equity funds was looming large over fund houses because of the current mayhem in the stock markets.         
	Early this month, mutual funds witnessed huge redemption calls from institutional investors in short-term liquid and liquid plus schemes.         
	The redemption pressure then spread to fixed maturity plans of more than one year.         
	To curb this, fund houses had to sell assets held under those schemes at hefty discounts, put a limit on the daily redemption amount per investor and delay the payment period against a redemption call.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RPL offer to open on Jan 15
                                                                                                            RPL offer to open on Jan 15
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan.2: Reliance Power Ltd (RPL), which is coming out with the countrys largest-ever initial public offering (IPO), may fix a price band of Rs 405-450 per share.         
	At this price, the Anil Ambani group company may raise anywhere between Rs 10,530 crore and Rs 11,700 crore.         
	The issue will open on January 15 and close on January 18. RPL will issue around 260 million shares through the offering, and a discount of 5 per cent to the offer price may be given to retail investors.        
	Officials from RPL declined to comment on the price band.         
	Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had approved the IPO after absolving the company of charges made by an investor group.         
	The promoters of RPL were accused of making unjust gains through a process of mergers using several front companies.        
	The market regulator then stipulated that the promoters contribution to the offering or 20 per cent of the companys post-issue equity capital should be locked in for five years from the date of allotment.         
	Investment bankers associated with the issue include ABN AMRO, JP Morgan, UBS, Enam Securities, JM Financial, Kotak Mahindra Capital and ICICI Securities.        
	RPL is owned 50 per cent each by Reliance Energy Ltd and AAA Projects, a Anil Ambani group holding firm.         
	Earlier, rating agency Crisil had assigned an above average rating of 4/5 (four-on-five) to the public offering.        
	The agency said the grade showed that the fundamentals of the issue were above average compared with other listed equity securities in the country.        
	Strong demand for power will catalyse regulatory facilitation for private participation in the power sector over the medium to long term. In this scenario, early movers such as Reliance Power will benefit from attractive business opportunities that are likely to come about as a result, especially if they achieve high levels of financial capability, as is likely for Reliance Power after its proposed IPO, Crisil had said in a statement.        
	According to Crisil, the grading also reflected the groups commitment that RPL would be the sole repository of the groups economic interest in the power generation segment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation hits Tata projects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Inflation hits Tata projects
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 16: Tata Steel today said its new projects in India would face a cost overrun because of inflation. Indias largest private sector steel company plans to set up three plants in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.        
	H.M. Nerurkar, chief operating officer of Tata Steel, said the company had undertaken a study to assess the impact of inflation.        
	There will be a cost overrun. The study will tell us by how much, Nerurkar said on the sidelines of the Tata Metaliks annual general meeting in Calcutta today.        
	Tata Steels project cost will go up as all its projects are running behind schedule. It hopes to start construction of the 6-million-tonne plant in Orissa this month. No timeframe has been fixed for the other two projects.        
	For the Orissa project, the company has already placed orders for a section of the plant and machinery, guarding the company against escalating costs to some extent. However, the construction cost will increase because of the spike in steel and cement prices. Earlier, the company had estimated an investment of Rs 90,000 crore in the projects.         
	The Orissa plant is a year behind schedule as locals are yet to vacate part of the land where the plant is coming up. We are having some positive discussions. Hopefully, it will be resolved soon, Nerurkar said.        
	In Chhattisgarh, where Tata Steel plans to set up a 5-million-tonne plant, the company has got iron ore mine allocation but the land is yet to be acquired.         
	According to the original plan, the first phase of the Chhattisgarh project was to be commissioned by 2011 and the second phase by 2015.        
	In Jharkhand, there has been no progress as the state government is yet to come out with a rehabilitation and resettlement policy.

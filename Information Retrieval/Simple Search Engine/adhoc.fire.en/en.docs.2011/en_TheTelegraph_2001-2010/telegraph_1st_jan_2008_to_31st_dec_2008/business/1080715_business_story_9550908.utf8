	Calcutta, July 14: Calcutta-based IFGL Refractories has acquired Germanys Hofmann Group of Companies through a special purpose vehicle named IFGL GmbH for 7 million euros.         
	IFGL Refractories managing director Pradeep Bajoria said the German firm was engaged in the manufacture of ceramic special filters for foundries. Hofmann is a market leader in round-hole filters.         
	IFGL will now manufacture ceramic filters in India for the local market and export to China and other countries. Hofmann has two foundries, in Germany and the Czech Republic.         
	With the recent and earlier acquisitions, IFGL will have manufacturing units in India, China, Germany, the Czech Republic, the UK, the US and Brazil.         
	The Hofmann acquisition was funded by a loan from HSBC and internal accruals of Monocon International Refractories Ltd, a subsidiary of IFGL.         
	For the current fiscal, the combined turnover of IFGL and Hofmann will be Rs 550 crore. The group is expecting a 25 per cent increase in net profit of over Rs 28.5 crore in 2007-08.         
	With the acquisition of Hofmann, IFGL has stepped into the foundry sector and plans to start manufacturing filters for foundries in its Rourkela unit.

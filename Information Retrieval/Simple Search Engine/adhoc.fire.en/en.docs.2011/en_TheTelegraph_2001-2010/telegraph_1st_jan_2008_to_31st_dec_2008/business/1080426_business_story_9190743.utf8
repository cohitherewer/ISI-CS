          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A. Raja in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 25: The government today said the security issues related to BlackBerry services would be resolved within a couple of weeks.        
	The crux of the problem is being resolved. We are hopeful that in a couple of weeks it will be over, telecom minister A. Raja said.        
	There are about four lakh subscribers of BlackBerry services offered by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance and BPL Communications.        
	The government has been in talks with service providers and the manufacturer of BlackBerry  Research In Motion (RIM)  to find out a proper monitoring system for emails between two BlackBerry phones.        
	The services came under the scanner last year when an application by Tata Teleservices to launch the BlackBerry service was rejected over security concerns. The government fears that terrorist outfits may use it.         
	Asked whether RIM had agreed to place a server in India, Raja refused to divulge any details.        
	India has asked RIM, whose BlackBerry has over 12 million users globally, to route all Blackberry calls and emails through servers based in the country. The Canada-based firm has sought time till the end of the month to explain its position.

                                                                                                               Tele user base nears 300 million
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: India is poised to become the second largest telephony market in the world with a total subscriber base of over 300 million by next month, data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.        
	India had 250.93 million wireless users at the end of February, against 256 million in the United States and an estimated 540.5 million in China, Trai said.         
	With only a quarter of Indias more than a billion people having access to a phone now, the potential for growth is huge.        
	India has been adding 8-9 million wireless users a month, compared with Chinas 6-7 million and the United States 2-3 million, thanks to lower call rates and cheaper handsets, said Trai.        
	The regulator added that this fast-paced growth could take India to the second position in wireless network in the world after China in April, surpassing the US.        
	Total fixed-line and wireless subscribers should exceed 300 million by April from 290.11 million in February, Trai said.        
	In February, India added a total 8.49 million telephone connections compared with 8.74 million connections in January.         
	The total number of telephone connections reached 290.11 million at the end of February compared with 281.62 million in January, said Trai.        
	The overall tele-density has reached 25.31 per cent at the end of February against 24.63 per cent in January.

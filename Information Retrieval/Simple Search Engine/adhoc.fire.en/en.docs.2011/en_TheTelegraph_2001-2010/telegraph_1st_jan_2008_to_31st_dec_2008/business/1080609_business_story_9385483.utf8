	St Petersburg, Russia, June 8 (Reuters): The financial crisis in the West means the fastgrowing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China (Bric) will grow their share of the world economy even faster than was originally forecast, the founder of the four-nation BRIC concept said.        
	The term Bric was coined by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs to describe how the four economies are likely to rival and overtake many of the Wests leading economies over the next half century.        
	Jim Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who originated the term in 2003, said the financial crisis that began in the US mortgage security markets  the sub-prime meltdown  was allowing the Bric countries to take a bigger share of the world gross domestic product (GDP).        
	On a relative basis it definitely allows the Brics to develop faster as they are going to take an even bigger share of GDP sooner, Neill said.        
	This is a financial crisis of the West and we must not forget that a majority of the worlds six billion people is not affected by this.         
	I was in India four weeks ago and there were no signs of the country being affected by all of this, he said.        
	Neill said China, India and Russia were actually growing faster than originally predicted by his research.        
	Of the four Brics, Russia, China and India have all grown on average 2 per cent more than we suggested, he said. They are now collectively 16 per cent of global GDP so it is all happening a lot quicker.        
	The four Bric countries have been seeking to form a political club to convert their growing economic power into a greater geo-political clout.        
	Last month in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, the four sought to formalise their club at the first standalone meeting of BRIC foreign ministers.        
	I would hope that Western leaders take note of that meeting and accelerate the process of bringing them into the G8 (Group of Eight) club and the International Monetary Fund because the world doesnt want a separate club just looking after the growing countries in the same way as it doesnt need an old club looking after the declining  it needs a better club involving them both, Neill said. G8 comprises the US, the UK, Japan, France, Italy, Canada, Germany and Russia.        
	I think the lack of progress by the G8 and the Western leaders to change is really bad and is one of the biggest problems in the world today, he said.        
	Neill said the combined GDP of the Bric countries could overtake the combined economic might of the G7 (Group of Seven) . The G7 has all the G8 countries barring Russia.

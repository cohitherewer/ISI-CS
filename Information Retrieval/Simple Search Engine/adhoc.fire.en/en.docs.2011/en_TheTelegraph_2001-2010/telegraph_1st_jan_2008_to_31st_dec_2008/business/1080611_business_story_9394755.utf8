          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, June 10: Tata Steel today announced that there was more coal in its Mozambique mine than it had initially forecast.        
	In a regulatory notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the company said it hoped to produce 6 million tonnes (mt) of premium hard coking coal and an equal volume of thermal coal from the Benga Exploration Licence near Tete province in Mozambique, which is in Africa.        
	Tata Steel has a 35 per cent stake in the Benga project as well as offtake rights for 40 per cent of the coking coal produced. The stake was acquired last year.        
	The company had earlier said that the mine would have reserves of 1.2 billion tonnes, when it signed the agreement for a joint venture with Australias Riversdale Mining, the owner of the Benga licence, in 2007. This has been now raised by a good 58 per cent to 1.9 billion tonnes.        
	Out of this, over 1 billion tonne is less than 300 meters deep and likely to be recovered through an open cut mining process.        
	When Tata Steel entered the project, it was projected that 720 mt of coal production would be through the open cut process.        
	The development will bring significant economic benefit to Tata Steel since coking coal prices have shot up by 200 per cent this year.        
	The incremental volume will make Tata Steels investment of around Rs 350 crore ($88.2 million) very lucrative.        
	When the mine starts operations, Tata Steel plans to supply coking coal to Corus, the Anglo-Dutch firm which it bought in Indias largest ever acquisition in January last year.        
	Lack of a captive raw material source for coal and iron ore is a major weakness of Corus. The firm imports about 11 mt of coking coal every year.         
	Tata Steel today said the quality of coking coal was very good.        
	Since Benga will also produce a significant volume of thermal coal, used in power generation, the involvement of Tata Power at some stage cannot be ruled out.        
	It has been reported that the Tata group is considering a holding company for natural resources where Tata Steel and Tata Power will be the key promoters. Tata Power is actively looking for thermal coal assets abroad for its upcoming power plants. It has already acquired a large thermal coal asset in Indonesia.

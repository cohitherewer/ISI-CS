The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trai paper wakes up to virtual reality
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Trai paper wakes up to virtual reality

	New Delhi, May 5: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended the entry of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) though existing players have expressed doubt about the success of the model.        
	New telecom companies and foreign firms  who have licence but no spectrum  are eager to offer services through the MVNO route. However, existing operators argue that a model which allows a company to buy airtime in bulk and sell it to subscribers under its own brand may not be successful under the current tariff environment.        
	An MVNO offers mobile voice and data services without actually owning radiowave or network infrastructure such as telecom towers or transmission equipment.        
	The entry of MVNO could raise the level of competition by providing consumers with a wide choice of service providers, innovative value-added services and more competitive pricing plans, Trai chairman Nipendra Misra said in a consultation paper on MVNOs released today.         
	The market is mature enough to accommodate MVNOs ... we have got positive response from many players ... a final policy is likely to be in place in the next six months, added Trai officials.        
	However, a leading mobile player said, With usage charges in India being the lowest, the industry plays with low margins, which may not attract spectrum resellers.        
	One cannot expect the MVNO model to succeed in India at current tariffs, said Sunil Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises. Trai, however, said with average revenue per user falling every quarter, operators have to look for alternative sources to boost their revenues.         
	There are several value-added services such as booking and delivery of tickets that can be offered through a good distribution network available with an MVNO, said Misra.         
	The MVNO route should have been followed to create more competition and allow economy in the use of spectrum, said telecom analyst Mahesh Uppal.

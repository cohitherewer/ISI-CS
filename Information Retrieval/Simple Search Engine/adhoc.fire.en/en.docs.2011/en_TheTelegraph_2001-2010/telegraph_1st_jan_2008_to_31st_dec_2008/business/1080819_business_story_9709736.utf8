	Calcutta, Aug. 18: Banks are planning to increase their exposure to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by taking the private equity route.        
	The SME lending business has been growing at a compounded annual rate of more than 30 per cent in the last two to three years.        
	The State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank are planning to float private equity funds through special purpose vehicles by September this year catering primarily to SMEs.        
	While the SBI is planning to float a $125-million fund, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank are eyeing a $200-million and a $100-150 million fund, respectively.         
	SBI Capital Markets had earlier floated a $100-million private equity fund in joint venture with SoftBank Investments of Japan. However, this particular fund invests in companies of any size. The bank is now planning to launch another PE fund with a focus on SMEs, said Jayanta K. Sinha, chief general manager (Bengal circle) of the SBI.         
	Earlier, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said that the bank had sought Sebis approval to launch a PE fund by the end of this calendar year for SMEs. The largest public sector bank in the country is also scouting for local investors .         
	At ICICI Bank, we are planning to float a $200-million PE fund exclusively for small and medium companies, said Sanjiv Sherawat, head (business banking), ICICI Bank.         
	According to Varun Tuli, president (business banking) of Yes Bank, the private sector lender is contemplating a $100-million-plus fund for SMEs. We are talking to investors and the PE fund will be launched by next month, Tuli said.         
	Yes Bank has joined hands with Avigo Capital Partners, a private equity player, to float the fund. SMEs generally have a very high debt-equity ratio which restricts them from getting more loans from banks and financial institutions. But these enterprises need long-term capital during the growth phase. While private equity can improve borrowing capacity, this alternative risk capital has not been easily forthcoming to SMEs, particularly in the manufacturing sector, Tuli said.        
	However, there has been significant growth in private equity funds dedicated to SMEs in the past 12 months. Aeurous, Blue River, BTS India, Sidbi, Canventure (the private equity arm of Canara Bank) have come up with PE funds exclusively for SMEs.         
	The surge in PE funds for SMEs follows a proposal for the setting up of a separate stock exchange for the sector.

   - High rates blamed for slide           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The countrys economy grew 7.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2008-09, the slowest in three-and-a-half years. In the first quarter of 2007-08, the economy grew 9.2 per cent.         
	Analysts attribute the weak show to high interest rates. Industry grew 6.8 per cent, while farming and services grew 3 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Manufacturing grew 5.6 per cent in the first quarter (April-June), slightly slower than 5.8 per cent in the previous quarter.         
	We expected a dip in growth in the first quarter on account of the global slowdown and a contraction in money supply. I expect growth to pick up and to be around 8 per cent for the full year, commerce minister Kamal Nath said.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram also maintained that growth for the full year will be 8 per cent.         
	To check inflation, which has been in double digits since June, the Reserve Bank of India has been raising its benchmark overnight lending rate (repo) for banks, which now stands at a seven-year high of 9 per cent. The RBI has also raised the cash reserve ratio, or the amount of money that banks have to compulsorily keep with it, to 9 per cent.        
	Industry chambers such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Confederation of Indian Industry have been complaining about the tight money policy being followed by the RBI.         
	Rating agency Moodys was quite concerned over the pace of growth in manufacturing, which, it said, was extremely weak by historical standard.        
	It warned that Indias export and manufacturing outlook would remain cloudy until the US and European economies come out of the current downturn.         
	Earlier this week, Moodys said it expected the RBI to further tighten monetary policy to contain rising prices, while projecting moderation in economic growth to 7.6 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	Analysts warned that the slowdown not only impacted manufacturing but had also spread to services.         
	Growth in services, which accounts for a little more than half of the countrys income, has slowed down to 10 per cent from 11.2 per cent in the previous quarter.         
	Construction growth, for instance, weakened to 11.4 per cent from 12.6 per cent in the previous quarter.

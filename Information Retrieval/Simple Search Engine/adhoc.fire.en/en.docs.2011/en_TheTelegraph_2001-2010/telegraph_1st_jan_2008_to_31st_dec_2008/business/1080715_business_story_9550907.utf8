          SIMI KAMBOJ                           BIG PROBLEM                                  
	Mumbai, July 14: The ministry of information and broadcasting has slapped a showcause notice on Bharti Telemedia for violating eligibility guidelines in direct-to-home (DTH) services as well as flouting foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.         
	The notice is likely to impact Bharti Telemedias plans to launch nationwide DTH services this year. It had received the DTH licence last September.         
	Around 40 per cent of Bharti Telemedias shares are owned by Bharti Airtel, while the rest is owned by Bharti Enterprises.         
	According to norms laid down for a DTH licence, a cable network company cannot hold more than 20 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital of a DTH licensee company.        
	However, in this case, Bharti Airtel, which is a registered cable operator and has started providing IPTV (Internet protocol television) service on a trial basis, holds 40 per cent in Bharti Telemedia, the DTH licensee.         
	The company has also been pulled up for breaching the FDI threshold of 20 per cent as well as for failing to secure prior approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).        
	The collective indirect foreign direct investment in Bharti Telemedia is 21.64 per cent, while rules do not allow more than 20 per cent foreign equity, direct and indirect, in a DTH company.         
	The ministry says Bharti Telemedia doesnt have any FIPB approval for foreign investment coming on a pro-rata basis through the investing companies. It also asked Bharti Telemedia to clarify who the seven shareholders in Bharti Enterprises are and whether they are Indians, NRIs or foreigners.         
	Bharti Telemedia has been given 15 days to respond to the notice and furnish the necessary documents.         
	The ministry has also warned that the companys DTH licence will be kept suspended until a separate FIPB approval is sought for the pro-rata foreign investment in broadcasting activities.         
	A Bharti spokesperson refused to either confirm or deny the showcause notice.         
	He, however, said, We are in complete compliance of all necessary regulatory guidelines, including FDI and the foreign equity component, as laid down in DTH licence conditions and requirements.         
	All these particulars were duly submitted to the ministry of information and broadcasting and the licence was granted by the ministry after consideration of all the details, he said.

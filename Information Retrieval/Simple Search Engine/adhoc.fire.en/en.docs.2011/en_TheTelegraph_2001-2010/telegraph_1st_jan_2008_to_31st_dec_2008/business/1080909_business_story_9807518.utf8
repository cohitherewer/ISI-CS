          A STAFF REPORTER                          On growth track                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: City-based Stone India is looking at acquiring a European company to strengthen its portfolio of railway safety products.        
	Managing director Amitava Mondal said the company would be in a position to give out the details by the end of this month. The company specialises in the manufacture of equipment for the railways.        
	Athens-headquartered Dressner Bank has agreed to fund the buyout, which will give the GP Goenka group company access to superior technology to make railway safety products, Mondal said.        
	A special purpose vehicle will be set up in Cyprus or the Netherlands to buy the company, which is nearly thrice the size of Stone India.        
	Another group company will also be brought in as a partner for the takeover.         
	Stone India is also in the final stages of starting production at its factory at Nalagarh in Himachal Pradesh, where it will manufacture electronic equipment for the railways.        
	The Rs 25-crore facility will make end-of-train (EOT) telemeters to replace guard coaches.         
	Mondal said the telemeters were tested on Konkan Railway, which passes through 91 tunnels.         
	Stone India has also developed a new-generation pantograph, a device for collecting current from overhead wires, which was tested on East Coast Railway.         
	The pantograph will help Indian Railways to run trains at a much higher speed. It will also help the railways when it introduces double-decker trains and wagons, Mondal said.        
	In November last year, Stone India had inked a technical collaboration agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries of Japan to manufacture air springs for rail coaches.

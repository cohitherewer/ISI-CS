          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today raised the pitch for a review of export-oriented unit (EOU) status given to Reliance Industries Jamnagar refinery.        
	The demand comes ahead of a crucial co-ordination committee meeting between the ruling UPA and the Samajwadi Party on Tuesday. The domestic refinery was overnight converted into a special economic zone by a designated authority. The government is short of revenue, but it is raising money through bonds while giving tax advantages to others, he told reporters after his meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram here today.        
	Singh said he would take up the issue of giving special status to Reliance, promoted by Mukesh Ambani, at the October 14 meeting. The Samajwati Party helped the ruling UPA stay in power after the Left withdrew support in July.        
	Singh said he was not batting for Anil Ambani, the younger brother of Mukesh.         
	According to oil ministry officials, Reliance Industries will start its 580,000-barrels-per-day refinery at Jamnagar by the end of November, well within the December deadline set by the firm.

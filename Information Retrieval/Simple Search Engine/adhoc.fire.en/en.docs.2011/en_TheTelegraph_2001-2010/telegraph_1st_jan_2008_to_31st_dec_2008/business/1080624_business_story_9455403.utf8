The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citigroup to slash jobs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citigroup to slash jobs
                              RIPPLE EFFECT                            
	New York, June 23 (PTI): Citigroup, led by India-born Vikram Pandit, is in for an aggressive round of layoffs beginning with the firing of about 6,500 employees from its investment banking business, media reports said.        
	After posting a loss amounting to $15 billion in the past two quarters and expecting to see billions of dollars of sub-prime crisis related write-downs, Citigroup will dismiss 10 per cent of its 65,000-strong investment banking workforce this week, the Wall Street Journal reported.        
	Quoting unnamed people familiar with the matter, the report said the pink slips are likely to be handed out on Monday.         
	The latest round of layoffs follows 10,000 job cuts earlier this year, as part of Pandits aim to trim the companys annual expenses by $15 billion. The company has more than 3,50,000 employees on its payrolls across the world.        
	In another report, The Times quoted unnamed sources as saying that even senior managing directors would not be immune from the layoffs.        
	Citgroups mergers and acquisitions bankers may bear the brunt of the cost- cutting because their ranks were not sharply reduced earlier this year. No major department of the investment bank is likely to be spared, apart from certain businesses in emerging markets and its lucrative transactions services division, The Times report said.        
	Entire trading desks in New York and other cities are expected to be eliminated, the Wall Street Journal quoted the people close to the matter as saying. And unlike Citigroups other recent reductions, this round will feature layoffs of dozens of senior managing directors, the journal stated.        
	In April, Citigroup said 9,000 jobs would go on top of the 21,000 eliminated in the past year.

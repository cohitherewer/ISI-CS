The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal pledges coal block to Videocon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bengal pledges coal block to Videocon
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 18: The Bengal government has promised to give the Nachan thermal coal block to Videocon Industries.        
	In a recent communication to Videocon, the West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation (WBMDTC) said the coal block in Burdwan district had been identified for the company. The block contains estimated reserves of 400 million tonnes.         
	The allotment of the block will remove the final hurdle to the companys 6-million-tonne (mt) steel plant project in the state.        
	Videocon had signed an agreement with the WBMDTC and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation last year for the Rs 25,000-crore project at Jamuria, Burdwan        
	In the first phase, Videocon plans to set up a 3mt steel plant and a 1,200MW power plant. In the second phase, a 3mt steel unit and a 400MW power facility will be added.        
	However, the Centre is yet to allot the block to the WBMDTC. The Centre will give the Nachan block under the state dispensation route. Thus, other state government agencies may also be in the fray.        
	The Centre may decide on the block in the next two months. However, once the WBMDTC gets the block, it will certainly be handed over to Videocon.         
	The company is cautiously upbeat on the communication from the state government. The future of the project looks brighter now, sources close to the development said.        
	Once the WBMDTC gets control of Nachan, Videocon will speed up the land acquisition process. The company has decided to offer jobs, shares and cash as compensation to the land losers.

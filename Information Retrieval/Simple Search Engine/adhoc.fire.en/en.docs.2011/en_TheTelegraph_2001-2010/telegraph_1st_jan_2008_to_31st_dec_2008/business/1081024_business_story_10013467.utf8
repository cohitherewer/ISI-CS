The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Asarco dumps Sterlite 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asarco dumps Sterlite 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: Sterlite Industries deal to acquire Asarco is off.        
	The US copper miner has scrapped the deal after the Indian company expressed a desire to renegotiate the terms of the acquisition. A meltdown in metal prices and the global credit crisis were behind Sterlites move.        
	In May, Sterlite, which is part of non-ferrous metal major Vedanta Resources, had put in a $2.6-billion bid for the assets of bankrupt Asarco.        
	Though Asarcos parent Grupo Mexico challenged the acquisition, Sterlite made significant headway and received the support of trade unions and local politicians. Asarco is based in Tucson, which is in the southwestern US state of Arizona.        
	However, the global financial crisis and the slump in copper prices seem to have seriously handicapped Sterlites ability to close the deal.        
	Earlier this month, Asarco had disclosed before a US bankruptcy court that Anil Agarwals Sterlite had indicated that it cannot and will not close the transaction under the existing terms and sought a reduction in the sale price of $2.6 billion.        
	The US company did not agree with Sterlite and scrapped the deal yesterday.        
	According to analysts, the steady reduction in copper prices in the international market has prompted Sterlite to review the deal.        
	When Sterlite and Asarco reached an agreement on the acquisition in end-May, copper prices were around $8,000 per tonne.        
	It touched an all-time high of $9,000 per tonne in June before sliding to $4,284 per tonne today, a correction of close to 50 per cent.        
	No response was available from Sterlite. But sources close to the development said the Indian company could still look at a fresh agreement at a lower price and that discussions were still on.        
	Sterlite does not want a deal at $2.6 billion. But a new deal can be possible at a lower price, they said.        
	According to Asarco, Sterlite has informed the US miner that the ongoing financial crisis has affected the Indian companys ability to raise funds for existing operations, capital expansion and acquisitions.        
	Sterlite, therefore, is giving priority to existing operations and capital expansion, Asarco told the bankruptcy court.        
	The crisis had recently forced Sterlite parent Vedanta to drop its giant reorganisation plan.

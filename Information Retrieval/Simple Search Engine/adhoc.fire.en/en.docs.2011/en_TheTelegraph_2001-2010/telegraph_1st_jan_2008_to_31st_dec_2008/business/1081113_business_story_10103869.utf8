	 Mumbai, Nov. 12: The rupee collapsed against the dollar by 119 paise, its biggest single-day fall in 12 years, amid a stronger dollar in overseas markets, fall in crude prices and continuing weakness in stock markets across Asia. The rupee ended the day at 49.31, a fall of 2.47 per cent over its previous close. Dealers in foreign exchange said the decline in excise and customs duty collections in October weighed heavily against the local unit because of the scarce availability of the dollar.

	 New Delhi, Nov. 12: Officers of public sector oil companies have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from November 18 if their demand for wage revision is not accepted by the government.

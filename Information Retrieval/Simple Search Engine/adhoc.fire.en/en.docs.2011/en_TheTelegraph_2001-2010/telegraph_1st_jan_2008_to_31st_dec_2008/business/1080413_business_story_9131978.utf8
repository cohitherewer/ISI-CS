	Washington, April 12 (PTI): Describing the soaring inflation in India as a politically hot issue, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today asked the Indian government to take immediate steps to arrest prices before the problem became entrenched and spilled over.        
	Referring to the recent IMF reports on global and regional economy, which said inflation was on the higher side and required immediate attention, senior adviser in the IMF Asia and Pacific department Kalpana Kochhar said, At 7.5 per cent, it may not seem very high but politically it is a hot issue.        
	Kochhar said, It was mainly because of food, fuel and some metals. Activities have come off a fast pace but are still pretty strong.         
	The annual rate of inflation, which was below 4 per cent in January, soared to 7.41 per cent towards the end of March and is expected to move up further before beginning to cool down.         
	Rising prices forced the government to take a host of steps, including banning export of non-basmati rice, pulses, edible oil and cement to contain inflation.

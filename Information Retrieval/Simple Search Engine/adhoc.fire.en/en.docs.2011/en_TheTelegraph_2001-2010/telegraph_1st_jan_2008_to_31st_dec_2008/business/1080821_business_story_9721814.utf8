          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                          Siganporia: Action time                                   
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: Tata Tea managing director Percy Siganporia is all set to head the global operations of the beverage major.        
	According to sources, Siganporia will be shifting base to Mumbai. I would not like to comment, Siganporia said when asked about the development.        
	The move is in line with Tata Teas ambition of expanding its global footprint.        
	In 2007-08, the companys consolidated turnover from the US and Canadian markets grew to Rs 1,338.30 crore from Rs 1,172.21 crore in 2006-07.        
	The growth in these markets was significant as Tata Tea had earlier said it was planning to launch a brand in the US and looking at acquisitions.        
	The UK, however, continues to be the biggest revenue earner for the company, with a turnover of Rs 1,390.19 crore in 2007-08 compared with Rs 1,326.72 crore in the previous fiscal.        
	In his new role, Siganporia is expected to head the operations in emerging markets such as Russia, China and eastern Europe.        
	The acquisition of Polish tea brands Vitax and Flosana, from Premium Foods SA, and Czech-based tea company Jemca has strengthened Tata Teas presence on the global map.        
	Under Siganporias leadership, the company signed a joint venture agreement with Chinas Zhejiang Tea Import amp; Export to manufacture and market green tea polyphenols, green tea extracts, cold and hot water soluble instant tea, liquid tea concentrates and other value-added beverage products.

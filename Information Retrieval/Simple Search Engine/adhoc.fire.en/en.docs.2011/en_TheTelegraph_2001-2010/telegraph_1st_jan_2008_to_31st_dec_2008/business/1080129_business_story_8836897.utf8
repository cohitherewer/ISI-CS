                                                                                                            Junior Mittals step on the gas
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Pramod Mittal (top) and Vinod Mittal: New vistas                                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: Following in the footsteps of brother Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, Pramod Kumar and Vinod Kumar Mittal have entered the oil and gas business.        
	Global Oil amp; Energy Ltd (GOEL), a company owned by PK-VK Mittal, has acquired two oil and gas blocks in Georgia.        
	GOEL is a subsidiary of Global Steel Holdings Ltd, the promoter of domestic steel major Ispat.         
	It owns 14 million tonnes of steel capacity across six countries.        
	PK-VKs oil and gas foray comes two and a half years after L.N. Mittal made a surprise entry into this sector in partnership with ONGC.         
	The elder brother then went on to set up a joint venture with state-run HPCL for two refineries in India.        
	While Mittal senior invested in oil and gas from his personal wealth and not through ArcelorMittal, PK-VKs move was made by the subsidiary of Global Steel.        
	PK-VK said the move was aimed at becoming a major player in natural resources with emphasis on minerals and raw materials for steel making and energy sectors.        
	The company said it was looking for other oil and gas assets, both in exploration and production and in the downstream sector.        
	One of the two blocks GOEL acquired in the east European country has produced oil. It is located in Guria/Adjara areas in western Georgia, about 300-350 km from Tbilisi, the capital of the country.        
	It is bounded on three sides by land and on the west by the Black Sea.         
	There are two production fields in this block and seven potential structures with a reserve of about 350 million barrels of oil.        
	GOEL has restarted work there and plans to ramp up production to 5,000 barrels a day three years from now.         
	The exploration block covers an area of 4,760 sq km and has 11 prospects with an estimated reserve of 220 million barrels of oil.

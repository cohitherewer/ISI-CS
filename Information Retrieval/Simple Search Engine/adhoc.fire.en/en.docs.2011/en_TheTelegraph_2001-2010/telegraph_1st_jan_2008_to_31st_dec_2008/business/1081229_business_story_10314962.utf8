	New Delhi, Dec. 28 (PTI): UTI Asset Management Company is likely to offload a 26 per cent stake to a strategic partner in the next three months.        
	The negotiation is at an advanced stage and the deal is expected to be closed by February or early March, sources close to the development said.        
	Japan-based Shinsei, with which the fund house has a tie-up with regard to global fund management, is being actively considered to be the strategic partner, sources said.        
	Other US and European players, including American Vanguard Mutual Fund, have also shown interest in picking up a stake in the mutual fund house.        
	Last month, UTI Mutual Fund moved ahead of ICICI Prudential to become the third largest fund house in the country, on the back of its increasing asset under management at a time when assets of the industry shrunk seven per cent.        
	It has increased its market share to 9.54 per cent against 8.86 per cent in October. The share is expected to cross double digit in December as UTI has raised Rs 300 crore from a new offer  UTI Wealth Builder Fund.        
	According to market analysts, UTI could command good valuations because of robust fundamentals and a strong pan-India presence.        
	UTI Mutual Fund is promoted by four sponsors  the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Life Insurance Corporation  each holding 25 per cent.

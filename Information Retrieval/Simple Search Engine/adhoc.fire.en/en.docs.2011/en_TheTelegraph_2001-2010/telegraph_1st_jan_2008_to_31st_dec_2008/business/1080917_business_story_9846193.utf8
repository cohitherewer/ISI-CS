	Sept. 16: Central banks across the world pumped emergency funds into world financial markets for the second day today in an effort to contain the fallout from the crisis sweeping Wall Streets biggest firms.        
	The injection of hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets to stop them freezing up failed to prevent a surge in the cost of borrowing between banks.        
	Stocks worldwide extended their slide  the Bombay Stock Exchange, however, bucked the trend  with Europes FTSEurofirst index hitting a three-year low at one stage as investors fretted over events on Wall Street.        
	Adding to the woes was Goldman Sachs, which today said its third-quarter earnings had fallen 70 per cent. Net revenue of Goldman, the largest US investment bank, fell by half to $6.04 billion from $12.3 billion.         
	In a late night development, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) held US interest rate steady, opting to soothe rattled financial markets with central bank lending and saying it was worried both about economic weakness and price pressures.        
	The Feds unanimous decision leaves the interbank overnight federal funds rate at 2 per cent, where it has been since April. It said downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern, surprising many in financial markets who had expected the central bank to signal greater worries on growth.        
	Investors had begun to speculate this week that the central bank would lower rates in the wake of the bankruptcy of 158-year-old Lehman Brothers, the sale of investment bank Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and a scramble for cash by insurer American International Group.        
	US stocks dropped and the value of the dollar rose, while prices for US government bonds held steady after the central banks decision.        
	Earlier in the day, the Fed pumped $50 billion into the markets following up on the $70 billion it provided on Monday, and said it was ready to do more. The European Central Bank injected 70 billion euros on Tuesday, after 30 billion euros the day before.        
	Stock markets tanked on apprehensions that deepening credit crisis in the US would have a broader impact on the world economy.        
	Indian stock markets, however, showed remarkable resilience, with the sensex closing flat after recovering the hefty losses in morning trade following a surprise buying in banking stocks.        
	The sensex had nosedived to 13051.73 points, a fall of hefty 480 points, before recovering handsomely to end the day at 13518.80 points, just 12.47 points off its previous close. The State Bank of India notched up a smart gain of 6.49 per cent to emerge as the biggest gainer in the sensex group.

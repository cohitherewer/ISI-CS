	Mumbai, March 5: Max New York Life Insurance today launched its health insurance plans under the Lifeline moniker.        
	Lifeline will offer a long-term (10 years and above) insurance cover based on the policyholders needs under three distinct categories  Medicash, Wellness, and Safety Net.        
	The minimum annual premium for all policies has been fixed at Rs 2,500, with the maximum age of maturity set at 65 years for Medicash and 75 years for the other two.         
	We are excited to be able to offer health insurance products that actually respond to consumers needs. With the growing incidence of diseases due to lifestyle changes, health insurance is one of the primary protection needs for all the members of the family, quot; said Max New York Life Insurance managing director and CEO, Gary Bennett.         
	The Medicash plans are hospital cash products that will offer fixed lump sum benefits every day to the insured during the period of hospitalisation but irrespective of actual medical bills.        
	The Wellness plans will provide cover against 38 critical ailments, which include cancer, heart ailments and Alzheimers disease.         
	The plan allows the insured to receive the insurance benefits only after 180 days of the purchase of the policy, with the premium varying according to the age of entry, and the claim amounts varying according to the nature of the ailment.         
	The Safety Net is a term plus health protection plan, offering the insured cover against losses arising from critical illness, accident, disability and death.         
	The entry and exit age limits are similar to the Wellness plans, but with a maximum sum assured limit of Rs 40 lakh.

	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Congress-led government could earn up to Rs 25,000 crore by divesting small lots of shares in state-run companies in the coming financial year. 
    
	If the selloff at all happens, it would be the first after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was forced to put a stop to several highly publicised stake sales two years back. 
    
	Officials said the government was looking at selling small stakes in a large number of state entities through initial public offerings (IPOs). The money raised will go to the National Investment Fund, which will use it to revive sick public sector units and for other development projects.
    
	Besides the mega flotation of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, the official said the government would come out with IPOs for National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited, Air India and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited. If the go ahead comes for all the issues that we are talking about, at current market valuations we could earn up to Rs 25,000 crore, said the officials.
    
	While the bulk of the money would come from the BSNL issue, the NHPC issue was expected to rake in about Rs 3,000 crore. 
    
	The governments plan to cash in on the stock market boom through divestments had run into rough weather with the Left and key allies such as the DMK opposing the exercise
    
	Stake sales in Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited, National Aluminium Company Limited, Power Finance Corporation Limited, Tungabhadra Steel Products Limited and NMDC Ltd were halted in July 2006 after the Prime Minister bowed to pressure from the allies. 
    
	However, the finance ministry has been continuously advocating small stake sales in PSUs as this was the only way to realise big-ticket social welfare projects. 
    
	According to the officials, These stake sales or even the issue of fresh equity help unlock the real value of the firms. These firms also become more accountable once they have to perform under the scrutiny of the market.

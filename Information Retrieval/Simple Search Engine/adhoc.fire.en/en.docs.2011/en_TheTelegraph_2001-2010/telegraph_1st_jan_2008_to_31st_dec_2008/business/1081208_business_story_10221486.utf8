The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ticket sellers take aim at Kingfisher, Air India
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ticket sellers take aim at Kingfisher, Air India
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                                              HIT TURBULENCE      
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: After Jet Airways, travel agents may soon stop selling tickets of Kingfisher and Air India.         
	It is a strategic move to withdraw our support rendered to Jet Airways and (subsidiary) JetLite. We will ask Kingfisher and Air India to resume our commission structure, else we will stop selling their tickets, too, Rajinder Rai, president, the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), told The Telegraph.        
	Many agents earn their bread from selling the tickets of these three airlines. The idea behind not withdrawing support at once from all the three airlines is to help agents sustain their earnings, he said.        
	In its meeting held on November 20, members of the TAAI and other agents associations had decided to withdraw support to Kingfisher Airlines. However, they resumed selling tickets from December 1.        
	Last week, six associations  Travel Agents Federation of India, Travel Agents Association of India, IATA Agents Association of India, Indian Association of Tour Operators, Association of Domestic Tour Operators in India and Enterprising Travel Association of India  decided to not sell tickets of Jet from December 4.         
	The decision was made to compel the airline to pay them five per cent commission, which was withdrawn from November 1. Web portals such as Makemytrip, Cleartrip, Yatra and Ezeego are also not selling Jet tickets.        
	Passengers keen on Jet will have to buy tickets either from the airlines sales offices or from the website of the company.        
	From last month, Air India and Kingfisher had also stopped paying commission fees.         
	The moves made by these airlines have forced travel agents to stop charging transaction fees from customers.        
	How do we continue to charge any fee from our customer if the airlines have withdrawn? Though the customers come to us for our value-added services, at the end, total cost to passenger is the most important factor, said Praveen Chugh, managing director, TSI Travels.        
	New system        
	Travel agents are formulating a system of common profit regime to generate income, if the airlines finally decide not to resume commissions.        
	We are thinking of getting an expert who will help us formulate a way of uniformly charging passengers. We want to take advice on the fee structure adopted by agents of other countries in such a situation, said Rai.        
	Tourist trend        
	India received 5 million visitors in 2007 and is estimated to get 10 million by 2010.         
	Industry forecast for the current tourist season is gloomy.         
	Growth in foreign tourist arrivals could be down by half to 7.8 per cent, if Indias economic growth falls to 7 per cent and global growth comes down to 3.2 per cent.        
	Tourist arrivals grew at an impressive 13-14 per cent last year.

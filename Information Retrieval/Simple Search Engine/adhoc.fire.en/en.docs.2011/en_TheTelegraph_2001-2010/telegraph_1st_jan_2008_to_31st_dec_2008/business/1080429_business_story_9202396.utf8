          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Khorakiwala: Standing tall		    
	Mumbai, April 28: A mark-to-market loss of Rs 27.9 crore on derivatives has led Wockhardt Ltd to report a 23 per cent fall in net profits for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008. Net profit of the company fell to Rs 50.9 crore from Rs 66.3 crore in the same period last year.         
	The stock was hammered on the bourses and fell 2.4 per cent to Rs 297.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The company has entered into hedging instruments, which are long term in nature to reduce the interest cost for the loans, which the company had taken in the past and is outstanding as of March 31, 2008. According to the risk management policy, the company is hedging the interest for 50 per cent of the long-term loans. The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The same has been treated as an extraordinary item, Wockhardt said in a statement.        
	Consolidated sales revenue rose 50.3 per cent to Rs 785.7 crore for the quarter.        
	According to Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala, the acquisition of Negma Laboratories in France and Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals in the US has enabled the company to increase its operating profit by 50 per cent and maintain a margin of 22 per cent.        
	Europe continues to be Wockhardts single largest market accounting for 54 per cent of its consolidated sales.

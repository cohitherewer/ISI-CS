The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AIG comes out with gold fund for investors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AIG comes out with gold fund for investors
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Sunil Mehta in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, April 7: AIG Investments today launched the AIG World Gold Fund. This will be the second equity-oriented gold fund for the industry after DSP Merrill Lynchs offering.        
	The open-ended scheme will invest through an international fund in companies engaged in extracting, processing and marketing the yellow metal.         
	The asset allocation strategy of AIG World Gold Fund is similar to DSP Merrill Lynchs World Gold Fund, which has surprised with returns of 41.44 per cent since its launch in August 2007.         
	AIG World Gold Fund hopes to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in the units of the $300-million AIG PB Equity Fund. The new fund offer will be open between April 15 and May 14.         
	The yellow metal has caught the fancy of many investors as gold prices are heading northwards amid choppy equity markets worldwide.         
	After touching a high of about $1,033 an ounce, gold prices recently came down in the range of $850-$950 per ounce. Many market analysts see this as a great time to invest in gold.        
	The recent fall in gold prices will provide an opportunity for investing in the metal. Keeping in mind the strong fundamentals of gold as an asset class, this fund will be an ideal supplement for our existing range of investment products, Sunil Mehta, country head and chief executive of AIG India, said.         
	The shares of gold mining companies are undervalued compared with gold prices and this provides a lot of headroom for long-term appreciation. When gold prices rise, the profitability of companies tends to increase more than proportionately, company officials said.        
	The international gold fund of AIG has posted returns at over 50 per cent over the past year.

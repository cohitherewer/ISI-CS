          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said Indian banks were largely insulated from the US financial crisis that singed investment banking giants Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, and insurer AIG.        
	He said AIGs ventures in India with the Tatas were on a sound footing, adding that the Indian group had assured the insurance regulator that all payment obligations would be met.        
	His statements brought life into the stock markets, where the sensex had slumped 705 points in early trading as investors turned panicky witnessing the events in the US. The Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether ended the day with a gain of 52.70 points at 13315.60. The rupee moved in tandem with stocks, though it closed lower by seven paise at 46.42 against the dollar.         
	In his first reaction to the crisis in the US financial markets, Chidambaram said banks didnt have any undue exposure and whatever exposure they have were in accordance with the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) guidelines. Although ICICI Bank had some exposure, it had made disclosures.         
	There is no cause for any alarm that any Indian bank is exposed. There is no apprehension at all. All our banks have strong balance sheets. And the RBI is fully on top of the situation. He said there could be some credit squeeze, which would be addressed.         
	The government expects the economy to grow by 8 per cent, and there will be no impact on financial sector reforms.        
	Tata AIG Life, the life insurance joint venture between the Tata group and AIG, today said that it was well-capitalised and continued to operate in the normal course.        
	As the US goes through some challenging times, we wish to assure you that this does not have any immediate material impact on Tata AIG Life, an AIG release said.

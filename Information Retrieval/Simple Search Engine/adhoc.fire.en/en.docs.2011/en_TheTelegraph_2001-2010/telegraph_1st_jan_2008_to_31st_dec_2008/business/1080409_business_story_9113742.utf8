          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 8: Sleuths from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today raided the offices of the Hiranandani group, one of the largest realty players in Mumbai, and claimed to have unearthed evidence that the group had defaulted on provident fund payments to the extent of Rs 168 crore.        
	This is being touted as one of largest provident fund defaults in the country.        
	The CBI team raided five premises belonging to the group after receiving complaints that the Hiranandani group was showing fewer people on its payrolls. Sources in the realty industry said this was a common practice.         
	Some people are just given cash payments and not included in the payrolls of the company. This is a common practice among realty firms, said a consultant.        
	The CBI claimed that they had credible information that the Hiranandini group had tampered with the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) documents.        
	The CBI also carried out raids at the residences of four officers of the Employees Provident Fund to unearth further evidence.        
	We will have to wait till the inquiry is concluded. At this point, I dont think we are in a position to comment at all or make any statement, said Mukesh Patel of the Neelkanth Group.        
	This has nothing to do with the real estate sector as such. It is only incidental that the Hiranandanis are a real estate company, said an industry consultant.        
	Others, however, claimed that the real estate firms were more transparent now than they had ever been, especially after a number of them have listed on the bourses.        
	The Hiranandanis are well known for corporate governance practices. There is a greater transparency now as more and more real estate companies are listed, said a realty analyst.

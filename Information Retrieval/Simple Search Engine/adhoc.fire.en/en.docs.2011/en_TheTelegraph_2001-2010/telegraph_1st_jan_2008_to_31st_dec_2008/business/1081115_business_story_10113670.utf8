                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Orient offers fresh equity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 14: Orient-Express  the Bermuda-based luxury hotel chain that has doggedly fought off a posse of shareholders, including the Tatas, over its poor corporate governance structure  stunned the markets today by offering another 8.49 million Class A shares at a price of $6.50 per share.        
	The stock had closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $8.33 on Thursday.         
	The flotation will raise the number of Class A shares issued by the company by about 20 per cent to 50.95 million shares.        
	Back in December, the Tatas  who had proposed an alliance with Orient-Express and were rudely fobbed off  had paid as much as $60 per Class A share.         
	The Tatas have been accumulating stock in Orient-Express since August 2007 and today hold 11.5 per cent of the Class A shares, which gives them a voting right of just 2.2 per cent.        
	Orient-Express  which owns Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg and the 21 Club restaurant in New York  has been desperately short of cash as the economic turmoil forces people to abandon holidays and leisure travel.         
	Last week, the company came out with its quarterly results in which it said its room occupancy levels worldwide had dipped to 60 per cent in the quarter ended September 30 from 64 per cent a year ago.         
	The fall was sharper in North America where it had fallen to 54 per cent from 63 per cent last year.        
	The hotel chain plans to use the expected proceeds of $52.72 million (after paying off issue expenses) to reduce debt, invest in properties and as working capital.         
	The issue of fresh shares will dilute the Tatas stake in the company unless they choose to buy fresh stock at lower prices and pare their acquisition costs.        
	We currently anticipate that the closing of the sale of the Class A common shares will take place on or about November 19, 2008, the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.        
	In an earlier filing during the day, the hotel giant said it planned to offer to the public from time to time in one or more series or issuances four types of securities: Class A common shares, preferred shares, warrants to purchase Class A common shares, and debt securities.        
	The Tata-owned Indian Hotels Company, Dubai Holdings and two large hedge funds owned by David Shaw and Steven Cohen have been locked in a battle with the luxury hotel chain to scrap an overbearing, super voting stock that the Orient management has used to beat off predators and muzzle shareholders demand for greater accountability. The management holds over 18 million of the Class B shares and has 81 per cent of the combined voting rights conferred by the two classes of shares.        
	Orient appears to be creating a new sub-strata of securities with plans to offer junior participating preferred shares that will be attached to and transferable only with the Class A common shares.        
	The preferred shares may carry voting rights and some pre-emptive rights, while the warrant may have some anti-dilution provisions, the statement said.        
	In early October, Shaw and Cohen had tried to force a change in the corporate governance structure at Orient Hotels by moving special resolutions seeking to scrap the super voting Class B stock. The resolutions were defeated because the management had over 80 per cent of the voting rights through Class B stock.

	Chennai, July 12: The domestic IT industry, which has been clocking an impressive growth rate in recent years, is likely to see a slowdown in the next fiscal because of competition from China, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, industry body Nasscom said.        
	Competition along with economic uncertainty and lesser IT spends by the US can pull down the growth rate to 6 per cent, Nasscom president Som Mittal said.         
	A recent survey by Nasscom revealed the industry grew 28 to 29 per cent in the last few years but our forecast is that it will go down to 22 to 24 per cent, he said while releasing the survey earlier this week.        
	However, it will not have any impact on the long-term prospects of the sector, which is set to cross the $60-billion mark this year, the survey said.        
	According to the survey titled FY08 Revenue Performance and FY09 Forecast for the Indian IT Software and Services Sector, the Indian IT-BPO industry, including domestic companies, recorded an overall growth of 28 per cent, clocking revenues of $52 billion in 2007-08, up from $39.6 billion in 2006-07. The software and services exports segment grew 29 per cent to register revenues of $40.4 billion in 2007-08, up from $31.4 billion in 2006-07.         
	The domestic segment rose 26 per cent to report revenues of $11.6 billion in 20007-08.         
	Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro Technologies, Satyam Computer Services and HCL Technologies were among the top ten software and service exporters during 2007-08.         
	Within the export segment, revenues from IT services exports grew 28 per cent to $23.1 billion, while BPO exports were up 30 per cent at $10.9 billion.

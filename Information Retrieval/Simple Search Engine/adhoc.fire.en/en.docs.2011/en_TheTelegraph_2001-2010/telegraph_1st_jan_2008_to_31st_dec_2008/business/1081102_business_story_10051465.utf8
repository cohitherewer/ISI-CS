The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel prices start melting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel prices start melting

	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Steel prices are set to fall by Rs 4,000-6,000 a tonne.         
	According to officials, Steel Authority of India effected a price cut today while sources in Tata Steel confirmed that the company would take a similar step soon. Ispat and JSW Steel will also be offering similar discounts.         
	The softening of prices in the international market and a drop in domestic demand have forced steel makers to take this decision.        
	The price cut is expected to have a soothing effect on inflation.        
	At present, hot-rolled coils cost around Rs 37,000 per tonne. After the latest revision, the price will come down to about Rs 33,000 a tonne compared with the average price of around $650-680 a tonne in the global markets.         
	Tata Steel had earlier said prices could fall by more than 10 per cent in the October-December quarter because of the global economic slowdown and the scaling down of requirements by steel users.         
	The margins of steel makers have been under pressure because of high input costs. The recent drop in demand because of the economic slump has added to their woes.        
	In a major fillip for steel, the government yesterday withdrew the 15 per cent export duty on certain products such as pig iron, steel ingots, bars and rods. These duties were imposed in May to increase the availability of steel in the domestic market and check rising prices.         
	Earlier, the steel industry had sought a 15 per cent import duty and in return pledged not to increase the prices for the next six months.         
	Producers also wanted the government to scrap the 15 per cent export duty on long steel products and levy a countervailing duty.         
	In May, local steel units had agreed to roll back prices by Rs 4,000 a tonne and hold the price line for three months.

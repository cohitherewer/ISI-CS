          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ratan Tata in Mumbai on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 28: Tata Steel plans to expand its sources of raw materials through worldwide acquisitions to keep its plants in India and abroad running smoothly.        
	Chairman Ratan Tata told shareholders here today that the company would initially look at securing raw materials and later own these assets.         
	Addressing the 101st annual general meeting of the company, he said Tata Steel had sufficient iron ore for its domestic operations but had to import coke.         
	However, there were problems with the Corus operations in the UK.         
	Corus has lower margins because it does not have captive raw material. We want to change this but it takes time... We will first try to secure raw materials and then consider ownership of raw material assets, he said.        
	The Tata Steel chief said the group had already started the process of achieving raw material security by finalising various agreements in Mozambique, Ivory Coast and Oman.

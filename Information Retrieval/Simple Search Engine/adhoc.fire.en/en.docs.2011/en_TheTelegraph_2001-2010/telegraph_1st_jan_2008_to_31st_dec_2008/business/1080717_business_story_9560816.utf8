                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ranbaxy smells foul play
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 16: Ranbaxy Laboratories today accused some vested interests of spreading confusion and speculation in the wake of a motion filed in the US accusing it of fraudulent practice and submitting false information to the American health regulator.        
	There has been speculation in the market due to lack of understanding and we have information that a multinational and a leading Indian company are working in concert to bring our share price down, said Malvinder Mohan Singh, CEO, Ranbaxy Laboratories.        
	Refusing to name the rivals, Singh accused them of trying to enter when the companys share price was low by spreading confusion and speculation.        
	I have a clear sense of what is happening. People are trying to create confusion and obviously somebody is trying to bring our price down so that they can come at a lower price, he said.        
	Recently, Japans third-largest pharmaceutical company Daichii Sankyo has made an open offer to acquire 20 per cent of Ranbaxy after agreeing to buy the promoters 34.8 per cent stake in the Gurgaon-based firm.        
	Singh said the company was collecting data from the market on the alleged rigging of share prices so that they could be furnished to the concerned authorities.        
	The Ranbaxy shares today settled at Rs 470.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, up 15.02 per cent from its previous close, after surging to a high of Rs 476.60. It had plunged 14.01 per cent to Rs 409.25 yesterday.         
	Singh said that Ranbaxys deal with Daiichi Sankyo is very much on track.        
	He said the motion filed by the US department of justice was just a motion that sought additional information and clarification.        
	We have been co-operating with them (the department of justice) and will continue to do so. In the meantime, our business in the US continues as normal, he said.

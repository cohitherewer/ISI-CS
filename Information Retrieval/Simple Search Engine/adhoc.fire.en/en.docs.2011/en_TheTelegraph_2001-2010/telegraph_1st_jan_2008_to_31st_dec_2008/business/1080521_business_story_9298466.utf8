	Mumbai, May 20: Wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd may sell part of its 34 per cent stake in Germanys REpower Systems.

The company, however, did not disclose how much stake would be sold and what it would do with the proceeds from the sale.        
	Suzlon had acquired its stake in the German wind turbine maker for 1.35-billion-euro (about Rs 7,314 crore), with a cash outflow of 250 million euros, in 2007.        
	Suzlon Energys stock rose Rs 10.40, or 3.38 per cent, today and closed at Rs 318.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

	It has posted a net profit of Rs 482.55 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared with Rs 437.82 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	Total income stood at Rs 2,786.83 crore for the reporting quarter against Rs 2,097.55 in the year-ago period.         
	For the year ended March 31, 2008, the company posted a net profit of Rs 1,265.71 crore against Rs 1,061.14 crore a year ago.        
	Total income during the year rose to Rs 7,051.62 crore from Rs 5,468.47 crore in the previous year.         
	Suzlon said consolidated wind turbine sales volume for the fiscal increased to 2,311MW compared with 1,456MW in the previous year, a growth rate of 59 per cent.         
	Commenting on the results, Suzlon chairman and managing director Tulsi Tanti said, Our global growth story continues stronger than ever. Suzlon has grown at over 71 per cent compared with an industry average of 24 per cent. We continue to outperform our peers on the global stage, and will continue our record-breaking growth even in this supply restricted environment.         
	Our global marketshare in calendar year 2007 grew to 10.5 per cent from 7.7 per cent in 2006, Tanti added.

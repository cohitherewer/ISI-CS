          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          K. V. Kamath in Mumbai on Thursday. (Fotocorp)                                   
	Mumbai, May 22: ICICI Bank managing director K. V. Kamath expects interest rates to remain stable in the near term as liquidity is comfortable and credit offtake is not matching inflows.        
	In his first interaction with reporters after taking over as the president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Kamath said, Credit offtake is not matching liquidity inflows. To me that is a key signal of whether rates will go up or not. Arguing that India is not witnessing a slowdown in investment, the CII chief said the country would continue to grow at a rate of 8.6 per cent for the next five years.        
	To me India should continue to grow at 10 per cent. But going by CII figures, Indias growth rate would be 8.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent in the next five years, he said.

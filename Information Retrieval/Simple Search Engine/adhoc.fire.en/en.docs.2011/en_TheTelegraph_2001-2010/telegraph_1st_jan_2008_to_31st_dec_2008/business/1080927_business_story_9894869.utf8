                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HCL joins Axon race
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nayar: Forward march                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: HCL Technologies today made a counterbid of 650 pence per share for the UKs Axon Group against the 600-pence-per-share offer made by Infosys in August.        
	The offer values Axon at 441 million and is 8.3 per cent more than the bid of Infosys, which had valued the UK company at 407.1 million.        
	HCLs offer price is at a premium of 42.6 per cent over the average closing price of 455.7 pence per Axon share for the three months ended August 22, which was the last business day prior to the announcement of the offer by Infosys for Axon.        
	HCL has arranged a 400- million loan for the deal and the rest of the money will be raised through internal accruals, company CEO Vineet Nayar told reporters while announcing the counter-bid.        
	HCLs transformation journey enters an exciting phase. We see Axon as one such transformational opportunity for HCL to become a significant player in the SAP services space, Nayar said.        
	Reacting to HCLs counter-offer, Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan said, We will see what we have to do.         
	Infosys is considering its position and urges Axon shareholders to take no action at this time, the Bangalore- based company said.        
	An Infosys spokesperson said it would discuss the matter and take a decision.        
	Earlier, the board of Axon had recommended the Infosys offer. The three founders of the company as well as the key employees, who together hold about 18.1 per cent, had also supported the offer.         
	After HCLs offer, Infosys will now get a second chance to scale up its bid.        
	Axon provides consultancy services to multinational firms in systems applications and products (SAP). It has about 2,000 employees.         
	Founded in 1994, Axon has offices in the UK, North America, Malaysia and Australia.         
	Its clients include Maruti, Honda, Ford, Mercedes and Nissan in the auto segment, GE Cap and Barclays in financial services, Vodafone, BT and Motorola in telecommunications and AstraZeneca, Novartis and GSK in pharmaceuticals.

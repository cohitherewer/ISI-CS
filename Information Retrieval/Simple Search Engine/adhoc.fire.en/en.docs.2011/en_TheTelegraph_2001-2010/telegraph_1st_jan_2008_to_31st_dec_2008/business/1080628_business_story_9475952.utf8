          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 27: Stocks today collapsed under the combined weight of weak global markets, record crude oil prices and soaring inflation. The BSE sensex registered its biggest single-day fall since March 31 this year and sank to its lowest closing level since May 11 last year.        
	Investors, who woke up to the news that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had tumbled more than 350 points, saw other Asian markets also opening weak. Brokers said the pain for the markets grew as inflation surged to 11.42 per cent for the week ended June 14.        
	Crude oil prices also inched up to record levels of around $142 per barrel after Opecs president Chekib Khelil said they could reach $170 this year because of a weak dollar and geopolitical unrest.        
	With nothing going in favour of the markets, the BSE sensex opened lower at 13885.85 and hit an intra-day low of 13760.24. It later ended below the 14000-mark at 13802.22, a drop of 619.60 points, or 4.30 per cent, over the last close of 14421.82.        
	The markets reacted negatively to global cues, surging oil prices and high inflation numbers. What further precipitated the fall was continued selling by foreign institutional investors, said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan.        
	All the sectoral indices of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) ended in the red and the market breadth was also negative as 2,051 stocks registered losses while 601 others closed in the green.         
	Among the various BSE indices, the bankex was the worst hit as it closed with a loss of 5.34 per cent. ICICI Bank  Indias largest private sector bank  fell 6.7 per cent to Rs 651.        
	Automobile stocks were also hammered because of fears that high interest rates would deter purchase. Tata Motors saw its worst fall in recent times, with the share crashing 8 per cent to Rs 450.        
	Brokerage CLSA today warned in a report that there was a risk of the index falling even further to 12000 on rising oil prices and selling by foreign institutional investors.

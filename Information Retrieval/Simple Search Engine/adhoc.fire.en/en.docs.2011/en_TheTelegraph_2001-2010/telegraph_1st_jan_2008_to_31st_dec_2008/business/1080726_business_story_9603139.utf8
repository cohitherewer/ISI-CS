The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bangalore blasts add to sensex woes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangalore blasts add to sensex woes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 25: The sensex floundered again today, plunging over 502 points after being rattled by a series of bomb blasts in Bangalore, a string of weak global cues and a wave of profit-booking as anxious investors scooped money off the table.        
	Investors dumped banking stocks on fears that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would raise rates when governor Y.V. Reddy and other top central bankers review the monetary policy.         
	Reliance Industries, the largest private company, also sank over 7 per cent as analysts expressed disappointment over its refining margins.        
	Broking circles said the serial blasts in Bangalore had sparked security concerns in the countrys largest hub for technology companies.        
	Sentiment was already subdued after Asian indices stuttered. The Asian indices ended lower by about 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent. Selling was accentuated after news of the serial blasts came in.        
	An analyst with a local brokerage said the marginal dip in inflation did not favourably impact the sentiment as worries of a rate hike remained.         
	We must remember that though inflation has cooled off, it is still at double-digit levels and that there are other worrying factors such as the monsoon. The RBI will, therefore, be hawkish and this impacted banking stocks, an analyst said.        
	The BSE sensex opened at 14451.95 and remained under pressure throughout the day. Although it rose marginally to a high of 14484.39, it tumbled to 14274.94 at the close, a loss of 502.07 points or 3.40 per cent.

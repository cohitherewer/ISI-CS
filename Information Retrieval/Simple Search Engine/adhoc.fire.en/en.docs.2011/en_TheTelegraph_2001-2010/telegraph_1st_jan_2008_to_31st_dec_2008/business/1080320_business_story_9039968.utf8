The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Paswan missive to blunt steel price rise
                                                                                                               Paswan missive to blunt steel price rise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 19: Spooked by the adamant attitude of steel makers, Ram Vilas Paswan today proposed a slew of measures to rein in prices.        
	If these steps fail to yield results, Paswan said a steel sector regulator should be considered to keep tabs on prices.         
	While removal of or reduction in duties on imported steel as well as curbs on export will hurt steel makers, increased export tax on iron ore and lower duties on steel inputs such as metcoke can actually help them.        
	According to officials, the duty drawback scheme, which steel makers enjoy, could be removed to curb steel exports.        
	In his letter to Singh, Paswan has pointed out that the rise in steel prices has been particularly high since December  prices of long products have increased 24 per cent while those of flat items rose between 20 per cent and 22 per cent.        
	In spite of Paswans appeal, most steel companies increased prices by Rs 1,500-3,000 a tonne this month.         
	In February steel makers had increased prices by an average Rs 2,500 a tonne. Later, they agreed to roll back prices of hot rolled coils and TMT bars by Rs 500 and 1,000 per tonne, respectively. However, they asked the government to consider matching excise duty cuts to maintain margins as well as impose restrictions on the export of raw materials.

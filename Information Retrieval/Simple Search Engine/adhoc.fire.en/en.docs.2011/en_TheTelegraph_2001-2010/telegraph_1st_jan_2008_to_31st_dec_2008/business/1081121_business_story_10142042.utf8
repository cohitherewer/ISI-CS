          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Robinson: Key role                          
	Mumbai, Nov. 20: Citigroup  the troubled banking giant that recently announced plans to axe over 50,000 jobs globally  has named Mark Robinson as the chief executive officer of Citi South Asia.        
	Robinson replaces Sanjay Nayyar, a Citigroup veteran who is moving on to head the Indian operations of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts amp; Co (KKR), a global asset manager with deep interests in private equity and fixed income segments.        
	Based in Mumbai, Robinson will lead Citis banking franchise in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and also join the Asia Pacific executive committee.        
	Nayar had a 23-year stint in Citi. He joined the bank in 1985.         
	For more than a year, the private equity space has been abuzz with speculation that KKR will set up an office in India.         
	KKR is, however, not new to India. In February, it agreed to invest $250 million in Bharti Infratel Ltd. It made its first investment in India in 2006 when it bought the software unit of Flextronics International Ltd. for $900 million.         
	Saudi stake        
	Citigroup lost as much as a quarter of its market value on Thursday as mushrooming worries about whether the bank has enough capital to withstand billions of dollars of additional loan losses outweighed new support from its largest individual investor.        
	Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said he would increase his stake to 5 per cent from less than 4 per cent and called the banks shares dramatically undervalued.

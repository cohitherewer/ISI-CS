     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Centre today decided to modify the hydro power policy to encourage private sector participation in hydroelectric projects. 
    
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in New Delhi today.
    
	Briefing reporters, information and broadcasting minister P. R. Das Munshi said the policy would benefit projects in the northeastern and Himalayan states.
    
	The arrangement would ensure that the initiative for allocation of projects remained with the state governments. The Central Electricity Authority would see that the projects were designed and built in the most optimal and economic manner. 
    
	The interest of the consumers will also be adequately protected, he added.
    
	In another move to expedite private sector participation, the government today approved the model concession agreement (MCA) for ports.
    
	The MCA, which will replace the model licence agreement of March 2000, is expected to strengthen the framework for an open and transparent environment for the development and operation of port facilities by private investors. 
    
	The MCA, he said, would ensure equitable and efficient allocation of risks between the contracting parties and protection of user interests through adherence to performance standards.

	New Delhi, May 28: The government has identified three coal blocks for the Tata project to produce diesel from coal in a collaboration with South Africas Sasol.        
	Central Mine Planning amp; Design Institute Ltd, a consultancy firm and a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, has zeroed in on three blocks in Orissas Talcher valley  Srirampur, Radhikapur and Ramachandi  which have 8.5 billion tonnes of coal reserves.        
	However, officials said only one of the blocks would be given for the pilot project as the coal requirement for the venture is much lower at 1.5 billion tonnes.        
	With crude oil prices rising as high as $135 a barrel, the government, which had at one stage indicated that the coal-to-diesel project was not a priority, is probably once again waking up to the need to have a pilot project.        
	Officials said the Tatas were expected to invest about $6-7 billion in the project and would require around 1.5 billion tonnes of coal over a 40-year period.         
	Though the blocks have been identified, it would take considerable time before they could be awarded as there may be counter claims from steel makers and power producers who have been demanding coal blocks from the government.        
	The Srirampur block is over 55 square kilometre and has gross reserves of 3.03 billion tonnes. The block west of Radhikapur is also over 55 square kilometre and has reserves of 4.1 billion tonnes, while the Ramachandi block covers 16 square kilometre and has reserves of 1.5 billion tonnes.        
	Waiting in the wings with applications for similar projects are big players such as Reliance, Adani, Essar and Jindal. The Tatas had shown interest some two years back and submitted a detailed project.         
	Two months back an inter-ministerial group led by Planning Commission member Kirit Parekh had recommended the project after studying its cost effectiveness and other parameters. The panel decided to clear the project based on a coal price of $80 a tonne and after the Tatas said they would not seek any subsidy or tax breaks for the pilot project.         
	The officials said the others have not submitted details of their plans.        
	The Centre had last year approved the allocation of coal blocks to produce diesel. Under Indian laws, coal mines can only be allocated to state-run coal miners and private sector companies for captive use. These are mainly steel, cement and power firms.         
	The Tata-Sasol combine is likely to use the Fischer Tropsch technology, which converts syngas, extracted from coal, into oil. This can be refined to produce diesel, naphtha, jet fuel, cooking gas and lubricants.

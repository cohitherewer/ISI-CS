                                I want to gift Rs 2-4 lakh by cheque to my married daughter to purchase a flat for herself. Is it mandatory to write the gift on a stamp paper? If so, then what value of stamp paper is required? Are witnesses necessary? Is it mandatory to register that gift paper in a court?          Basudeb Sarkar, Hooghly
                    It is not mandatory to write the gift deed on a stamp paper. It is, however, advisable to gift money through a gift deed because it is then considered by the tax authorities as a supporting document. Since you are gifting the money to your daughter, you can write the gift deed on a plain paper and get it witnessed by at least two people. Though registration of the gift deed is not mandatory, it is advisable that you do so to be on the safe side of the income tax law.                                  Attachment rules      I have a pension account with a nationalised bank. The bank has asked me to realise my outstanding debts by attaching my pension account without giving me reasonable opportunity to square up the dues. Can they do it legally? My belief is that the pension account is not attachable?        Biswanath Laskar, North 24 Parganas
                    case of loan default, the lender bank can exercise its lien on all deposit accounts of the borrower, including pension account, with the bank. The money in a provident fund cannot be attached, but a pension account can be.                                    Form logic      I have two fixed deposits, one of Rs 6 lakh and the other of Rs 6.4 lakh. Both these deposits earn interest at the rate of 9.75 per cent per annum. My total interest income exceeds Rs 1 lakh per annum. I have no other source of income. Can I furnish declaration in Form 15G? If not, can I furnish form 15G for one fixed deposit? I am not a senior citizen?        P.S. Basu, Salt Lake
                    The basic exemption limit on the annual income of people who are above 65-years-old for income tax purposes is Rs 2.25 lakh. This increased basic exemption limit is effective from the current financial year, that is 2008-09. Since you have no other source of income, you can submit Form 15H, and not Form 15G, for non-deduction of tax at source. Form 15H is meant for senior citizens, while Form 15G is for those who are below 65-years-old.

          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, May 15: Russias largest mobile operator Sistema, which has joined hands with Etilsalats holding company DAS, is being seen as a potential partner in Etilsalats bid for MTN.        
	South African telecom firm MTN is being courted by Indias Bharti Airtel and UAEs Etilsalat.        
	Sistema, has recently signed a partnership agreement with Dubai-based DAS Holding, which owns a 40 per cent stake in Etilsalat, telecom analysts said.         
	Sistema may take this opportunity to propose a joint bid to control Johannesburg-listed MTN. The analysts said there was similarly a possibility of Singtel  which holds 30 per cent in Bharti partnering Bharti for the Indian companys bid for MTN, which has a market capitalisation of around $37 billion.         
	Sistema wants to continue its aggressive expansion outside Russia this year and has found new partners in a bid to break into African and West Asian telecom markets, said sources.        
	Sistema Telecoms vice-president Vitaly Savelyev had said that the companys aim was to be a global player.         
	The company also plans to expand aggressively in India and compete with leading operators such as Bharti, Vodafone Essar and Reliance Communications.        
	In September 2007, Sistema had bought a 10 per cent stake in Shyam Telelink, which operates in Rajasthan. Sistema later raised the stake to 51 per cent and plans to take it to 74 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil, MTN confront new equation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil, MTN confront new equation
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; JAYATI GHOSE                                             
	New Delhi , June 15: The Reliance Communications-MTN merger deal may have to be reworked to avoid legal complications and delays posed by Reliance Industries claim of the right of first refusal on any share sale or a swap of R-Com equity.         
	Even if the deal structure is changed, it will ensure that R-Com promoter Anil Ambani will remain in control of his company as well as take charge of South Africas MTN.         
	Though its contours are still being worked out, the deal may not happen the way it was earlier envisaged  a share swap making MTN the largest shareholder in R-Com followed by a public offer in India by the South African company.        
	Instead, setting up of holding companies may be explored to achieve the goals of the proposed alliance.         
	If such a structure materialises, R-Com will not turn into a subsidiary of MTN, at least directly.         
	The earlier share-swap proposal was for Anil to give his 66 per cent stake in R-Com and make a cash payment of $4-$5 billion, raised from private equity firms or through debt, to MTN in return for a 34.9 per cent stake in the South Africa company.         
	This would have made R-Com a subsidiary of MTN, but the proposed share swap meant Anil would be the biggest shareholder in the South African firm.         
	However, rivalry between Anil and elder brother Mukesh seems to have forced a change in the plans.         
	Reliance Industries, controlled by Mukesh, claimed the first right of refusal on any stake sale in R-Com, in a letter to MTN last week, a copy of which was sent to R-Com.         
	The row signalled another low in the relations between the brothers who inherited the Reliance empire from father Dhirubhai before carving it up three years back.         
	Reacting strongly to the letter, R-Com stated that the claim is legally and factually untenable, baseless, and misconceived and threatened claim damages if legal action was taken against the merger move. Mukeshs attack changes strategies but does not derail the deal.         
	R-Com wants to continue with its efforts to forge an alliance that can create one of the largest telecom entities in the developing world.         
	The merged entity would have revenues of Rs 58,100 crore, an asset base of Rs 1,47,000 crore and an operating profit of Rs 25,000 crore.

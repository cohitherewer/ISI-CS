	New Delhi/Mumbai, April 11: On a day when the rate of inflation jumped to 7.41 per cent, industry provided some respite by logging a growth rate of 8.6 per cent in February. Though the industrial growth figure is less than the 11 per cent clocked in February last year, it is higher than the 5.3 per cent growth logged in January this year.         
	The February figures had a positive impact on stocks, too, pushing up the sensex 113 points to 15807.64.         
	Brokers said an industrial growth of 8.6 in February was better than what the market had expected.         
	For the first 11 months of last fiscal, industrial growth stood at 8.7 per cent against 11.2 per cent a year ago. In February, electricity generation grew 9.8 per cent from a low of 3.3 per cent a year ago. Manufacturing grew 8.6 per cent against 12 per cent in February 2007. It was, however, higher than the 5.9 per cent growth in January this year. Growth in consumer durable goods, which fell 3.1 per cent in January, rose 3.3 per cent in February against 1.8 per cent a year-ago.        
	Mining output maintained a growth rate of 7.5 per cent.        
	Indias GDP (gross domestic product) growth is facing headwinds from weakening foreign demand and tight money conditions, said a Lehman Brothers report.         
	The report said rising inflation would lead to more policy measures that could hit growth. Lehman has cut its GDP growth forecast for 2008-09 from 8.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent. We expect the Reserve Bank of India to continue with its tight money policy, said D. Joshi of Crisil.         
	The market has been factoring in too many negatives over the past few months. Even the slightest positive hint can spark a huge market rally now, said Manish Sonthalia of Motilal Oswal.         
	We expect another 200-300 point upside rally in the coming week. The IIP numbers gave a short-term boost to the market, said Harendra Kumar of Centrum Broking.

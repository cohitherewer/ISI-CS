	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Yaga Venugopal Reddy may get a tenure extension on Mint Street next week.        
	But if he doesnt, his deputy at the Reserve Bank  Rakesh Mohan  looks a cinch to become the next governor.        
	Bankers in Mumbai are betting that 67-year-old Reddy  who took over from Bimal Jalan in September 2003  will get an extension for at least a year because of the tough measures he has taken to beat down inflation since the start of this fiscal.        
	Inflation peaked at 12.64 per cent this year and has been running at its highest level since 1992.        
	However, Raisina Hill was agog with the talk of a change after Rakesh Mohan met finance minister P. Chidambaram today, a week before Reddys tenure officially ends.         
	Several key decision-makers in the capital have been backing Mohans candidacy, including Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission  a person with whom Chidambaram has not always seen eye to eye on professional matters.         
	Finance secretary Duvvuri Subbarao was also believed to have been in the race with strong support from former RBI governor Chakravarthy Rangarajan who is a close confidant of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the ultimate authority in deciding on the appointment.        
	However, the government seems to feel Subbarao is needed in his current assignment and cannot be spared.         
	There was speculation earlier that Ahluwalia might also be in the fray, but officials say he cannot be asked to take up a job that is ranked lower than his current assignment.         
	Reddy has managed to keep money supply in check but his attempt to control it through a sharp burst of interest rate hikes  the repo rate was raised thrice between July 12 and July 29 from 7.75 per cent to 9 per cent  hasnt been popular with North Block.        
	The finance ministry has always been in favour of being a little more liberal on monetary policy issues and had at times even advised state-run banks to keep a check on interest rates as it doesnt want growth to be trammelled by a tight policy.        
	In its first-quarter monetary policy review, the RBI trimmed its economic growth forecast for 2008-09 to 8 per cent from 9 per cent in the previous year.        
	The RBI governor will have a crucial role to play in ensuring macroeconomic stability in the run-up to the general election due early next year. The government has already written off over Rs 70,000 crore of farm loans in June and cleared a 21 per cent pay hike for bureaucrats which will put a strain on the exchequer, forcing it to lean heavily on the RBI to manage its big borrowing programme.         
	Manmohan Singh could well choose to stay with Reddy to ride out the tough times ahead.

	Mumbai, March 3: Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer expects the market for its executive jets in India to touch close to $13 billion in next 10 years. 
    
	According to Manfred Bandzus, regional sales director (executive jets), the Asia-Pacific market for the company is at $26 billion. India is a significant market for us in the AsiaPacific region. There are already more than 20 jets flying in India at the moment, and we see a demand for more, he said on the sidelines of an exhibition here.
    
	India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines are important markets for us in the Asia Pacific. We expect this region to contribute more than 30 per cent to our global business, Baudzus told The Telegraph. 
    
	Embraer is looking at high net worth and corporate clients. The first of its Phenom 100 aircraft, priced at around $3.2 million, was purchased by a Bangalore client. It will be delivered in India by the end of next year.

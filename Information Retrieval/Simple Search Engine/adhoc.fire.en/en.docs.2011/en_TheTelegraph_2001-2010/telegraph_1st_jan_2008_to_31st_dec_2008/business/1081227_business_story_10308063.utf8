          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Dream abode                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The government today offered home buyers from the weaker sections of society a 5 per cent interest subsidy on loans up to Rs 1 lakh taken during the Eleventh Plan (2007-12).        
	Realtors, however, said the scheme would not improve demand.        
	After the cabinet committee of economic affairs approved the scheme, home minister P. Chidambaram said the subsidy was determined with an eye on the repayment capacity of the borrowers.        
	The total subsidy will be Rs 1,100 crore and is expected to leverage institutional finance to the tune of Rs 3,870 crore. The loan repayment period will vary between 15 and 20 years.        
	Real estate firms such as DLF said the scheme would not help the targeted segment.         
	It is a very unrealistic scheme, given todays market conditions. Interest subsidy on Rs 1 lakh will hardly help anybody, said Rajeev Talwar, group executive director, DLF.        
	US realtor Prologis shared similar views. None of the big developers are looking at building residential apartments in this category. So, if the government really wants to spur demand, it will have to increase the overall (loan) limit, said Abhijeet Malkani, director, Prologis. In April, Prologis had entered India through a joint venture with the Rahejas.         
	Officials said the scheme would result in the creation of 3.10 lakh new houses for the economically weaker sections and low income group households over the next four years.        
	Of this, 2.13 lakh houses will be for the weaker sections and 0.97 lakh for the low income group.        
	The National Housing Bank and Hudco will be the nodal agencies for the disbursement and monitoring of the subsidy. It will be given to banks and microfinance institutions, among others.        
	In 2005-06, the government launched a scheme under Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission to provide homes to 1.5 million households belonging to the economically weaker sections.

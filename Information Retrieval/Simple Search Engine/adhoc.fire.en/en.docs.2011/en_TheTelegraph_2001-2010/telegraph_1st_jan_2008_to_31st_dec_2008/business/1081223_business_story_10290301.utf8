The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twin strikes by the Left
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Twin strikes by the Left
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Acharia: Tough stand                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: In a two-pronged offensive, the Left today sought the suspension of the retail licence of Swiss financial entity UBS and moved a privilege notice against oil minister Murli Deora.        
	CPM member of the Lok Sabha Basudeb Acharia today wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, alleging that UBS had helped Anil Ambanis Reliance ADA Group in using foreign loans, meant for buying capital goods, to scoop up stocks on local bourses.         
	Acharia, who is a member of the standing committee on finance, has sought the suspension of UBSs retail banking licence, pending a probe.         
	In another development, Deora came under attack from RSP member of the Rajya Sabha Abani Roy, who in a privilege notice, accused the minister of giving contradictory statements in Parliament in a court case between the Ambani brothers.        
	In Bombay High Court, the government through its statements had implied that the price of gas from Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Krishna-Godavari oil block should be $4.2 per unit against brother Anils contention that the price should be much lower at $2.34 per unit.         
	However, in a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on August 21, 2007, Deora had said the government does not fix the price of gas. Roys privilege notice to the Rajya Sabha chairman says it clearly represents contradictory statements by the minister for petroleum and natural gas.        
	Roy told The Telegraph, I am not attacking any industry house, my motion is against Deora. He cant say two different things in two different places. However it (the motion) could affect industrial groups.         
	Acharia has alleged that the foreign borrowings of two Anil entities were used to ramp up shares of Anils Reliance ADA Group companies.         
	This was done through UBS, I will be giving proof to the PM, Acharia told The Telegraph.         
	A Reliance ADAG spokesperson said, We are in full compliance of all applicable regulations. We have not received any enquiries from any government agency.

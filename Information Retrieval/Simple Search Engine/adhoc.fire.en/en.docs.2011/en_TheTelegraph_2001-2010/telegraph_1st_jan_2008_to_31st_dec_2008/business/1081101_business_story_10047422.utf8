          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Union cabinet today approved the insurance amendment bill that seeks to introduce various changes in the existing law, including raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.         
	These are comprehensive amendments to reflect the current need of the insurance industry, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.         
	According to officials, the bill will be tabled in December but is unlikely to be brought to vote because of time constraints. Besides, the government is not sure of obtaining the requisite numbers to get the bill passed.         
	In 1999, the BJPs attempts to increase the FDI cap in insurance was foiled by opposition from within the party. Without the support of the BJP and the Left, it would not be a smooth run for the present government to pass the bill.         
	Though the governments newest ally, the Samajwadi Party, is willing to take a fresh look at the stalled insurance and pension bills, others such as the RJD, may not be party to the bill.        
	Officials said the bill was likely to be sent to the standing committee on finance after its introduction in Parliament and remain with it till the next Lok Sabha gets elected.         
	However, todays announcement went down well with the insurance industry. The insurance industry has been waiting for this news for a long while. The hike in FDI will surely inject adrenaline into the industry in the country, said Ajay Bimbhet, managing director of Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited.        
	T.R. Ramachandran, CEO of Aviva India, said, Raising the FDI limit may increase the total FDI in the life insurance industry by almost 2.5 times from the current levels of around Rs 2,500 crore.        
	Uco capital rejig        
	The cabinet today approved the capital restructuring of state-run Uco Bank by converting Rs 250 crore of its equity into preference shares. This will enable the Calcutta-based lender to raise funds from the market.         
	The reduction in equity capital will improve the banks earnings per share, said Chidambaram.

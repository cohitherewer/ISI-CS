	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Bokaro Steel Plant, which contributes more than a quarter of SAILs profits, may run out of iron ore in a few years.
    
	According to sources, current mining areas at Bokaros twin mines Kiriburu and Meghataburu have reserves of just 58 million tonnes, which will be used up in four to five years if the current output is maintained. If Bokaros production goes up to 7.5mt over the next two years as planned, the reserve will be exhausted much earlier.
    
	SAIL has been unable to start mining in other areas of Kiriburu and Meghataburu because of the delay on the part of the Jharkhand government in giving environment and forest clearances for fresh mining within its lease areas. 
    
	The steel behemoth wants to start mining at Kiriburus south block, which has reserves of 60mt, and at the central block of Meghataburu, which has 80mt of iron ore. 
    
	Bokaro, which needs about 10mt of ore annually to produce 4.5mt of steel, plans to increase output to 7.5mt in the next two years. It plans to raise production to 17mt by 2020, which will make it the largest steel plant in the country. 
    
	SAIL wants to renew leases for its Chiria mines to expand capacity at Bokaro and IISCO, Burnpur as well as set up a new plant at Saraikela near Manoharpur. Steel output at these three locations is expected to go up to 32.5mt.
    
	We have offered to tie up lease renewal for 1 billion tonnes of ore with committed plans to increase steel output. We are ready to give written commitments on that, said SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta.
    
	Profit up 31%
    
	SAILs net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 rose 31.5 per cent to Rs 1,934.66 crore from Rs 1,471.19 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. Total income increased 12.41 per cent to Rs 9,847.64 crore. The company has declared an interim dividend of 19 per cent.

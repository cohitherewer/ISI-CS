	Calcutta, June 7: Spencers, the retailing arm of the Rs 13,500-crore RPG Enterprises, will tie up with three more international retail majors this fiscal.        
	The company, which today announced its tie-up with 3-billion Woolworths Plc of the UK, could enter into joint ventures with the foreign firms or make them equity partners.        
	We have started with Chad Valley, the globally famous toy brand from the house of Woolworths. We will be inking at least three more such international tie-ups this fiscal. For Chad Valley, we would eventually look at standalone stores as well, Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, said.        
	Spencers plans to invest Rs 1,200 crore in the next 18 months. It has already invested Rs 1,000 crore.        
	This is the first foray for Chad Valley in the Indian market.         
	Spencers is projecting a turnover of Rs 1,800-2000 crore for 2008-09, up from around Rs 900 crore last fiscal.        
	Spencers has 400 stores now and plans to add 300 stores and 14 hypermarts by the end of this fiscal.        
	Along with the existing 65 cities, the expansion will also cover six new cities.

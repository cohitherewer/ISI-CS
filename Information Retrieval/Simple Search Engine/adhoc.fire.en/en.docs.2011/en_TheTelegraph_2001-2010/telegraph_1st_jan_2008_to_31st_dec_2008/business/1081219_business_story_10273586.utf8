          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Change is in the air                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: ICICI Bank may decide as early as tomorrow the successor to K.V. Kamath, its managing director and CEO. The board of the countrys second largest bank may ask Chanda Kochhar to take over the mantle from Kamath.         
	Talks about a change at the top have been doing the rounds since early this month. Kamath leaves office on April 30 next year.         
	Apart from Kochhar, who is now the joint managing director at ICICI Bank, Shikha Sharma, CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, is also a front-runner.         
	Other top officials who were shortlisted included Renuka Ramnath, managing director and CEO of ICICI Ventures, and three ICICI Bank executive directors  V. Vaidyanathan, Madhabi Puri-Buch and Sanjoy Chatterjee.        
	A spokesperson for the bank confirmed that the board was meeting tomorrow, but termed the talks of a change at the helm as speculative. I do not know the agenda of the board meeting, he said.         
	Kamath may take over as non-executive chairman of the bank from N. Vaghul whose term, too, ends next year.         
	Kamath had started his career in 1971 with ICICI Ltd, the domestic financial institution which promoted ICICI Bank. Subsequently, it was merged into the private sector bank in 2002. After a stint with the Asian Development Bank, Kamath returned to the bank as its CEO in 1996.         
	He transformed ICICI from a project finance entity to a bank strong on retail credit.         
	He has a degree in mechanical engineering and a masters degree in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.         
	Kamath is the president of the Confederation of Indian Industry and a member of the boards of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and the Manipal University.         
	Kochhar joined the erstwhile ICICI as a management trainee in 1984. When ICICI decided to enter commercial banking in 1993, she was deputed to ICICI Bank as part of a core team.         
	Kochhar was instrumental in scaling up the retail business of ICICI Bank. In April 2001, she took over as executive director, heading the retail business. In April 2006, she was appointed the deputy managing director.         
	In October last year, Kochhar was promoted as joint managing director and chief financial officer. She was made responsible for the corporate centre and was the official spokesperson for the bank.

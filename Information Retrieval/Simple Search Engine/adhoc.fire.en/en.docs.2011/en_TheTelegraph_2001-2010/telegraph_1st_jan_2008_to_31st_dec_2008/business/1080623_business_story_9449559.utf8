          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                           Cost of living                                  
	New Delhi, June 22: The government is banking on the monsoon, which has been normal till now, to ease the pressure on food prices.        
	Food, commodity and fuel price increases have seen inflation galloping to a 13-year high of 11.05 per cent. Finance ministry officials believe inflation can go up further in the weeks ahead.         
	However, many in the finance ministry and the Planing Commission are fearful of rising commodity and fuel prices causing problems to the economy, even if food prices start coming down.        
	Arvind Virmani, chief economic advisor to the government, said, Inflationary pressure will continue for some time. We will see a 5-6 per cent inflation rate only next year.         
	Crude prices, which nearly touched $140 a barrel last week, are forecast to touch $200 a barrel this winter, when demand for heating oil in the US and Europe add to the demand for crude oil from the emerging markets.        
	Investment banker Morgan Stanley has already forecast that oil prices will touch $150 a barrel by July 4 because of strong demand in Asia.         
	With many state elections in this winter and a Lok Sabha poll next year, high inflation could pose problems to the Congress-led coalition.        
	Inflation is unlikely to come down in the next two quarters (end of 2008), said Shubhada Rao, chief economist with Yes Bank.         
	Crisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said the current year would continue to see inflation in the double digit and it will start moderating only from March 2009.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has himself gone on record about the inflation rate moderating after September 15 if the monsoon is normal. Economists, however say, that the increases in fuel and commodity prices along with the associated rise in the costs of most items mean prices will remain sticky at the best and continue to soar at the worst. The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast near normal rainfall in the June-September monsoon season.        
	Rao said the monsoon would ease the prices of food articles, but this would not help as inflation data shows non-food primary product prices spiking upwards. Other commodities such as steel and cement which are linked to global prices, will also show an upward trend, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti to make a Splash with Ritz
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Maruti to make a Splash with Ritz
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Name game                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Suzuki Motor Corporation plans to launch its hatchback Splash as the Ritz in India.         
	According to sources, Maruti Suzuki, the Indian subsidiary of the global auto maker, is trying to find out if any rival company has already registered the name.         
	The car is likely to be launched by mid-2009 and will have two versions  a 1.2-litre petrol and a 1.3-litre diesel engine.         
	In the West, the Splash has replaced the WagonR. But Maruti is unlikely to phase out this popular model in India.         
	Sources said Maruti sold some 85,000 units of the WagonR in a tough market during April-November this year. However, it sold 24,000 units of the Zen Estillo, despite steep price discounts.        
	The Splash (or the Ritz) is likely to be priced around Rs 4-5 lakh, slightly below the Swift.         
	Designers said the Ritz would have a high roofline and wider tracks to give it more space and leg room.         
	Marutis sales have dipped along with other Indian auto majors because of high interest rates and low consumer demand on the back of a global recession. A 4 per cent cut in value-added tax has not helped in pushing up sales.        
	In November, the Indian automobile industry reported a 19 per cent drop in passenger car sales. Maruti Suzuki reported a 27 per cent decline in sales. The company had earlier reported a 36.52 per cent dip in net profit for the second quarter ended September.         
	Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 296.1 crore against Rs 466.5 crore in the same period last year.        
	Car makers have been offering heavy discounts to turn around the market, but have held back new models.         
	Tata Motors, Fiat and Hyundai have pushed back their plans to bring in new cars.         
	Only Maruti has launched the A-star last month. Analysts said Marutis strategy seemed to be to aggressively bring in new models and push up sales.

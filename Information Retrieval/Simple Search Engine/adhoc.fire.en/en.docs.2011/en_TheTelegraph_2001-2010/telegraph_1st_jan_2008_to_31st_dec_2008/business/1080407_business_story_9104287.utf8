          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, April 6: State-owned NHPC Ltd will once again approach market regulator Sebi for an initial public offering (IPO). It had planned an issue last year, but Sebi refused because the hydro-electric company did not have a sufficient number of independent directors on its board.         
	The audit of our financial accounts for 2007-08 will be completed by May and we shall file the revised draft red herring prospectus for the IPO with Sebi in June or July, said S.K. Garg, chairman of NHPC. The IPO will hit the market in August, Garg added.         
	The government had allowed 24 per cent divestment in NHPC following which it applied with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in April last year to offer 167 crore shares.        
	This comprised 112 crore of fresh equity shares and 55 crore of the governments shares, which were 5 per cent of NHPCs equity.         
	NHPC had planned to raise Rs 3,700 crore from the flotation. But Sebi had stalled the offering on the ground that the state-owned company was non-compliant with Clause 49 of its listing norms.         
	Under the clause, a company must have 50 per cent independent directors on its board if it wants to be listed on the bourses. We have five functional and two non-executive directors on the board. We need to appoint seven independent directors under Clause 49. Four independent directors have already been appointed and the ministry of power has forwarded the names of the remaining three to the government. Their appointments will be done soon, Garg said.        
	NHPCs net profit will cross Rs 1,000 crore in 2007-08. The provisional estimates put our net profit in the last fiscal at Rs 1,000 crore plus compared with Rs 925 crore in 2006-07, Garg added.         
	Though the government has allowed 24 per cent divestment, NHPC will raise up to 15 per cent of its post-issue paid-up capital now. The remaining 9 per cent will be raised by 2012.        
	NHPC plans to invest Rs 28,000 crore to set up 12 hydro-electric projects during the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012), adding more than 5,000MW to its installed capacity.

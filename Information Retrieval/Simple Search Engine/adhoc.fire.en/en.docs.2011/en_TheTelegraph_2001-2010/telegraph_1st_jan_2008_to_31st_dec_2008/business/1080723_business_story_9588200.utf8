The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Union backs Sterlite bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Union backs Sterlite bid
          SAMBIT SAHA                          SUPPORT SYSTEM                                  
	Calcutta, July 22: United Steelworkers (USW) has thrown its weight behind Sterlite Industries attempt to acquire the assets of the bankrupt US copper miner Asarco LLC.        
	The union has decided to oppose the reorganisation plan to be submitted by Grupo Mexico, the estranged parent of Asarco.        
	The union members said that its members, retirees, workers from other unions and locally elected officials would hold pickets outside Asarcos Ray and Mission mines and the Hayden smelter in Arizona.        
	The union intends to send a clear message to Grupo Mexico that it will not be welcomed back because of its poor track record.        
	Besides the USW, some local law-makers have also objected to Grupos attempt, citing its past record that include the non-payment of taxes.        
	The position of the state and local officials puts them at odds with US Congress members Gabrielle Giffords and Raul Grijalva, both Tucson Democrats.         
	In a letter last month to the US department of justice, the pair said that they believed Vedanta did not have a good record as a responsible employer and environmental steward.        
	The USW move to support the Indian company is in contrast to its stand last month when the union had blocked another Indian company from acquiring a metal asset in the US.        
	Essar Steel in June lost out to Russias Severstal in its bid to acquire Esmark as the USW persistently opposed Essar and favoured Severstal.        
	Anil Agarwal-owned Sterlite, however, pre-empted any such possibility when it entered into an agreement with the USW earlier this month.        
	The new collective bargaining agreement, which retains existing worker benefits, will take effect when Sterlite acquires Asarcos assets.        
	The parties have agreed to the extension of the terms of the current agreement, expiring in 2013, by three years.         
	The latest USW move gains significance as the US bankruptcy court early this month gave the go ahead to Grupo Mexicos bid.

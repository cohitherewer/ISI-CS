	Mumbai, Jan. 19: ICICI Banks net profit rose 35 per cent to Rs 1,230 crore in the third quarter ended December 31 from Rs 910 crore in the corresponding previous period. Strong loan growth and income from other sources boosted profits. 
    
	The growth is ahead of analyst estimates and comes at a time when retail advances have slowed down because of high interest rates. 
    
	The bank clocked a net interest income at Rs 1,960 crore in the quarter against Rs 1,485 crore a year ago, a 32 per cent increase. The growth was an indicator of robust demand for loans from the corporate sector. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned from disbursing loans and that paid on deposits. 
    
	Total income stood at Rs 10,338 crore in the quarter compared with Rs 7,581 crore a year ago, an increase of 36 per cent.
    
	Fee income, which is generated from selling third-party products such as mutual funds, rose 33 per cent to Rs 1,785 crore from Rs 1,345 crore in the year-ago period. ICICI Bank said total advances increased 25 per cent to Rs 215,517 crore from Rs 172,763 crore on December 31, 2006. The banks retail advances were Rs 132,311 crore in the reporting quarter and constituted 61 per cent of total advances. The proportion of advances of the banks international branches in total advances increased to 21 per cent from 12 per cent.
    
	The bank plans to raise around $7 billion this calendar year to finance expansion of its Indian businesses, including organic and inorganic growth. It had raised $6.7 billion last year in international bond markets in dollar, euro and sterling currencies.

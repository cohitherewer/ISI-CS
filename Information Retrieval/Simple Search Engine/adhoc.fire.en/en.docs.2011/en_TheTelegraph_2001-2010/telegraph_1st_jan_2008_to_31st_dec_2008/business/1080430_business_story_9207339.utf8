          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with CII president Sunil Bharti Mittal 
  in New Delhi on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                          
	New Delhi, April 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked industry to absorb increase in input costs and maintain the price line.         
	Let me be upfront and say that industry and trade must eschew the temptation of seeking short-term gains and should co-operate with the government to ensure long-term stability of the growth process, Singh said at a conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	Singh said the current high inflation rate was mainly because of an increase in global oil and food prices and called upon industry to pass on the benefits of tax and duty cuts to consumers.        
	Singh, however, said the prospects for domestic growth remain good if we can ensure price stability that will help sustain the growth momentum.        
	The government has taken a number of fiscal and monetary measures to reverse the recent spurt in prices, which analysts say have started paying off.         
	The Prime Minister said the government was aware of the challenge thrown up by inflation, which is averaging over 7 per cent for the last several weeks. I am confident that we will be able to moderate the price rise, he added.         
	Terming inflation as the immediate challenge, Singh said global response to the problem has not been adequate and wanted India to take part in managing global food and financial systems.        
	According to Singh, industry had a societal obligation in controlling inflation.        
	Singhs appeal to industry came hours before the announcement of the RBI monetary policy, which tightened money supply by sucking additional Rs 9,000 crore out of the banking system to combat inflation.        
	Singh also advised corporate heads to show sobriety in their lifestyle. A measure of sobriety in corporate lifestyle and compensation can also help cut costs and maintaining the price level.        
	He said prudent fiscal management would be a key concern for the government as money does not grow on a tree, signalling the limitation of resources.        
	Emphasising that broad macroeconomic parameters were robust, Singh said India was on a new growth path to become the worlds second fastest growing economy.        
	It is not my intention to understate the problems in hand. At the same time it is also not correct to belittle what has been achieved and what has been done, he said.        
	Singh called for a synergy between developed and developing countries to stabilise food prices.        
	The rise in global food prices not only slows down the the growth momentum but also accentuates global inequalities. The world awaits a new concordant between developed and developing nations on food security, he said.        
	He, however, hastened to add that the challenge to food security could not be addressed without solving the problem of rising oil prices.        
	I am deeply dismayed that the global response to this third energy crisis has fallen short of our expectations and compares poorly with the response to the first and second oil crisis, Singh said.

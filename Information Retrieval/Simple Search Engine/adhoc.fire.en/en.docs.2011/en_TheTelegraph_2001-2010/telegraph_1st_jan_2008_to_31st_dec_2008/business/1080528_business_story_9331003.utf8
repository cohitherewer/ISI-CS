  Outgoing chief pledges 200m                                                
	London, May 27 (PTI): Vodafones outgoing CEO Arun Sarin today announced an additional investment of 200 million in its India operations.        
	The UK-based telecom giant had announced an investment of 1 billion last year when it entered India after buying out Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom Internationals controlling stake in Hutchison Essar, which was renamed Vodafone Essar.        
	Vodafone will invest 200 million more in India, said Sarin in an interaction with analysts.         
	The company is targeting 100 million customers against the current 44 million and for that, Vodafone needs more spectrum, Sarin added. He also hoped that third-generation services would be rolled out in India in the next 12 months.        
	Talking of a business model that will reduce costs, Sarin was emphatic on inorganic growth prospects.        
	The CEO, who has shown a knack for overseas acquisitions, also spoke about the opportunities in the African and Asian markets. We are interested in large markets in Asia and Africa. Our African strategy is to take control of Vodacom, said Sarin. Vodafone recently said it was not bidding for South African telecom company MTN.        
	Commenting on the performance of Vodafone in India, Sarin said, Our existing emerging market assets continue to perform well. Vodafone Essar in India is delivering strong growth and performing in line with our acquisition plan.        
	Revenues increased by 50 per cent during the year driven by the rapid expansion of the customer base with an average of 1.5 million net additions per month since acquisition, he added.        
	We have also established an independent tower company with two other operators to drive further strong and cost-efficient growth, Sarin added.        
	The high-profile chief executive of Vodafone will step down as the company CEO on July 29 after being five years in the post. Sarin will be replaced by his deputy Vittorio Colao.        
	Sarin is likely to venture into the private equity business and may also join the boards of large international companies as a non-executive director.        
	Ripple effect        
	Shares of Vodafone turned volatile today after an initial rally of over three per cent on the London Stock Exchange.        
	The stock rose 3.6 per cent in early morning trade but soon pared early gains and after see-sawing between positive and negative zones, closed 1.26 per cent down at 161.25 pence.        
	Brokers said the surge in the share price was more related to the full-year profit of over 6 billion.         
	However, Sarins exit may have also added to the gain as there had been a demand from some groups of shareholders in the past for his removal.

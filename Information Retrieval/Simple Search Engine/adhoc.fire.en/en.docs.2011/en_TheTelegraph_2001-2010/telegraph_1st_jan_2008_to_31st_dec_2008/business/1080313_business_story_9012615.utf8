	New Delhi, March 12 (PTI): The government has issued a formal notification to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in public sector refineries to 49 per cent.

	The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) issued a press note saying, It has been decided to allow FDI up to 49 per cent, with prior approval of Foreign Investment Promotion Board, in petroleum refining by PSUs without involving any divestment or dilution of domestic equity in the existing PSUs.        
	Besides, the condition of compulsory divestment of up to 26 per cent by foreign companies involved in trading and marketing of petroleum products has been deleted.        
	The government has allowed 100 per cent FDI in the trading and marketing of petroleum products with a condition that 26 per cent foreign equity be divested in favour of an Indian partner or the Indian public within five years.        
	The biggest beneficiary of the decision will be the BG group of the UK, which had been resisting divestment of its stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd.        
	Civil aviation        
	FDI limits in the domestic civil aviation sector have also been raised.

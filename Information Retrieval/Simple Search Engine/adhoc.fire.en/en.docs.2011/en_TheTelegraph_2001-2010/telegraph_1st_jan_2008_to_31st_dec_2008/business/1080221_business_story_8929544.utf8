          R. SURYAMURTHY                                          LOTS TO LEARN      
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Calcutta-based George Telegraph plans to invest about Rs 100 crore in expansion activities.        
	The institute will set up centres to cash in on the lack of trained manpower in emerging sectors such as retail, pharmaceutical and accountancy.         
	Group director Subrata Dutta said the retail salesman course was introduced to cater to the needs of the retailing industry, which was growing at the rate of 30 per cent per annum. The institutes will come up in Jamshedpur, Cooch Behar, Sonarpur and Barasat this year.        
	According to the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, services and manufacturing are likely to face a shortage of five to six million skilled professionals in the next five years since the countrys educational centres are ill-equipped to meet the demand.        
	The 88-year old educational enterprise will also introduce pharmaceutical marketing and logistics courses in the eastern region. Other courses in the pipeline include training for insurance advisers, front office and back office executives, mutual fund consultants and other investment advisers.         
	Initially, these courses will be offered at the Calcutta centre and later at the other centres in the eastern region, Dutta added. It also plans to provide training to candidates appearing for the civil services examinations.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 28: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) today announced a 16.5 per cent growth in profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 at Rs 380.95 crore compared with Rs 327.08 crore in the same quarter last year.        
	Net sales grew Rs 609.62 crore and the company reported an underlying volume growth of 10.2 per cent.        
	However, HULs net profit fell compared with the same quarter last fiscal because of certain exceptional items arising out of the sale and demerger of properties worth Rs 65.81 crore.        
	The company recorded a net profit of Rs 380.95 crore compared with Rs 392.89 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.        
	The FMCG majors spending in advertisement and promotions rose 21 per cent during the quarter, a trend, officials said, was likely to continue.        
	Advertisements and promotions are important ingredients in the marketing programme of an FMCG company. I dont see this coming down. Our spending remains competitive. It will in all probability go up, said HUL vice -chairman D. Sundaram.        
	He added that the companys margins had improved after increasing investments in advertisement and promotions. The company has earmarked a capital expenditure of Rs 500 crore across all categories for the current fiscal.        
	Officials expressed concern at the growing inflation, but maintained that it had no impact on consumer spending.        
	Inflationary pressures are a cause for concern, but market growth continues to be strong and there is no evidence of any significant impact on consumer spending in our FMCG categories. Our brand portfolios cater to consumers across income segments and with our record for delivering cost-saving initiatives, we are confident to effectively manage the inflationary challenges in a competitive context, said HUL chairman Harish Manwani.        
	Accounting year        
	The HUL board has approved a change in the accounting year of the company. It will now commence from April 1 every year and end on March 31 the following year.         
	Consequently, the next annual accounts and report of the company will be for a period of 15 months starting January 1, 2008, and ending March 31, 2009.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Singapore opens retail door to SBI
                                                                                                               Singapore opens retail door to SBI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 25: The State Bank of India (SBI) has finally won the licence to offer a full range of retail banking services in Singapore.        
	The Monetary Authority of Singapore today granted a qualified full banking (QFB) licence to Indias largest bank. The SBI had filed an application for the licence about six months ago.        
	In August 2005, India and Singapore signed a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA) under which both countries agreed to open up their financial sectors to each other. Under CECA, the two countries have agreed to give full banking licences to three banks from either side.        
	Coincidentally, Singapore-based DBS Bank has received the Reserve Banks approval to set up eight more branches in the country. DBS started its banking operations in India in 1995. It received a licence for a second branch in 2005.         
	India has been liberal in handing out banking licences to Singapore banks. Singapore, however, hasnt shown the same level of reciprocity. Its tardiness in handing out full banking licences to Indian entities has invited muted criticism here.        
	However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has indicated that Indian banks do not qualify for the QFB licence because of their prudential norms.        
	Besides the SBI, ICICI Bank had also sought a QFB licence. Singapore is an important financial hub in Asia with a sizable Indian population.        
	The SBI can now raise retail deposits and open 15 branches in Singapore apart from offering other facilities such as automated teller machines. With one branch, the SBI now has an offshore banking licence in Singapore, which arranges for syndicated loans and provides trade finance.        
	Some of the other Indian banks that are present in Singapore are the Bank of India, the Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of Baroda, Uco Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. None of them provide retail banking services and their activities are restricted.        
	DBS will open branches in Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai, Moradabad, Nashik, Pune, Salem and Surat. At present, it has branches in Delhi and Mumbai.        
	DBS Bank is one of the largest financial services groups in Asia with operations in 15 markets. It is present in corporate banking, small and medium enterprises, treasury and consumer banking.        
	All the eight branches are expected to be operational in the next 12 months. DBS Bank will focus on both corporate and individual customers. Until now, there has not been any instance where a foreign bank has secured RBI permission to open eight branches at one go.

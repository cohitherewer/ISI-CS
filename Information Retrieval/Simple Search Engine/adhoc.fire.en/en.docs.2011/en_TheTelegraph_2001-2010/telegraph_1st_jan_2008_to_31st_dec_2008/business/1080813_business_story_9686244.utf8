	Calcutta, Aug. 12: After equities, its the turn of precious metals to fall prey to a bear hug. Prices of gold, silver and platinum have tumbled more than 20 per cent in the last few weeks.         
	Commodity market experts believe that there will be more downsides, particularly in gold prices, with the strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies in the global market.        
	Investment in gold, either in physical form or through units of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), is fast losing its sheen.         
	Gold price, which touched a 28-year high of $1,032.70 a troy ounce (0.03215 troy ounce = 1 gram) on March 22 this year, tumbled nearly 23 per cent to hit a seven-month low of $801 today.         
	Silver and platinum, which yielded a higher return than the yellow metal in the past 12 months, recorded a steeper fall of 36 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, in recent months.        
	In the Mumbai bullion market, gold and silver prices scaled peaks of Rs 13,410 per 10 gm and Rs 25,835 a kilo, respectively, on July 22. But since then, the prices have declined to Rs 11,390 and Rs 20,430, a fall of over 15 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.         
	At the beginning of this calendar year, gold and silver were trading at Rs 10,700 and Rs 19,500 levels, respectively, in the domestic market.         
	A sustained rise in global gold prices over the last few years had prompted a number of domestic mutual fund houses to launch gold ETFs as an alternative to traditional investment avenues such as equity and debt.         
	The sub-prime crisis in the US mortgage market and its aftershock led investors to lap up gold ETFs for better returns.        
	During the past 12 months, gold ETFs gave a return of 32.41 per cent compared with a nominal 4.28 per cent return by the sensex.         
	Diversified equity and equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds gave a negative return of 1.84 per cent and 2.61 per cent, respectively, during the same period.        
	The asset under management of gold ETFs grew to Rs 634 crore at the end of July this year from Rs 300 crore at the end of August last year.         
	However, in the past one month, gold ETFs have been giving a negative return of 10.60 per cent, while the sensex generated a positive 15.10 per cent and diversified equity schemes 11.50 per cent returns.

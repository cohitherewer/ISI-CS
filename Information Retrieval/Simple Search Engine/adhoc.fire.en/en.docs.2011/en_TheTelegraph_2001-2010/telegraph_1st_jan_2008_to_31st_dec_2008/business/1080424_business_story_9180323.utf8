          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 23: The Abhijit Sen Committee on futures trading of essential commodities, which met today to sort out differences among its members, will submit its report by April 27.         
	The committee could not establish a direct link between futures trading of agriculture commodities and the increase in their prices in the draft report submitted on April 21.         
	The panel, however, will neither recommend a ban nor favour continuing futures trading in essential commodities.         
	We found an acceptable way of expressing the differences in opinions, committee chairman Abhijit Sen said. He, however, declined to give further details.        
	Committee member Sharad Joshi said each member would submit a separate note, which would go along with the report.         
	The terms of reference do not include any obligation to make recommendations about the futures market and we dont have to say anything about whether it should continue or not, Joshi told reporters here. The common minimum report will not have anything either on banning or permitting futures market, Joshi said.        
	About lifting the ban on futures trading in certain commodities including wheat, he said, We dont have to say whether the ban shall be lifted.

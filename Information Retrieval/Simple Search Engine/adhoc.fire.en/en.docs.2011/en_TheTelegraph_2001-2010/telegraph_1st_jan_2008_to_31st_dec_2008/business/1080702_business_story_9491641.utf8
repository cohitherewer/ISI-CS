          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, July 1: Anil Ambani group company Reliance Infrastructure today said it had merged its wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Projects Finance with itself, effective from June 30.         
	In a statement issued to the stock exchanges today, Reliance Infrastructure (formerly known as Reliance Energy) said Bombay High Court had sanctioned the scheme of amalgamation and arrangement in its June 20 order.         
	Upon filing of the order with the Registrar of Companies, the scheme has become effective from June 30.         
	Since the transferor company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the transferee company, no new shares are required to be issued to the members of the transferor and the entire share capital of the transferor firm stands cancelled, the statement added.         
	The company, however, did not give out reasons for the merger. In April, Reliance Energy was renamed Reliance Infrastructure as the company, either directly or through subsidiaries, was engaged in several infrastructure projects.         
	These included not only power generation, transmission and distribution projects but also other infrastructure projects such as highways, roads, bridges, metro rail, airports, special economic zones and real estate among others.         
	The new name appropriately reflects the current nature of the businesses. The new identity redefines the companys vision and focus to emerge as a premier infrastructure company, the Anil Ambani group had said.

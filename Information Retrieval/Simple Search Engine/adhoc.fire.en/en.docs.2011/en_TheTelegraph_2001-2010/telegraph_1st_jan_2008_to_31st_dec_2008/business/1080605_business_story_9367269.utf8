          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 4: Food companies are divided over the impact of the fuel price hike on prices. While some believe a price revision is imminent, others say they will try to absorb higher costs.        
	Arvinder Pal Singh, managing director of Lal Quilla, said, Inflation is likely to go up. With the rise in diesel prices, transportation costs are likely to go up.         
	We will pass part of the impact on to consumers while absorbing some of it ourselves, Singh added.        
	Dabur, however, has no plans to burden the consumer. Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur India, said, The rise in freight bill will be marginal. We have no plans of passing it on to customers.         
	Retailers are also feeling challenged by the soaring fuel prices. Salil Sahu, CEO of Home Stores India, said, We are trying to hold the prices of our food products as much as possible. For products such as rice, pulses and flour, we are trying to work on price efficiency internally.        
	The Home Stores CEO is also talking to major companies to find out ways of keeping costs low. Sahu does not think the footfall in his stores or its conversion rates into actual sales will fall. After all we deal in food and groceries  and one cant cut down on such purchases, he added.        
	According to Danish Beg, assistant finance controller of Rei Agro Ltd, The increase in diesel prices will have no major impact because raw materials constitute the main input cost for rice exporters. Mother Dairy, on the other hand, is taking a wait-and-watch approach. It will wait to see how things unfold in the long run before taking any decision.

	New Delhi, April 15: Home appliances company Whirlpool India will increase prices by 2-3 per cent.        
	The company, which hopes to break even from the last fiscal, will invest Rs 200 crore over the next three years.         
	We will increase prices by 2-3 per cent across our product portfolio in the April-June quarter. Subsequently, the company may decide on a further price rise if the situation so demands, said Shantanu Dasgupta, vice-president (marketing), Whirlpool India.        
	The industry has been facing a tough time with prices of inputs such as steel, plastics and aluminium going up considerably in the last few months. The input costs have gone up nearly 15 per cent. But, we have decided not to pass on the burden entirely to the consumers. So we will absorb as much as possiblebut some burden will have to be shared, said a company official.         
	Whirlpool had increased prices by 2-3 per cent in January. We expect to break even in 2007-08. This will be a record turnover. The results will be declared very soon, Dasgupta said.         
	In the last calendar year, the company grew 20 per cent and posted a net profit of Rs 15 crore in the nine months ended December 31, 2007. In 2006-07, Whirlpool had suffered a net loss of Rs 5.32 crore against a total income of Rs 1,496.78 crore.

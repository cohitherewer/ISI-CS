	New Delhi, Sept. 5: Political pressure is mounting on the Manmohan Singh government to reduce fuel prices as crude shows signs of falling below $100 a barrel.         
	Major parties, including the Congresss new ally Samajwadi Party, have voiced the need to reduce petrol and diesel prices to ease inflationary pressures.         
	Why should the prices of petrol and diesel not be reduced here. It has come down in the international market, asked Mohan Singh, leader of the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the Lok Sabha.        
	We have demanded the government reduce at least what had been increased, said the SP leader. The party has helped the government to stay afloat after the Left withdrew support to the government over the nuclear deal.        
	However, petroleum minister Murli Deora ruled out any immediate fuel relief, saying international rates will have to fall further to trigger a retail price reduction.        
	Oil companies are still losing money. Please pray that prices come down further so that we can consider reducing fuel tariff, Deora said.        
	In June, the government had hiked the price of petrol by Rs 5 per litre, diesel by Rs 3 and domestic LPG cylinder by Rs 50, along with a cut in the customs and excise duty.        
	Global crude prices have fallen to around $106 a barrel from its peak of $145 on June 15.         
	Jason Schwarz, energy strategist for Lone Peak Asset Management, has projected that prices would plummet to $30-$50 a barrel in the long term. His projection is contrary to a Goldman Sachs forecast that the price of crude oil could touch $200 a barrel by the end of the year.         
	Former finance minister and BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said, The party wants the government to reduce fuel prices as it will reduce inflationary pressure in the economy. However, the government would play politics with fuel prices and would only reduce it nominally before calling polls.        
	The Left parties said they would put pressure on the government by taking to the streets.        
	We want the government to at least roll back the hike. We will put pressure on the government by holding protest marches, demonstrations and meeting, said Basudev Acharya, leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the Lok Sabha.

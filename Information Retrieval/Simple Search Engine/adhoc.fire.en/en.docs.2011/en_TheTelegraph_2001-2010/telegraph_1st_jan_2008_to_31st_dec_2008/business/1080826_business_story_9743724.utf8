The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G contenders weigh options to cut costs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3G contenders weigh options to cut costs
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Gain Access                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Foreign telecom players looking to enter Indias third generation (3G) mobile space may tie up with new 2G service providers as virtual network operators to reduce rollout costs.        
	The government is planning to open the market for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) who will buy bulk airtime and resell it to customers under their own brand.        
	Officials believe this will not only increase competition but also help new 3G players to be successful. The aim is to give 3G players a more level-playing field to compete with existing telcos who already own 2G spectrum, they said.         
	New telecom firms entering the 3G space will get only 5 megahertz (Mhz) of radiowaves in the 2.1 Gigahetrz (Ghz) band, which if used for both voice and data transfer, will hamper service quality.         
	However, as MVNOs, 3G players will get access to the 1,800Mhz band of spectrum that is more efficient for voice calls and the 2.1Ghz band can be dedicated to high-speed data transfer.        
	By providing stand-alone high-end mobile value-added services such as real-time transactions, video streaming, and data services, the 3G operators can easily attain the minimum subscriber base of 50 lakh required to reach the break-even point, said Sudipto Basu, a telecom analyst.        
	Moreover, new 2G players would also want to partner experienced foreign players to be able to connect to a large customer base and bring in highly-specialised value-added services, Basu said.         
	Globally, companies such as the UKs Virgin Mobile, BT Mobile and Japans KDDI have set up their telecom strategy on the MVNO model. At present, there are 360 MVNOs operating globally.        
	According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), An MVNO could be a licensee in any service area. It can provide mobile services to its own customers through an agreement with the licensed mobile service provider.                                
	Trai has proposed to introduce MVNOs as distinct service providers with their own licensing and regulatory framework. Accordingly, MVNOs are to be issued a license under the Indian Telegraph Act.        
	Any company registered in India, which fulfils licence conditions such as 74 per cent foreign direct investment limit, net worth and paid-up capital would be eligible for MVNO licence, said Trai.        
	While, the government is yet to finalise the MVNO policy, analysts contend that the route will be opened up by the time 3G services starts, which is around six months from now.        
	The government will start by auctioning five 3G licences and depending on the spectrum available, this number could be extended to a dozen.        
	Globally, the number of operators per country ranges from two to a maximum of five. The UK has five 3G players, Australia and Brazil four each and most European states have between two and three. Singapore has only two players and the Philippines three.        
	Overall, there are 228 operators in 94 countries that offer 3G services.

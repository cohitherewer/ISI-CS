     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Singapore expects Bengal to put behind the the recent crisis over land acquisition and continue to attract foreign investment.
    
	The industry and the government have learnt a lesson from the recent developments. I am sure investor confidence will be restored soon. I am bullish on Bengal, said V. V. N. Balakrishnan, Singapores community development and youth sports minister. The minister, on his way to New Delhi, today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings and representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry at a city hotel.
    
	He said Singapore companies working in areas such as port, airport, community development and environment, would find Bengal an attractive destination.
    
	A business delegation from Singapore is likely to visit Calcutta to forge ties with local companies.
    
	The minister, however, did not disclose the details of the meeting with the chief minister. The chief ministers approach is very business friendly. He speaks the language of a businessman and understands a businessmans mind. He really wants to bring about some changes in the state. We also have an optimistic view about Bengal and are looking for opportunities here, he said after his meeting with Bhattacharjee. 
    
	The minister said the chief minister and business leaders have realised the need for early consultation, of being fair to the people and helping them cope with the future to manage the rapid changes taking place in the state. I am impressed with what I saw. I will apprise the industry back home, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Manmohan Singh government is under pressure to cut fuel prices further.        
	Global crude prices have fallen to around $34 a barrel despite the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deciding to cut production by 2.2 million barrels per day from January.        
	Faced with criticism from the Opposition on the issue of fuel price cut, Lok Sabha leader Pranab Mukherjee said, We are alive to this problem. We will come to the House as soon as a decision is taken.        
	The price of the Indian basket of crude, which was at $41.84 a barrel yesterday, is expected to fall further with the continuing slide in global crude amid fears of a prolonged worldwide recession.        
	The government had earlier indicated a further reduction in fuel prices. We will watch crude oil prices to see if a further reduction is possible, home minister P. Chidambaram had said.        
	At a meeting in London, petroleum minister Murli Deora today said, Oil prices should be reasonable. It should neither be too low to discourage investment nor too high playing havoc with import dependent economies.         
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the government was evaluating the options but would not like to add to the burden of oil companies.

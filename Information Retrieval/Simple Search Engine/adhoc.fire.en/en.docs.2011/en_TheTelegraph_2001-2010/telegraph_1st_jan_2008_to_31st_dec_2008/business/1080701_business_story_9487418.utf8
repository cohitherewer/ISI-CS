	Calcutta, June 30: Homegrown Jai Balaji Group hopes to get land from the Bengal government for the first phase of its proposed 5 million tonne (mt) steel mill project during this fiscal.        
	The company, the eighth largest steel producer in the country, is seeking 1,500 acres for the initial phase of the project. The capacity of the plant will be 2mt in the first phase. It also wants to put up a 400 mega watt (MW) power and a 1mt cement plant, with a cumulative investment of Rs 5,000 crore.         
	Aditya Jajodia, chairman and managing director of Jai Balaji Group, said the project could be completed within 40 months after the transfer of land. Government agencies have identified 1,200 acres for the initial phase. They have acquired 500-600 acres so far. We hope the rest will come in the next 8-9 months, Jajodia said after announcing the annual result of Jai Balaji Industries.        
	The company had signed an agreement with the Bengal government last October for a 5mt steel plant. The project, worth Rs 16,000 crore, also involves a 3mt cement plant and a 1250MW power plant.        
	Jai Balaji Group officials said an all-party consensus had been built for the project, which is coming up on low yield land. It has sought 3,800 acres from the Bengal government for the entire project.        
	Jajodia said the company had discussed the rehabilitation package with the state government for the displaced. Efforts would made to provide employment to most of the displaced.        
	Good show        
	In the last fiscal, Jai Balaji Industries reported total revenue of Rs 1,347.28 crore, representing a growth rate of 29.7 per cent over the previous year.        
	Net profit grew to Rs 118.87 crore, an increase of 91 per cent. The company will complete its Rs 1,700-crore expansion project during this year. We are one of the top three investors in Bengal. We put up a 1 mt plant in three-and-a-half years, Jajodia said.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 22: Global cues are not the only reasons behind the carnage on the domestic stock markets. Experts feel that aggressive selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) over the past few days have also contributed to the sharp fall.
    
	FIIs, who pumped in a record $17 billion into the Indian stock markets in 2007, have turned passive since the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) came out with guidelines on participatory notes (P-Notes) in October last year. While the regulator plugged a controversial avenue through which most of the investments came, brokers feel the FIIs have slowed down their purchases since then. 
    
	In the last four sessions, in particular, FIIs had been net sellers to the tune of $2 billion. Provisional data available for today estimated that these investors, who also sold in many other markets, took away nearly Rs 4,000 crore from the table.
    
	According to Shahina Mukadam, head of research at IDBI Capital, Profit booking and selling by FIIs in the last couple of sessions have been major factors in the sharp market correction. 
    
	Amitabh Chakraborty, president (equity) of Religare Securities, said, The exogenous factors, such as fears of a US recession, have caused risk aversion, so a few FIIs have sold. Additionally some large proprietory book players had to liquidate their position, not only in India but also across Asia. 
    
	An analyst with a foreign brokerage said FIIs had largely stayed away because of the P-Note norms and the fact that valuations were stretched.
    
	They could return, albeit slowly, with valuations now looking reasonable. While their interest will initially be limited to blue-chip stocks, quarterly results and the forthcoming Union budget will also be keenly watched, he said.
    
	Last October, the market regulator had decided that P-Notes, which accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the FII flows into India, will only be issued to entities that are regulated. Sebi had also ruled that there would be no fresh issuance of P-Notes in derivatives, even as it allowed FIIs to wind up positions in 18 months. 
    
	Similarly, FIIs will not be allowed to issue participatory notes for more than 40 per cent of their assets under custody. Brokers said though there was a positive response to Sebis plan to allow sub-accounts that issue P-Notes to register as FIIs, the process was expected to take some more time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Borrowings to put strain on profits
                                                                                                               Borrowings to put strain on profits
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, March 26: The Tatas have shown great appetite for overseas buyouts, but analysts have started to fret about the impact that the heavy borrowings and new investments will have on the balancesheet.        
	Jaguar and Land Rover could pose some of the biggest challenges to the group.        
	Experts reckon that the Tatas face stress tests in several areas. First, Tata Motors has to ensure that the $2.3-billion acquisition does not adversely affect its balancesheet.         
	Second, it has to pump investments into Jaguar and Land Rover to ensure that these brands do not lose their iconic status. And third, they will have to invest heavily in research and development to ensure that the cars are able to meet the tough emission standards that will come into effect in Europe from 2012.        
	Vaishali Jajoo, auto analyst at Angel Broking, said the JLR acquisition would be beneficial for Tata Motors in the long run, but it could be a drag on the balancesheet in the short term. Jajoo said Tata Motors would have to continuously pump money into both Jaguar and Land Rover for the next couple of years for promotion and R amp;D expenditure. They may have to put in $500-800 million as capital expenditure annually, she added.        
	Piyush Parag, an analyst at Religare Research, shared Jajoos concern. Although the JLR deal would be value accretive to Tata Motors, Parag said there were some tough challenges ahead.        
	Though Tata Motors will now get two of the most powerful luxury brands and its portfolio will grow, it will have to see how best it can integrate these businesses and cut costs. Further, it will have to maintain the product quality to face competition. The risks are certainly high, he added.                
	Last year, both Jaguar and Land Rover spent more than Rs 3,600 crore on R amp;D alone while the expenditure at Tata Motors was over Rs 700 crore.         
	Standard amp; Poors has already placed Tata Motors corporate credit ratings on watch with negative implications.         
	Its credit analyst Anshukant Taneja had earlier in a report argued, This would be a large scale acquisition for Tata Motors that could potentially have a negative impact on the corporate credit ratings of the company, especially if it is heavily funded by debt.        
	There is also a worry on the financial performance of Jaguar. Although details of the balancesheets of both are not known, it is felt that while Land Rover is profitable, Jaguar has not yet reached that stage.         
	However, at a conference call post the acquisition, C. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer of Tata Motors, expressed the confidence that profits at both the entities would grow in the days ahead.        
	Tata Motors will also have to grapple with other tests. This was evident late last year when it was in the race. Then US Jaguar dealers had shown their disappointment towards an Indian company acquiring the luxury brand.         
	The Wall Street Journal quoted chairman of the Jaguar Business Operations Council Ken Gorin as saying that the two brands should not be sold to Indian companies.        
	I dont believe the US public is ready for ownership out of India for a luxury car brand such as Jaguar... I believe it would throw a tremendous cast of doubt over the viability of the brand, he had then said.         
	Observers say that this indeed will be a challenge for Tata Motors, which is present across small cars to trucks and is now coming out with the worlds cheapest car.        
	While Ford Motor Credit Company will provide financing for Jaguar and Land Rover dealers and customers during a transitional period, which can vary by market of up to 12 months, Tata Motors managing director Ravi Kant said the company would make its own arrangements of having tieups with vehicle financiers in the UK, the US and Europe within the 12-month time frame.

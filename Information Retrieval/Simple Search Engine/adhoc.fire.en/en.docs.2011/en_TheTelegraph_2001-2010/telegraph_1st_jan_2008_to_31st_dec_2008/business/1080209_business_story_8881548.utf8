The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal puts brakes on steel rush

	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Bengal has decided not to sign fresh agreements in steel for the time being.        
	It has, so far, signed 13 memorandums of agreement with prospective investors to set up steel projects, promising them to provide land, coal and water.         
	There are a few more proposals in the pipeline. But we will first sort out the requirements of the 13 projects on hand before entering into any fresh pact, Sabyasachi Sen, Bengal commerce and industry secretary, told The Telegraph.        
	The state government will set up a committee to look into the various requirements of these projects.        
	We do not want to get into a position where the government fails to honour its commitments, Sen said.        
	These 13 projects will produce 27 million tonnes of steel.         
	The companies, including JSW Bengal Steel, Videocon, Bhushan Steel and Jai Balaji Group, have also proposed captive power plants to feed their steel operations.        
	With cumulative investments of over Rs 1 lakh crore in steel, Bengal is now in a position to take on Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.        
	These three states have iron ore reserves, unlike Bengal.        
	Orissa and Jharkhand, too, have received a slew of proposals in steel and they have signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) rather indiscriminately.         
	The Bengal government, on the other hand, has signed agreements entailing greater commitments on the part of both the state and the project promoters. The latest was signed on Monday.        
	The neighbouring states, though, are not pressing the pause button on fresh MoUs as yet.        
	Sen said the committee, comprising experts from the steel industry, would suggest the amount of land necessary for each project.        
	There is a tendency to ask for more land than actually required. The committee will give us a clear picture, Sen said.        
	A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the steel companies have sought more than 20,000 acres of land cumulatively.        
	Sen expressed concern about the viability of the projects in the long run as all of them would have to depend on the market for crucial raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal.        
	It is easy to get carried away and sign deals. But the government must see long-term viability, he said.         
	State industry minister Nirupam Sen had gone on record saying that steel projects would not take off if the state failed to provide captive coal mines.        
	The industry secretary said captive coal would be given only after projects achieved financial closure.

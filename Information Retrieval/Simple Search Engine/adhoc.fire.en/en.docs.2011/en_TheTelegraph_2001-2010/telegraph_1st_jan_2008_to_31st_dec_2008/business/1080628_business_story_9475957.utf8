          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 27: Air travel can turn even costlier with the price of crude touching $142 and jet fuel $160 a barrel.         
	Officials of airline companies said state-run oil companies had sounded them out for a Rs 2,000-2,500 per kilolitre (kl) increase in jet fuel price, which may come about next week.        
	Airlines, which had earlier this month raised fares after a huge increase in jet fuel prices, are likely to revise upwards their fuel surcharge, which they charge passengers over and above ticket price and tax.         
	The three largest airlines  Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines  had last week increased their base fares for up to 750 km by Rs 1000, between 750 km and 1000 km by Rs 2,250 and beyond 1000 km by Rs 3,000. Low cost airlines such as SpiceJet and GoAir increased their fares at that time by about Rs 350 and Rs 500 in two slabs. Ticket prices have risen by nearly 40 per cent over the last six months, and airlines are expected to end this fiscal year with losses of about Rs 8,000 crore.         
	The state-run oil marketing companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation had increased jet fuel prices by Rs 10,839-12,375 per kl on June 1. Prices were, however, lowered by approximately Rs 3,000 per kl after the government reduced the customs duty. Prices have almost doubled in the last one year.         
	Oil product prices        
	The government isnt likely to raise the prices of petroleum products even though global crude oil topped $ 142 a barrel, with expectations that it could hit $200 by winter this year.         
	The government is chary of passing on oil prices as it can stoke inflation, which is already at a 13-year high of 11.42 per cent, especially with elections due in states such as Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh this winter followed by a general election next year.         
	Earlier this month, the government had increased the price of petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 3 a litre to take into account crude oil prices which were over at around $113 a barrel. Since then, inflation has shot up from 8.1 per cent to 11.42 per cent.

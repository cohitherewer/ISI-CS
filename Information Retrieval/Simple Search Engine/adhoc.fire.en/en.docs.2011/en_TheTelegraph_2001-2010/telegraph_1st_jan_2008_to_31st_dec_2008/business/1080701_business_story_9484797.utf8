	New Delhi, June 30: State-run banks who will be writing off around Rs 71,000 crore of farm loans will have to give at least Rs 50,000 crore of fresh loans to farmers in the kharif season to meet a lending target.        
	Top finance ministry officials, monitoring the loan write-off by the banks, said they had advised bankers to lend at least Rs 50,000 crore to maintain the minimum level of bank loans in agriculture.         
	Bankers are expected to lend at least 13.5 per cent of their total funds to the agriculture sector, which includes farmers and artisans. Before the loan waiver was announced, the banks had lent about Rs 2,45,000 crore. In the waiver proposal, loans worth Rs 59,000 crore of small and marginal farmers will be waived fully.        
	For large farmers, the banks will write off Rs 12,680 crore, if they pay back 75 per cent of their loans which, officials said, will be about Rs 37,500 crore.        
	Banks will be either writing off or getting back money which will total about Rs 100,000 crore. This means that most banks will be way below their target lending mark and will have to advance fresh loans to the farm sector almost immediately afterwards and this is what we sought, the officials said. From July, farmers will be eligible for fresh bank loans for the ongoing kharif season.         
	The officials said farmers in Punjab, western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana  the countrys leading grain producing regions  will get the lions share of the fresh loans, though they are not the major beneficiaries of the waiver as they have cleaner balance sheets.        
	According to data of the ministrys banking division, based on inputs by banks, around Rs 986 crore will be written off for some 3 lakh Punjab farmers, while six lakh Haryana farmers will get a waiver of Rs 2,108 crore.         
	On the other hand, Tamil Nadu farmers will see a waiver of Rs 5,000 crore.         
	The officials said banks, too, were more comfortable in giving loans to the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh because of their good loan payment record. Besides, with the kharif planting coming up, these states will also need more money as advances.         
	In the original scheme, announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram in Parliament, the government gave a complete loan waiver to all small and marginal farmers with up to 5 acres of land and a 25 per cent write off to bigger farmers who were willing to pay back outstanding loan dues. The package then was expected to cost about Rs 60,000 crore.        
	Later, the government extended the package to arid and dry regions. All farmers, including those with large holdings, in 237 identified dry and arid districts will be eligible for debt relief of either 25 per cent of their outstanding loans, or Rs 20,000, whichever is higher.        
	This was done after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi demanded in Parliament an extension of the scheme to farmers with holdings of over 5 acres in dry and arid districts.

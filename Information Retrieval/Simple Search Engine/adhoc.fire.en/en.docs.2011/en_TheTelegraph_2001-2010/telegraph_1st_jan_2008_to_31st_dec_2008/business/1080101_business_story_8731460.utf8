     OUR BUREAU
                      
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: Nifty  the poor cousin  has outshone the sensex, the markets bellwether index, this year.
    
	The Nifty cracked up a return of 54.7 per cent at the end of the last day of trading in 2007. On December 29 last year, which was the last day of trading in 2006, the Nifty had closed at 3966.4.
    
	In contrast, the sensex has risen by 47.2 per cent. The two indices are not strictly comparable: the sensex has 30 stocks while the Nifty has 50. Except DLF and Wipro, all the other sensex stocks are represented on the Nifty.
    
	But the real story for the retail investor over the past five years has been the eye-popping growth clocked by the sensex since the last day of trading in 2002. 
    
	The last time that the Nifty fared better than the sensex was on December 31, 2001: the markets had crashed that year from year-ago levels. The sensex closed 17.87 per cent lower, while Nifty had ended with a loss of 16.18 per cent.
    
	With three consecutive years of over 40 per cent growth in the sensex, the big question on everyones mind is this: will 2008 see the same sort of growth?
    
	The market pundits dont think so. Most tend to believe that investors will have to prepare for a modest 20 per cent growth next year.
    
	The year has been excellent in terms of returns, but the market will not be able continue with over 40 per cent returns in 2008.
    
	A compounded annual growth rate of 18 to 20 per cent seems to be more feasible, said Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking Ltd. Agrawal reckons the sensex will touch 23000 by December 2008.
    
	The technology pack was in the doghouse this year as a 15 per cent surge in the rupees value against the dollar depressed profitability.
    
	Agrawal believes that the IT stocks may see an uptrend in 2008. Metals, capital goods and oil and gas shares dominated the year on Dalal Street, clocking more than 100 per cent returns. Metal stocks led the pack, notching up gains of 121.5 per cent.
    
	In 2008, we are expecting some good rallies in midcap stocks, said Sree Sankar, head of Research at IL amp;FS Investsmart.
    
	The market is unlikely to maintain over 40 per cent returns as we are entering the New Year with a very high base. Global trends will hurt India the least among the Asian markets in 2008. Metal has been the star performer of the year, but infrastructure is going to replace it as the frontrunner in 2008, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (market strategy) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

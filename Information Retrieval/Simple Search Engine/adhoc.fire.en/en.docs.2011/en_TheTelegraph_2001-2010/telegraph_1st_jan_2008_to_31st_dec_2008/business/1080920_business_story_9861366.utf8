	Mumbai, Sept. 19 (PTI): Mobile phone users may soon be able to credit or debit money from their bank accounts using their handsets, if the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) proposed guidelines to banks for mobile payments come into practice.        
	A mobile payment involves debiting or crediting funds into a customers account on the basis of instruction received through cellular phones.        
	According to the RBIs draft, licensed banks will be allowed to offer the services to Indian residents after getting approval from their boards. The facility will be restricted only to those bank and credit card accounts which comply with know-your-customer norms, an RBI release said.        
	Only Indian currency will be used, and cross-border money transfers through mobile banking are prohibited.        
	The central bank has invited comments from the public by September 29.        
	The RBI said the rules would enable the transfer of funds from an account in one bank to another in the same bank or any other on a real-time basis, irrespective of the mobile network of the customer.        
	Anti-money laundering rules will be applicable to customers opting for mobile-based banking services. The guidelines on combating the financing of terrorism would also be implemented from time to time, the draft said.         
	Only those banks which have core banking solutions will be permitted to provide the service.

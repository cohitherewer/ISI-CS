                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Real estate stocks fall from investors grace

	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Bargain hunters need not forage beyond realty stocks for value buying on Dalal Street.        
	In January, when the 30-share sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange touched a lifetime high of 21000 points, Housing Development amp; Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) quoted a price of Rs 1,432 a share. Now share prices of 11 out of the 14 companies constituting the BSE realty index aggregate to less than Rs 1,430 even after a 9 per cent gain in the sectoral index today. These companies are HDIL, DLF, Ansal Housing amp; Infrastructure, Indiabulls Real Estate, Mahindra Lifespace, Omaxe Ltd, Orbit Company, Parsvnath Developers, Phoenix Mills, Sobha Developers and Unitech Ltd.         
	The BSE realty index, the hardest hit among all the sectoral indices in the recent sell-off bout, fell from its all-time high of 13848.09 points reached in January this year to a low of 2490.73 last Friday  a decline of over 82 per cent in nine months. The real estate sector lost its attractiveness to investors for a number of reasons, said an equity researcher at Sharekhan, a stock broking firm.         
	Real estate companies have been the largest recipient of foreign institutional investors (FII) money that fuelled the share prices of these companies. When FIIs started pulling out from domestic markets, the share prices of real-estate companies went into a free fall, he said.        
	In January, the investors were willing to pay any premium for stocks of these real estate companies. The price multiple for BSE realty index rose around 75 on January 14, implying that investors were willing to pay Rs 75 for an earning of Re 1 per share.         
	After the sustained selloff, investor enthusiasm in real-estate companies has evaporated. As on Friday, the index traded at a price multiple of less than 10 and at a price-to-book value ratio of only 2.61. The book value is the actual worth of a stock in the companys books and it is measured as the net worth of the company minus its liabilities.        
	Oil India float        
	Oil India Ltds (OIL) initial public offering (IPO) has been deferred by at least a month because of the choppy market conditions.        
	OIL was to launch its IPO of 2.64 crore equity shares on November 10, but the reversal of fortunes on the stock markets has led to a rethink on the timing.         
	I do not know when the issue will be rescheduled but it is unlikely to happen before December, a senior company official said.

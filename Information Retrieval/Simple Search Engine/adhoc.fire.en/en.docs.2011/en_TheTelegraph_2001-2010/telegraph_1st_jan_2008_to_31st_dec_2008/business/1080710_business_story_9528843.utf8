          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 9: A survey of Dun amp; Bradstreet (D amp;B) shows that high inflation has led to the business optimism index sinking to its lowest since the fourth quarter of 2004.        
	Rising input costs and the inability of manufacturing units to pass them on to consumers because of poor demand caused the composite business optimism index to drop 11.2 per cent from the previous quarter to 136.5 points. On a year-on-year basis, the index declined 18 per cent.        
	D amp;B said that all the six optimism indices  volumes of sales, net profits, selling prices, new orders, inventory levels and employee strength  declined compared with the previous quarter. The level was particularly low in the consumer durables and basic goods sectors.        
	Since consumer durables are interest sensitive, D amp;B attributed the low optimism to falling demands after the increase in interest rates last month.         
	According to D amp;B, profit expectations continued to be moderate for the sixth consecutive quarter. About 58 per cent of the respondents felt that profits would rise in the third quarter of this year, while more than 40 per cent anticipated a fall or no change in their net profits in the forthcoming quarter.        
	While around 71 per cent of the respondents expected sales volume to increase, 13 per cent felt that a decline in sales volume was imminent.

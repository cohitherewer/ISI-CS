          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          Money matters                                  
	Calcutta, May 27: Banks had invested Rs 41,223 crore in mutual fund instruments, particularly in liquid and money market schemes, till May 9 in the current financial year.         
	This is three times more than the corresponding period last year, according to the latest weekly data of the Reserve Bank of India. Scheduled commercial banks had invested Rs 12,329 crore between March 30 and May 11 last year.        
	Banks also invested Rs 41,210 crore in SLR (statutory liquidity requirement) instruments during the period compared with Rs 21,897 crore last year.        
	In their non-SLR investments, commercial banks preferred short-term income schemes of mutual funds, such as fixed maturity and liquid/money market plans, to commercial papers, shares and the bond/debenture issues of public sector and private sector enterprises.         
	According to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds of India, the net inflows in income funds and liquid/money market schemes in April this year were Rs 36,203 crore and Rs 35,310 crore, respectively. Net inflows in income plans and liquid/money market schemes of mutual funds in April 2007 were Rs 6,637 crore and Rs 7,380 crore, respectively.        
	Because of a sluggish growth in credit and a huge buoyancy in deposits, banks are faced with excess liquidity. The money could not be invested in the sagging and volatile equity markets. Even the returns from the overnight call money markets are down.         
	Banks found short-term income and liquid schemes of mutual funds more remunerative, said a treasury manager with a public sector bank on conditions of anonymity.        
	The volatile stock market also prompted retail investors to turn to banks.         
	Bank fixed deposits grew Rs 90,037 crore between March 28 and May 9 this year compared with Rs 49,527 crore over the same period last year.         
	The growth in bank fixed deposits came on the back of a lower interest rate.         
	During the same time last year, banks were offering an annual interest rates between 9.5 and 10 per cent for fixed deposits of one to three years.

	Calcutta, April 14: ICICI Securities, a wholly owned arm of ICICI Bank, mobilised the maximum amount of funds through public issues in 2007-08. Public issues cover initial public offerings (IPOs), rights and follow-on offers.        
	It managed 15 issues to mobilise Rs 38,331.42 crore, or 73.4 per cent of the total capital raised from the domestic primary market, in the last financial year. There were 91 IPOs and follow-on offers in 2007-08 that raised about Rs 52,253 crore.         
	Eighty-five initial public offerings raised Rs 41,358 crore, while six companies tapped the capital market for the second time to mobilise about Rs 10,895 crore.         
	Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank, followed ICICI Securities, mopping up Rs 32,528.45 crore from 19 issues. Enam Securities came third, managing 17 issues to raise Rs 31,057.20 crore.         
	At Rs 52,253 crore, funds raised through IPOs and follow-on offers in 2007-08 were 109 per cent higher than the Rs 24,993 crore raised in 2006-07.        
	Mobilisation from IPOs would have been more but for the two secondary market crashes that forced a number of companies such as Emaar MGF, Wockhardt Hospitals, IT People and SVEC Constructions to postpone their issues.         
	Besides, there were only two public sector undertakings  Powergrid Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation  which sold equity shares to the public in 2007-08, offering Rs 1,814 crore.         
	Though mobilisation through IPOs and follow-on offers rose 109 per cent, the number of issues increased by just six to 91 from 85, meaning funds mobilisation per issue was much higher than in 2006-07. In 2007-08, fund-raising through rights issues was at an all-time high.         
	Thirty companies offered shares to raise Rs 32,518 crore. In 2006-07, there were 38 rights issues that raised just Rs 3,703 crore.         
	The largest rights issue in 2007-08 was from the State Bank of India (Rs 16,736 crore).         
	Other big rights issues were of Tata Steel (Rs 9,135 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 2,141 crore) and Indian Hotels (Rs 1,447 crore).

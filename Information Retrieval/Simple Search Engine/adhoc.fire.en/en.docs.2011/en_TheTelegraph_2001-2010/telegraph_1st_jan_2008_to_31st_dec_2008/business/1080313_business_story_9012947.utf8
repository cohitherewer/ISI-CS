	Net sales rose 14.76 per cent to Rs 550.78 crore from Rs 479.92 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Exports during the quarter grew 61.90 per cent to Rs 251.41 crore from Rs 155.29 crore.        
	Tyre manufacturer Ceat Ltd is the flagship company of Rs 13,500-crore RPG Group.         
	According to reports, the proceeds of the sale will help in the expansion of the company.         
	The transaction will not affect Ceats existing tyre manufacturing operations or its employees.         
	The companys ongoing operations will continue on the 24-acre land it has near Bhandup.

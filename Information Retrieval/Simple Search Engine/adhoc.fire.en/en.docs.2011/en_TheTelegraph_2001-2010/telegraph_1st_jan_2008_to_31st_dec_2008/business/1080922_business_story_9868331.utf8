	Washington, Sept. 21 (Reuters): The Bush administration has asked Congress for a $700-billion bailout package for firms burdened with bad mortgage debt, seeking extraordinary authority as it tackles the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.        
	Democratic lawmakers said they hoped to approve the bailout quickly but wanted changes such as more oversight, limits on executive pay at participating firms and assistance for homeowners.        
	US treasury secretary Henry Paulson will have sweeping powers over the massive war chest and his decisions will not be reviewed by any court. The government could acquire up to $700 billion in home and commercial mortgages from the US-headquartered banks and other institutions over the next two years.

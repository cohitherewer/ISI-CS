The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crisis casts cloud over 3G rollout deadline
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crisis casts cloud over 3G rollout deadline

	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The rollout of 3G mobile services, scheduled to start from January 2009, may be delayed by more than six months because of the global financial crisis and problems relating to spectrum.        
	The financial turmoil has dampened the spirits of foreign and domestic telecom players who were earlier eager to battle high licence fees and a spectrum crunch.        
	Citing the crisis, private operator Vodafone Essar has asked the department of telecom (DoT) to postpone the auction of 3G spectrum.         
	For a pan-India licence, the government has fixed a reserve price of Rs 2,020 crore and is looking at garnering about Rs 25,000 crore from the bidding process.         
	Operators are of the view that the liquidity problems of global banks and financial institutions could make borrowing difficult.         
	Shortage of spectrum is also weighing heavily on the minds of policy makers.         
	The defence authorities are yet to vacate unused spectrum because the construction of an alternative telecom network for them has still not been completed.        
	The defence forces are expected to vacate around 25-30 Mhz (megahertz) of spectrum in the 2.1-gigahertz band.         
	However, it will take three to six months for military forces to switch to the optical fibre-based alternative communication network and vacate spectrum space, industry experts said.         
	S.D. Saxena, director (finance) of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, said that the PSU would be able to complete the alternative network only by the year-end.        
	Officials of the DoT said that in Delhi it was in a position to accommodate just three operators instead of six because of the shortage of spectrum. In Rajasthan there is no spectrum available at all, the officials said.         
	The DoT is also required to resolve the issue of separating revenues earned from 2G and 3G services to accurately fix spectrum use fees.         
	It had recently stipulated that firms would need to pay one per cent of their gross revenues from 3G services as a fee for spectrum use compared with 4-6 per cent from 2G services. The DoT, however, did not specify the process.        
	The lower spectrum charge will be an incentive for foreign players, reeling under a credit crunch.         
	However, any revision in the method of calculating spectrum charges can force foreign firms to do a rethink of their investment plans.        
	The DoT has already set up a panel, which is expected to submit its report by October-end. The department has appointed Rothschild to conduct the e-auction of 3G spectrum and plans to complete the process by January 2009.

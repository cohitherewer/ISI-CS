	Calcutta, June 27: The National Housing Bank (NHB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India and the regulator of non-banking housing finance companies, will soon start accepting fixed deposits from the public.         
	NHB is allowed to accept term deposits with more than one-year maturity from the public, chairman and managing director S. Sridhar said here today.         
	So far, we havent introduced a fixed deposit scheme. But given our changed focus to facilitate rural housing and growing business in terms of loan refinancing and direct project financing, we have decided to mobilise public money beginning this year through fixed deposits and zero coupon bonds, he added.        
	The NHB chairman was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	Sridhar said the NHB had already approached the finance ministry for income tax benefit under section 80C for its proposed fixed deposits having tenure of more than five years. We are awaiting approval from the government for the tax benefit and once we get that, well launch the term deposit schemes, he said.        
	The NHB is planning to offer term deposits with different maturity varying from one year to 10 years. Fixed deposits of less than five years will, however, get no tax benefit, Sridhar said, adding that the interest rate on these deposit schemes would be in line with the market rates.         
	He said the NHB would soon launch zero coupon bonds with a maturity of 10 years. Zero coupon bonds are discount bonds, which are issued at a price less than their face value. On redemption, bondholders get the face value. Since these bonds do not offer any coupon or interest, the income is considered as capital gains.         
	Hence, the tax incidence on income from zero coupon bonds is lower  a 10 per cent long-term capital gains tax  than a 30 per cent (at the highest tax bracket) income tax on interest income in bank fixed deposits.

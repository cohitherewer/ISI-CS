   Calcutta leads rally          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: With crude oil on fire, gold has started to sparkle.        
	The yellow metal crossed a key threshold when it topped Rs 12,000 per 10 gms today in all the domestic markets.        
	The rally was led by Calcutta where gold peaked at Rs 12,225, followed by Delhi at Rs 12,040.         
	In Mumbai and Chennai, gold advanced to Rs 12,005 and Rs 11,930, respectively.        
	Gold is typically used as a hedge when other markets ride a roller coaster.        
	There are two fundamental reasons for the rally in gold. First, there is a huge demand supply gap globally; second, the inflationary pressures have started to build up in the US markets with crude oil prices crossing $100 mark, quot; Keyur Shah, associate director of the World Gold Council, told The Telegraph.        
	The market, however, expects gold prices to stabilise and come down.        
	According to World Gold Council estimates, there is a gap of 1000 tonnes between demand and supply.         
	Global gold supplies are estimated at 2,500 tonnes but demand has peaked at 3,500 tonnes, Shah added.        
	We are watching the movement of the rupee before we make any prediction about gold prices. Todays peak was a result of the weakening Indian rupee, said an analyst with a leading brokerage house in Mumbai.        
	The April contract, he said, is trading at Rs 11,800 levels.        
	Gold rose to a three-week high in the Asian markets after crude oil prices crossed the $100 mark yesterday, enhancing the appeal of the bullion as a hedge against inflation.         
	Further expectations that the US central bank might lower borrowing costs to support the US economy also acted as a catalyst.        
	Gold purchases gathered momentum after reports of a steep rise in crude oil prices in the overseas markets and tumbling domestic bourses, forcing investors to park their funds in gold, which is always considered as a safe haven.        
	Silver was also 0.3 per cent higher at $17.58 an ounce. Silver ready remained steady in brisk buying activity and shot up further by Rs 340 to Rs 21,840 per kg. According to analysts, speculative buying sparked the silver rally.        
	Silver coins also traded higher by Rs 100 to Rs 26,100 for buying and Rs 26,200 for selling of 100 coins.

	Dec. 2: Tata Steel unit Corus has asked the Dutch government to subsidise a reduction in staff work hours equivalent to a cut in 1,100 full-time jobs.        
	Corus spokesperson Dick Schiethart said in Amsterdam the reduction in hours would be spread across 6,400 workers, who would each work one day less per week over a period of six weeks.        
	He said Corus had applied for a government-funded work-reduction scheme, which was part of a 6-billion-euro ($7.6 billion) package announced last month to boost the flagging Dutch economy.        
	Under the scheme, affected workers would be paid 70 per cent of their wages through unemployment benefits, while Corus would pay the remaining.         
	In Mumbai, Corus chief executive Philippe Varin hinted that the company would soon approach the UK government urging them to introduce a similar facility in the country as well.        
	Corus, Europes second-largest steel maker, said last month it expected to produce about 30 per cent less crude steel than planned during the two quarters to the end of March 2009 because of the global economic slowdown.         
	Schiethart said the reduction in work hours stemmed from the cut in production, but declined to indicate how much money the company would save if granted the support.

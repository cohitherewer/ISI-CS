          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                 Load Factor      
	Mumbai, June 4: The rise in oil prices will directly impact foodgrains and vegetable prices, with transporters saying they will pass on the hike to customers.         
	The All India Motor Transport Congress, the representative body of truckers and transporters, will meet tomorrow to work out the impact of the fuel price hike and announce new freight charges. Transporters say freight rates are likely go up 15 to 20 per cent.         
	Prices of perishables such as vegetables, fruits, fish and eggs will rise first along with construction material such as steel, cement and stone chips, said Haranjit Singh, managing director of Calcutta-headquartered logistics firm Northern Cargo Service. Diesel costs will rise to 65 per cent of overall expenses from 35 per cent earlier.         
	Besides fuel costs, the prices of all other inputs, including tyres, engine oil, and other lubricants, will also go up. We will ask our customers to bear with us, said Promod Gupta, managing director of EFC Logistics Indian Pvt Ltd.         
	The freight cost for every tonne on the Calcutta-Mumbai route will increase to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,300. Prices of rice, wheat and other foodgrains are set to rise one per cent in the wholesale market. This will translate into a hike of Rs 1 to Rs 2 per kilo at the retailer level, said Nilesh Veera, honorary secretary general of the Grain Rice and Oil Seeds Merchants Association.         
	Other transporters, including cargo and courier companies, are also gearing up to raise freight rates.

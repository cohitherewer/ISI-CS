The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Duty cut high on trade plan agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Duty cut high on trade plan agenda

	New Delhi, April 6: The foreign trade policy, to be announced on Friday, could make the import of food articles, commodities and metals cheaper, both to check inflation and make industry competitive globally by allowing firms access to raw materials at a lower cost.        
	To check prices, the government has scrapped import duties on edible oils, banned the export of non-basmati rice, cut duties on maize imports to zero from 15 per cent and extended the ban on pulse export by a year. It has also banned the export of edible oils and scrapped the export refund schemes in steel and cement.        
	With inflation touching a more-than-three-year high of 7 per cent, the government is expected to boost imports and encourage exports of only those value-added products that do not push inflation.        
	Analysts said inflation in commodities such as rice and pulses was because of a shortage in the supply of rice of up to 4 million tonnes and pulses of up to 2 million tonnes.         
	Fiscal measures such as reducing customs duties for a short period of time until prices stabilise will help to bridge the gap between demand and supply. There could be a similar move in metals and metal products.        
	There could be some relief in the policy for labour-intensive export-oriented units hit hard by rupee appreciation.        
	The policy is likely to set an export target of about $220-225 billion, buoyed by a robust 35.25 per cent growth rate in February.         
	The commerce ministry has done a survey of 300 factories to find out the number of workers in them in April 2007 and in November-December of the same year.         
	Officials said if the data was extrapolated, job losses could be 10-15 lakh because of the appreciation of the rupee.        
	Trade analyst Linu Mathew Philip with the Centre for Trade and Development said, As a dynamic developing nation, the rupee appreciation is only natural  protecting the exporters from its ill effects can only be a short-term measure but it cannot form the main essence of the foreign trade policy.        
	To tackle rupee appreciation, officials said in the EPCG (export promotion capital goods) scheme, exporters could be eligible for tax incentives without any rider on export obligation.         
	Greater assistance is also likely under the focus product and the focus market schemes.         
	To boost the agriculture sector, officials said, efforts will be made to include items such as cotton, jute and coir under the special agriculture and village industry scheme.        
	Exporters are expecting an announcement on the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme that was extended last week from March 31 till further notification.        
	Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, If the government plans to come out with any new scheme to replace DEPB, it should be made known before. Otherwise, it should continue till 2010, when the goods and services tax is introduced.        
	Exporters are also demanding the refund of state levies, as is the case with central taxes.        
	Analysts said, The Centre has to find out some mechanism to get the state levies exempted on exports as goods will have to be exported, not taxes. Though the government has extended the refund of service tax paid by exporters to 16 services, exporters will be looking forward to the inclusion of services provided to the developer of a special economic zone. The officials said there would be sector-specific relief for floriculture and leather products.        
	There is a lucrative overseas market for flowers, while the leather sector is labour-intensive and has suffered a severe employment loss because of the rise in the value of the rupee.        
	Analysts said India should move up the value chain and focus on high-end products. Rather than being labour-intensive, exports should be more knowledge-intensive, they added.

                                      Rahul Bajaj: Awaiting peace    
	Mumbai, Dec. 29 (PTI): The six-year-long dispute between the Bajaj brothers could end tomorrow, with Bombay High Court today allowing elder sibling Rahul to transfer the control of sugar company Bajaj Hindusthan to Shishir.        
	Under the deal, Rahul will acquire over 4.1 crore shares, or an 80 per cent stake, in Bajaj group investment firm Bachhraj and Co and transfer them to Shishir.        
	The shares would be purchased from Neeraj Bajaj at market value tomorrow and would amount to a 29.2 per cent stake in Bajaj Hindusthan.        
	Justice Roshan Dalvi, who admitted a petition by 13 minority shareholders challenging the sale of the shares, directed Neeraj and Rahul to deposit within three weeks the amount obtained through the sale of 12.5 per cent shares owned by the minority shareholders.        
	The amount to be deposited should be equivalent to the market value of the shares on March 1, 2008, in the event of the sale of the shares owned by the minority shareholders.         
	The judge gave Rahul time to deposit the money after he filed an undertaking that, as security, they would not sell or transfer the shares of Bajaj Auto Ltd.        
	According to the petition, in 2006 a settlement was reached between the Bajaj factions wherein Rahul had agreed to purchase shares in Bajaj Hindusthan held by the other Bajaj family members and group companies and transfer them to Shishir.        
	The shares of Bachhraj and Co would be transferred to Rahul at the rate of Rs 7 per share which was then trading at Rs 550 per share, petitioners advocate U.D. Madan said.         
	Terming the settlement as malafide, Madan argued that the petitioners had addressed a letter dated May 15, 2006 to the directors of Bachhraj and Co objecting to the sale of the shares. It was asserted in the letter that the sale would result in a loss of Rs 180 crore to the minority shareholders, Madan said.

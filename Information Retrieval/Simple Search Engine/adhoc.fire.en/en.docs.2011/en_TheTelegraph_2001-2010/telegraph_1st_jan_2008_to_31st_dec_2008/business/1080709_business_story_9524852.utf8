          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          REVIEW TIME                                  
	Mumbai, July 8: Rising inflation and the possibility of higher loan defaults today dominated a meeting between senior bankers and the top brass of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).        
	This is a routine meeting that the central bank holds ahead of its quarterly review of its monetary policy.        
	The bankers who attended todays meeting included State Bank of India chairman . P. Bhatt, Punjab National Bank chairman and managing director K. C. Chakrabarty, Bank of Baroda chairman M. D. Mallya, Bank of India chief T. S. Narayanaswami and HDFC Banks managing director Aditya Puri. Representing the RBI were its deputy governors Rakesh Mohan, P. Leeladhar and Shyamala Gopinath.        
	H.N. Sinor, chief executive of the Indian Banks Association, told reporters after the meeting that discussions between top bankers and the RBI brass focused on various industry aspects. He, however, admitted that the issue of inflation dominated the agenda.        
	With interest rates buoyed by surging inflation, bankers fear that loan defaults can rise in the coming months. This point was communicated to the central bank.         
	Sinor, however, said bankers were optimistic about the countrys economic fundamentals.        
	The growth fundamentals are strong, though there are some areas of concern. The concern appears to have centred on the possibility of higher loan defaults because of rising rates, he added.        
	More than a fortnight back, the RBI had raised the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio by half a percentage point. But with inflation continuing to rise, it is feared that the central bank may have to go in for another round of rate hike to rein in prices.        
	Many expect the RBI to hike the repo rate again by 25 basis points during the quarterly review of monetary policy on July 29.        
	High inflation and the RBIs monetary measures resulted in banks raising their prime lending rates (PLRs). Consequently home loans of different banks became costlier.        
	Sinor said high inflation had an effect on the retail portfolios of banks. He, however, added that there was still good credit demand.

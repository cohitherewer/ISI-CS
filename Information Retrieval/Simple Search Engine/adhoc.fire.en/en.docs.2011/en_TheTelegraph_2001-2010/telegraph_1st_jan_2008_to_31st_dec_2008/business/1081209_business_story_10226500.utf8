          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government has cleared 21 highway projects worth Rs 28,302.71 crore being built in a public-private collaboration.        
	Since July, the government had stopped awarding fresh projects because of a credit crunch. Projects worth around Rs 60,000 crore are stuck.         
	However, yesterday the government announced a finance window of Rs 10,000 crore which India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) will avail itself through tax-free bonds. Projects worth Rs 100,000 crore can be helped out through this window, finance ministry officials said.         
	The 21 projects cleared include roads in Orissa, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.         
	The decision to clear the projects was taken at an inter-ministerial meeting on November 21, but the government announced it after getting a nod from the Prime Ministers Office.         
	Infrastructure associations such as the National Highway Builders Association have earlier said that interest rates on loans for roads needed to fall to 8-9 per cent from the current 12.5-16 per cent. IIFCL, however, funds projects at rates below 10 per cent.

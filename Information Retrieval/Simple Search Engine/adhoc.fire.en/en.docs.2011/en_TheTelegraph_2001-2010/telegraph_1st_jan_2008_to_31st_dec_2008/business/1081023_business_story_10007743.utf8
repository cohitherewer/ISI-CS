	Analysts had estimated the countrys largest software exporter to report a net profit in the region of Rs 1,281 crore.        
	TCS said total income rose to Rs 6,784.45 crore in the second quarter on a consolidated basis, a gain of nearly 18 per cent from Rs 5,761.82 crore in the July-September quarter of last year. The companys standalone net profit after taxes rose to Rs 1,173.04 crore in the quarter ended September 30 from Rs 1,147.11 crore in the year-ago period.

	New Delhi, April 22 (PTI): India will join the US-backed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP) gas pipeline project this week, while it rejoins talks on a rival project from Iran.        
	We are going to Islamabad at an invitation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to attend the steering committee meeting of the TAP project. The talks scheduled for April 23-24 will see India joining the project, petroleum minister Murli Deora said here.        
	Apart from signing project heads of agreement, the four countries will also ink a pipeline framework agreement, he said. The ADB will sponsor the project.        
	The US is opposing the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project as it feels Tehran may use revenues from gas sales to fuel its nuclear programme. Instead, the US is encouraging India and Pakistan to import gas from Turkmenistan to meet their growing energy needs.        
	The 1,680-km pipeline from Turkmenistan will transport 100 metric million standard cubic meters (mmscmd) per day of gas from the Dauletabad gas field, of which Indias share is likely to be 60 mmscmd.

	Mumbai, Aug. 17 (PTI): Private sector investment is expected to rise at a slower pace because of a deceleration in global and domestic economies, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.        
	Private corporate investment in 2008-09 is likely to increase, although it may grow at a slower pace ... Corporate incentives to invest are likely to remain strong in 2008-09, namely high domestic demand and high capacity utilisation rates amidst improved profitability of last few years, the RBI said in its August bulletin.        
	The capital investment intention of companies in the domestic market having institutional assistance up to the last fiscal amounted to Rs 1,48,350 crore against Rs 1,25,248 crore envisaged for 2007-08, the RBI said.        
	In the current fiscal, the proposed investment aggregates to Rs 1,73,173 crore, if the capital spending envisaged by companies raising funds from sources other than banks and foreign investors was added, the apex bank said.        
	If the aggregate capital expenditure in 2008-09 were to surpass the level intended for the year 2007-08, the fresh envisaged capital expenditure in 2008-09 must be above Rs 71,934 crore, the RBI said.        
	However, high global crude oil prices, increasing cost of external capital, hardening of interest rates abroad and wage-cost pressures in some industries are causing downside risks to corporates.        
	Notwithstanding the slowdown in overall business activities, the countrys corporate sector managed to maintain decent profitability levels in 2007-08 and against the backdrop of upbeat performance in recent years, the RBI said.        
	FDI inflow        
	Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first quarter of 2008-2009 has far exceeded the total FDI inflow into the domestic economy in 2005-06, the RBI said.         
	The total FDI inflow into the country in the April-June period amounted to $10.073 billion against $8.961 billion in 2005-06, the RBI said in its August report.FDI into India was less than $10 billion annually until 2005-06. It shot up to $22 billion in 2006-07 and then to $32 billion in 2007-08.

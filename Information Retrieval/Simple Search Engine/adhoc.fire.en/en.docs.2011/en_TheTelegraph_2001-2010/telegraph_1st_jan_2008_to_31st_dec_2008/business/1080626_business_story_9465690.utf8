          OUR BUREAU                      Anil Ambani            Mukesh Ambani                          
	Mumbai, June 25: The squabbling Ambani brothers have been unceremoniously removed from one of the celebrated Mumbai makeover projects  the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), or the Nhava-Sewree sea link. Instead, the Maharashtra government has decided to construct the Rs 6,000-crore project on its own.        
	The cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure of the state, which includes chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, public works minister Anil Deshmukh, chief secretary Johny Joseph and senior Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) officials, approved the decision at a meeting today.         
	MTHL was a prestigious project as it would connect Sewri in mainland Mumbai to Nhava across the creek, thereby connecting various growth centres such as the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), upcoming special economic zones in the region and a proposed international airport.        
	The project presented one of the first occasions where the Ambani brothers faced off after their split in January 2006.        
	Anil Ambani had wrested the project after a controversial bidding process last year.        
	However, the younger scion is understood to have backed out once he realised his aggressive bid for a concession of just 10 years will not help him recoup the costs, though the official explanation from his group is different.        
	During the concession period, toll can be collected from users by the builders of the project.        
	On June 19, the MSRDC deemed as invalid the winning bid of the Anil Ambani-led consortium for the project.        
	His Reliance Infrastructure-Hyundai consortium, which had quoted the concession period of nine years 11 months, had rejected the governments proposal to extend the bid validity up to August 12 from June 12 when it expired.        
	On the other hand, elder brother Mukeshs Reliance Industries-led consortium had quoted a concession period of 75 years.        
	The project was important for both the Ambani brothers who have lined up huge investments in the infrastructure business.

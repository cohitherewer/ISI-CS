          OUR BUREAU                          Chidambaram in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, May 31: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has asked banks to provide more credit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and free them from the clutches of private money lenders who charge high interest rates.        
	Expressing his disappointment that bank credit has not yet reached tiny units, Chidambaram reminded banks that they were duty bound to lend to the sector.        
	It is the duty of banks to help and nurse these micro and small enterprises...MSEs are entirely dependent on unscrupulous money lenders who charge huge interest rates, he said while releasing the Code of Banks Commitment to MSEs here today.        
	Though agriculture, industry and even small and medium enterprises enjoy easy access to bank loans, Chidambaram said, credit had not yet fully reached micro and small enterprises.         
	The tiny units are more vulnerable than low-paid employees who hold regular jobs, he said.        
	Undoubtedly, credit is the lifeline of the economy. Absence of credit means there is hardly any room for growth, not to speak of sustainable growth, the finance minister added.

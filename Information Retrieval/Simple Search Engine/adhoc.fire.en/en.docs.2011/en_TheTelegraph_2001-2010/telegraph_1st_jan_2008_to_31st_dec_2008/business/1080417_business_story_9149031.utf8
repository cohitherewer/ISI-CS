          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Chidambaram: Job ahead		    
	New Delhi, April 16: The government today said it would import cooking oil, to be sold at subsidised rates, while hinting at curbs on forward trading in farm produce and threatening to break the cement and steel cartels as the fight against inflation gathered momentum.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may also call a meeting of state chief ministers to chalk out strategies to check the surge in food and commodity prices that took inflation to a three-year high of 7.41 per cent in end-March.         
	Facing severe criticism from the Opposition and the Left parties  the latter even walked out of both the Houses of Parliament  the government today fielded two of its seasoned campaigners, Sharad Pawar and P. Chidambaram, in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to take questions on inflation.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told the Lok Sabha that the government would import 1mt of edible oil and 15 lakh tonnes of pulses.         
	The imported edible oil would be subsidised at the rate of Rs 15 per litre and made available through ration shops.         
	In just three months, cooking oil prices have gone up between 20 per cent and 25 per cent and pulses by 20-35 per cent in the wholesale markets.         
	The government has cut duties on edible oils, banned the export of non-basmati rice and withdrew export incentives on cement and steel to increase local supplies and put a lid on prices.         
	We can intervene through fiscal steps, monetary steps and supply-side measures, Chidambaram said in the Lok Sabha.         
	We will not hesitate to take tough administrative measures.         
	He told state governments to impose stock limits on food items to check hoarding.        
	Chidambaram also referred to the possibility of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sucking excess money out of the economy. I am sure the governor (of the RBI) is listening to the debate.         
	He will take appropriate measures, if necessary, he said.        
	At the Rajya Sabha today, CPMs Sitaram Yechury said, This situation may force us to rethink our support to the government.         
	To this, BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi quipped: We will support you in dislodging the government.        
	Though the RBI has a wide range of instruments to reduce excess money supply, government officials and bankers feel it may chose to raise the cash reserve ratio, or the money that banks must compulsorily keep with the central banker, in its policy review on April 29.

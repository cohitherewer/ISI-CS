          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: Tata Communications has been ordered to pay damages of $19 million plus interest from May 2006 to Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Globalcom for blocking access to its cable landing system in Mumbai.         
	The arbitration tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce handed down its final award on a dispute that had raged between the two telecom players for over four years.         
	This is one of several disputes between the Tatas and Anil Ambani companies, which are fierce rivals in areas such as power, telecom, and direct to home (DTH) services.         
	The case dates back to 2004 when Flag Telecom  which was taken over by Anil Ambanis company and eventually assimilated into Reliance Globalcom  claimed $385 million in damages from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd, the state-owned telephony giant that the Tatas acquired in 2002.         
	Flag, a subsidiary of Reliance Globalcom, had accused VSNL of denying it free access to its cable landing station and, thereby, having a monopolistic hold on bandwidth prices. Flag Telecom wanted access to enhance the capacity of the Flag Europe Asia cable system from 10 Gbps (billions of bits per second) to 80 Gbps.         
	Gbps is a measure of bandwidth on a digital data transmission medium such as optical fibre. In response to Flags demand, VSNL had maintained that it was not under any obligation to grant access under the construction and maintenance agreement between the two parties. In December 2004, Reliance Globalcom approached the International Chamber of Commerce to resolve the issues through an arbitration procedure.

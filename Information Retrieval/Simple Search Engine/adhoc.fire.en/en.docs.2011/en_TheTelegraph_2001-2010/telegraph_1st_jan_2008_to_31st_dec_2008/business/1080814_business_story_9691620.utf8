          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: As the battle for control of Zandu Pharmaceuticals hots up, Calcutta-based contender Emami group has received support from an unexpected quarter.        
	Some minority investors of Zandu have questioned the present managements decision not to include Emami as a partner in running the company.         
	Emami holds about 24 per cent stake in the century-old company.         
	The present management is controlled by the Parikh family, who are opposing Emamis entry in the company after their co-promoter, the Vaidya family, sold out to Emami.        
	The investors, under the umbrella of All Gujarat Investor Protection Trust, have wholeheartedly supported the Emami claim to the management partnership in Zandu.         
	In a communiqu to shareholders, Hemantsingh Jhala, chairman of the All Gujarat Investor Protection Trust, said Emamis participation in the management would give a fillip to Zandu and create value for its shareholders.         
	The shareholders said the present management had failed to grow the company over the years.        
	They said that Zandus standalone sales at Rs 136.98 crore in 2007-08 have reported a paltry 2.61 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the last nine years.        
	The company has not launched any product of significant value over the last five years.         
	On the other hand, Emami has grown consistently at a CAGR of 20.62 per cent over the last nine years to Rs 583.71 crore from Rs 108 crore.        
	CLB hearing        
	The Mumbai bench of the Company Law Board (CLB) will start its hearing next week in the case filed by Zandu Pharmaceuticals opposing the takeover bid by Emami, following the directions of a high court.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
             Policemen stand guard in front of the Bombay Stock Exchange in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 22: If stocks tank, will housing prices drift downwards?
    
	Theres a widely-accepted theory that the froth from speculative investments in stock markets tends to float into the realty business.
    
	But realty experts reckon that if you are waiting for a distressed sale of apartments after this weeks stock market crash, its going to be a long, long wait.
    
	There is no immediate impact that a depressed stock market will have on realty prices. Even an investor looking for margin trading would look first at utilising his liquid assets, not his real estate properties, said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head of Jones Lang La Salle Meghraj, a real estate consultant. 
    
	Real estate assets are very illiquid, he added.
    
	Although stock and real estate markets are interlinked, many believe that in todays scenario, the real estate market is not dependent on the stock market alone. 
    
	No longer are builders and developers dependent solely on stock markets. They have other ways to raise money such as real estate funds and overseas investors, said Prasanth Prabhakaran, senior vice-president of Kotak Securities.
    
	There is definitely a co-relation between the two markets, but I dont think this fall will cool off property prices in the immediate future, he added.
    
	If we do see that there is an actual recession in the US markets, there might be an impact here, Prabhakaran said.
    
	You have to understand one thing that the real estate market is not as liquid as the stock market. You cannot immediately buy and sell in realty, said Anshuman Magazine, managing director of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate consultancy firm. 
    
	The stock market, the real estate market are all related to the economy of the country. If they both continue to languish, there is something seriously wrong with the countrys economy, Puri said.
    
	At this point, I dont see that happening. The stock market has to underperform consistently over the next four to six months to actually have any impact on the real estate market, he added.
    
	Most realty observers believe that the realty market needs more than a two-day fall to get impacted. 
    
	The demand-supply mismatch still exists and there are enough genuine buyers who are ready to pay good money for the apartment of their choice.
    
	We are in the middle of a correction and not a scam like the one that Harshad Mehta ignited in the early nineties, which precipitated a real estate crash, another real estate analyst said.

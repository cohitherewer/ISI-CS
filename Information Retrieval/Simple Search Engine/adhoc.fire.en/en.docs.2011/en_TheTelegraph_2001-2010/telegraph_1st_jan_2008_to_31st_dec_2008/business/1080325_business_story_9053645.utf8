	New Delhi, March 24: Dell India Private Ltd will launch low-cost laptops and desktops by April 2008.

	The low-cost desktop computers will be manufactured at our Chennai unit and the laptops will be imported from the facility in Malaysia, said communications director Rajiv Ahuja.         
	The 50-acre Dell factory at Sriperumbudur near Chennai is the firms third manufacturing facility in the Asia-Pacific region. The company began desktop production in July 2007 for the domestic market.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Mumbai, June 4: Inflation has raised its hydra head again and threatens to surge past 9 per cent  running a tad higher than economic growth in the last quarter of 2007-08 (January to March) at 8.8 per cent.         
	Such a situation  where inflation runs faster than GDP growth  hasnt been seen since 2002-03 when the economy grew just 3.8 per cent while inflation, measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), scaled up to 6.5 per cent.         
	GDP growth in 2008-09 is forecast at around 8.5 per cent. During 2007-08, the economy grew 9 per cent, according to the latest revised estimates.         
	The latest round of fuel price increases  the second this year since the hike on February 15  will make it harder for the government to tamp down the rate of inflation.         
	Several economists told The Telegraph that the effect of costlier fuel prices on inflation would be felt in two stages. In the first round, there will be a direct impact where inflation could rise by around 50 basis points.         
	The hike will also have second-round effects as higher freight charges could see many items becoming dearer.         
	Experts anticipate this to add another 25 to 40 basis points to the current inflation numbers. Recent inflation data showed it at a 48-month high of 8.1 per cent.         
	Hours after the government announced the hike, credit rating agency Crisil forecast that the direct impact on headline inflation will be around 51 basis points and the total impact (including the second-round effect) on inflation will amount to around 95 basis points.         
	Inflation could touch 9 per cent, said D.K. Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. Joshi added that inflation was likely to remain on the higher side for the next few months. It might cool down towards the end of the year, he added.         
	Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, held a similar view. Barua said the initial impact could be to the tune of 50 basis points and the cascading effect should add another 30 basis points.         
	The hike in prices would be reflected in official data slated for release on June 20.         
	All eyes on RBI        
	With inflation expected to hit 9 per cent levels, the focus has shifted to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).         
	Observers are, however, divided on what action the RBI will take to calm inflationary expectations.         
	While some feel that it can raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR), others are of the opinion that the repo rate now at 7.75 per cent could be raised by 25 basis points.         
	The repo is the rate at which the central bank injects liquidity. The RBI last raised CRR by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent on April 29.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil firms put brakes on new outlets
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          ON HOLD                                  
	New Delhi, July 18: State-owned oil marketing companies have decided to go slow in opening retail outlets for selling petrol and diesel because of mounting losses from selling fuels below costs, while global crude prices stay high.        
	We have decided to go slow in opening new retail outlets as the losses from the current outlets are quite substantial and the global oil prices are surging with no indication of them come down to around $100 a barrel in the near future, a senior official of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said.        
	Sources said the companies were planning to open about 1,500 outlets in the next two years, and the current situation indicated that the exercise could be put on hold for the next two years.        
	They said the oil companies  IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL)  had, however, decided to open the outlets that were under construction, along with those planned in strategic locations.        
	About 100 outlets, in various stages of implementation, will be opened. Officials in the petroleum ministry said the government had asked the companies to review their retail strategy and assess the commercial viability of outlets.        
	They said the ministry had not imposed any curbs on new outlets but advised the companies not to open them indiscriminately as unviable dealership resulted in malpractices such as adulteration.        
	The ministry has issued an advisory to Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Limited to put the process of setting up new outlets on hold for two years because of under-recoveries in petrol and diesel. The company had received approval to set up 500 outlets across the country.        
	The three state-owned companies have about 33,000 petrol stations, while private operators run about 2,400. The private firms had a market share of 14 per cent in 2006, but in the past few months it has fallen to a negligible level.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Relief for small tea growers
                                                                                                               Relief for small tea growers
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11 (pti): The Tea Board will soon set up a separate cell to look into the problems faced by small tea growers.        
	We are going to set up a separate wing for the small tea growers, where dedicated people will address their issues, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said.        
	Banerjee said the tea quality was poor in the southern states because of a lack of basic infrastructure.        
	The existence of a number of unregistered associations is another reason why small growers are not able to get the benefits of government schemes, he said.        
	The Tea Board aims to form about 200 self-help groups of small growers in the 11th Five-Year Plan. We will provide about Rs 10,000 per hectare assistance to each group, he said        
	Each group will comprise about 50 small growers and the board will provide special training to them, Banerjee added.

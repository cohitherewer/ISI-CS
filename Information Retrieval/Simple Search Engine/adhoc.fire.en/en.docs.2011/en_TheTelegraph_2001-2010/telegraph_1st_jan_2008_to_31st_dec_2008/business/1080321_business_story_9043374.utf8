The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Protest against steel regulator
                                                                                                               Protest against steel regulator
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 20: The Indian Steel Alliance (ISA), an association of major steel producers, has asked the Centre to drop the idea of appointing a regulator to rein in prices.        
	The ISA contends that raw material costs are very high and any attempt to regulate prices will impact the steel industrys growth as it will deter the creation of fresh capacities.        
	In a letter sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the ISA said though input costs had gone up considerably in the recent past, steel prices had not been raised to the same extent.        
	The Indian prices of steel (hot rolled coils) are ruling at $800 per tonne, perhaps the lowest in the world, whereas international prices of steel are over $1,000 per tonne, it said.        
	Moosa Raza, president of the ISA, said rise in input costs had been beyond the absorption capacity of steel manufacturers. Constituents of the ISA include SAIL, Essar Steel, JSW Steel and Ispat Industries among others.         
	The communication to key decision makers has come at a time when the steel ministry is seeking the withdrawal of export incentives available to steel producers for having raised the prices despite appeals made by the Centre.

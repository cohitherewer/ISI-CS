	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Private carriers Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines want certain conditions to be fulfiled before they cut fares.         
	Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal said, We have a responsibility to our shareholders  we need to protect our bottomline  I certainly would not like to close down the company. We will do whatever the government wants us to do, provided we are profitable.        
	Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya said, We can only reduce fares if ATF is put under the declared goods category. That way there will be a uniform 4 per cent tax on it and so we will be able to reduce fares without worrying about external causes.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has asked air carriers to cut fares in response to the governments support to the industry.        
	The government is trying to help airlines tide over the difficult times  with fuel prices dropping, you must match it with the perception that fares are coming down, otherwise public sympathy, government sympathy will wane, Patel said.        
	Jet fuel prices have come down by nearly 25 per cent because of price cuts and removal of customs duty on the fuel. However, most airlines have shied away from discounting tickets, claiming they had borne too high a loss through the year to afford price cuts.        
	Jet move        
	Jet Airways is likely to announce a 20 per cent cut in the salaries of its pilots, engineers and some other staff. Chairman Naresh Goyal has convened a meeting of airline officials, pilots and engineers here tomorrow to discuss the issue of salary cuts. An announcement to this effect is also likely, a source said.

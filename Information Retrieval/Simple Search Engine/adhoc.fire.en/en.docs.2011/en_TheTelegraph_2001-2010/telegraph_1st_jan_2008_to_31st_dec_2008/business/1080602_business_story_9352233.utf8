                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Banks take to real-time transfer

	Mumbai, June 1: Buoyed by the success of the real time gross settlement system, banks are offering niche solutions to industry.        
	In the real time system, funds are transferred electronically in real time among banks and on a gross basis. This is the fastest possible money transfer system through the banking channel. The system is primarily for large value transactions, and the minimum amount to be remitted is Rs 1 lakh.        
	Settlement in real time means the transaction is not subject to any waiting period. Gross settlement means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis without bunching or considering other transaction.        
	Beneficiary branches are expected to receive the funds in real time as soon as funds are transferred by the remitting bank. The beneficiary bank has to credit the beneficiarys account within two hours of receiving the funds transfer message.        
	The coverage of the system, which has been in operation since 2004-05, has increased significantly. By March 31 this year, real time connectivity was available in more than 43,500 branches across the country. Its not the coverage alone that has grown. Data of the Reserve Bank of India show the system to have gained popularity among bank customers as well.        
	With banks charging reasonable fees from customers and the latter fully aware of the systems advantages, banks are also offering specialised solutions. Take the case of YES Bank. At the private sector bank, which has a balance sheet size of Rs 17,000 crore, all its 67 branches are enabled with the real time gross settlement system.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Suresh Sethi, president, transaction banking group, said that the bank saw the potential of the system from the beginning and is now offering this as a value-added service to its clients. The group, which offers cash management and other services to firms, is now looking at adding more than 500 customers this year.        
	YES Bank has come out with specific solutions targeted at mutual funds and the organised retail industry by leveraging the real time gross settlement system.         
	In retail, currently majority of the payments are in the physical payment mode  cash, cheque, demand drafts and pay orders  which has its own disadvantages.        
	The YES-Treasury Transact Services removes these disadvantages. Companies can handle bulk payments to multiple vendors by uploading just a single file. Sethi said that this could be replicated in the mutual fund industry.

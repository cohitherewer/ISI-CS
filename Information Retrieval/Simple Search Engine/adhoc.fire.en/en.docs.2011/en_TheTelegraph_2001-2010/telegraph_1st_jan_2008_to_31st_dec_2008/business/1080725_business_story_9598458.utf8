          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S. Hajara in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 24: Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI) may partner the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) to develop container terminals at Diamond Harbour.        
	The port has firmed up a plan to build four terminals on a public-private partnership model at an estimated investment of Rs 1,233 crore. SCI chairman and managing director S. Hajara indicated that the company would look at the facility coming up at Diamond Harbour. We have a presence in the east coast. We are keen to step that up, he said on the sidelines of a CII-organised seminar on logistics in Calcutta today.        
	He said that one of the options to increase SCIs presence on the east coast could be through participation in the proposed facility at Diamond Harbour. I am in touch with CPT chairman, he said when asked if SCI would be interested in the project. As part of its strategy to become an absolute logistic solution provider, SCI has decided to branch out into terminal management.        
	It has evinced interest in two new container terminals coming up at Ennore in Tamil Nadu and Nhava Sheva near Mumbai. These will have 4 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) capacity each, almost the same as the Jawahar Nehru Port Trust of Mumbai, the largest container port in India.        
	The Diamond Harbour container terminals, expected to be completed by 2012 end, will have 1.6 million TEUs capacity. It has a higher draft of 9 meters, compared with 7-7.5 at Calcutta, allowing bigger ships to come. Since it is 80 kilometres closer to the sea than Calcutta and not restricted by tide movement, ships can discharge cargo much faster.        
	 The port will not have to acquire more than 20 acres to build the terminals. The railhead is only 2 kilometre from the proposed site and a link will be built between them. The road connectivity is already established.

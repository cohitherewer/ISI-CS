	Calcutta, July 23: Blue Dart Express Limited will raise charges by 10-15 per cent for the second time in a year to offset the rise in fuel prices.         
	The logistics firm had hiked service rates in June this year.        
	Crude prices have risen by over 30 per cent leading to an unprecedented rise in aviation turbine fuel costs. Manpower and rental costs have also increased. Hence, we have to undertake another round of price hike in August or September, said Anil Khanna, managing director of Blue Dart Express.        
	We try our best to rationalise prices but beyond a point our customers will have to pay more, he added.        
	In June, ground service rates were increased by 10 to 15 per cent, while air service charges were hiked by around 15 to 20 per cent.        
	Blue Dart said there had been a slowdown in the last three to four months. However, with the logistics industry growing at the rate of 17 per cent, the company hopes to maintain the 21 per cent growth rate registered last year.        
	New vistas        
	Blue Dart is planning to expand operations to Saarc countries.        
	We are studying the market to start our air services in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Opportunities in Dubai and Singapore are also being studied, said Khanna.        
	DHL, which owns 81 per cent in the company, has its services in these markets and Blue Dart may consider offering joint services in these regions.

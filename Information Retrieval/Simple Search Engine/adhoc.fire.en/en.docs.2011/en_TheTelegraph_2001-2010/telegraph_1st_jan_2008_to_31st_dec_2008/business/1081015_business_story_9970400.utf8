	Mumbai, Oct. 14: Investors booked profits which forced the sensex to surrender most of its gains made earlier in the day on the back of soaring Asian stocks.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchange bellwether index closed at 11483.40, a rise of 174.31 points over its previous close.         
	The 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange advanced 27.95 points to 3518.65. In early trading, the sensex had gone up 500 points.        
	Sentiment was boosted by finance minister P. Chidambarams encouraging words and the Reserve Bank of Indias decision to bail out mutual funds.         
	After a gap of about two weeks, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the domestic stock market.         
	FIIs bought shares worth Rs 3,829.76 crore and sold stocks to the tune of Rs 2,931.51 crore, with net buying being Rs 898.25 crore.

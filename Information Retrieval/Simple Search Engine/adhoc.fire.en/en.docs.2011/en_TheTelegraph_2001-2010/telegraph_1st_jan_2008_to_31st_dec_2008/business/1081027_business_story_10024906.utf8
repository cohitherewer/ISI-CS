The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ore exporters suffer massive sales drop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ore exporters suffer massive sales drop
          SAMBIT SAHA                           Badly hurt                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: Indias iron ore export has plunged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.        
	According to latest data, the country exported 45 per cent less iron ore in September, when the financial crisis turned acute. Export may fall over 50 per cent in October compared with the same month in 2007.         
	Along with the volume drop, prices have fallen. The price of iron ore fines has come down from a high of $143 a tonne in June to about $50 a tonne, R.K. Sharma, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, told The Telegraph.         
	There is distress sale happening at the port. It is not viable to keep stock there and pay port charges hoping the tide will turn, he said.         
	Export was growing on the back of a strong demand from China till July this year but showed signs of slowdown in August when it dropped 17.29 per cent over the corresponding period in 2007.         
	September saw a decline of 45 per cent. The slide looks stark when compared with 18 per cent growth during the January-September period of this year against the year-ago period.         
	Sharma said the recent slump and steep fall in prices could be attributed to the reluctance of the Chinese buyers to make fresh spot purchases.         
	China accounts for 88 per cent of Indias iron ore exports.         
	They are not buying from us. Exports have slowed down from Australia and Brazil, too, Sharma said.         
	The latest data will be welcomed by the domestic steel industry, which was lobbying the government to clamp down on export.         
	The Centre had imposed a 15 per cent duty on the export of iron ore earlier this year.         
	A reduction in export implies an increased availability in the domestic market and a fall in local prices.         
	Aditya Jajodia, chairman of Jai Balaji Group, said he was hoping prices would fall following the softening in the international spot prices. The firm buys iron ore fines and lumps from private miners.         
	We are not buying anything now. The prices of fines are expected to come down to Rs 1,050 from Rs 1,600, while sized ore (lumps) may fall to Rs 2,500 a tonne from Rs 6,000 a tonne now, he said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet Air plans to sell 10% stake
                              Goyal: Cash chase                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 29 (PTI): Private carrier Jet Airways today said it planned to dilute 10 per cent of its equity to mop up funds and strengthen its balance sheet.        
	We will do anything which is required to make our balance sheet strong. We plan to dilute 10 per cent equity, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal told reporters after the companys 16th annual general meeting here.        
	Jet is in talks with a few institutional investors for the purpose, Goyal said, without disclosing their identities.        
	We are talking to investors, which include some internationally renowned funds as well as some serious investors, he said.        
	Goyal did not give a tim e frame for the stake dilution. Currently, the market conditions are volatile and not conducive for this, he said.        
	The Jet chief said he would not cede control of the company and would not go in for a distress sale.        
	On the airlines financial prospects in 2008-09, Goyal said, It will depend on fuel prices and the overall economic conditions.         
	I am hoping for an improved performance and that irrational pricing will be stopped, he said.         
	Irrational pricing, which some air-carriers have resorted to, has led to players not even recovering their costs. You need a 30 per cent hike in fares and a 30 per cent cut in capacity to meet the costs, he said.         
	Aircraft buy        
	Jet plans to take delivery of eight aircraft over the next three years at an investment of $1 billion.        
	We are going to take five Airbus A-330 and three Boeing-777 for $1 billion, Jet Airways senior general manager (investor relations) K.G. Vishwanath told shareholders at the AGM. The acquisitions will be 100 per cent debt-funded, he said.        
	Over the next six months, the airline will take delivery of five aircraft, including an Airbus, another official said on the sidelines of the AGM.        
	The airline has plans to launch a Bangalore-Brussels service from October 31 and a flight to West Asia in November.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude rules above $107
                                                                                                               Crude rules above $107
                            
	London, March 10 (Reuters): Oil sped to a record high above $107 a barrel on Monday, reversing earlier losses as investors sought out oil as a hedge against a depressed dollar and inflation.        
	A rush by financial funds into commodities and political tensions are the prime drivers of a rally that has lifted oils average to above $95 for the year.        
	US crude jumped to $107.44 a barrel and was trading up $2.01 at $107.16 by 1613 GMT. It had sunk to $104.08 in earlier trading.        
	London Brent crude was up $1.27 to $103.65.        
	Fears of recession, following the biggest US job losses in five years and strains in the credit market, have depressed equities and the dollar, while prompting many investors to seek safety in commodities, including oil.        
	The disconnect between slowing US growth and a soaring commodity/energy complex has truly been quite remarkable, said Edward Meir of MF Global.        
	The effect of the slowdown in the United States could start to have an impact on demand.        
	What you have seen over the last few months is fantastic strength in a whole range of commodities, all of which together significantly add to inflation and erode real incomes and profits, said Michael Saunders of Citigroup.        
	If it were just oil it would be more manageable, but its not ... What you are seeing now is far more widespread and therefore more damaging.        
	A sharp drop in US crude oil inventories and Opecs decision last week to hold supplies steady have also boosted oil prices.        
	Opec president Chakib Khelil was quoted on Monday as saying that speculation and political tension would keep prices at triple digits through the year.        
	Some analysts think oil can go higher still, possibly breaking through $110, although there are expected to be dips below the $100 mark too.        
	We certainly do see the balance for the rest of the year averaging $100, said Paul Horsnell of Barclays Capital.

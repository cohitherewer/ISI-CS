          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                Room for more        
	Mumbai, May 20: Two more international firms are understood to have shown interest in the MTN group.        
	German major Deutsche Telekom is believed to be eyeing a majority stake in MTN. Russian operator Altimos arm VimpelCom is also learnt to have expressed interest in the South African company and is in preliminary talks with MTNs bankers.        
	The buzz is that Deutsche Telekom has already sounded out MTNs bankers and Germanys Deutsche Bank to finance the acquisition of a majority stake in the African company.        
	With a market capitalisation of $72 billion and a presence in 11 countries, Deutsche Telekom could prove to be a serious bidder for MTN. Its subsidiary T-Mobile International has a significant presence in 11 European countries as well as in the UK and the US.        
	VimpelCom is the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 and has a market capitalisation of $42.3 billion. The operator covers 78 regions of Russia and has 140 million subscribers, representing 97 per cent of the Russian population.        
	Earlier, Etisalat of the UAE had said it was examining the possibilities of joining the race for MTN. Though none of these companies has formally entered the race, it is feared that a bid from any one of these players can increase the cost for Indias Bharti Airtel.        
	The top brass of Bharti, led by chairman Sunil Mittal and others, have been holding discussions with the senior management of MTN over the past few days to arrive at a broad consensus over the deal.        
	It is learnt that Sunil Mittal is planning to visit Johannesburg later this week and resume talks with the MTN leadership.         
	Talks between Bharti and MTN remained inconclusive since Friday when MTN asked for a $500-million break-up fee for agreeing to an exclusivity pact with the Indian telecom firm. The break-up fee is a surety amount in case the deal does not materialise after signing the exclusivity pact.        
	Bharti, which is understood to have offered $200 million, will have to better its offer, banking sources said. Bharti is keen on an exclusivity contract with MTN so that the South African player cannot talk to other bidders till negotiations between the two are over.        
	However, MTN is not in favour of signing this contract with Bharti as it feels the pact will go against the interest of its shareholders.        
	It is also feared that the ongoing anti-immigrant riots in South Africa can result in Bharti going slow on the talks with the African company.         
	A merger with an Indian company could prove to be a challenging issue for Cyril Ramaphosa, the non-executive chairman of MTN, who is also a prominent social and political figure in South Africa, which is facing anti-immigrant clashes.

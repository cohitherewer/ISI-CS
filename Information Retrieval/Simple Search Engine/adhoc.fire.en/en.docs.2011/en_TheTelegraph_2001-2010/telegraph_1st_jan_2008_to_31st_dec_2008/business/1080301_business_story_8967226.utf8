The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Infrastructure gets due attention
                                                                                                               Infrastructure gets due attention
        Guest Column - NIKHIL GANDHI                        
	Initial reactions to the budget have termed it as populist, while ordinary people from almost all sections of society have welcomed it. The fact of the matter is that given the circumstances, this budget looks near perfect. And for those for whom the stock market is of paramount importance, the market has seen enough growth and even a bull run during the spotless white-and-white clad Harvard graduate Tamilian Chettiars tenure as finance minister for the last four years.         
	It was high time someone paid attention to the needs of our farming community and the finance minister has done the right thing by waiving loans worth Rs 60,000 crore for small and marginal farmers         
	One item which has been frustrating and bothering the infrastructure sector so far  the dividend distribution tax  has been removed. The finance minister has shown great foresight in recognising this need and correcting it through the budget. This will be a big plus for all the infrastructure players.        
	Another major achievement has been that rural infrastructure spending has been set at Rs 140 billion. This is a critical requirement for the growth of the economy as disparities between Bharat and India cannot be bridged unless the rural sector is fully developed.         
	The third highlight is the focus on power sector development. Around Rs 800 billion will be spent towards accelerating power sector reforms, besides developing the 4000MW mega power project. Since power remains the backbone of any infrastructure development, this area will get the much required boost. Indias irrigation programme has been lagging behind significantly.         
	The national highways development programme has over the last eight years given tremendous boost to the economic development by providing necessary linkages to all parts of India. This programme has received due support by providing Rs 13,000 crore for the purpose. This will boost cement, steel and construction industry specifically.        
	The budget has also proposed concrete steps to help realise Indias demographic dividend. Knowledge and healthcare infrastructure, which will be critical to enable every citizen to have access to the skill sets needed to make India a developed country have been recognised. High allocation of funding, tax holidays etc will act as a tremendous booster for these sectors. Substantial development will be witnessed in next three to five years.        
	However, one area which was left unattended and which needed serious attention was to have tax free bonds for infrastructure floated, if not by the private sector, then by banks to attract the retail investors. This will, in turn, invest in the much required capital for the infrastructure sector. This could help the retail investors make long-term investment and help banks extend their helping hand for infrastructure development programmes. But for this, I believe, this has been a balanced budget from the infrastructure point of view.        
	The FM has tried to empower large number of people who are less privileged through several schemes which will enable them to spend more, which in turn will make the balancesheets of many companies look better. Chidambaram has done his part by ensuring that people in these segments have more money in their pockets to spend and thereby fuel the economy further.

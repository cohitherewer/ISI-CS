          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The Congress-led government may favour the phase-wise injection of more credit into the economy by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through reductions in key lending rates.         
	According to the finance ministry, the main culprit for the slowdown in industrial growth is tight money conditions which have made cash too costly for borrowers. In August, industry grew just 1.3 per cent.        
	Banks have become cash-strapped because of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) depositing their rupee proceeds from the sale of stocks in India with the RBI and taking the dollar equivalent outside the country.         
	Officials in the ministry said they would prefer the RBI to cut its key lending rate in phases by 100 basis points, though it is for the RBI to take a call.         
	Over the last one year, the central bank had hiked the key overnight lending rate for banks as well as CRR (cash reserve ratio) in several tranches to a high of 9 per cent. CRR is the proportion of a deposit which banks mandatorily keep with the RBI.        
	The rise in these rates has forced bankers to increase lending rates which, in turn, is believed to have slowed down investment decisions.        
	Liquidity boost        
	Economists advising the government feel CRR, which has been reduced by 150 basis points to 7.5 per cent this week by the RBI, may be cut by another 50 basis points to pump in more liquidity. This could be done after the government assesses the impact of the current infusion.         
	One of the principal reasons for following a tight money policy is to combat runaway inflation which had nearly touched 13 per cent on the back of high food and fuel prices.         
	Though the inflation rate has come down to below 12 per cent, the RBI is worried of too much cash in the system pushing up prices.         
	Elections to several key states are due next month, and the government does not want to risk an inflationary spiral, which will hardly be popular with the voter.         
	A cash-strapped economy may lead to more than just a slowdown in industry. Lack of cash could delay payments throughout the economy and lead to a bigger crisis of confidence.         
	Guarded impact        
	Indias losses from the financial crisis has till now been in the stock markets and exports, unlike in North America and Europe where the impact has been more widespread with companies downing shutters, real estate prices slumping and people losing jobs.        
	The stock market meltdown had been severe and could well see many mutual funds running up losses. Export slowdown has hit segments such as textiles and handicrafts, and has caused jitters in infotech and among hoteliers.         
	However, with exports contributing just 10 per cent to Indias GDP (gross domestic product), the net impact of the global slowdown is expected to be bearable. The Indian economy had grown by 9 per cent in 2007-09 and an average of 8.8 per cent in the past five years.         
	Despite the global slowdown, the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory council has said a 7.7 per cent economic growth rate is still likely to be attained.        
	Farm production is likely to grow at a lower pace of 2 per cent in the current year against 4.5 per cent in last fiscal. Industrial output is expected to decelerate to 7.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent and services to 9 per cent. Services sector growth has been in double digits during the last five years.        
	The downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008-09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on India  be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets, a report by the PMs Economic Advisory Council had said.

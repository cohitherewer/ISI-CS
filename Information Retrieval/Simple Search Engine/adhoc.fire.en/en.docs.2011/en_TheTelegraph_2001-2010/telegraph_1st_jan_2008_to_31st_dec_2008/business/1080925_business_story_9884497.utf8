          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The global financial crisis and the ensuing liquidity crunch may hit the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India.         
	FDI inflows to India may be on the lower side, especially in infrastructure, which requires large investments, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), which released its World Investment Report 2008 today.        
	Unctad said the collapse of investment banks such as Lehman Brothers could affect the flow of FDI, though investment sentiment of multinationals were unchanged.        
	Analyst Partha Mukhopadhyay of the Centre for Policy Research said India continued to be a preferred destination for FDI but would find it difficult to achieve the $35-billion target for this fiscal.        
	The UN body said India would need an average investment of $99 billion per annum in 10 major infrastructure segments during 2007-12, the duration of the Eleventh Five Year Plan, to support an annual growth of nine per cent.         
	The public sector is expected to provide 70 per cent of this investment, with the rest contributed by the private sector. The latter is expected to take the lead in telecom, port and airport.        
	However, these ambitious plans could face an annual financial gap (shortfall) estimated at close to $14 billion, the report said.        
	The deteriorating profit of multinationals in the wake of the economic slowdown will make cash financing of FDI difficult.         
	Unctad said the Bric nations  Brazil, Russia, India and China  were the most attractive destinations for large multinationals.        
	The report said the slowdown would hurt the merger and acquisition (M amp;A) plan of global investors.         
	According to Mukhopadhyay, Companies would find it difficult to raise capital for M amp;A such as the Tata-Corus deal because of global financial turmoil. There could be a lull for two to three months and some delay in the projects.        
	He said the Reserve Bank of India could ease the interest rate situation to enable the industry to access funds.        
	Unctad said global FDI in 2008 would be $1,600 billion, a 10 per cent decline from 2007.

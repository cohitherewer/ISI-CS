                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New team to lead Wipro
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, April 18: Wipro Ltd  the countrys third largest software exporter  today announced a new slate of honchos to run the information technology business, which contributes 74 per cent to its revenues.        
	Ending weeks of speculation in the media, Wipro owner Azim Premji announced that Girish Paranjape and Suresh Vaswani  two of the five business heads within the group  were being elevated as joint chief executive officers of the IT division.        
	They have not been given separate geographies or verticals; they will look after the IT business, said a Wipro official.        
	The change of guard is the third since July 1999 when one of the founders of Wipro Technologies, Ashok Soota, said goodbye to the company to pursue his own interests after a 16-year stint.        
	At around the same time, a young Vivek Paul was bidding farewell to his boss Jeff Immelt at GE Medical Systems in the US to join a relatively unknown $150-million company called Wipro Technologies in Bangalore.         
	Paul, often called the brand ambassador of Wipro, ramped up revenues from $150 million to more than $1 billion before leaving to join private investment firm Texas Pacific Group.        
	Since Pauls exit in July 2005, Wipro hadnt filled the post of vice-chairman.         
	After Pauls exit, the company created strategic business units with five independent heads reporting directly to the chairman: Suresh Vaswani (47), president, global IT services, Girish Paranjpe (49), president, financial solutions, Sudip Banerjee (47) president, enterprise solutions, P.R. Chandrasekar, president (America and Europe), and Sudip Nandy (49) CEO, telecom and product engineering solutions.        
	Girish Paranjpe, Suresh Senapaty and Suresh Vaswani have been appointed to the board of Wipro. Sudip Banerjee, currently president (enterprise solutions business), is moving as director on the advisory board of PremjiInvest.        
	P.R. Chandrasekar will continue to head the companys American and European business.        
	Its a little unusual to create joint CEOs. This will help the company retain two equally skilled professionals, said Rajiv Mehta, analyst with Indiainfoline.        
	Girish Paranjpe has been with Wipro since 1990 and has transitioned from leadership roles in the finance function to business leadership roles. Most recently, he was the president of the banking, financial services and insurance business unit of the global IT business of Wipro.        
	Suresh Vaswani has been with Wipro since 1985. Over this period, he has held multiple leadership positions, and was most recently president of Wipro Infotech (the India, Middle East and APAC IT business of Wipro) and of global practices (EAS, Testing amp; TIS).         
	Suresh Senapaty has been with Wipro since 1980 and been its chief financial officer since 1995.

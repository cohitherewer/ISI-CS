     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Overseas mission
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: Indiabulls Financial Services is planning to raise $1 billion through an overseas flotation to raise cash for its existing businesses and new ventures.
    
	The company today informed the stock exchanges that the money could be raised via public issue of convertible securities/American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) convertible into equity shares.
    
	Indiabulls Financial Services will seek permission of its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on February 1 for the proposed issue.
    
	Although Indiabulls did not reveal the reasons behind this fund raising initiative, sources said the company was venturing into a host of high value-added services in the financial space which would require huge amounts of capital.
    
	Even as it is set to enter the asset management business, it recently joined hands with Societe Genarale in life insurance. Here, Indiabulls Financial Services will hold 74 per cent stake, while Sogecap, the insurance arm of SocGen, will own the remaining 26 per cent.
    
	It is also setting up a multi commodity exchange in partnership with the MMTC.
    
	While we are planning to get into a few more areas, we will also need money to grow the existing business. Here, Indiabulls Financial expects to end this year with a fresh disbursal of Rs 12,000 crore and the amount could touch Rs 25,000 crore next year, sources said.
    
	At present, Indiabulls Financial Services provides consumer finance even as it also gives loans to builders and those buying commercial vehicles.
    
	Within consumer finance, the company is present in personal and mortgage loans. Recently, it separated the securities trading unit. After coming out with an IPO in 2004, the company had separated its real-estate arm in February 2007.
    
	Several foreign fund houses, including Citigroup Inc, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Group have stakes in the company.
    
	For the quarter ended September 30, Citigroup held 5.58 per cent, Merrill Lynch 4.99 per cent and Goldman Sachs 3.65 per cent in Indiabulls. In May last year, the company had raised $25 million through issue of GDRs convertible into equity shares.
    
	During the first half of this year, the company reported a consolidated total revenue figure of Rs 938.2 crore, a gain of 91 per cent over the corresponding period last year. 
    
	Similarly, the consolidated profit after tax rose nearly 98 per cent to Rs 339.5 crore from Rs 171.7 crore last year. Financing income amounted to Rs 629.1 crore or 67 per cent of total revenues, up from 52.6 per cent last year.
    
	Fees based income from loan processing, insurance distribution and advisory services totalled Rs 77.1 crore, or 8.2 per cent of total revenues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toyota braces for first-ever loss

	Nagoya (Japan), Dec. 22: Earnings at Toyota Motor, the Japanese motor giant, are set to dive into the red for the first time since 1941 as exports screech to a halt and margins are hammered by the soaring yen.         
	Toyotas full-year loss  unprecedented since the company stopped making looms and turned its hand to car making  is expected to reverberate throughout Japan.         
	Toyota president Katsuaki Watanabe today said, The change that has hit the world economy is of a critical scale that comes once in a hundred years. Toyota began making cars in the 1930s but only began keeping company record in 1941.         
	It is the second time in less than two months that the car maker has lowered its profit forecast. This emerges as Japans ministry of finance revealed a 26.7 per cent annual fall in exports, which had contributed to the countrys first November trade deficit in 28 years, totalling 223 billion yen.         
	Japanese exports to America fell by their steepest-ever monthly margin of 33.8 per cent. Perhaps more worrying, said economists, was the 24.5 per cent plunge in exports to China and a similar nosedive elsewhere in Asia.         
	Many Japanese exports around the Asian region are parts or components for assembly in lower-cost manufacturing centres and the fall in exports, as well as Toyotas warning, points to equally grim export data from Asias emerging economies over the coming months.         
	Widely considered to be the best-managed auto maker in the world, Toyotas statement is likely to send a shudder throughout the rest of the car industry.         
	In what some investors also described as a devastating blow to prospects for the entire Japanese economy, the auto maker said it would probably book a loss of 150 billion yen in the current financial year: a shock contrast, said brokers at Nomura, with the record 2.2 trillion yen operating profits logged in fiscal 2007.

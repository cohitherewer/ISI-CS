          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Telecom minister A. Raja today said call charges were likely to fall with many telecom companies  global and domestic  keen to launch third-generation (3G) mobile services in the country.        
	Most players around the globe are interested to bid for 3G spectrum... the resultant competition will reflect in lower tariffs, Raja said.         
	Domestic telecom service providers Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications and global firms such as the UKs AT amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, France-based Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo have expressed interest in bidding for 3G mobile licence.        
	The government is also planning to do away with termination charges which may further reduce call rates.         
	Termination charges are paid by an operator from whose network a call originates to an operator on whose network the call terminates.         
	The government is also confident of raising Rs 30,000-35,000 crore by auctioning radiowaves for 3G services. With the base price at Rs 2,020 crore and the government allocating five blocks, the basic price is Rs 10,000 crore ... I expect it to go up to Rs 35,000 crore at least, said Raja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Delay to help 3G bidders clear doubt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delay to help 3G bidders clear doubt
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Domestic and foreign telecom firms bidding for a 3G licence have sought a greater clarity on the spectrum, merger and rollout norms.         
	They have agreed to the governments proposal to defer auctions by two weeks. The bidding was initially on January 16.        
	The firms hope to overcome their misgivings in the meantime. The delay will also give them more time to plan for the bidding.         
	The auction was delayed to take into consideration the concern of prospective applicants during the pre-bid conference on December 23, said officials of the department of telecommunications (DoT). The government has deferred the last date of receiving applications for the auction to January 20 from January 5.        
	It plans to complete the auction within this fiscal and raise around Rs 40,000 crore.        
	Keen on securing global participation to gain maximum revenue, the DoT has formed a dedicated team for assisting the prospective bidders.        
	Four issues have been raised by the bidders: norms on the allocation of additional spectrum; difference between 2G and 3G rollouts; call termination charges for 3G; rules for merging or acquiring an existing player.        
	Foreign players, who have been allowed to bid as 100 per cent entities, are worried about getting approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and finding a domestic partner after the bidding.        
	The foreign firms consider 5MHz of 3G spectrum as insufficient to compete with existing players who will enter the fray with 7MHz of 2G spectrum in the bag.         
	While the DoT has declared that 3G winners can get 2G spectrum, foreign players know there is a very limited chance as 450 firms are in the queue.        
	Besides, it will take time for 3G players to recoup their costs in the price-sensitive Indian market.

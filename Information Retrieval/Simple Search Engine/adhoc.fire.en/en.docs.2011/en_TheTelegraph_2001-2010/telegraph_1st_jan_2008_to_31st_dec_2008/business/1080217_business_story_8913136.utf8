The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bajaj Auto one up on TVS
                                                                                                               Bajaj Auto one up on TVS
          OUR BUREAU                          BUMPY RIDE                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: In a major relief to Bajaj Auto, Madras High Court today restrained TVS Motor Company from manufacturing, marketing and selling its bike, TVS Flame 125.        
	Justice P. Jothimani granted the stay order on a petition filed by Bajaj Auto, which accused TVS of using its Digital Twin Spark Ignition (DTSi) technology in its 125cc bike, the Flame. TVS is likely to file an appeal against the injunction. Sources close to Bajaj Auto said TVS could not manufacture and market the Flame after the injunction.        
	Justice Jothimani also dismissed a petition filed by TVS to restrain Bajaj Auto from interfering with the manufacturing and sale of its new bike.         
	On February 4, the high court reserved orders on the petitions filed by the two over allegations of infringement of patent rights by TVS. Earlier, on January 18, the Supreme Court had asked TVS not to book further orders for its new bike.         
	Bajaj Auto had warned of legal action against TVS for infringing on its patented technology. Following this, TVS filed a Rs 250-crore defamation suit against Bajaj Auto in Bombay High Court and another one in Madras High Court under the patent law.        
	Bajaj Auto claims the DTSi technology was registered in July 2002 under patent number 195904. The technology uses two spark plugs at the two ends of the chamber, enabling faster combustion and efficient burning of the fuel-air mixture.         
	An analyst said the injunction was a disappointment for TVS as the countrys third-largest motorcycle manufacturer had expected the product to provide a boost to its sales.

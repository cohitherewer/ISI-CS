          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 26: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has bagged a five-year contract worth $100 million from the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors BV.         
	TCS will provide consulting services as well as application management, development and support services across NXPs supply chain operations.        
	The revenues from the deal will get reflected from the second quarter of this financial year and the upgrades will happen between the second and third quarters. We cannot say the exact number involved in the ramp up, but it will be a few hundred people, said N. Chandrasekaran, CEO of TCS.        
	The deal will be implemented through multiple centres in India, Asia and the US, which are part of TCS global network delivery model. These offices will be supported by a centre of excellence based in Eindhoven.        
	The supply chain operations will be accessed out of India, the front end will be in the Netherlands and the support services will be through various centres in Asia, he added.        
	Chandra added that the semiconductor vertical has seen good growth in the past one year. Though semiconductor is part of the manufacturing business, TCS may look at it as a separate segment later.        
	The engagement with TCS reflects NXPs commitment to optimising our processes and driving business value from all aspects of our operations, said Louis Luijten, senior vice-president at NXP.        
	We were looking for a partner who has a holistic understanding of our core business and not just the technology behind it and in this respect TCS is ideally placed to help us drive growth over the next five years, Luijten added.        
	TCS will also support NXPs technology infrastructure globally covering enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management in addition to the companys portal-based applications.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crisis managers on full alert     -  Package for exporters in the works
          R. SURYAMURTHY                      Pillai: Helping hand                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: The government is preparing a package for exporters to help them overcome the global financial crisis.        
	We are talking to the department of industry and the ministry of finance and will finalise the package soon, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai told The Telegraph.        
	One of the governments objectives is to prevent large-scale layoffs in sectors such as textile and leather through the package. The package is an attempt to prevent that. There can be a bit of turbulence because of the financial crisis and a slowdown in exports, Pillai said.        
	The government has set a $200-billion export target for this fiscal, and commerce minister Kamal Nath is confident of reaching the target despite the global financial slump and the weakening of the rupee.        
	Pillai said the package would be ready in a couple of days. We need to take measures by November or else, it may be too late to make a difference, commerce ministry officials said. The commerce department is meeting export promotion councils to identify the areas in which the government can offer its help.         
	The government could consider offering interest relief, additional incentives on duty drawbacks and easy access to long-term credit. Incentives to insurance companies to support high-risk transactions are also likely.         
	Apart from a decline in orders from the US and the European Union (EU), exporters have been unable to get long-term credit. The government could persuade banks to give credit to exporters for 180 days instead of 90 days and at a lower interest rate.        
	The government has asked exporters to look beyond the EU and the US, which together constitute about half of the countrys export market.        
	Export orders for the next fiscal have declined around 15 to 20 per cent. If the slowdown in the global economy continues, there can be job losses in the sector, Mukhtarul Amin, chairman of the Council for Leather Exports, said.        
	The labour-intensive leather industry employs about 2.5 million people. Amin said if the demand declined at the current pace, employment in the sector would suffer.

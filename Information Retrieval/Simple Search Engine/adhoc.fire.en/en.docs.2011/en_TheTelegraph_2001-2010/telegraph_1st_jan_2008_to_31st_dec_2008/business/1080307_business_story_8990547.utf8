                                                                                                               RBI pledges support to loan waiver scheme
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 6: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will help the government and banks in implementing the Rs 60,000-crore farm loan waiver scheme.        
	Stating that this years budget was in line with growth and price stability objectives of the RBI, governor Y.V. Reddy said, the central bank would work closely with the government and banks to ensure that the farm loan waiver scheme helps farmers, improves credit flow and serves the interests of the banking system.        
	The governor stated the budget was broadly consistent with the overall objectives of achieving growth along with price stability, the RBI said in a statement after its board meeting here today.        
	The board also emphasised the need for a quantum jump in agricultural growth to ensure food security and rural employment.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who was present at the RBI board meeting, said the debt waiver scheme would be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the banking system.        
	Chidambaram had announced the farm loan waiver package in his budget speech on February 29.        
	Banks will be compensated in a way that they will not be constrained at all, Chidambaram told reporters after the post-budget meeting with the RBI board.        
	RBI governor Y.V. Reddy has told the board that the central bank is fully geared to support the government in implementing the scheme in a manner that the banking sector will be strengthened not weakened, he said.        
	Of the Rs 60,000-crore loan, co-operative banks have an exposure of Rs 37,000 crore and regional rural banks and public sector banks have an outstanding of over Rs 10,000 crore each. The finance minister said the government would divulge the details of the loan waiver scheme during a debate on the budget in Parliament.        
	The debt relief package is expected to be applicable to farm loans disbursed by state-run banks up to March 31, 2007, and overdue on December 31 last year. Farmers with up to 2 hectares of land will be eligible for a complete write-off of loans overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid up to February 29 this year.

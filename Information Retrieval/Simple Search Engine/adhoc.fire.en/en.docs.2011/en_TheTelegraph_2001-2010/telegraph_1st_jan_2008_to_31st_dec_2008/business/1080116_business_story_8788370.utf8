     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: The moolah has started to flow into the primary market  and the pundits expect that this will soon turn into a flood.
    
	The Reliance Power IPO raised over Rs 1 trillion on the very first day and experts reckon that companies lining up their own issues in the next few weeks neednt worry about loss of investor interest in their offerings.
    
	Several large IPOs are lined up: there is UTI Asset Management Company, Emaar MGF, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Oil India Ltd, JSW Energy, Lodha Builders, Coal India Ltd and Rural Electrification Corporation to name but a few. 
    
	Incidentally, the RPower offering opened on a day when that of Future Capital Holdings was subscribed nearly 27 times on its penultimate day. The price band for the Future offering has been fixed between Rs 700 and Rs 765 per share.
    
	The success of Reliance Power will not affect other IPOs. Instead the market should continue to do well, said Prithvi Haldea of Prime, an independent analyst of the primary capital market.
    
	Earlier this month, Prime had estimated that public issue mobilisation during the current calendar could hit an all-time high of Rs 75,000 crore. This will top last years high of Rs 45,176 crore. 
    
	Haldea felt that all the talk that the Reliance Power issue was being excessively valued hadnt dimmed investor enthusiasm for the stock. 
    
	He also felt that the initial public offerings would elicit good response provided the secondary markets continued to boom.
    
	An analyst with a domestic brokerage agreed with Haldeas view. The Indian markets have not been affected by the US sub-prime crisis and it recently hit record highs. This gives investors the confidence to park their money in IPOs. Moreover, in the recent past, investors had made profits by investing in new issues. Therefore, there will be good appetite for the new issues.
    
	Incidentally, many of the new listings in recent times have come at a decent premium to their offer price.
    
	Experts also say that a boom in the primary market will only serve to act as a strong ballast for the secondary market as well, though there could be a few hiccups along the way.

	The response to the Reliance Power IPO seems to reflect the confidence of global investors in the future of the Indian economy, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today.
    
	It is a reflection of world community in the future of India ... Investors seem to be confident in the future of the Indian economy, quot; Chidambaram said.
    
	Not only was the IPO fully subscribed within a minute of opening, it generated demand worth over Rs 50,000 crore in less than two hours.

										      OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: The sensex tumbled again  a boring regular feature over the past three weeks  but the talking point in the market was the way Anil Ambanis first public issue tanked on the first day of listing.        
	The 30-share bellwether index plunged 833.98 points  its third steepest fall  but investors were counting up the losses they had made on the speculative bet they had put on Reliance Power, the countrys biggest IPO.        
	Right after opening at 17427.34 in the morning, the market went into a nosedive before settling at 16630.91, well below its January 22 low of 16729.94.         
	ADAG firms mauled        
	The Anil Ambani group of companies were mauled as well, with Reliance Energy  the parent company of Reliance Power  losing 19.4 per cent of its value.        
	The 50-share Nifty stumbled 263.35 points to 4,857, almost 5.14 per cent down from its previous close.         
	Global cues        
	The market has dropped mainly due to weak global and Asian indices. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) do not seem to be in a buying mood, and we expect the volatility to continue for at least 2 to 3 months. The forthcoming budget might not be able to provide a major fillip to the market, but we expect some stability from the second half of the year, said Mihir Vora, senior vice-president and head of fund management  equities, HSBC Mutual Fund.         
	Although the Asian markets were weak, the Indian bourses appeared to be hit hardest. The market has fallen for the fourth consecutive session today. At a total market capitalisation of about Rs. 55,34,268.17 crore, todays fall wiped out as much as Rs 2.19 trillion of investors wealth from Fridays close.         
	The FIIs were net sellers to the extent of Rs 1,268.67 crore, while domestic institutions sold stocks worth about Rs 22.27 crore. Power stocks suffered a blackout with losses of over 8.6 per cent. Oil and gas and realty stocks ended with losses of about 7 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively.        
	Big brother hurt        
	While Anil Ambani also lost about 16.36 per cent on RNRL, and about 8.62 per cent on Reliance Communications stocks, brother Mukesh Ambani lost about 7 per cent on Reliance Petroleum and about 6.07 per cent on Reliance Industries.         
	The market is expected to remain volatile and will see some support at about 14700 levels, said a senior analyst with a leading brokerage.        
	Reliance Power will gain some momentum in the long run. Given the valuations of the company, I wont ask investors to buy Reliance Power at the current levels, he added.        
	IPO market        
	Reliance Powers debacle on the first day of trading has raised questions about the success of forthcoming initial public offerings (IPOs) in the country. While the past week witnessed withdrawal of two big IPOs of Emaar MGF and Wockhardt and the failure of Reliance Power to fetch the expected premium today, investors appear to have completely lost their appetite for IPOs.         
	Asked if they were ready to stump up money in new issues, investors on Dalal Street said they would not want to lock in any money in IPOs until the stock market stabilised. Many investors even said they would never invest in any public offer that carried the Reliance name.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MTNL first to dial 3G
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with telecom minister A. Raja in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) today became the first player to offer 3G services in India.        
	The PSU launched 3G in a limited way in Delhi and will be offering the service free to its premium mobile customers for a month. Full-fledged 3G is expected within two months.        
	Once our network is complete, we will make it available to everyone. Commercial launch in Mumbai will also happen by January-end, MTNL chairman and managing director R.S.P. Sinha said.        
	Worldwide, 3G has revolutionised the cellular experience with value-added offerings such as high-speed Internet and mobile TV.        
	MTNL hopes to announce the prices by February.        
	Our 3G pricing cannot be different from the existing prices across the world. It has to be affordable, Sinha said.         
	Motorola will set up the 3G network, which MTNL is offering under the brand name of Jadoo.         
	Sinha said he expected a bulk of MTNLs revenues to come from new services such as Internet protocol television (IPTV), broadband and 3G by next year.         
	Analysts are, however, doubtful of the company getting a first-mover advantage.        
	MTNL is generally a slow mover on the ground, said Sheriyar Irani, co-head of research at JM Financial Institutional Securities. They will have to move fast, with the private operators expected to launch their own services by the second half of the next calendar year, assuming the auctions go on time, he said.         
	Fellow PSU Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd expects to launch 3G in Chennai by mid-January.        
	Being government entities, the duo have received spectrum, unlike their private rivals who will get spectrum through an auction, which is expected to be over by February.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Whiff of relife                          
	Mumbai, April 25: Gujarat High Court has restored tax benefits to Essar Oils refinery at Vadinar. The company had moved court against the Gujarat governments decision to stop the benefit to the refinery, which has a capacity of 10.5 million tonnes.        
	A division bench of the court, which sits in Ahmedabad, allowed Essar Oil to avail itself of a sales tax/value added tax deferment benefit up to 125 per cent of investment in the refinery.        
	The Gujarat government, in the late nineties, had allowed the deferment of the taxes up to a maximum of 17 years, subject to some investment eligibility criteria that included an investment of more than Rs 1,000 crore.        
	Projects of Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, among others, were eligible for the relief.        
	However, the state government rejected the benefit to Essar on the grounds of delay in starting production at the refinery.        
	The court has curtailed the deferment period for Essar Oil till 2020 and the deferment benefit by over Rs 1,000 crore.        
	During the period of the dispute, the court said, the Gujarat government had improved infrastructure at Vadinar, which might have helped Essar Oil.        
	A deferment benefit on sales tax means an entity can put off the payment of the tax for a fixed period or up to a specified monetary limit. The same applies to a deferment benefit on VAT (value-added tax).        
	Under the scheme, the deferred amount of the sales tax will be recovered by the state from Essar Oil in six equal annual instalments.        
	The court directed the Gujarat government to issue the final eligibility certificate within a month.        
	The Essar Oil scrip ended marginally higher at Rs 280.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange after the news.         
	The Ruias have invested close to Rs 10,000 crore in the refinery and have firmed up plans to raise its capacity.                          
	Last year, the company said that close to $6 billion would be spent on raising refining capacity to 34 million tonnes by 2010.

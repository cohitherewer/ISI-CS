          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 19: Bombay High Court today cleared the plan to demerge Bajaj Auto, the Rs 10,834-crore maker of two-wheelers.        
	The courts sanction is a major step forward in the long-drawn process that began last May when the companys board cleared a plan to carve out three entities  an auto company, a wind power and financial services company, and a primary investment company that would focus on new business opportunities.        
	Bajaj Auto will now file the order with the office of the Registrar of Companies (Maharashtra) in Pune and initiate steps to complete the process.        
	Under the demerger plan, two subsidiaries will be created: Bajaj Holdings and Investment Ltd (BHIL) and Bajaj Finserv Ltd (BFL).        
	In the first step, the auto business will be transferred to BIHL along with a cash equivalent of Rs 1,500 crore.        
	The wind power projects and the investments in the groups insurance ventures  Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company  will be transferred to BFL along with Rs 800 crore. Bajaj Auto will subscribe to 43.5 million shares of Rs 10 each in BHIL and an equal number of shares of Rs 5 each in Bajaj Finserv. Later, BHIL  the new auto company  will be renamed as Bajaj Auto.         
	The existing Bajaj Auto will be renamed as Bajaj Holdings and Investment and this will act as the primary investment company. All shareholders of Bajaj Auto will become shareholders in the two new companies and will be issued shares in the ratio of 1:1.        
	Officials from Bajaj Auto were not available for comment, but it was speculated that the new entity could be listed within the next two to three months.

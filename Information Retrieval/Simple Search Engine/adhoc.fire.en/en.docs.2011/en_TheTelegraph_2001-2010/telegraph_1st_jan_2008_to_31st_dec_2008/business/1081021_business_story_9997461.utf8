          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The government will restructure the capital base of state-run Uco Bank and Punjab amp; Sind Bank (PSB) to improve their valuations.        
	In its supplementary demand for grants, tabled in Parliament today by finance minister P. Chidambaram, the government said it planned to convert Rs 250 crore of Uco Banks equity into perpetual non-convertible preference shares. Uco has a paid-up capital of around Rs 800 crore.        
	Of the Rs 743-crore paid-up capital in Punjab amp; Sind Bank, the government will convert nearly Rs 560 crore into preferential shares and debt instruments. Post restructuring, the banks equity base will come down to nearly Rs 180 crore.        
	Around Rs 160 crore of PSBs equity will be converted into innovative perpetual debt and Rs 200 crore into perpetual non-cumulative preference shares. Another Rs 200 crore will be converted into perpetual cumulative preference shares.         
	As restructuring of equity capital is involved in both cases and there is no cash outgo, a token supplementary is sought, Chidambaram said.         
	PSB is planning to dilute 25-30 per cent stake through the private placement of equity with public sector companies.

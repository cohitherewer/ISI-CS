          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Tea prices are set to rise next year as stocks may fall short by 43 million kg in April. This year, there was a shortage of 28 million kg, while it was 3 million kg last year.        
	North India  Bengal and Assam  may have to grapple with a higher shortage in April as South India has fared better in terms of production.        
	Assuming no production after December 20, there will be no tea in the broking system after the middle of February, Aditya Khaitan, chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA), said.        
	ITAs status report expects production of 962 million kg, higher than 945 million kg last year. But this has been offset by a higher tea export of 200 million kg against 179 million kg in 2007. Consumption has increased from 810 million kg to 825 million kg.

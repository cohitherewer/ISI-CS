          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Leeladhar: Forward march                                  
	Mumbai, April 17: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will play a supportive role in jump-starting the process of bank mergers  which could begin as early as next year with the possible relaxation in the rules governing foreign investment in banks.        
	The RBI  as the regulator and supervisor of the banking system  will continue to play a supportive role in the task of banking consolidation based on commercial considerations, RBI deputy governor V. Leeladhar said here today.        
	Analysts interpreted Leeladhars comment made at the International Banking amp; Finance Conference 2008 as a signal that the RBI would permit foreign banks to pick up higher stakes in local private banks. At present, a foreign bank with operations in the country cannot hold more than 5 per cent in another private sector bank.        
	The rules are due to come up for review sometime next year. Leeladhar said consolidation was required to further strengthen the Indian financial sector and support growth while securing the stability of the system.        
	There have been 22 bank mergers since 1990 and another one is brewing this year: the merger of Centurion Bank of Punjab with HDFC Bank.         
	Leeladhar said the Reserve Bank had found no reason to reject any scheme of merger or amalgamation that had been placed before it in the recent past.        
	There have been five voluntary amalgamations between private sector banks so far. However, the amalgamation of Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad and the Federal Bank had taken place at the RBIs behest.        
	He said there were adequate enabling provisions within the existing statutes to pave the way for the merger of public sector banks.        
	The RBI deputy governor said the residuary non-banking finance companies (RNBCs) would have to look for a new business model after the changes in their operating environment.         
	The notable RNBCs are entities such as Lucknow-based Sahara India Financial Corporation and Calcutta-based Peerless General Finance.        
	With the number of deposit taking non-banking finance companies declining to 376 in March this year from 710 in 2003, Leeladhar said, Perhaps the time has come when we can now think of only allowing banks to acquire public deposits.        
	Leeladhar said foreign exchange derivatives did not pose any systemic risks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 30: The economy today received a double jolt  a four-year-high inflation of 8.1 per cent and the possibility of a slower growth rate of 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	However, there was some cheer for the government, facing a general election early next year, in the form of an upward revision of growth to 9 per cent during the last fiscal. According to the government, this was made possible by better farm growth.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today admitted that the relentless rise in oil prices, which has helped fuel inflationary pressures, remains a cause for concern.        
	He said there were no easy solutions to the crude price spiral. The government has already imposed curbs on the export of key products, including rice and steel, and lowered the import duty on food and metal products as well as on cement to raise domestic supplies and battle rising prices.        
	If the situation demands, the government plans to take more measures to fight prices.        
	Prices of commodities produced in India are certainly moderating, but prices of anything that is globally traded and we import are not declining. All I can say is food prices may moderate though it is difficult to hazard a guess whether non-food prices will moderate, the minister said.        
	Unless non-food prices decline, it is very difficult to hazard a guess about the inflation trend. The finance minister said the economy in 2008-09 would grow at 8.5 per cent. The current financial year appears even more difficult than the year that has come to an end, but I am confident we will maintain growth, he said.        
	Policy-makers must ensure the judicious use of interest rate to fight inflation, so that growth is not hurt in the process.        
	To boost growth, the finance ministry yesterday raised the limit on overseas borrowing by companies. Infrastructure companies can borrow as much as $100 million overseas, up from a previous limit of $20 million, while other companies can borrow $50 million compared with the earlier cap of $20 million.        
	The dilemma between rising inflation and slowing growth will continue and we expect the central bank to tighten monetary policy, said Sonal Varma, economist at Lehman Brothers.        
	The question is whether the service sector can sustain this pace. We have our doubts, she said. The analyst expected high oil prices, financial market turbulence and slowing world demand to play a decisive role in this fiscal        
	Manufacturing grew 5.8 per cent in the January-March quarter, down from 9.6 per cent growth in the October-December quarter, while services grew 11.2 per cent.        
	On manufacturing growth falling to 8.8 per cent for 2007-08 from 9.4 per cent estimated by the government earlier, Chidambaram said the government would take corrective measures. We will address why there is a slowdown in manufacturing. We will have to take some corrective measures.         
	Farm output grew 2.9 per cent in the quarter to March compared with 6 per cent in the prior three months.        
	Agriculture, which has a weight of about 24 per cent in the calculation of the gross domestic product (GDP), probably grew 4.5 per cent on the back of bumper winter wheat crops against earlier estimates of 2.6 per cent.        
	Analysts said double-digit growth in services, with hotels, trade and transport growing 12 per cent and financing, insurance and real estate, 11 per cent, helped pull up overall GDP growth.         
	In April, the ministry of agriculture had raised foodgrain output figures for 2007-08 by 10 million tonnes (mt) to 227.32mt, which was disputed by several top farm economists, including the then chairman of the agricultural costs and prices commission.        
	Economists in the Planning Commission had said the upward revision was a statistical exercise. It was dependant on the reporting by the agricultural ministry which may not be totally reliable.        
	Silver lining        
	India has been better off in managing food inflation compared with several other developing countries in 2007-08.        
	Prices of food articles rose 5.8 per cent in India, the lowest increase among 15 developing countries for the period ended February 2007-08, a joint report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organisation has said.        
	Food prices showed the highest increase at 25.6 per cent in Sri Lanka, followed by Kenya, 24.6 per cent, and China, 23.3 per cent, the report said.

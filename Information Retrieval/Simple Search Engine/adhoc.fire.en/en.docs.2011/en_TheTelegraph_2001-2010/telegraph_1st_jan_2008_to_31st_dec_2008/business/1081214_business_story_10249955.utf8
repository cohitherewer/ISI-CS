The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wall Street investors in a tizzy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wall Street investors in a tizzy
                            
	New York, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Investors scrambled to assess potential losses from an alleged $50-billion fraud by Bernard Madoff, a day after the arrest of the prominent Wall Street trader.        
	Regulators accused Madoff, who was chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market in the early 1990s, of masterminding a fraud of epic proportions through his investment advisory business, which managed at least one hedge fund.        
	Hundreds of people investing with him through the firms clients entrusted Madoff with billions of dollars, industry experts said.        
	It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth has gone to money heaven, an analyst said.        
	Federal agents arrested Madoff on Thursday after prosecutors said he told senior employees that his money management operations were all just one big lie and basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.        
	A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones, and is dependent on a constant stream of new investment. Because the invested capital is not earning a sufficient return on its own, such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight.

	Calcutta, Jan. 14: Its not only the aam aadmi who is going gaga over the Tatas Rs 1-lakh car. A top ranking US government official was all praise for the Nano today.
 
	David S. Bohigian, the US assistant secretary of commerce, described the small car as a great step in Indian engineering and entrepreneurship.
 
	It is a world-class product. It is a completely new category in the auto industry, Bohigian said in Calcutta today.
 
	He was in the city, leading a team of 11 clean energy companies. 
 
	Since the launch of the Nano at the Auto Expo in New Delhi last week, almost everyone had something to say about the car. However, this is the first time that a foreign diplomat commented on it.
 
	Strong support
 
	The Indo-US nuclear deal may be hanging fire, but this has not stopped top US government officials from praising the pro-industrialisation policy pursued by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.
 
	Speaking at a CII business meet in the city today, Bohigian said: We are happy that industrial capacity is being enhanced and service industry is thriving. Industrialisation and the positive development create the investment opportunity here.

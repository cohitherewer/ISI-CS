                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Retail FDI to remain a pariah
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Frown factor                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: Multinational retailers have little to rejoice at the news of their bete-noire, the Left, threatening to withdraw support to the UPA.        
	Not only will the ruling alliance be forced to continue stonewalling FDI in retail but it may also bring in an act to regulate organised retailers to protect small shop-owners.         
	The Samajwadi Party, which is likely to lend support to the Congress in cobbling together a majority in Parliament, has made it clear that it will oppose the entry of multinationals.        
	Moreover, the party has demanded an act to set up a regulatory body, which will protect the interests of small retailers.         
	We have already made it clear that the Samajwadi Party will oppose foreign investment in multi-brand retailing. We are also asking the government to quickly come out with an act of Parliament to regulate corporate retailers who pose a threat to small shops, said Banwari Lal Kanchal, a Samajwadi Party MP.        
	The Left has already opposed multinationals, sought the regulation of organised retailers and questioned the legality of multinationals entering India through back-end supply management pacts with local firms.        
	Wal-Mart and Metro are the global chains to have entered via the supply pacts.        
	A regulatory mechanism is a necessary step. Our apprehensions about big retail are not just confined to foreign direct investments, said Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader.         
	Top CPM leaders have also, reportedly, stressed the need for the regulation of the sector.        
	There have to be set parameters even for domestic big retailers. We are not batting for them against foreign retailers, RSP leader Abani Roy added.         
	Even some of the UPA constituents such as the RJD and the NCP are not prepared to allow FDI in retail now.         
	The opposition stems from the fears of huge job losses as big retailers expand.        
	However, government officials said the aim was to limit retail format stores supported by multinationals to upmarket products in selected areas.        
	Top finance ministry officials feel it can prove to be a goldmine in terms of foreign investment.

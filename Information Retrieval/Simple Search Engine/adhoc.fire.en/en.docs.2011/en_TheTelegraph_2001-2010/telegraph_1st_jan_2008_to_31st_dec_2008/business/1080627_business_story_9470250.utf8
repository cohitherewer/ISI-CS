          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          P. Chidambaram with Chauhan in New Delhi on Thursday (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 26: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today approved a new concession scheme for phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, which will reduce the subsidy bill by Rs 1,163 crore and encourage higher production.        
	Under the new scheme, indigenous di-ammonium phosphate has been brought on a par with imported di-ammonium phosphate for calculating concessions.        
	The cabinet also decided that the department of fertilisers would maintain a buffer stock of 3.5 lakh tonnes of di-ammonium phosphate and one lakh tonnes of muriate and potash to meet any exigency. Both di-ammonium phosphate and muriate and potash are part of the phosphatic and potassic family.        
	There will be no impact on the retail price of fertilisers because of the new scheme, fertiliser secretary J.S. Sarma said. It will come into effect retrospectively from April 1, 2008.        
	The scheme will provide a long-term perspective to the fertiliser industry to seek out new and cheaper source of phosphatic and potassic raw material, intermediaries and finished fertilisers and will thereby help the Indian farmers meet their nutrients requirements, said Prithviraj Chauhan, minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office.        
	To expand the basket of phosphatic and potassic fertiliser, the Centre approved the inclusion of triple super phosphate fertiliser, which is a cheaper alternative to di-ammonium phosphate, in the new concession scheme.        
	Similarly, with a view to encourage the balanced use of fertilisers, ammonium sulphate has been included in the new scheme through a 25 per cent subsidy on delivered cost.        
	In another decision, the cabinet today gave a Rs 48.52 crore budgetary support to 10 sick PSUs, including Calcutta-based Hindustan Cables.        
	Oil plans        
	The CCEA today gave its approval to ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd  the joint venture between steel baron L. N. Mittal and ONGC Videsh Limited  to invest $155 million in a Trinidad and Tobago gas block and another $282 million in two exploration blocks in Brazil.        
	To promote research and development of drugs for neglected diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, the cabinet today approved the extension of grants-in-aid to pharmaceutical firms, with Rs 45 crore being earmarked in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2102).

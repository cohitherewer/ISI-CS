	Bela Horizonte (Brazil), Feb. 10: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel making company, is planning to set up its own distribution network in India to hawk products that will be manufactured by its proposed facilities in Orissa and Jharkhand.        
	The distribution set-up is part of an integrated value chain that the steel giant already has. ArcelorMittal will invest an estimated $20 billion in the Orissa and Jharkhand projects. They will have an eventual capacity of 12 million tonnes each, and production for the first phase of six million tonnes is expected to begin late in 2010.        
	A senior official from ArcelorMittal said unlike the conventional distribution set-up, which markets only a particular kind of products, the companys network would offer a range of services. They will do what it takes to satisfy the clients. If the clients want some changes in the products, it will be done. The idea is to move closer to the customer and have a direct link with him, the official added.        
	ArcelorMittal has distribution networks in Europe and South America. But this isnt the only area where the company will introduce some of the best practices from its overseas operations. Our group has a lot of experience in replanting forest land. Moreover, there are other energy-saving and environmental control techniques that can be implemented in India, sources said.        
	ArcelorMittal has a 7.5-million-tonne unit at its Tubarao facility in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil. The unit is self sufficient in power as it uses gases generated from the mills own production process to produce electricity.        
	While its not yet clear as to which among the two projects will kick off first, officials said a Delhi-based engineering entity, Dastur amp; Company, was involved in the process of putting a detailed project report.         
	The report is expected to be ready by June. While the report will go into the nitty gritty of the projects, ArcelorMittal has formed a 15-member Indian technical team under the supervision of a chief technology officer, Pierre Guglier Mina. The team will vet the detailed project report and try to improve it if needed. They will bring their international expertise and then we will have a final document, the sources added.        
	Simultaneously, ArcelorMittal, which has now applied for mining blocks in Orissa and Jharkhand, is also looking into the issue of rehabilitation and resettlement in both the states.

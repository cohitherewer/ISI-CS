          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 19: BK Birla Group-promoted Century Textile and Industries Ltd is planning to set up around 10 stores this fiscal in the eastern region.         
	The stores, operating under brand name Cotton by Century, will be primarily franchise outlets.        
	Real estate prices are so high at the moment and there is so much discounting in retail that unless we see clear profit, we do not open a store, Subrata Siddhanta, business head of Cotton by Century told The Telegraph.        
	The company is targeting a revenue of Rs 100 crore by the end of 2008-09.         
	We have a revenue of Rs 61 crore right now and will reach Rs 100 crore soon. The numbers stood at Rs 8 crore when we started in 2004, Siddhanta added.         
	The company has recently made its foray into denim and womens garments.         
	The youth and womens clothes segment hold a lot of potential. We can increase our revenues substantially by catering to the needs of women and youngsters, Siddhanta added.        
	According to a recent report, about 50 per cent of Indian youth favour denims. The companys denim business has witnessed 15 per cent year-on-year growth.         
	About 25 per cent of our turnover comes from clothes for young people, marketed through the Century UVA brand. We are planning to increase this to 40 per cent by the end of this year, Siddhanta told the media.        
	Womens clothes contribute 10 per cent to Century Textiles revenues, and the company is planning to increase this to 20 per cent by the end of this fiscal.        
	The company has 124 stores, most of which are located in western India. Almost 50 per cent of the companys business come from western India, 20 per cent from north, 25 per cent from south and 5 per cent from the eastern region.        
	Century Textile has posted a net profit of Rs 279.43 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008 compared with Rs 272.81crore in the previous fiscal.

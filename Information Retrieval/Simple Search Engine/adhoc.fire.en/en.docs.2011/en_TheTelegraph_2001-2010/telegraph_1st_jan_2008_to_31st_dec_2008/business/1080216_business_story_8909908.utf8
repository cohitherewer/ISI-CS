The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ficci wants cut in rates
                                                                                                               Ficci wants cut in rates
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: A fortnight before Budget 2008-09, Ficci has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to address concerns about rupee appreciation, rising interest rates, infrastructure spending and the shortage of skilled workers.         
	Addressing the 80th annual general meeting of the chamber, the Prime Minister said, We are in the midst of the budget season ... but I am sure that the ministers will take note of what has been stated by your (Ficci) president.        
	In the chambers budget wish list, Ficci president Habil Khorakiwala has demanded the lowering of interest rates. Khorakiwala said soft interest rates would make many manufacturing projects, which are on the drawing board, viable.         
	 Khorakiwala also referred to delays and cost escalations in infrastructure projects. A recent review said 301 infrastructure projects have been delayed by up to 96 months, with a cumulative cost overrun of Rs 48,000 crore. Efficient implementation is the need of the hour and public-private partnership is the model for that, said Khorakiwala.        
	Singh, however, said, I read a lot about the poor state of our infrastructure. In fact, facts tell a slightly different story. Singh said the civil aviation sector was going through an unprecedented boom, with two international airports taking off in Hyderabad and Bangalore in a few weeks.         
	The industry also asked Singh to address the shortage of skilled workforce in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, textiles, food processing and the automotive industry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mumbai land sale loses steam
                                                                                                               Mumbai land sale loses steam
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 18: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) got a poor response to its auction of five plots covering 58,402 square metre at the Bandra Kurla complex.        
	Of the four plots and one gymnasium on sale, one commercial and two residential plots were able to get bidders. The two residential plots were sold for Rs 248 crore each, while the commercial property fetched Rs 826 crore.         
	Jet Airways bid for the commercial plot at Rs 3.44 lakh per square metre. The residential plots went to Starlight Systems for Rs 3.52 lakh per square metre. Starlight Systems is part of Piramal Sunteck Realty, which is a joint venture between the Ajay Piramal group and Sunteck Realty.        
	The 5,952-square-metre commercial space has a maximum development area of 24,000 square metre.        
	According to Ambar Maheshwari, director (investment advisory) of DTZ, What has happened in Bandra Kurla is a reflection of what has been happening in the real estate market in the country in the last three to six months. We have been witnessing a slowdown in the market in the last six months, and Mumbai is no exception.        
	There are quite a few reasons for the slowdown  unsustained realty prices, high interest rates and so on. People have been waiting for a correction for quite sometime. One of the final reasons for the slowdown has been oversupply. Besides, the volatility in the stock market has just aggravated the situation, Maheshwari said. DTZ is a real estate advisory firm.        
	One of the plots which failed to attract any bid was to have an underground parking, garden and a gymnasium equipped with facilities such as a swimming pool, a restaurant and a badminton court.         
	MMRDA officials admitted that the poor response could be because of the fluctuations in financial markets.        
	There were nine bidders each for the two residential plots which have a combined built-up area of 14,100 square metre.        
	Some of the other bidders were the K Raheja group, Peninsula Land and Akruti Nirman. MMRDA will gain around Rs 1,300 crore from the land sale.         
	The plots are located close to the National Stock Exchange and overlook the Mithi River.        
	The MMRDA had fixed a reserve price of Rs 3 lakh per square metre for the three plots. This price is less than Rs 5.04 lakh per square metre paid by Wadhwa Developers in November last year for a built-up area of 16,500 square metre.

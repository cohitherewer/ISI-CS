	Mumbai, Jan. 7: The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI)  the countrys largest liner  plans to start building ships.
    
	The company is in talks with private shipbuilders at home and abroad for a shipyard project that will cost around Rs 4,000 crore. 
    
	We are negotiating with both Indian shipbuilders as well as foreign companies. An agreement is expected to be formalised in two months time, said SCI chairman and managing director S. Hajara. 
    
	The Indian shipbuilders with whom the SCI is in talks already have the land to house the new venture.
    
	If the SCI decides to go with a foreign partner, it will have to approach the Centre or the respective state governments for allotment of land. 
    
	Hajara refused to divulge the names of shipyards the SCI is talking to.
    
	The SCI is characterised as a mini ratna public sector unit, which empowers its board to invest up to Rs 500 crore without having to seek approval from the Union cabinet. 
    
	The company plans to rely on debt to fund the joint venture shipyard project.
    
	Our share will entirely depend on the equity structure we have with the partner. However, we plan to raise debt to fund our share, Hajara said. 
    
	Currently, SCI operates 83 ships with a capacity of 4.8 million dead weight tonnes (DWT), which accounts for 35 per cent of Indias total shipping tonnage.
    
	It has placed orders for another 28 ships amounting to around 2.4 million DWT that will cost around Rs 6,500 crore. The orders include container ships, tankers, bulk carriers and anchor-handling tugs.
    
	Over the next three years, the SCI plans to place orders for another 50 vessels, subject to government approvals.
    
	The company plans to achieve a total tonnage of 8 million DWT by 2011. 
    
	During this period, the company may have to scrap an estimated 1 million DWT as 30 per cent of its fleet comprises single hull ships Under international maritime norms, single hull ships will not be allowed to ply beyond 2010.
    
	Despite the current boom in the shipping industry, the Indian fleet is growing only by 17 per cent compared with 40 per cent growth in countries such as the US and China.

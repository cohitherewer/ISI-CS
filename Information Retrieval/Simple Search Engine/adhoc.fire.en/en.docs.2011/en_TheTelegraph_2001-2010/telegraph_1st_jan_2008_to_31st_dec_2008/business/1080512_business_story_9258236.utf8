          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New connection                                  
	Mumbai, May 11: Reliance Communications (R-Com) and Alcatel-Lucent will form a joint venture to manage network services of telecom companies.         
	Initially, the joint venture will manage R-Coms CDMA and GSM networks in 12 circles in the northern and western parts of the country. Reliance sources said the value of this deal was $400-500 million.        
	The venture will later expand to other areas as R-Com prepares for a pan-India rollout of GSM services by the middle of next year.         
	The new entity also plans to go global at a later stage, said sources. R-Com officials said the company had been scouting for partners who would be able to manage its CDMA and GSM networks.        
	Officials said they expected Alcatel-Lucents end-to-end network integration capabilities to help R-Com serve its customers better.         
	It will improve our competitiveness by reducing operating expense without sacrificing network quality. With the combination of network management and operational expertise, consulting and IT experience, as well as technology, Alcatel-Lucent will help in setting up a process-driven organisation, officials said.        
	The joint venture will support the expansion and growth of Reliance outside India, bringing predictability of operations and related expenses, while maintaining the highest standards of customer experience, they added.         
	We will be building on the existing operational and multi-vendor capabilities to drive this innovative business model, which is a unique partnership between a leading service provider and a leading vendor in the telecom space, said Vivek Mohan, managing director of Alcatel-Lucent India.         
	In early 2004, Bharti Airtel had signed a Rs 1,800-crore outsourcing contract with Swedish technology provider Ericsson for managing its cellular network.         
	The deal, which was signed for Airtels 13 mobile circles for three years, was the first of its kind in the world. Officials estimate the network management business of new players at $7-10 billion.         
	A host of new players, including Videocon, Unitech and Datacom, have received telecom licences and will begin operations by the middle of 2010. A number of existing players such as Idea Cellular and Spice Telecom have also received licences.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The government will seek voluntary contributions under its new pension scheme from public and private sector employees, including state government staff, self-employed professionals and informal sector workers.
    
	When it was launched in 2003, the scheme was open to all, while it was mandatory for central government employees who joined after January 1, 2004. However, not many have taken advantage of the scheme voluntarily. 
    
	Though some state governments have in recent months agreed to join, Bengal has refused to participate. The Left had objected to the scheme and the pension regulator bill which the government had sought to bring in. 
    
	Their fear is of the twin moves being used to bring in foreign investments in pensions and channel pension and provident fund savings into the capital market.
    
	The bill continues to hang fire in Parliament as the Left, on whose support the government depends, has made clear its refusal to pass the bill.
    
	The Japan Special Fund is providing a $1-million grant to help the government shift to the new scheme and develop supporting infrastructure. 
    
	To be managed by the Asian Development Bank, this grant will help establish a broad-based income security system through pensions, especially for the informal sector workforce. 
    
	The grant should help ease the fiscal burden of the government and contribute to the development of the national capital market as pension funds are important sources for long-term funding, a bank statement said. 
    
	Under the new scheme, a central government employee and the Centre both contribute 10 per cent of the employees salary to a fund. The income from this fund is the employees pension, unlike the current system that imposes an undefined liability on the government alone for the pension.

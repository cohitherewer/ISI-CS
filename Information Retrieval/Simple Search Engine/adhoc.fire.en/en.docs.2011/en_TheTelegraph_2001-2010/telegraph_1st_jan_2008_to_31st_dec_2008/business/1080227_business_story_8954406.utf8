     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Mumbai, Feb. 26: The sensex hitched a ride today on Lalu Prasads gravy train.
    
	The railway ministers announcement sent the 30-stock index surging by about 156 points to 17806.19 at the close of trading. In tandem, the Nifty climbed 70 points at 5270.05.
    
	Grasim was the biggest gainer in the sensex pack, gaining over 5 per cent at Rs 3,042.70, a beneficiary of the railways reduction in freight charges by 6 per cent.
    
	But steel stocks were the most buoyant today, sensing a sharp increase in demand for products after Lalu Prasad announced plans to add another 20,000 wagons to its fleet.
    
	Although stainless steel prices are mostly driven by international demand, analysts believe that the announcement will help boost investors sentiments in the coming days. 
    
	The announcement may not have any significant impact on the stock prices of stainless steel because the profitability of companies manufacturing the product are predominantly governed by global demands, said Sanjay Jain, analyst with Motilal Oswal Financial Services. 
    
	Given the fact that India is too small a player in stainless steel production in the international market, the prices of steel will not see any immediate impact. But the announcement will certainly have an effect on local demand, Jain added. 
    
	India produces 1.5-2 million tonnes of stainless steel annually, of which about 1 million tonnes are exported.
    
	Shares of Jindal Stainless jumped by about 7.2 per cent, while Jindal Steel and Bhushan Steel gained about 4 per cent each. Tata Steel, SAIL, and Jindal Steel clocked the highest turnovers on the BSE. 
    
	Infotech stocks rose after the railway minister unveiled plans for an integrated security plan that would involve the installation of hi-tech gadgets at vulnerable railway stations.

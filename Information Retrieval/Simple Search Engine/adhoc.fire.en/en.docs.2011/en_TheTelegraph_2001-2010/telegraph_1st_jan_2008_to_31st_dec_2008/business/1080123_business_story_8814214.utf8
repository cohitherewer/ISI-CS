     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: India wants East Asian airlines to fly directly to destinations such as Gaya, Khajuraho and Agra.
    
	According to Ambika Soni, union minister of tourism and culture, better connectivity to these regions will help India strengthen its tourism ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
    
	We are developing world class tourism infrastructure around 15 of our most important heritage sites such as the Taj Mahal, Hampi, Ajanta and Ellora and Bodh Gaya. These sites are now connected by air and we (the government) will encourage airlines to directly operate flights to these areas without having to go via major cities, said Soni at the ongoing India-Asean tourism ministerial meeting. 
    
	With the support of the private sector we should be able to work out attractive tour packages that cater to the needs of Asean tourists, she added.
    
	India is participating for the first time in the ministerial meeting, being held in Bangkok. Outbound tourism from India crossed 8 million in the last calendar year. The Asean region is one of the prime beneficiaries of this outbound traffic from India, said Soni.
    
	At the last India-Asean summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced a target of one million tourist arrivals from Asean by 2010.

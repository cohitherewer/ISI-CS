          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Hyundai Motor India plans to make India its global small car hub and will increase its R amp;D headcount four-fold for the purpose.        
	The company also plans to increase export by about 8 per cent for the rest of the year. It will begin exporting engines from its Chennai plant next year.        
	Our parent company has decided that all small cars will be produced from India in the future and so all research work for small cars will happen here, H.S. Lheem, managing director and CEO of Hyundai Motor India, said on the eve of the companys 10th anniversary celebrations. Small cars have found a new market in the US following the spike in crude prices.        
	By next year, the company will step up its R amp;D headcount to 800 from around 250. It is setting up a new centre at the IT park in Hyderabad, which will open by April next year.        
	We will start exporting engines next year, mainly to our Korean partner Kia Motors. A certain portion will also go to Malaysia and other Asian markets, Lheem said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel turns costlier
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet fuel turns costlier
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, June 30: In a move that could further make air travel costlier, oil companies today raised jet fuel prices by 4 per cent to 7 per cent.         
	With little operating margins and mounting losses, analysts said all carriers would hike the ticket prices to meet the latest hike in ATF prices.        
	Jet fuel would cost Rs 78,641.65 per kilo litre in Calcutta, while in Mumbai it would cost Rs 71,630.53 and in Delhi Rs 69,097.19. The rates, which are revised at the beginning of each month, would be effective from midnight tonight. The decision to hike the jet fuel prices comes at a time when the aviation industry is reeling under intense pressure of rising operating costs, and leading airlines like Jet Airways reporting losses running into crores of rupees.        
	Crude course        
	Oil rose more than $3 a barrel on Monday to a new record above $143, propelled by heightened market fears of conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehrans nuclear programme.        
	Prices later retreated from session highs, partly reflecting a rebound in the US dollar versus the euro.         
	During mid-day trading, the US light crude was up $1.76 at $141.97 a barrel, after a record high of $143.67 a barrel. London Brent crude was up $1.91 at $142.22. There are many high-level geopolitical news items, particularly in West Asia, that are pushing prices up, an analyst said.        
	The latest flare-up in crude coincided with Opecs rejection of Indias proposal on a price band to regulate prices. The oil cartel felt the market was the best judge and forecast prices climbing to $170 a barrel on summer demand in the US. Producing and consuming nations never agree on any price ... They never agreed with (Opec) price band (that operated between 2000 and 2005). Then we did away with the price band... We are never going to agree (on the price band), Opec president Chakib Khelil said.

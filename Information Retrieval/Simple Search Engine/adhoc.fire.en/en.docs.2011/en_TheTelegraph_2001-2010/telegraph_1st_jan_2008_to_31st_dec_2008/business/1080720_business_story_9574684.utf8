	New Delhi, July 19 (pti): Finance minister P. Chidambaram has suggested that the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (epfo) may invest in high yielding instruments to provide better returns to its over four crore subscribers.        
	On whether the epf rate will be increased because of the rising inflation, he said the government cant increase the interest rates on special deposit schemes (sds), where the bulk of the epf funds are parked.        
	Sds gets eight per cent returns. You cannot touch that eight per cent because that applies to many instruments also. So, it cannot be looked at in isolation, he said.        
	He, however, added that the epfo was welcome to withdraw the SDS money and invest it elsewhere, if it got better returns.         
	Chidambarams statement comes after some members of the central board of trustees of the epfo raised a demand for increasing the interest rate on provident fund to 12 per cent from 8.5 per cent.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wipro honcho quits
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 28: This is an exit waiting to happen.        
	P.R. Chandrasekar, president (Americas and Europe), Wipro, who was left out recently when the company had announced a major management restructuring, has put in his papers. Confirming this, a company spokesperson refused to give any reason for the move.        
	It was quiet evident in the recent reshuffle that Chandrasekar was not given any new responsibility. His peers, Girish Paranjpe and Suresh Vaswani, were elevated to the positions of joint CEOs of the Global IT business.        
	After any management restructuring, there is always some unrest. But that does not mean that Wipro has lost its sheen. The shares may remain volatile tomorrow, but Wipros fundamentals are strong. So, I do not see any long term impact of this exit, said an industry analyst.        
	Chandrasekar was appointed as the CEO of the companys businesses in the Americas and Europe in 2005, a month after Wipros high-profile vice-chairman Vivek Paul quit to join the US-based global private investment fund, Texas Pacific Group.        
	In his earlier roles in Wipro, Chandrasekar has been responsible for global mergers and acquisitions, channel development and the global .net business.         
	The Wipro share today fell 1.82 per cent to Rs 457.70.

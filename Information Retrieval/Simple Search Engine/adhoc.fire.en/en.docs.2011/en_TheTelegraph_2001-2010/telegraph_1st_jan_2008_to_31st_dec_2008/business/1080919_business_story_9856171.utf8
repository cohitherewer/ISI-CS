	New York/London, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Morgan Stanley today topped the list of major financial firms scrambling to find a buyer.        
	It was in deal talks with US regional banking powerhouse Wachovia Corp and the negotiations have advanced to a more formal stage, a source familiar with the firms plan said.        
	The No. 2 US investment bank, whose shares are down 50 per cent this month, has also approached Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp about boosting its stake, the source said, following a $5-billion investment late last year.        
	HSBC Holdings was named by a television channel as another potential bidder for Morgan Stanley, but a person familiar with the matter said the bank is not interested.        
	Morgan Stanley and larger rival Goldman Sachs Group, the largest surviving independent Wall Street investment bank, are facing concern that the credit crunch can constrict the short-term funding theyve traditionally relied on. The deposit base of a commercial bank can be a more stable alternative.        
	Morgan Stanley shares were down 8 per cent in early trading, but the cost of insuring its debt against default fell.        
	Morgan Stanley is in merger talks with Wachovia, a move that would make more sense if Morgan were seeking synergies rather than seeking safety, Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York, said.        
	Wachovia shares rose 14 per cent, a top gainer as US stock markets rebounded in early trade.        
	As Morgan Stanley cast around for a lifeline, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp said it would consider all possibilities, including taking a stake, if approached.        
	Morgan Stanley officials in New York did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.        
	A spokesperson at HSBC, which this week became the worlds biggest bank by market value, also declined to comment, but a source said the bank wasnt interested in Morgan Stanley.        
	With the financial landscape undergoing its most dramatic transformation since the Great Depression, top US savings bank Washington Mutual was also tipped for a takeover.        
	Potential suitors include Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and HSBC.        
	Washington Mutual shares soared 19 per cent in early trading.        
	The AIG rescue capped a week of bailouts, bankruptcy and moves by central banks around the world to flood the financial system with funds to prevent it from seizing up.        
	Last weekend, investment bank Merrill Lynch struck a deal to sell out to Bank of America.        
	The rescue of AIG came just over a week after the government bailed out mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and six months after the US Federal Reserve brokered the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase.

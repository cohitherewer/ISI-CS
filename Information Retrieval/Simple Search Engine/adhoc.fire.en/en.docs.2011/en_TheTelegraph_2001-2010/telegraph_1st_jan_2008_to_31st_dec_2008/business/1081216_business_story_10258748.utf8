The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel cheaper, not air fare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet fuel cheaper, not air fare
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Costly affair                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Jet fuel prices were reduced once again, but airlines are unlikely to bring down fares because they want to protect margins.         
	State-run oil companies today cut jet fuel prices by over 11 per cent effective from midnight, the seventh reduction since September.        
	An Air India spokesperson said the state-run airline had not taken any decision on fares. Jet Airways vice-president Ragini Chopra said, We have not taken a call on it as yet. They duo had reduced fuel surcharge recently.        
	A spokesperson for Kingfisher said they were evaluating the impact of the move.        
	Analysts said fare cuts could help airlines fill up more seats. Occupancy has already fallen to around 50 per cent from 70 per cent last year because of high fares.        
	Jet fuel is cheaper by Rs 4,300 per kilolitre on an average from today. It constitutes around 45 per cent of an airlines operating costs and is linked to global crude movements. Jet fuel had touched around Rs 73,000 per kilolitre earlier in the year when crude values had sizzled. Since August, as crude plunged, the fuel became cheaper by 50 per cent.        
	According to the analysts, passengers have shied away from airlines because of the high fares. Airlines had increased them five times this year when crude and jet fuel prices soared.        
	However, there have been some moderation as the oil market cooled. Earlier this month, Air India had cut fuel surcharge on all domestic flights by Rs 400. Jet Airways and subsidiary JetLite also reduced the surcharge by Rs 400 and Rs 300, respectively.         
	Analysts said airlines would be under pressure to cut fares to remain competitive.         
	Almost all domestic airlines have reported losses in the second quarter of this fiscal year because the fares had reduced occupancy. The industry had lost about Rs 4,000 crore in 2007-08.        
	Jet fuel in Calcutta after todays cut is around Rs 40,824 per kilolitre; in Chennai, around Rs 36,437; in Mumbai, Rs 33,719; and in Delhi, Rs 32,691.

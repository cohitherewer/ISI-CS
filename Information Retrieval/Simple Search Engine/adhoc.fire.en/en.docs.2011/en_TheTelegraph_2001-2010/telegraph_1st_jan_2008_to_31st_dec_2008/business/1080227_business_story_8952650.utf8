	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Industrialists from China face difficulties in obtaining business and working visas in India and this is affecting investments in India, Chinese ambassador to India Zhang Yan said today.
    
	At an interactive session organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce, Yan said China was willing to encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in India, adding, We hope the Indian side could provide us more convenience in this regard.
    
	China, he said, is keen on expanding the basket of commodities imported from India. 
    
	It will begin dispatching Chinese acquisition teams to India, who will discuss with the government and the business community ways to increase imports from India. They will push forward sound and sustainable development of China-India bilateral trade, Yan said.
    
	Bilateral trade with China was $38.7 billion in 2007, up 55 per cent over the previous year. The increase in bilateral trade had made China the second largest trading partner of India.
    
	In January, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited China, a bilateral trade target of $40-60 billion for 2010 was set.

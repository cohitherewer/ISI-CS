          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 17: Ranbaxy Laboratories and Japans Daiichi Sankyo today said their stake sale deal was binding and final.        
	A statement issued today by Ranbaxy said, Following intense speculation in sections of the media and the stock market, Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy reiterate that the agreement between Daiichi, Ranbaxy and the Singh family, promoters of Ranbaxy, is binding and final, subject to regulatory approvals.        
	Last month, Daiichi agreed to buy the promoters 34.8 per cent stake in Ranbaxy Laboratories for Rs 9,576.14 crore. The agreement came under cloud following allegations about the Indian company selling spurious drugs in the US.        
	Stressing on the commitment of both the companies to the transaction, the statement said, Daiichi Sankyo, Ranbaxy and the Singh family stand by the deal and confirm that the terms of the deal remain unchanged. All the synergies expected to accrue to the combine, remain intact.        
	The deal would create a complementary business combination that provides sustainable growth by diversification and an enhanced global reach, it added.         
	The share purchase and share subscription agreement have earlier been approved by the boards of directors of both the companies. Coupled with the approval now in place from the shareholders, this clears the decks for the deal to proceed as planned, the statement said.

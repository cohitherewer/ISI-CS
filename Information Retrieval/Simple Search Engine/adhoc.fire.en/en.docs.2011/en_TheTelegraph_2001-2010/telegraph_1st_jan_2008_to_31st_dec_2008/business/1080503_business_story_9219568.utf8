	Calcutta, May 2: The State Bank of Indias net profit jumped 48.18 per cent to Rs 6,729 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 4,541 crore in 2006-07.         
	The earnings of the countrys biggest lender also improved during the fourth quarter ended March 31 to Rs 1,883 crore from Rs 1,493 crore in the previous corresponding quarter.        
	Encouraged by the increased profitability, the board of directors has proposed a 215 per cent, or Rs 21.50 per share, dividend to shareholders. For 2006-07, the SBI had declared a dividend of Rs 14 per share.        
	In 2007-08, the banks deposits grew 23.39 per cent to Rs 5,37,406 crore from Rs 4,35,521 crore a year ago and advances went up 23.36 per cent to Rs 4,22,181 crore.         
	We have consciously shed low-yielding loans worth Rs 8,000 crore in favour of high yielding assets during the year as a result of which our income went up, said . P. Bhatt, chairman and managing director of the SBI. The banks net interest margin declined marginally to 3.07 per cent from 3.14 per cent in the previous year.        
	However, the banks non-performing assets (NPA) have grown in the January-March quarter following which its gross NPA at the end of 2007-08 stood at 3.04 per cent, up from 2.12 per cent as on March 31, 2007. Net NPA also rose to 1.78 per cent from 1.56 per cent.        
	After a rights issue in February, the banks capital adequacy ratio (CAR) rose to 13.47 per cent from 12.34 per cent at the end of 2006-07. The banks net owned capital comprises 9.14 per cent (8.01 per cent) of its CAR of 13.47 per cent.         
	We have enough headroom to raise tier II capital to fund our future business growth, said a senior official of the bank. In 2008-09, the SBI expects 25 per cent growth in advances and a 20 per cent increase in deposits.        
	Besides the money raised through the rights issue, we will require between Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 25,000 crore additional capital in the next three years, Bhatt said.         
	We may look at acquiring an overseas bank next year, he added.

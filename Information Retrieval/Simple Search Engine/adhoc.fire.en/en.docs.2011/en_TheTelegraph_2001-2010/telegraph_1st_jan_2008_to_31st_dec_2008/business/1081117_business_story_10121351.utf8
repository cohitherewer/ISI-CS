          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Gujarat had pitched for the Nano project to create jobs and stimulate development in the state.        
	Besides, the state government also wanted to honour popular sentiment in favour of the Tatas, chief minister Narendra Modi said at the India Economic Summit here today. Last month, the Tatas had relocated the Nano plant from Bengal to Gujarat.        
	Modi has been accused of giving tax sops to the Tatas worth over Rs 25,000 crore to bag the project. The chief minister, however, refuted such allegations.        
	Our efforts to bring the Tatas to Gujarat was part of an honest intention to help a leading industrial house of the country, Modi said.

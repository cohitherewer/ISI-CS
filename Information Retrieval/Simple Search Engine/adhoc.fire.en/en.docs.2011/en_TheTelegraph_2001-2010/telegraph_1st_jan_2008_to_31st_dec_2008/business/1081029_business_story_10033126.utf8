	Calcutta, Oct. 28: Gold (24-carat) price in the city market shot up by Rs 235 to Rs 12,435 per 10 gram on the back of good festive demand and strong global cues.         
	In all the other major cities, the price of the yellow metal recorded a 2 per cent increase.        
	The demand for gold is rising after a period of decline since the yellow metal reached a peak of Rs 14,565 per 10 gram on October 10. The fresh demand for the precious metal picked up from last Friday on the eve of the auspicious Dhanteras and Diwali, said an official at Tanishq on Camac Street.         
	Silver also showed moderate recovery on strong festive demand. Its price rose Rs 250 to Rs 17,350 per kg.        
	According to the estimates of the All India Gems amp; Jewellery Trade Federation, jewellers across the country had sold about 50 tonnes of gold between October 1 and October 22. Between October and December last year, 80 tonnes were sold.        
	On Dhanteras (last Sunday), gold sales across the country rose 30 per cent compared with last year.         
	Jewellers attributed the rise in sales to a number of factors. First, investors see gold as a safe haven after the crash in equities; second, gold is now more affordable compared with a couple of weeks ago.         
	According to Ashok Minawala, chairman of the gems and jewellery body, there was a big turnaround in gold sales during this festive season, and about 60 tonnes of metal had been sold in the last 25 days.        
	Braj Raj of Nemchand Jewellers in Calcutta said there was a 10 per cent rise in sales. Last year, the price of gold around this time was above Rs 10,000.        
	In international markets, too, gold price gained 2 to 3 per cent over yesterdays close.

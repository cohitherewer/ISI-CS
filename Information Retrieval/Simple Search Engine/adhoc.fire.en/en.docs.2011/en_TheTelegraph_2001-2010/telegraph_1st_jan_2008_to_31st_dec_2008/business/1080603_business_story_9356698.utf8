          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, June 2: After being three years on the top, India has finally lost its position as the most preferred destination among emerging markets for retail investment, according to the seventh annual global retail development index (GRDI) by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.        
	The GRDI ranks countries among the 30 emerging markets on the basis of their retail investment attractiveness.        
	Vietnam occupies pole position in 2008. The countrys leap from the fourth place in 2007 to the top spot this year was driven by strong GDP growth, changes in its regulatory structure favouring foreign investors and increase in consumer demand for modern retail concepts.         
	India, Russia and China the top three countries in last years GRDI  fell to second, third and fourth places, respectively, in the 2008 GRDI.        
	The factors that have powered Vietnam to the top of the index this year are rapidly growing per capita income of the consumers and the drastic opening up of regulations for new entry, Saurine M. Doshi, partner at A.T. Kearney India, said in a statement today.        
	While India, Russia and China remain important destinations, high real estate prices in big cities and growing competition have decreased the attractiveness compared with the previous years and forced retailers to look for opportunities in Tier II and III cities.        
	India continues to be a dominant force in AT Kearneys annual GRDI report. While India has slipped to No. 2 this year, it continues to be a hot destination for global retailers. However, challenges such as skyrocketing real estate costs, a lack of good commercial property and complex regulations for foreign entry have caused the slide in ranking, said Hemant Kalbag, principal (consumer industries and retail practice), AT Kearney India.        
	Vietnams $20-billion retail market place is very small compared with India or China, but the absence of competition and an 8 per cent GDP growth make it an attractive opportunity for global retailers, says the report.        
	Moreover, the Vietnamese consumer is among the youngest in Asia, with 79 million below the age of 65. Moreover, the countrys consumer spending increased by more than 75 per cent between 2000 and 2007.         
	But all is not lost for India. The retail market opportunity here is larger than ever at $510 billion and spending patterns and consumer maturity are growing faster than what most retailers had forecast.         
	However, there are a few stumbling blocks that have emerged. Foreign players entering India today face stringent regulations, a clouded political atmosphere, soaring real estate costs and a fiercely competitive domestic retailer group, said the report.

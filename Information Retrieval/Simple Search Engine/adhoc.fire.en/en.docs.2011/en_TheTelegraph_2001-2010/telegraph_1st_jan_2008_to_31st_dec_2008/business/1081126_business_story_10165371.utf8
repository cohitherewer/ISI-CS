The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BHP Billiton drops Rio Tinto bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             BHP Billiton drops Rio Tinto bid
                                          
	Sydney, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Global miner BHP Billiton has walked away from its $66-billion hostile offer for rival Rio Tinto, citing worsening market conditions and European regulators demand that it sell prized iron ore and coal assets.        
	BHP said the European Commission wanted divestments in both iron ore and coal as a condition of the all-share deal which, when it was first proposed just over a year ago, was worth around $188.2 billion. Theres certainly been no indication BHP would do this  its a surprise, said Tim Barker, resource analyst at BT Financial Group in Sydney.        
	This decision suggests that BHPs board has looked at whats going on in the market and realised the situation is not quite what it was before because of the economic deterioration, Barker said.        
	Traders in London predicted BHP shares would open 20 per cent higher, while those of Rio Tinto would fall 30 per cent.        
	Iron ore was one of the main reasons behind BHPs bold bid that would have combined the assets of the worlds second and third-largest iron ore producers.        
	But faced with a 300-plus page statement of objections from Europe, which sought the sale of iron ore assets in the key Pilbara region in western Australia, BHP has ditched the bid just days ahead of a Monday deadline to offer Brussels concessions.        
	Rio Tinto consistently rejected BHPs offer of 3.4 of its shares for each Rio share as undervaluing the company.        
	BHP said it no longer believed its proposal was in the best interests of shareholders, adding it would write off around $450 million in costs.        
	Rio said it had no immediate comment.        
	Global steel makers had opposed the deal, fearing a mega merger that would control more than a third of the worlds seaborne trade in iron ore.        
	The news is positive for (South Korean) steel makers. When BHPs bid first became known, there were worries that it may cause inflexibility in iron ore pricing, said Kim Hyun-tae, analyst at Hyundai Securities in Seoul.        
	However, how much the news will help share prices of steel makers such as Posco still remains to be seen. We will have to watch the US steel makers for reaction to it, he said.

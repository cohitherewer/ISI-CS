          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 26: Tata Steel Ltd today reported 196 per cent growth in its consolidated net profit for the year ended March 31 at Rs 12,321.76 crore against Rs 4,165.61 crore in the preceding year  the surge in profits arising because of the Corus Group acquisition last year.        
	Net sales have crossed the Rs 1-trillion-mark. The steel behemoth clocked consolidated net sales of Rs 131,535.88 crore against Rs 25,212.38 crore in 2006-07. Tata Steel, however, did not give out separate numbers for Corus.        
	On a standalone basis, Tata Steel said net profit rose to Rs 4,687.03 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 4,222.15 crore last year.         
	Though the company did not reveal the fourth quarterly numbers, quick calculations show that there has been a net profit growth of little over 9 per cent to Rs 1,205.51 crore against Rs 110.5 crore in the same period last year.        
	Raw material prices have risen sharply since then. However, steel makers were persuaded by the government in late April to hold prices for at least three months.        
	 Analysts, however, say that a positive element is that Corus will be able to pass on the higher raw material costs to its consumers and this should bode well for the consolidated performance of Tata Steel.        
	Philippe Varin, CEO of Corus Group, confirmed this at a press conference held after the results were announced. Varin said the company had raised steel prices by nearly 230 euros per tonne in the past two months.         
	He added that Corus was successful in bringing down energy consumption and improving operating earnings.        
	Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said the company would increase its return on invested capital to 30 per cent by 2012 and that it would exceed the target of $450 million in savings per year.        
	He said Tata Steels domestic production would go up to around 7 million tonnes by the end of this year and jump to 10 million tonnes over the next couple of years. Even if the economy grows at a sluggish rate, we expect a substantial difference between what is produced in India and what is needed for the economic growth, he said, indicating that the prospects for the industry remained robust.        
	Tata Steel is also concentrating on acquiring raw material assets. The group has plans to reorganise in the next six to 12 months for planned growth in raw materials and expansion in new markets.

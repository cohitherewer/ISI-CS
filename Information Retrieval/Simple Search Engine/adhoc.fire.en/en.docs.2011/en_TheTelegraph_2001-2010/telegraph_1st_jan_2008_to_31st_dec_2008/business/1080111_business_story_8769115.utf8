             Chidambaram: New ways
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The government today approved a proposal to offload 28 per cent in rail infrastructure company RITES Limited through an initial public offering. 
    
	RITES Limited, a state-run engineering firm under the ministry of railways, will raise fresh equity through sale of one crore shares each of face value Rs 10 by the next financial year, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after a cabinet briefing.
    
	Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) is foraying into infrastructure projects and needs capital. 
    
	After the public issue, the paid-up equity of RITES will rise from Rs 4 crore to Rs 5 crore. 
    
	Chidambaram said that after the issue the government would hold 72 per cent equity. 
    
	The government had earlier decided to increase the paid-up capital of the company from Rs 4 crore to Rs 40 crore by issuing bonus shares of Rs 36 crore to the government.
    
	Chidambaram said the formalities of the public offer, including the appointment of advisers, would normally take three to four months. Therefore, the offer would only be possible in the next fiscal. 
    
	RITES has also decided to split the face value of its share from Rs 100 to Rs 10. Since the government holds all its 4 lakh shares, it will now increase to 4 crore.
    
	RITES has a strong presence in over 60 countries with operational experience in project consultancy, management and engineering.
    
	Besides railways, its areas of operations are transport, highways, ports, airports, inland waterways and ropeways.
    
	Loan for Sri Lanka 
    
	RITES has offered to provide a $170-million loan to Sri Lanka to upgrade the island nations railway lines in the south.
    
	The Sri Lankan ministry of transport will enter into an agreement with RITES to secure the loan, Sri Lankas transport secretary Nihal Somaweera said.
    
	The project, which will be implemented in two stages, is scheduled to be completed by the end of next year.
    
	Besides 16 power sets for long distance travel and three engines to maintain tracks, RITES has proposed to provide materials to upgrade the railway track from Colombo to Aluthgama (distance of about 57 kms by road) in the first phase of the project.
    
	Four long distance power sets to upgrade the Galle-matara railway track will be provided by RITES in the final stage of the project. Galle is located about 100 kms south of Colombo.
    
	Somaweera said the loan for the project would be granted under a credit line facility.

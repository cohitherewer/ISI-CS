	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Mahindra Kinetic Scooters and Motorcycles, the newly formed joint venture between utility vehicle leader Mahindra amp; Mahindra and two-wheeler manufacturer Kinetic Motors, wants to roll out scooters and explore opportunities to become a volume player.        
	We wish to launch at least two scooters in the first year of operation. The joint venture will continue to make Kinetics existing line of products. We have a capacity of 3-3.5 lakh units each and can be expanded by another 1.5 lakh units, a source said.        
	Sulajja Motwani, managing director of Kinetic Motors, told The Telegraph, We hope to become a volume player in the segments we operate. We will share more details once the due diligence process by Mahindra is over.        
	Kinetic has a manufacturing facility at Pitampur in Madhya Pradesh where it produces about 90,000 units a year, including two-wheelers for export.         
	Sources say Mahindra-Kinetic will also foray into the performance segment of motorcycles. Pune-based Kinetic Motors currently sells its two 100cc bikes  the Shakti and the CK  both of which are meant for the rural market.         
	Our aim is to become a volume player in the next three to four years in both the segments. In motorcycles, we will get into the performance segments (125cc and 150cc). Given Mahindras strong foothold in the rural market, we will tap it and try to price our products more competitively, the source said.         
	Some of the products will carry a Mahindra-Kinetic logo. Last month, Mahindra announced the acquisition of Kinetic Motors. According to the agreement, Mahindra will pay Rs 110 crore to acquire the assets of Kinetic Motors. Mahindra will hold an 80 per cent stake in the new company, while the balance will be held by Kinetic.        
	Mahindra officials said the company would not take over the liabilities of Kinetic Motors, and the acquisition cost of Rs 110 crore was subject to the closing of due diligence.

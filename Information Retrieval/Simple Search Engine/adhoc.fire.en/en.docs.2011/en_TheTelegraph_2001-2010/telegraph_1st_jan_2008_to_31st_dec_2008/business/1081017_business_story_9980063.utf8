          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: The Rs 5,000-crore rights issue of Hindalco Industries Ltd has devolved on the underwriters.         
	Shareholders spurned the rights shares because of the current slump in the stock markets. Hindalco said it had asked its underwriters to pick up around 34 per cent of the issue, translating into an amount of Rs 1,717.88 crore.        
	The company had offered 525,802,403 shares on a rights basis at a price of Rs 96 per share. Shareholders were slated to receive three shares for every seven held. The stock closed at Rs 69.75 on the BSE today, over 27 per cent lower than the rights issue price.        
	In a filing made with the stock exchanges today, Hindalco said provisional data showed it had received a subscription of 55.967 per cent of the issue size.        
	The rights issue was underwritten by ABN Amro Asia Equities (India) Ltd, ABN Amro Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd, Deutsche Equities India Pvt Ltd, DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd and the State Bank of India.        
	Capital market circles said the development could spell trouble for the rights issues of Tata Motors and Suzlon Energy.        
	Tata Motors will offer one ordinary share at Rs 340 for every six held and one A ordinary share at a price of Rs 305 for every six held. The A share will have differential rights on voting and dividend. The stock closed today at Rs 250.55 on the BSE.        
	Suzlon has not yet announced the terms of its rights issue.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt favours partial reform in coal mining

	New Delhi , July 27: The Congress-led government is likely to implement its decision to start the auction of coal mines for captive use but is unlikely to push an amendment, which is stuck in Parliament, to open up the vital sector to private miners for non-captive use.         
	Top officials said the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) was keen to bring in greater transparency in coal block allocations and wanted the government to quickly introduce auctions.         
	Though the coal ministry is likely to be given to Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren, the PMO will insist that reform measures it chalked out should go ahead.         
	The government may also clarify that there will be no restrictions on foreign direct investment in captive mining. This is important as blocks have been awarded to worlds No. 1 steel maker ArcelorMittal and are also likely to be given to companies such as Posco, which is setting up a steel plant in India.         
	However, a proposal to allow mining on a non-captive basis and the exploration for new reserves by private companies made in the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill 2000, which is still lying with the Parliament, will not be pushed. The officials said this was too sensitive a subject to be taken up in an election year.         
	Though most reports prepared by the Planning Commission indicate that the government should go ahead with the privatisation of the sector, powerful trade unions whose votes count in the coal-rich states of Orissa, Jharkhand and Bengal are opposed to it.        
	Privatisation has also been fought tooth and nail by the Left, and the government does not want to raise the hackles of its former partner on this issue so quickly because of electoral reasons.        
	However, an open auction of mines for end-user industries is likely to be brought about soon, said officials.         
	The allocation of coal blocks to end-users, often against vague plans for setting up power or steel plants, has attracted a lot of flak.         
	At the same time major steel makers and power companies with a proven track record have often been denied mines. The officials said it would be best to let the markets decide on such allocations, eliminating biased political and bureaucratic interference.         
	Part of the money from the auction will be earmarked for rehabilitation and community development projects in the coal bearing areas which are mostly on tribal lands. This is necessary because of the spate of unrest in Jharkhand and Orissa over land acquisition.         
	The new bidding system will provide for both financial stakes as well as penalties for not developing mines. Competition amongst bidders will be in terms of production sharing  those who offer the highest production share to the state government will get the mine.         
	Successful bidders will have to give a bank guarantee equal in value to three years of output. If the mine is not developed in time, the guarantees will be encashed and the leases cancelled.         
	Currently, about 60 per cent of the countrys total energy requirement is met by coal. Coal-based power accounts for around 70 per cent of power generation in India. Coal needs are expected to increase several fold in the next few years on account of burgeoning demand from the power, steel and cement sectors.        
	Earlier this month, the government is understood to have approved the allocation of 23 coking and non-coking coal blocks to leading steel, cement and power producers, including Essar and Grasim.        
	While four coking coal blocks have been allocated in Madhya Pradesh, the rest 19 non-coking blocks are in Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

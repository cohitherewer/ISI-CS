	New Delhi, Oct. 8: Foreign direct investment (FDI) jumped 124 per cent to $14.6 billion in the first five months of 2008-09, reflecting investor confidence in India at a time of a harrowing financial crisis, worldwide.        
	Officials said they expected the trend to remain unaffected by the global contagion.         
	Union commerce minister Kamal Nath today said while no country could remain decoupled from the global economic situation, there is a sentiment and frenzy effect of the world situation. With strong fundamentals, we have the confidence to tide over the global financial crisis.        
	Huge growth in FDI in India despite the global economic slowdown shows how sound and resilient our economy is, Nath said.        
	The country received FDI worth $14.6 billion in April-August 2008 against $6.5 billion a year ago. He said the target for the current fiscal would be met despite a difficult financial environment.         
	The FDI target for 2008-09 is $35 billion, while the actual inflow during the previous year was $24.57 billion.        
	The good part is that the recipient sectors are manufacturing and infrastructure, Nath said.        
	Major investments include UKs Royal Bank of Scotlands $382 million to acquire shares in Reliance Ports and Terminals Ltd and DE Shaw Composite Investment of Mauritius pouring $384 million into DLF Assets Ltd.         
	Mauritius remained the top source of FDI, accounting for 37 per cent of the total inflow, while Singapore, the US, the UK and Cyprus were the other major countries to invest in India.        
	Decks cleared        
	The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has approved 16 FDI proposals worth Rs 794.37 crore. Green signal was given to Mumbai-based Asia Motorworks plan to induct Rs 590 crore foreign equity.         
	Finance minister P Chidambaram, however, rejected Mahindra Defence Systems plan to produce defence equipment.         
	Adani Powers proposal to convert an operating company into an operating-cum-holding company to make downstream investment was deferred.

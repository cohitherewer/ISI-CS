	New Delhi, June 2 (PTI): The telecom disputes settlement and appellate tribunal (TDSAT) today directed Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) not to take coercive action against Tata Tata Teleservices (TTL) till further order.        
	TTL is facing disconnection from the network of BSNL over the non-payment of charges.        
	Admitting the petition of the Tata company, TDSAT chairman Justice Arun Kumar directed BSNL not to disconnect any points of interconnections (PoIs) of the company.        
	Till further orders, the respondent (BSNL) is restrained from disconnecting PoIs or taking any other coercive action against the petitioner (TTL) on account of the impugned demand, said Kumar. The tribunal also issued a notice to BSNL and directed it to file its reply in four weeks.        
	In its petition filed before the tribunal, TTL submitted that it had already paid 75 per cent of the disputed amount of Rs 350 crore (approximately) to BSNL in the wake of threats of disconnection from the PSU.        
	Bsnl may now go ahead and disconnect our PoIs for recovering the rest 25 per of the disputed amount, submitted the counsel appearing for ttl before the tribunal.         
	He added that some of the calls for which bsnl was claiming levy were not even routed through the PSUs network.

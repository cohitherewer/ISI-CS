The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IEA expects oil boil to continue
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IEA expects oil boil to continue
                            
	Madrid, July 1 (AP): Oil supplies will remain tight despite record prices and reduced demand from industrialised countries because emerging economies such as China and India will consume more crude to feed their booming economies, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.        
	The market will continue to be tight through the next five years, despite lower overall estimated demand, as the world adjusts to record prices and cuts in its crude consumption, the agency said in its annual medium term report.        
	It said the worlds estimated daily oil needs will rise from 86.87 million barrels this year to 94.14 million barrels in 2013, less than what it anticipated in its 2007 report. In percentage terms, there will be 1.4 per cent less demand this year and 3.43 per cent less in 2012, the last year for which the report gave percentage figures.        
	The IEA is the energy watchdog for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a grouping of the worlds most industrialised countries.        
	The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), however, maintains that the market is well supplied now. It blames crudes three-fold price rise on the weak us dollar and speculators seeking to protect themselves from the falling value of the dollar by investing in oil.

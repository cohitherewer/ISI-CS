          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sen: Big move                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 19: The Bengal government plans to unveil next month an incentive scheme for industry linked to employment generation, state industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.        
	It will replace the West Bengal Incentive Scheme (2004), which expires on March 31, 2009.        
	The ongoing scheme, like all the previous ones, is not linked to employment generation.        
	I dont know if such a scheme is there anywhere in India. But we are almost ready with it, Sen said after a CII event, Biz Bridge  Resurgent East.        
	 The new scheme will be sent to the finance department and, then, to the state cabinet for its approval, Sen said.        
	At present, micro, small, medium and large manufacturing industries get an incentive for buying plant and machinery. Service sector units also get the incentive to buy equipment.        
	Under the new scheme, employment generation will get more importance.        
	At least 50 per cent or more of the incentives would be linked to how much employment the unit would create, Sen said.        
	The state will take the help of the regional provident fund commissioner to find the number of employees registered with a particular unit. It would be difficult for us to keep track, he said.        
	Details of the incentive disbursement are being worked out.        
	The Bengal governments move is clearly in line with the its policy to create jobs through industrialisation, especially in the manufacturing industry.        
	State chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has always voiced concern over jobless growth across the country and harped on the need to correct the situation.        
	The states move to develop automobile, steel and foundry, petrochemicals, and engineering industries is in line with its goal of industrialisation with employment generation.

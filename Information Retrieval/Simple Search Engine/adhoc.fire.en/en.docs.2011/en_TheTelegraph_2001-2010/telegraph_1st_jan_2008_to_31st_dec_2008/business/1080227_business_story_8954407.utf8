     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Feb. 26: Reliance Energy Ltd (REL), the Anil Ambani group company, today announced that its board will meet on March 5 to consider a share buyback programme. The move is designed to perk up the wilting stock.
    
	On the BSE today, news of the buyback ignited the stock which closed at Rs 1,697.25, a gain of 4.59 per cent over its previous close. At the current levels, the share is, however, trading off its 52-week high of Rs 2,631.
    
	The buyback proposal at REL comes just two days after Reliance Power Ltd (RPower)  a company in which REL holds a 45 per cent stake  announced a bonus issue in the ratio of 3:5 to compensate investors for the losses they suffered when the initial public offering listed on February 11.
    
	The buyback will increase the promoters holding, which now stands at around 35 per cent. This is the second time that a share buyback plan has been devised for RPower. 
    
	In early 2004, before the demerger of the Reliance group, a proposal to buy back shares in REL had been passed by the board and its shareholders. The buyback plan was later abandoned as the battle between the Ambani brothers escalated.
    
	REL is involved in power generation through its shareholding in RPower. Its other businesses include transmission and distribution, engineering, procurement and construction. The company is also implementing several infrastructure projects in the country.
    
	Although details of the share buyback programme will be known only on March 5, sources close to the company said at current market prices, the stock was undervalued when compared with its actual fundamentals.
    
	REL also has net cash reserves of over Rs 10,000 crore and this presents a good opportunity to deploy the extra cash, they added.
    
	REL is the second major company after FMCG company Hindustan Unilever to announce a buyback. Recently, Unilever said the promoters share in the company had marginally risen to 52.12 per cent from 51.40 per cent after the buyback offer.
    
	Unilever invested around Rs 626.27 crore in buying back shares at an average price of Rs 207.13 per cent. The buyback offer was open from October 3, 2007 to January 31 and the total number of shares bought back was a little over 3.02 crore. Like REL, Unilever also wanted to utilise its surplus cash. Companies that buy back shares have to extinguish them. This leads to higher book value and earning per share.

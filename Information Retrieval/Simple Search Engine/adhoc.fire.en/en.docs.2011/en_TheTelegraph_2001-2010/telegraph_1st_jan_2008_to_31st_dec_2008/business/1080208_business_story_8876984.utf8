	New Delhi, Feb. 7: ArcelorMittal will start construction of its proposed steel plants in Orissa and Jharkhand by the end of 2008.        
	We will submit our detailed project reports soon and construction will start by the end of the year, said Sudhir Maheshwari, executive vice-president (finance and M amp;A).        
	The two projects will require investments of around Rs 80,000 crore. Each of the 12-million-tonne plants will need 600 million tonnes of iron ore. The company has applied for mines in Orissa, said Maheshwari.         
	It has also applied for four iron ore mines in Jharkhand, including the mines at Karampada and Ghatkuri.         
	The company has also expressed interest in Jharkhands Chiria mines, which have reserves of over 2 billion tonnes. Last year, the steel maker said it had been allocated two coal blocks for captive power projects linked to its steel plants in the two states. In Jharkhand, ArcelorMittal has shortlisted Torpa in Ranchi district and Kamdara in Gumla as sites for its plant.         
	In Orissa, the steel plant will be set up in the Keonjhar district. The Orissa project requires 8,000 acres  6,000 acres for the plant, 1,000 acres for a power plant and 1,000 acres for a township. The worlds biggest steel maker is forming a 15-member team to finalise the blueprints for the two plants.

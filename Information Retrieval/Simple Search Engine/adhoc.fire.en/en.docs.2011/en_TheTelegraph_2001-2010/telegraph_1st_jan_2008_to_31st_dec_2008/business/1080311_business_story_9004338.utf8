The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fast against SBI cell shift
                                                                                                               Fast against SBI cell shift
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 10: A section of State Bank of India employees in the city has gone on an indefinite hunger strike from today to protest against the managements move to withdraw forex operations from the city.         
	The employees of the forex department will take part in the strike without affecting their duties.         
	Ashok Datta, general secretary of the SBI Staff Association, warned of sterner actions if the management did not settle the issue. The strike will not end with merely calling us to the negotiation table and giving us an assurance. The management has to sign an agreement, he said.        
	According to a tripartite agreement between the management, staff and officers associations in 2000, forex operations were to be equally distributed between Mumbai and Calcutta.        
	Local employees claimed that the agreement was not fulfilled and forex operations in the city dwindled.        
	The management had promised that inward remittance operations would be done from here, but that promise was not kept either.        
	The corporate office has also decided to shift money market operations from today to Mumbai. It has not happened today because of our protests, Datta added.

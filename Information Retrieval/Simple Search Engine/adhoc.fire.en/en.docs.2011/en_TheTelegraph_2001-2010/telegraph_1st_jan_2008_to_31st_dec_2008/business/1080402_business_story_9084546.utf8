The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MTNL eyes wider reach
                                                                                                               MTNL eyes wider reach
          JAYATI GHOSE                          NEW NUMBERS                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: State-run Mahanagar Nigam Telephone Limited (MTNL) has sought a pan-India CDMA licence to compete with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and private telecom companies such as Reliance Communicatons and Tata Telecom.        
	The department of telecom, which has already given a go-ahead to state-run BSNL to launch CDMA services under a dual technology licence, is considering MTNLs proposal, officials said .        
	At present, MTNL operates in the Delhi and Mumbai circles. It provides GSM services under the Dolphin brand and limited mobility CDMA services under the Garuda brand.         
	Last month, the DoT allowed MTNL full mobility on the CDMA platform in Delhi and Mumbai. However, the company now has asked for a pan-India licence to tap the booming telecom market and also compete more effectively with private operators.        
	With the restriction of a limited mobility service removed, it would be beneficial as well as cost-effective for the company if a pan-India licence to expand CDMA services was available, said an MTNL official.        
	The company has more than 30,000 CDMA handsets, worth more than Rs 15 crore lying unused, which can be used for expansion in the rest of the country. It also plans to utilise the mobile virtual network operator model to capture the CDMA market.         
	DoT officials said telecom minister A. Raja was in favour of allowing MTNL to expand beyond these two circles to improve its falling momentum in the two metros.        
	The company not only has to deal with falling landline numbers, its efforts to scale up cellular operations have also been restricted by the fact that the two metros are nearing saturation. This is reflected in MTNLs poor performance in the last few quarters. Its profit declined to Rs 98 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, against Rs 209 crore in the same quarter last year. Its total income fell 7 per cent to Rs 1,327 crore from Rs 1,428 crore in the corresponding period last year.

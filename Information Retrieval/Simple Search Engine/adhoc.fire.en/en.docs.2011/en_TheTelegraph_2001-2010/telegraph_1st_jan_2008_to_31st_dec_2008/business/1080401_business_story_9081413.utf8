          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    Chidambaram: In control                          
	New Delhi, March 31: The Congress-led government today banned the export of rice, except basmati, and pulses besides slashing the import duty on edible oils in crude form and maize to zero per cent as well as the duty on butter and ghee to 30 per cent from 40 per cent.         
	Tonights move is being seen as an attempt to increase local supplies and check the rise in prices.        
	It comes after inflation touched a 14-month high of 6.68 per cent, which is of concern for the government as elections to many states are due this year, while the general election will be held next year.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the media that only basmati rice can be exported but for a price of $1200 a metric tonne.         
	The decisions were taken at a marathon meeting of the cabinet committee on prices.         
	At the meeting, the committee decided to issue notifications empowering the states to crack down on the hoarding of food items and impose stock limits for traders of food products.         
	A separate meeting of the empowered group on foodgrains will take place later this week to decide on raising the procurement prices for wheat and rice.         
	Chidambaram also said that the government was aware of reports that steel producers were planning to raise prices.         
	The finance minister said he would advise them to observe restraint.         
	Decisions on steel and iron ore exports will be taken after steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan returns to New Delhi.        
	The commerce ministry is likely to broker a meeting between steel makers and iron ore miners to sort out differences between the two sides over an export duty on ore and its supply to domestic steel makers at a lower rate.         
	Chidambaram said the duty on refined cooking oil was being reduced to 7.5 per cent from 17 per cent.         
	Officials said the finance ministry was in constant touch with the RBI to chalk out an effective monetary policy. The central bank has already raised key inter-bank lending rates several times this year to check the rise in money supply.         
	The edible oil industry has welcomed the governments move to reduce duties on imported edible oils.

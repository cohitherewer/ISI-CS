          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 4: Steel and cement producers have said they wont raise prices after todays fuel price hikes  standing steadfast to a three-month commitment to hold the price line.        
	Last month, the government had asked companies in these two key sectors to freeze prices as it struggled to wrestle with runaway inflation which now threatens to top 9 per cent.        
	We will not raise prices as the contribution of road transport to our overall costs is marginal. The industry largely uses other modes of transport such as railways, said an official with a leading steel company.        
	However, the official added that there could be instances of consumers paying more as fleet operators pass on the impact of higher petrol and diesel prices. A hike, if any, could happen at the truckers end, he said.        
	Sources in the cement industry said prices would remain soft as the construction sector is heading into a lean season with the monsoon round the corner.        
	Pawan Burde, cement analyst at Angel Broking, said though petrol and diesel price hikes would add to the cost of cement manufacturers, they would be hesitant to pass the burden on in view of the low demand.        
	They will also be wary of invoking the wrath of the government. Therefore, the industry is likely to hold on to the current prices, he said.         
	The Centre had earlier invoked an export ban to cool prices of the commodity. The move drove down prices in Gujarat and Mumbai as supply in the domestic markets improved. However, the ban was relaxed subsequently on the anticipation that the monsoon would depress demand.        
	Since the export ban, cement prices have declined by at least Rs 5 per bag in certain markets.        
	Sumit Banerjee, managing director of ACC, had recently said the company would not raise prices for the next three months. He had then pointed out that cement was under intense margin pressure.        
	Analysts expect cement prices to come under pressure in the next 12 months as more capacity is added. It is estimated that at least 70 million tonnes of additional capacity will be operational by 2010.

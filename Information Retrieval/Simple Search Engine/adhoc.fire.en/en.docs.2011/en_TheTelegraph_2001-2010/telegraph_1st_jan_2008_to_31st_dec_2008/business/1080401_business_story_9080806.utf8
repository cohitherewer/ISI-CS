	Paris/Stockholm, March 31 (Reuters): Frances Pernod Ricard won a hard-fought auction on Monday to buy the maker of Swedens Absolut vodka in a 5.63 billion euro ($8.87 billion) deal, but its shares fell on concerns over the price.        
	The worlds second-largest wine and spirits company beat the favourite, Jim Beam bourbon maker Fortune Brands, to win control of one of the biggest and fastest-growing spirits brands  half of which is sold in the United States.        
	Analysts at HSBC hailed it as a master stroke, but said the high cost of the deal proved there were no cheap opportunities left in the fast-consolidating drinks sector.        
	While Swedens centre-right coalition government called the deals price a victory for taxpayers, stock market traders said the company had overpaid and its stock fell a two-month low, wiping almost 700 million euros off the companys market value.        
	Pernod Ricard, US spirits maker Fortune Brands, Bermuda-based Bacardi, and Sweden-based private equity group EQT had all been in the running to buy the maker of Absolut, state-owned former monopoly Vin amp; Spirit AB. Its sale is the centrepiece of Swedens largest-ever push to privatise state assets.         
	The deal to buy V amp;S is Pernods biggest expansion move since the 2005 purchase of Britains Allied Domecq for $13 billion but relies heavily on new debt.        
	The company said a 12-billion-euro syndicated loan would pay for the Swedish company and refinance existing Pernod debt.         
	Pernod shares fell as much as 5 per cent and by late morning were down 4.6 per cent to 64.96 euros. The shares had fallen 18 per cent this year.

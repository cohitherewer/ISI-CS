	New Delhi/Mumbai, June 4: Stocks tumbled off a cliff today with the sensex plunging over 447 points to close at 15514.79 as jitters about oil-fuelled inflation spooked the market.         
	The sharp increase in diesel, petrol and LPG prices raised the spectre of inflation rocketing past 9 per cent  triggering worries about how that would hurt the bottomlines of a large swathe of companies ranging from car makers to retailers.         
	Auto and real estate companies will be badly hit and will find their profitability impacted, said S. Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities Ltd.         
	The 30-share sensex shed 447.77 points to touch a two-month low at 15514.79, with realty and metal sector stocks being mauled by about 5 per cent each on the BSE.         
	Market observers were alarmed over the prospect of an interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India in the near future to tame inflation. The 50-share Nifty also stumbled 130.30 points before settling at 4,585.60.         
	The hike in petrol and diesel prices will impact the demand for heavy vehicles more than light passenger vehicles. But if the RBI raises interest rates, the stock prices of companies in interest-rate sensitive sectors such as banking, auto and real estate may receive a bigger blow, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president, equity strategy, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Stocks of Maruti and Tata Motors plummeted about 5 per cent each, while realty giant DLF lost about 4.7 per cent.         
	Yield trend        
	Government bond yields today rose to their highest in more than a month as the decision to hike fuel prices gave way to the fear that inflation could inch up to 9 per cent. Yields on the 10-year security closed at 8.13 per cent after hitting an intra-day high of 8.16 per cent during the day. It ended at 8.12 per cent yesterday.        
	Bond yields have already edged up and will continue to remain under pressure, said A. Prasanna, an equity analyst at ICICI Securities, adding that a 10-1/2 year bond yield, which is currently at 8.13 per cent, is expected to increase to 8.25 per cent.        
	The government today announced that it would issue oil bonds worth about Rs 94,600 crore on a quarterly basis. However, without statutory liquidity ratio status (SLR), higher bond yields need to be offered to make oil bonds more attractive vis-a-vis other investment options for banks.         
	The RBI may also buy part of these oil bonds held by oil marketing firms and provide foreign exchange to these firms through banks. However, this may not have a huge impact on the bond market, said analysts.

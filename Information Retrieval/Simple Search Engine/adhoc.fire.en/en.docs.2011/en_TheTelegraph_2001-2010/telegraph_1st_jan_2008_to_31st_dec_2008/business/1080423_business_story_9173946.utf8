          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sriperumbudur, April 22: Telecom minister A. Raja today said sops under section 10(A) and 10(B) of the income tax act should continue beyond 2009 to ensure sustained growth for electronics hardware companies.        
	He was speaking at the inauguration of a Dell factory here today by Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi.         
	Raja wants any doubts about the continuance of this sunset clause to be dispelled quickly. If the sops are not extended, fresh investments in the hardware sector will be impaired.        
	The production of electronics hardware in India is inadequate by global standards, he added.         
	Electronics hardware production accounted for 12.7 per cent of Chinas total GDP and 15.5 per cent of Taiwans GDP, while in India it accounted for only 2 per cent of GDP.         
	Dell centre        
	Inaugurating Dells manufacturing facility, Karunannidhi said the factory had come up in a record 16 months.         
	The state would continue to take steps to make Sriperumbudur a major manufacturing hub of Asia, he added.         
	Dell will invest $30 million in this facility over a five-year period.        
	The company today unveiled the Dell-500, a laptop at a starting price of Rs 24,500, which has been specially designed for customers in emerging countries such as India and China.         
	Dells global revenues last year were $61 billion, said Paul-Henri Ferrand, president of Dell (Asia Pacific).

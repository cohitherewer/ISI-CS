          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          M.V. Nair (right) with Ficci chairman (eastern region) C.K. Dhanuka in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 15: Setting an example for its private sector peers, public sector Union Bank of India has made cash withdrawals by its deposit holders from ATMs of other banks free.         
	On March 10 this year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had notified that all scheduled commercial banks should not charge any service fee for withdrawals from other bank ATMs with effect from April 1, 2009.        
	Till March this year, banks were charging customers between Rs 10 and Rs 50 per transaction, including balance enquiry, if they used the ATMs of other banks.         
	From April 2008, the RBI made balance enquiry from other bank ATMs free and the charge for cash withdrawal was capped at Rs 20 per transaction. Banks charge a fee on cash withdrawal from other bank ATMs because the second bank bears the cost of replenishing the cash withdrawn by the first banks account holders. The second bank charges this cost to the first bank, which in turn, passes it on to its ATM cardholders as service charge, said M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of Union Bank of India.         
	But we have decided that the bank will shoulder this cost and our customers wont have to pay any fee for cash withdrawal from other bank ATMs, he added.         
	Nair was speaking at a banking seminar organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	The Union Bank of India, which has already brought all its 2,513 branches under the core banking solution platform, has also made fund transfers through electronic modes such as RTGS (real time gross settlement) and NEFT (national electronic fund transfer network) free of cost.         
	The public sector bank will soon launch a home search facility for its home loan borrowers. We have tied up with more than 100 reputed builders across the country and are preparing a database inventory for their properties in different cities, Nair said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: The government has altered the duty structure for exporting iron ore fines to ease the burden on miners.         
	It has proposed an export duty of 8 per cent on an ad valorem basis instead of a specific duty of Rs 200 per tonne, which was announced nearly two weeks ago. Under the new arrangement, taxes will depend on international prices instead of quantities sold.         
	On October 31, the government had announced the specific duty on the export of iron ore fines, while retaining the 15 per cent tax on lumps.        
	Producers had protested the shift to a specific duty from an ad valorem levy as it amounted to a 90-100 per cent increase in duty.        
	In the notification, 8 per cent ad valorem will substitute Rs 200 per tonne, the finance ministry said in a release. Miners had been expecting the government to reduce the export tax .         
	According to Glenn Kalvampara, secretary of the Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association, the new duty structure will hurt miners less.        
	However, low grade ore producers wanted the export tax to be scrapped, he added.        
	Domestic steel makers had demanded an increase in iron ore export duties to ensure adequate supply of the raw material for themselves.         
	India, which ships about 90-100 million tonnes of ore annually, is among the top three exporters.        
	The Federation of Indian Mineral Industries said it would not raise its forecast of ore exports because of the change in duty. It would continue to push for the abolition of the duty and cut in freight and port charges.         
	The federation expects overseas sales to drop 45 per cent in 2008-09 to below 60 million tonnes.        
	Iron ore prices have slipped to about $70 a tonne from $150-200 in March-April, amid the global economic slowdown. International benchmark prices are set to dip 10-25 per cent next year.        
	Contract prices reached record levels earlier this year, with big miners  Rio Tinto, Vale and BHP Billiton  extracting a 65-96 per cent increase in prices from steel makers in China, Japan and Korea. Contract prices are fixed prices valid for a year.

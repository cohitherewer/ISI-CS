	New Delhi, April 21: German truck maker Daimler AG and the Hero group will invest Rs 4,400 crore over the next five years to jointly develop and manufacture commercial vehicles in the country.        
	The companies today formalised a joint venture called Daimler Hero Motor Corporation in which Daimler will hold a 60 per cent stake and the Hero group will own 40 per cent. Daimler will invest Rs 1,368 crore, while the Hero group will put in Rs 900 crore.        
	The joint venture will first focus on light and medium commercial vehicles, which will be developed with the Indian conditions in mind and will be launched by 2010. By 2012, it will roll out heavy commercial vehicles, said Andreas Renschler, head-Daimler Trucks. The partners are now scouting for a location to set up a plant.        
	We have identified three locations  Haryana, Chennai and Pune. In another four to six weeks, we expect to finalise the location, said Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman of Hero Corporate Services.        
	The manufacturing facility will have an initial production capacity of 70,000 units, which will be increased in the future, he added. The joint venture aims to have a localisation level of 80 per cent.        
	Daimler is already present in the commercial vehicles segment through Mercedes Benz India, which imports the Actros range of trucks, Renschler said.        
	Any import order for existing products from Daimlers portfolio will go to Mercedes Benz India, while the new joint venture will develop products specially for the Indian market, he added.        
	Daimler has a research and development centre in Bangalore and the venture with Hero will benefit from it, he said.        
	Asked about the proposed spend on research and development, he said it would be significant. Renschler added that Daimler had no plans to sell its 6.6 per cent stake in Tata Motors. It will, however, see how to go about the 3.6 per cent stake in Eicher Motors, he said.         
	Price hike        
	Hero Honda has increased prices of its products by Rs 500-1,000 to factor in rising input costs. The company is also planning possible tie-ups with regional vehicle financing partners to boost sales.        
	We have increased the prices of many of our products by Rs 500-1,000. We have been trying to absorb rising commodity prices, but prices have reached a stage where we need to pass them on to customers, said Pawan Munjal, managing director of Hero Honda.

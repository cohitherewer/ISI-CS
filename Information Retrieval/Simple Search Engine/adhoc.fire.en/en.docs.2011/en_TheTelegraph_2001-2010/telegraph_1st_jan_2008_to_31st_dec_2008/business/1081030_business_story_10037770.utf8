The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Unitech takes Telenor stake call
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Unitech takes Telenor stake call
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Norways Telenor today picked up a 60 per cent stake in realty firm Unitechs telecom venture for Rs 6,120 crore.        
	Unitech Wireless will issue new shares, and the transaction values the firm at Rs 11,620 crore. It is subject to regulatory approval.         
	The Indian firm has a pan-India telecom licence covering 22 circles. Earlier, Swan Telecom with a licence for 13 circles, had sold a 45 per cent stake to UAE-based Etisalat for Rs 4,050 crore, valuing the company at Rs 9,000 crore.        
	According to analysts, the valuation of telecom licences has come down because of the global financial crisis. Sources said Unitech had initially sought a valuation of Rs 14,000 crore. The market meltdown has come as a blow to the new telecom players, many of whom are seeking foreign partners with ready cash and technology to jumpstart their businesses.         
	Datacom, Stel, Shyam Telelink and Loop are believed to have been bargaining for higher valuations than what is being offered now.         
	Unitech has been doubly hurt since the value of its real estate business has eroded considerably. Unitech Wireless plans to launch its telecom service in the first half of 2009. It not only has a pan-India telecom licence but also start-up spectrum for 13 circles. The company has already recruited more than 250 people and established offices in many cities.        
	This deal will bring in much needed foreign exchange into the country, said Sanjay Chandra, chairman of Unitech Wireless. He said regulatory approval for the sale of 49 per cent stake had already been received, and the company would soon approach the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for selling the additional 11 per cent.         
	The company planned to invest over Rs 15,000 crore over the next three years to become a long term and successful telecom operator.        
	Unitech is one of the six new companies that won GSM licences earlier this year. The others are Datacom, Loop Telecom, Shyam Telelink, Stel and Swan Telecom. These are scouting for funds and are at various stages of negotiations with prospective partners.         
	Telenor, the worlds seventh largest mobile firm, has operations in Europe and Asia, including a 100 per cent subsidiary in Pakistan.        
	According to Jon Fredrik Baksaas, president and CEO, Telenor Group, India enjoys a forward looking telecom regulation and an investment-friendly climate. By combining Unitechs strong presence in India with Telenors experience at building and managing the best in class mobile operations in Asia, we will together contribute to developing the mobile market in India.        
	 Telenor, which is 54 per cent owned by the Norway ministry of industry and trade, employs more than 35,800 domestically and abroad.

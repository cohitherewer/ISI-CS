The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Aerion jet for the super-rich
                                                                                                               Aerion jet for the super-rich
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           FASTER THAN SOUND                                  
	Mumbai, March 11: The rich and the famous can now put a new toy on their shopping lists: an Aerion supersonic jet.        
	The new jets will cost $80 million a pop and travel at a speed of 1.15 Mach  thats faster than the speed of sound  making the conventional jets look like lumbering crates in the sky. Aerion has come to India to offer the super-luxury business jets to the super-rich in the country.        
	ExecuJet Aviation Group, which is Aerions distributor of the jets, said five Indian companies had already placed the orders. ExecuJet has received orders for 25 jets worldwide  and India accounts for the largest share at present.        
	The Aerion supersonic business jet (SSBJ) is a serious business tool, Peter Smales, executive director (marketing) of ExecuJet Aviation Group, said here today.         
	Indias business community has grasped the idea very quickly. They have recognised the Aerion SSBJs ability to fly faster point-to-point than todays conventional business jets, which saves time and generates opportunity, Smales added.         
	ExecuJet said the company received three more orders from India in the past week. It expects its order book to swell in the next few months. A couple of orders from India were struck during the Dubai Air Show last November.        
	The supersonic business jet seats eight to 12 passengers. The company has made it easier for potential customers to place orders: they need to stump up an initial deposit of $250,000.         
	The company believes that the Indian demand for supersonic business jets will grow to 300 in five to 10 years.         
	Supersonic jets are known for their extraordinary speed which in turn saves 30 to 40 per cent time on long and ultra long range flights. The Aerion jet has been designed to cruise at speeds of up to 1.15 Mach overland without producing a sonic boom on the ground, and at speeds of up to 1.6 Mach over other areas. The Aerion SSBJ will complete a Mumbai-Singapore trip in 2 hours 55 minutes against 4 hours 50 minutes in a conventional business jet.        
	However, customers may have to wait for a few more years before these jets take wing. Aerion Corporation is scouting for a suitable original equipment manufacturer to be its partner. It hopes to finalise its partner by the end of 2008. If that deadline is met, the jets will be certified and ready to enter service by 2014.

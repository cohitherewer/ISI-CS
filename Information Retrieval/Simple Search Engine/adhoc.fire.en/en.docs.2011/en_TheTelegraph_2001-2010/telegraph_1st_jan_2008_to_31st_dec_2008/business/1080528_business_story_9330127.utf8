          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 27: Rating agency Crisil today said price controls on certain commodities would have a detrimental effect in the long term as they distorted resource allocation and created shortages.        
	Crisil was referring to the Centres move to control the prices of commodities such as steel and cement by persuading manufacturers to reduce rates. Moreover, the government did not increase the prices of petro products, hitting the financials of oil companies.         
	The imperative underlying these attempts is to bring immediate relief from rising prices, but the measures could have several detrimental consequences and prove counter-productive in the long run, Roopa Kudva, managing director and CEO of Crisil, said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 28: Goldman Sachs today reduced Indias GDP (gross domestic product) forecast for 2009-10 to 7.2 per cent from 8.2 per cent because of a weaker investment outlook on the back of rising interest rates. The growth forecast for this fiscal has been kept unchanged at 7.8 per cent.        
	The investment bank raised its inflation forecast for 2008-09 to 11.5 per cent from 10 per cent.         
	Tushar Poddar and Pranjul Bhandari, economists at Goldman, said the monetary policy would remain tight in 2008, though it could start easing from next year. It expects the Reserve Bank of India to increase both the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio by half a percentage point each by October-end and then pause for the rest of this fiscal.        
	Goldman said it was not revising the countrys growth forecast for this year as activity would moderate rather than slow down sharply, with a large fiscal stimulus holding up demand. The fiscal stimulus covers the debt waiver to farmers and wage hikes to civil servants.        
	The key risks are oil, monsoons and politics. On balance, the risks to growth are skewed to the downside in 2008-09 and roughly balanced in 2009-10, it said.        
	According to the economists, consumer demand is likely to remain at a moderate level.        
	The impact of higher interest rates on investment demand is the key factor behind the lowering of our growth forecasts, Goldman said.         
	In recent years, investment has been an important driver of growth, contributing to nearly half of total GDP growth in 2007-08.        
	With the current high rates, financing may become a major hurdle, particularly for new investment plans. Investment, in our view, will slow much more in 2009-10, Goldman said.        
	As demand begins to fall and inflation starts cooling off in early-2009, the central bank will start easing the rates gradually, the economists said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Export ban in store for steel makers 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Export ban in store for steel makers 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pandey: Firm stand                                  
	New Delhi, July 2: The government is weighing the possibility of banning steel exports as it is not satisfied with the industrys claim that the 20-25 per cent increase in prices is because of speculation by retailers.         
	Following a meeting among ministries, steel secretary R.S. Pandey will sit with producers tomorrow to ensure they rein in their distributors and roll back prices.        
	Officials said the government would use an export ban as a lever to force producers to fall in line. In case they do not, steps will be taken to ban exports.         
	The committee of secretaries will also ask the finance ministry to come out with a clarification on whether steel for special economic zones will be exempted from an export tax.        
	To check inflation, the government had imposed export taxes on iron ore and steel.        
	Steel makers had in May agreed to roll back prices by Rs 4,000 a tonne and hold prices for three months. However, at the retail level prices were allowed to rise as many steel makers cut back on retail margins allowed to dealers.         
	The average price of hot-rolled coil, an intermediate product, rose to Rs 47,331.25 a tonne in mid-June from Rs 43,458.33 a month ago, according to government data.        
	In April, the government had placed a hefty 15 per cent export duty on semi-finished steel product and a 5 per cent export duty on galvanised sheet.         
	Imports of pig iron and mild steel products, such as hot rolled and cold rolled coil, sponge iron and semi finished products were also made duty free.        
	This punitive package followed soaring inflation, with steel prices playing a role. Repeated pleas by steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the producers to hold prices were to no avail.        
	Only state-run Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Tata Steel agreed to check prices.         
	On April 3, top producers had agreed to take price cuts of Rs 1,500- 2,000 a tonne on long products, after a session with steel secretary Pandey.        
	Soon after, except SAIL and Tata Steel, most producers started threatening a price hike, citing higher input costs. This did not go down well with the government.

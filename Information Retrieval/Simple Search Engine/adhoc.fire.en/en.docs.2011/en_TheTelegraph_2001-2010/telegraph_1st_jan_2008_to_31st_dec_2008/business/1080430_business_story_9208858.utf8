          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 29: The markets cheered the Reserve Bank of Indias decision to keep the key lending rates unchanged, with the sensex jumping 362.50 points to 17378.46.        
	The National Stock Exchanges Nifty took heart from the RBIs announcements to move up 105.85 points to 5195.50.         
	Sentiments got a further boost from the central banks move to raise the limit of housing loan for individuals having lower risk weight.         
	This was a boon for realty stocks, which shot up by about 6 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange to become the biggest sectoral gainer. DLF soared 8.57 per cent and Unitech, 8.18 per cent.         
	Other leading realty companies Parsvanath, Omaxe, Indiabulls Real Estate, Ansal Infra and HDIL also posted handsome gains in the range of 4-7 per cent.        
	More good news came from Delhi as finance minister P. Chidambaram announced in the Lok Sabha an extension of the tax holiday scheme for software units.         
	It pumped up IT stocks whose index rose 5.24 per cent, led by Infosys which jumped 5.15 per cent.        
	According to Anand Tandon, research head at Brics Securities, The positive news on the home loan front and the extension of the tax holiday for software companies contributed to todays rally. The market has given a thumbs up to the RBI policy. Although the move (of raising the cash reserve ratio) may subdue credit growth, the impact will not be very large.        
	According to Hitesh Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking, Theoretically speaking, the CRR hike may not be very good for the market, but the move is necessary to control inflation. The market continued with its momentum because of the fact that the fourth quarter corporate earnings have been decent and above expectations mostly. We have to wait and watch how the bankers react to the RBIs policy tomorrow or the day after.         
	The inflows from foreign institutional investors have been steady and the inflows from domestic mutual funds have also been good. If things continue like this, without any negative, the market may reach 19000 levels without a hitch, he said.        
	Positive factors, however, failed to trigger any major activity in the small cap and the mid cap segments.        
	Among the losers, index shares such as Grasim tumbled 6.16 per cent, Bharti Airtel 2.79 per cent and Reliance Comm, 1.73 per cent.        
	The markets, however, discounted the global cues. Asian and european markets witnessed a narrowly mixed trend.

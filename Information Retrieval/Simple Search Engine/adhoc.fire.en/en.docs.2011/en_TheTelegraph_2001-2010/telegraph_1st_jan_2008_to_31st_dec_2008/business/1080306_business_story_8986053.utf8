	New Delhi, March 5: Steel companies today raised prices, ignoring minister Ram Vilas Paswans request to exercise restraint on pricing.         
	Tata Steel, Essar, Ispat and the Jindals told their dealers and customers that they were increasing prices.         
	Sources said steel companies hiked prices by Rs 1,550-2,000 a tonne for long products and Rs 2,000-3,000 a tonne for flat products in the afternoon.        
	Late in the night, state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd also told its stockists that it was raising prices by Rs 1,500-2,500 a tonne.         
	Earlier in the day, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan told a conference organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce that stable pricing should be adopted by steel producers. They should pay due importance to the views of the price monitoring committee while deciding on the prices of their produce.        
	Steel makers had on February 14 agreed to partly roll back the price hikes they made on February 1.        
	They had raised prices by an average of Rs 2,500 a tonne on February 1 but cut them back by Rs 500 for hot rolled coils and Rs 1,000 for TMT bars.        
	At the time of the rollback, they had asked the government to consider matching excise duty cuts to maintain margins as well as impose restrictions on the export of raw materials.

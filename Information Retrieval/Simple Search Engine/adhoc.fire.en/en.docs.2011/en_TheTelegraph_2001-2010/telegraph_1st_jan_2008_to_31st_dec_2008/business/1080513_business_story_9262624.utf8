	New Delhi, May 12: The government today said it had no plans to ban more goods from the futures market and hoped that the suspension of trading in soya oil, chana, potato and rubber would not be extended beyond four months.        
	I dont think any new commodity will be added, said Sharad Pawar, the Union minister of agriculture, who also heads the consumer affairs ministry that oversees the futures markets. Pawar was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	The government had suspended futures trading in soya oil, chana, potato and rubber for four months till September 6 to control inflation. This was in addition to last years ban on wheat, rice, tur and urad.        
	On the possibility of extending the ban on the four items beyond four months, Pawar said, Lets see what happens. I think the decision has been taken only for four months. I do hope time will not come to extend the four-month period.        
	The minister said the decision to suspend futures trading was taken by the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) after much deliberation. The decision was taken by the FMC about three days back. They have applied their mind and they ultimately came to this conclusion, he said.        
	Pawar said of the four commodities banned last year, the prices of two items had stabilised while the rates of two others increased.        
	To a query about the Abhijit Sen committee report, Pawar said, We have not taken a view on the report because there are some specific as well as separate recommendations, including that of the chairman (of the panel).        
	Apart from the main report, the committee has submitted supplementary reports by four members, including chairman Abhijit Sen, where they expressed their personal views.         
	The committee was set up last year to study the impact of futures trading on the prices of essential commodities. The panel found no conclusive evidence of whether futures trading had any impact on the prices of essential commodities.

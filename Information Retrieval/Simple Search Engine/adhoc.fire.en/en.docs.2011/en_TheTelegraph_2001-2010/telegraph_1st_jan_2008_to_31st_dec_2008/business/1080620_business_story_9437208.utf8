                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       R-Com set to pull trigger
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, June 19: The second Ambani slugfest in the courtrooms is likely to start tomorrow.        
	Reliance Communications (R-Com) is preparing to file a writ petition in Bombay High Court on Friday against some officials of Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) accusing them of criminal breach of trust and fraudulent misuse of powers in signing and executing a set of agreements on January 12, 2006.         
	These agreements laid down the terms under which the two brothers would stay out of each others turf for a period of 10 years.        
	These subsidiary agreements were linked to the process of demerger of the Reliance empire that occurred in January 2006.        
	R-Com officials said several RIL officials, including L.V. Merchant, Sandeep Tandon, and K. Sethuraman, would be charged with criminal conspiracy and abetment to cause wrongful harm to the two million shareholders of Reliance Communications and the ADA group.        
	These officials were the signatories to the non-competition agreement and the trademark management agreement between RIL and the four demerged entities that eventually went to Anil Ambani.        
	Sources in the ADAG said R-Com would primarily challenge the procedure followed by RIL in signing the non-compete agreement.         
	According to officials, the agreement was signed in a one-sided manner by Mukesh Ambanis men when R-Com was still under Mukeshs control. The company was transferred to the ADA group only on February 7, 2006.        
	RIL is also being accused of gross violation of the fiduciary obligations in signing the agreement.        
	Sources in RIL said they would wait for Anil Ambanis camp to file the petition and then decide on their response. This will be the second legal battle since the demerger.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          FUN TIME                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 12: Reliance Retail has entered into an exclusive pan-India franchise arrangement with UK-based Hamleys to bring their toys to India.        
	Reliance Retail will be the partner in one of the biggest international expansions by the old iconic toy retailer, approaching its 250th anniversary in 2010.         
	Reliance Retail will replicate the magical and experiential elements of Hamleys famous flagship store on Londons Regent Street.         
	Our partnership with Hamleys heralds the beginning of a new era in the evolution of the toy market in India. We hope to bring world-class toys, which will capture the imagination of children in India. We are excited about this venture, said Bijou Kurien, president and chief executive officer of Reliance Lifestyle Holdings Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Retail Limited.        
	Reliance Retail is set to open two flagship stores in Mumbai and New Delhi in 2009. This will be followed by a regional expansion across India over the next few years.         
	The stores will sell a wide range of toys, from the much-loved brands to the more traditional and nostalgic ones as well as quirky and unusual treasures.         
	Toy demonstrators and magicians will bring the store to life as will a host of events and activities.         
	Paul Currie, trading director of Hamleys, said, We are thrilled to bring the magic of Hamleys to India partnering Reliance Retail. Its going to be a fantastic and exciting stage in our international development and we are sure that our Indian customers will love the magical elements of Hamleys, which guarantees the best of past, present and future for all children.         
	The Indian toys and games market is roughly estimated at Rs 2,500 crore (organised and unorganised put together) and has been handicapped by the lack of significant national brands and the availability of quality retail stores.

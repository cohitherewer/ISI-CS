          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The State Bank of India today reduced its benchmark prime lending rate by 25 basis points to 12.50 per cent. The new lending rates will be effective from February 16.        
	Benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) is revised downward by 0.25 per cent from 12.75 per cent to 12.50 per cent with effect from February 16, the SBI informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The reduction in the PLR is likely to moderate lending rates for all categories of borrowers, including housing (floating rate), corporate and car loan, said analysts.        
	Following the SBIs example, the Bank of India reduced its interest rates on retail loans by 25 basis points to 250 basis points, effective February 1.        
	According to D. Krishnamurthy, general manager (credit) of the Bank of India, The rates on auto loans and personal loans have been reduced by 250 basis points, while those on home loans of up to Rs 20 lakh have been cut by 25 basis points.        
	The revised rate for home loans up to Rs 20 lakh is 9.75 per cent, he said. The interest rates on educational loans have also been reduced by 100 basis points, he added.        
	However, the Bank of India left its prime lending rate, or the rate at which it lends to its best borrowers, intact at 13.25 per cent.        
	Pune-based Bank of Maharashtra also cut its home loan rates by 0.25 per cent for all loans sanctioned on or after March 5, 2007.         
	For loans up to Rs 20 lakh and having a tenure of five years, 5-10 years and 10-20 years, the floating rates have been revised to 9.75 per cent, 10 per cent and 10.25 per cent, respectively. Fixed rates for the first two maturities have been revised to 10.50 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.        
	For educational loans up to Rs 4 lakh, the rate was cut by 0.50 per cent, from 12.50 per cent to 12 per cent, while for loans above Rs 4 lakh, the revised rate is 12.75 per cent compared with the earlier 13.25 per cent, the bank said.        
	Public sector Indian Overseas Bank is also mulling a 0.25 per cent cut in select lending rates such as loans for consumer goods but will wait till March to reduce deposit rates.              
	Last week, both Canara Bank and Allahabad Bank had announced an up to 1 per cent cut in housing and consumer loan rates. Housing finance company HDFC and PNB Housing Finance too have recently reduced interest rates on their loans. While HDFC reduced its RPLR by 0.25 per cent, effective February 1, PNB Housing Finance slashed the rates by 0.5 per cent.        
	RBI governor Y.V. Reddy, while announcing the quarterly monetary policy review on January 29, had asked bankers to explore the possibility of reducing interest rates in the light of high net interest margin.        
	Even finance minister P. Chidambaram, after meeting bankers on January 4, had underlined the need to cut deposit and lending rates by half a per cent to spur investment and consumption so that the economy can be sustained on a high growth path.        
	I would like, I cant wish this, that banks cut lending and deposit rates by 50 basis points so that it stimulates investment and consumption, he had said.        
	Chidambaram is again meeting heads of public sector banks tomorrow in the national capital for a review of the banking sector.

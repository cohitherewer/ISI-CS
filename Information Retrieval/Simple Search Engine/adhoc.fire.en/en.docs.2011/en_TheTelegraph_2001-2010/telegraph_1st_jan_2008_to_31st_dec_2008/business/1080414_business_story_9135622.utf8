                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Q amp;A      Claim clamour
                                I could not claim the refund of excess tax deducted at source from my income. I could not file my return, too, though I had no tax liability. Can I claim the refund now?          S. Raha, Asansol
                    It is possible to claim refund by filing condonation petition u/s 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act. You can file a petition to condone the delay in the filing of return and claim refund till March 31, 2010. Enclose evidence in support of your claim and state your income and tax collected in that assessment year. If the tax to be refunded is up to Rs 1 lakh, youll have to approach the commissioner of income tax. For refund of more than Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, you can apply to the chief commissioner of income tax. For refund of more than Rs 5 lakh, the Central Board of Direct Taxes is the authority. However, no interest will be paid on the unclaimed refund amount, and self-assessment cases are not covered by this scheme. This means that the refund will be made on TDS or advance tax paid.                                   Home for sale      Im an NRI. I inherited some property here. I want to sell it. Is the repatriation of the sale proceeds possible?        Chandan Banerjee, Hooghly
                  An NRI can repatriate the sale proceeds of immovable property in India. However, there are certain restrictions. Repatriation of sale proceeds of residential property purchased by an NRI out of foreign exchange is not allowed for more than two such properties. If there is any capital gain, it should be credited to the NRO account from where the NRI may repatriate an amount of up to $1 million per financial year for all bonafide purposes to the satisfaction of the authorised dealer bank and subject to tax compliance.                                      Father dear       I put some money in a bank FD in the name of my father who is 60-years-old. The bank deducted tax at source from the interest payment though may father had filed Form 15H.        Samir Chandra, Calcutta
                    Your father is 60-years-old and is not eligible for Form 15H. Only those who are 65 years or more can file Form 15H. Your father should submit Form 15G.

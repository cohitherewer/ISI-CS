The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cautious optimism in Mumbai
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cautious optimism in Mumbai
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 22: A guarantee is as central to investment, or for that matter employment, as risk.        
	Nobody knows this better than the employees at Lehman Brothers.        
	So, there was no visible sign of euphoria when reports surfaced this morning that Nomura Holdings  Japans biggest brokerage firm  had stepped forward to buy the Asian operations of Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US last week. There was just a feeling of cautious optimism among Lehmans staff in Mumbai on Monday.        
	Nomura Holdings Inc, which pipped rivals Barclays and Standard Chartered Bank to mop up Lehmans investment and brokerage units in Asia for $230 million, is expected to guarantee some job protection.        
	Nomuras acquisition of Lehmans investment banking division in Asia includes the fixed income, equities and investment banking units in China, Japan, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, reports say.        
	A source at Lehmans investment banking arm in Mumbai said Nomura wanted to bolster its investment banking services in India to tap the growing demand from large Indian firms for structured financial products and underwriting services.        
	In July, Nomura had advised Daiichi Sankyo of Japan in its $4.6-billion acquisition of a controlling interest in Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals.        
	Our employees are some of the best in the business. Rather than lose them to rivals that Nomura will have to face in India, they will prefer to absorb our staff. But there are no guarantees, he said.        
	There is no clear indication whether all jobs will be safe. It is unlikely they will be. But we are certain that the core teams will be protected, said an employee at Lehmans investment banking division in Mumbai.        
	Nomura had a presence in India in the 1990s but then wound it up. It returned in a small way in 2005.        
	A couple of months ago, it announced plans to offer a full range of stock trading, asset-management and investment banking services in India, becoming the first major Japanese broker to expand aggressively in the fast growing market.        
	Nomura is aggressively expanding in the Indian market. They had five employees in 2005; they have 17 at present. But it will be too simplistic to believe that there will be a 100 per cent absorption, said a Lehman source.        
	Nomura received licences to trade in stocks, stock futures and options in June. It has been in talks with the Life Insurance Corporation to forge an alliance in asset management services.         
	It counts Infosys Technologies among its investment banking clients in India, reports said.         
	Corporations cannot guarantee anyone a lifetime job any more than they have a guarantee of immortality, said a Lehman employee here.        
	Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), has confirmed that employees who continued to report to work as the investment bank went into administration will be paid by September 30.        
	Some Lehman staff in Europe are telling us that employees may have grounds to seek claims against unfair dismissal and protective awards if PwC is unable to go through the statutory 90-day consultation process with the employees before effecting the first dismissal, said a Lehman source at the bankrupt firms Mumbai back office which employs over 2,000 people.        
	Nomura is not expected to acquire the back office, Lehman Brothers largest operation in Asia.

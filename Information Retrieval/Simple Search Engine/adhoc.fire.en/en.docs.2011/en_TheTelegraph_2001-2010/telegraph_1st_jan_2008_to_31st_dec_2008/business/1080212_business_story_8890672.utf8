          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          GOOD TIMES AHEAD                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: IT services exports will increase 29 per cent in 2007-08, despite a 12 per cent rise in the rupee against the dollar, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said.        
	Software and services exports will rise 29 per cent to $40.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, from $31.4 billion in 2006-07, the software industry body said in its report titled Nasscom Strategic Review 2008.        
	The domestic market is likely to generate a revenue of $23.2 billion, increasing the growth rate by 33 per cent to $64 billion, the report said. Earlier, Nasscom had estimated software services revenues to rise 24 to 27 per cent to $49-50 billion for the year ended March 2008.         
	Positive market indicators and a strong track record support the optimism of the industry in achieving its target of $60 billion in software and services exports and $73-75 billion in revenues by 2009-10, said Som Mittal, president of Nasscom.        
	Some domestic firms have started renegotiating orders from the US and shifted their focus to Europe to hedge against the rupee appreciation. The appreciating rupee has adversely affected food processing, auto, leather and textile sectors.        
	GDP contribution        
	At present, the IT industry accounts for 5.5 per cent of Indias gross domestic product, up from 1.2 per cent in fiscal 1998, Nasscom said.         
	Mittal said, The trends are interesting and the findings indicate that the domestic market is poised for growth with IT spends moving upwards, particularly by the government. We also see an increasing level of specialisation within the industry, both in IT services and BPO, showing signs of a rapidly maturing industry.        
	According to a recent report by Forrester Research, US buyers may spend less on information technology this year than projected over concerns of the economy slumping. This in turn will reduce the worldwide demand for computers, software and related services.        
	Local biggies        
	Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Technologies, the countrys largest providers of software services, compete with IBM to create software and maintain networks for overseas clients.         
	On the key findings of the report, Nasscom chairman Lakshmi Narayanan said, The robust growth of the IT-BPO industry by over 33 per cent in the current fiscal reinforces the confidence of global players in India. As we move towards 2010, trends indicate that the industry is firmly poised for a broad based growth across industries and service lines.

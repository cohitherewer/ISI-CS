										      JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY       FM Speaks                                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: P. Chidambaram feels that he has added a chapter to the growth story but a happy ending depends on state governments.        
	The finance minister told Lok Sabha Television and The Telegraph in his first post-budget interview: Our goal is investment-driven growth... and to keep inflation under check.        
	Disagreeing with suggestions that it was an election budget and a please-all exercise, Chidambaram said: The intention was not to please everyone ... (our aim) is that the growth story should remain unhindered.        
	The story, of course, would remain incomplete if we did not pay attention to sections like farmers, SC, STs and, above all, women, he added.        
	The budget has come out with a series of sops that included a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver package for farmers and plans to spend nearly Rs 50,000 crore on weaker sections and women.        
	Chidambaram said one of the budgets aims was to create wealth for the people. It will ensure that jobs will increase, savings and investment will rise... the budget should stimulate investment and growth.        
	The minister admitted that conventional economics said spending could be inflationary but pointed out today there is slag capacity. Consumption is flagging. We need to stimulate demand. Industrial growth has come down to 9.2 per cent during April-November 2007, compared with 11.6 per cent in the same period last year.        
	However, the government will try to balance its twin goals of stimulating growth and controlling inflation. We will take monetary and fiscal steps, if inflationary pressures mount, the finance minister said.        
	Asked whether the steps proposed would ensure the pick-up of stressed sectors, Chidambaram said: We have given an across-the-board 2 per cent reduction on 16 per cent Cenvat, which works out to be a 12.5 per cent overall reduction. Besides, we have given deeper cuts in sectors like drugs, cars, two-wheelers, paper, besides customs cut to boost manufacturing.        
	He said the measures he had taken, such as spending on National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, would put money in the hands of very poor people. Increased spending on health and education would lead to enormous savings in work output.        
	But Chidambaram, who also announced a central scheme to monitor the implementation of flagship schemes, said success depended on the state governments. I can only appeal to the state governments to govern better and the people to elect governments that work better.        
	Answering questions on whether the country would be affected by the global recessionary trends emanating from the US sub-prime crisis, the finance minister said India was not dependent on global cues. However, he warned that the consequences for developing economies are not yet fully clear... (but) if all goes well, we will not be affected too much.

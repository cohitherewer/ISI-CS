The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti weighs options for MTN
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bharti weighs options for MTN
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, May 6:Bharti Airtel could be looking at a combination of debt and equity to fund what could be corporate Indias biggest ever deal that involves South Africas MTN Group.        
	While Bharti may have to shell out over $20 billion for a 51 per cent stake in the South African telecom major, sources say that a greater part of the acquisition cost could be financed through debt and the rest through equity to certain shareholders of MTN. Sunil Mittals flagship is already understood to have received feelers from several global banks.        
	However, the Delhi-based company, which confirmed on Monday that it had entered into an exploratory discussion with MTN Group, today said that it had not yet made an offer to acquire the whole or part of MTN.         
	The speculation around a bid by Bharti in a section of the media is incorrect and misleading. Details of any transaction will be released promptly, if and when, the parties reach agreement. As a responsible listed company, Bharti will continue to uphold the highest levels of transparency and corporate governance, quot; the company said.        
	This statement came in response to a report in Financial Times which said that Bharti had tabled an indicative bid for 51 per cent of MTN at about Rand 165 per share, that approximately valued the South African company at $37 billion.         
	The report added that Bharti Airtel secured $12 billion of financing from Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered Bank and, for the rest, it could issue equity to MTN shareholders.        
	Though officials at Bharti Airtel did not make any comments on how the deal would be funded, sources said that the company would settle for a debt-equity combination.         
	Given the huge size of the deal, it will be a mix of debt and equity. We will have to wait for further details on this front, said a telecom analyst with a foreign brokerage.        
	Interestingly, there are speculations that Sunil Mittal may look at the option of teaming up with Singapore Telecommunications to jointly bid for MTN. A report from Citigroup predicted today that if Bharti Airtel went ahead with the MTN deal, SingTel could get involved.        
	Telecom analysts feel that though the deal will be beneficial to Bharti Airtel in the long run, the significant issue relates to valuations and how the transaction be financed. Moreover, the acquisition could involve incurring a huge capital expenditure funded by debt, which would put pressure on Bhartis balance sheet.        
	Another worrying point is the possibility of telecom giants such as China Mobile, Vodafone and Reliance Communications joining the race which could lead to a bidding war, thereby increasing the cost of acquisition for Bharti Airtel.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Food woes signal end to Doha row

	New Delhi, May 4: The global food crisis could provide impetus to kick-start the stalled Doha round of trade negotiations. However, the crisis could weaken the bargaining position of developing nations, who have been united in opposing farm subsidies of developed countries.        
	Indications on the direction of the negotiations may be available at the forthcoming meeting between commerce minister Kamal Nath and US trade representative Susan Schwab in New York next week.        
	At the meeting, India and the US are expected to resolve differences over agricultural subsidies and market access for industrial products.        
	India wants to be a part of the solution, but the package has to be an equitable one. We do understand that with the election atmosphere in the US, the space available for negotiations may not be enough, Nath said.         
	We hope the US will comprehend Indias sensitivities in agriculture and the concerns of our infant industry and small-scale industries, he said.        
	Under the Doha round of negotiations, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) aim to lower trade barriers. However, talks got stalled because of differences between developed nations and major developing countries. The Doha round is so called because the talks had commenced in 2001 in Doha, the capital of Qatar.        
	The talks in Washington, on May 7 and May 8, will be crucial as revised draft proposals on agriculture and non agricultural market access are expected later this month.         
	This could be followed by a ministerial meeting  the highest decision-making body of the WTO  by the end of May.        
	An empowered group of ministers had recently ratified Indias position on agriculture, industrial goods and services.         
	The government has said that the interests of Indian farmers would not be compromised; there would be no trade-offs for gains in other areas of negotiations.        
	Bargaining power        
	However, to contain inflation the government has cut tariffs on many farm items, which can weaken Indias negotiating position, analysts said.        
	Devendra Sharma, a farm analyst, said India had cut duties on several items such as edible oil, maize, ghee, butter and rice to contain inflation, though there was no crisis in these commodities. Under the garb of inflation, the government is trying to send a clear signal to the US that New Delhi is ready to conclude the farm talks.        
	The recent rise in global prices for farm commodities has changed the earlier situation of developing countries accusing the rich nations of depressing global prices through subsidies.         
	The analysts said it needed to be seen whether developing nations would trade long-term interests for short-term gains to check rising prices.

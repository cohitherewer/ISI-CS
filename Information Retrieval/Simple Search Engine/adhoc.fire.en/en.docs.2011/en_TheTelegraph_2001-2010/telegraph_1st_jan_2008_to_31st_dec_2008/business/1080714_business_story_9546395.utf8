          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, July 13: PC and mobile handset prices are falling at a time when inflation is ruling at a 13-year high, because of technological changes and mass production processes.         
	Between 1995 and 2008, the price of a PC has dropped by an average 62.5 per cent and that of a mobile by 90 per cent. Both these years saw wholesale price-based inflation hovering around 12 per cent.        
	Changes in information technology policy, a duty rejig and the emergence of upgraded PC components at lower rates have allowed companies to provide affordable desktops and laptops, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director, Manufacturers Association of Information Technology.        
	In 1995, the price of a PC was around Rs 48,000. They had a simple configuration, capable of managing windows software and limited Internet access.        
	By 2008, the technology was advanced enough to accommodate high-end games, movies, live television along with richer Internet experience. On the other hand, prices have come down to below Rs 18,000.        
	The abolition of customs duty in 2005 and a low excise duty at 12 per cent have also contributed to a drop in PC prices, Mehta said.        
	Moreover, riding on the back of affordability, mobility along with enhanced technology, laptops have emerged as the preferred computing device among individuals, businessmen and company executives.        
	Currently, the cheapest laptop in India, produced by HCL Infosystems, is priced at around Rs 13,990. Calcutta-based Xenitis Infotech has also recently launched laptops priced around Rs 20,000.          
	Cell sea change  
	Mobile handsets are also treading the path of technological and policy evolution with prices expected to come down to Rs 500 for an entry-level handset in the near future, analysts said.         
	The price of an entry-level mobile handset price has dropped from around Rs 12,000 in 1997 to around Rs 1,200 now, says Sunil Dutt, country head, Samsung Telecommunications.         
	The continous lowering of customs duty from around 39 per cent in 2002 to around 4 per cent in 2005 coupled with handset makers opting for manufacturing in India have assisted in the price slide.        
	The mobile subscriber base, which was around 5 million in 2002, stands at around 270 million now, giving a fillip to manufacturing in India. Global players such as Nokia, Siemens, Philips and Motorola had entered the Indian market in 1995-96 and Samsung in 1999.        
	The average sales tax, too, has come down to 4 per cent from 12 per cent for mobiles, contributing to the affordability of the handsets, Dutt said.        
	The handset industry has seen a revolution in technology over the years, both in form and functionality, and a fall in prices.Multimedia and business applications, email and touch screen, all have contributed to the growing mobile base in the country, Dutt said.        
	The PC industry expects the sales of personal computers to grow by 16 per cent annually, while mobile handset sales are expected to grow around 30 per cent.

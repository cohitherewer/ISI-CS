          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sebi chairman M. Damodaran (right) with ONGC chief R.S. Sharma in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will allow all categories of investors  retail, financial institutions, foreign institutional investors and mutual funds  to sell short from February 1.        
	The market regulator had banned short selling by institutional investors in 2001 following a stock scam. Till now, only retail investors are allowed to sell short, which means selling securities that the seller does not hold at the time of trade.         
	Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given its clearance to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to sell short, and now Sebi will allow it for all institutional investors from February 1. He was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a conference on corporate governance.        
	Damodarans comments come a day after the RBI allowed short selling by FIIs.        
	However, Sebi said there would be no naked short selling, and it is mandatory for investors to fulfil their obligation of delivering securities at the time of settlement.         
	In a typical short sale, an entity sells share it doesnt hold but makes arrangements to borrow the securities from the market to square up positions at the end of the two-day settlement.         
	In a naked short sale, the entity has no intention of borrowing the shares and, therefore, fails to deliver the shares to the buyer.         
	Sebi will not allow institutional investors to do day trading, which is squaring off transactions within a day.        
	This is a positive move and will add to the liquidity and depth of the market. Investors can now safely play the stock market in the short term, Punjab National Bank executive director K. Raghuraman said.        
	Securities traded in the futures and options segment will be eligible for short selling. Sebi will review the stocks eligible for such transactions periodically.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Newbies to flock together
                                                                                                               Newbies to flock together
                            
	New Delhi, March 23 (PTI): New players in the telecom sector and those who already have GSM licences under the dual-technology policy will form an association parallel to the existing lobby COAI to fight for their rights and bring fair competition in the sector.        
	Seven firms, including Videocon-promoted Datacom, Shyam Telelink, Swan Telecom and S Tel, have been issued licences in January this year and have deposited the spectrum fee. They, however, are yet to be allocated radio frequency.        
	CDMA operators Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices were permitted to provide GSM services under the crossover technology policy of the government. One of the new operators has accused the existing GSM players of cartelisation and adopting tactics to delay the allocation of spectrum to new players so that they could not start mobile services sooner.

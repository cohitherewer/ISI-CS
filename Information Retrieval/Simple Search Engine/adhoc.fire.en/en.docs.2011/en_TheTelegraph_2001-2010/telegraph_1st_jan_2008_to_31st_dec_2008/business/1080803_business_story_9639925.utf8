	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd (SRSL), which is setting up a sugar refining plant at Haldia, has earmarked a capital expenditure of Rs 560 crore.         
	The company will set up another refinery at Mundra SEZ in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 350 crore. This refinery will have a production capacity of 700,000 tonnes per annum.         
	SRSL is also increasing the crushing capacity at its plants in Athani to 8,000 tonnes crushed per day (tcd) from 6,000 tcd and at Havalga from 4,000 tcd to 8,000 tcd. Both the plants are in Karnataka.         
	This will increase the total crushing capacity of Shree Renuka Sugars to 35,000 tcd, of which 24,750 tcd is the companys own capacity and the rest is leased. The capacity expansions will be completed by January 2009.         
	SRSL is also setting up a 15MW power plant at its Havalga plant that will increase the companys cogeneration capacity to 164MW. The new unit will commence generation in October next year. The setting up of the power plant and the capacity expansion at crushing mills will entail an investment of another Rs 210 crore.         
	The sugar refining plant at Mundra will commence operations by March 2010. It will raise the companys sugar refining capacity to 6000 tpd, which includes the 2,000 tpd refinery at Haldia and two of its integrated sugar mills in Karnataka.         
	SRSL has recently acquired Ratnaprabha Sugars Ltd for Rs 23.75 crore. Ratnaprabha Sugars has a crushing capacity of 1,250 tcd and a distillery with a capacity of 30 kilo-litres a day.         
	SRSL has also entered into an agreement with the promoters of Godavari Bio-fuel Private Ltd to buy out the company for Rs 1.8 crore. Godavari Biofuels has a land bank of 4.8 acres at Khopoli in Maharashtra. The land will be used to build ethanol storage tanks as it is strategically located near the Mumbai port to cater to SRSLs clients and for exports, said a company official.

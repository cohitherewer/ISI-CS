     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                    
	Mumbai, Jan. 29: The markets today closed in the red as RBI governor Y.V. Reddys decision to keep rates unchanged affected buying in rate-sensitive sectors. 
    
	Led by bank, realty and auto stocks, the sensex today lost 61 points from yesterdays close to settle at 18091.94. 
    
	Investors were hoping for a cut of at least 25 basis points. But since there was none, they are disappointed, which led to profit booking in bank and realty stocks, said Divyesh Shah, an investor. 
    
	A lot of investors have their money locked in the IPOs of Reliance Power and Future Capital. From next week, when these companies get listed, investors will redeem their money and invest in the secondary market. The market will move up then, he said.
    
	Bank and auto stocks had helped the market to recover yesterday. 
    
	But the countrys largest banks such as ICICI Bank, the State Bank of India and HDFC Bank were the biggest losers today with their share prices dropping by 4.19 per cent, 3.58 per cent and 3.36 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Auto and DLF also fell by 3 per cent and 1.04 per cent, respectively.

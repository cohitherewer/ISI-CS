          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 19: The State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur (SBBJ) today announced that its board would meet on May 22 to consider reducing the face value of shares to Rs 10 from Rs 100 per share.        
	The SBBJ, therefore, becomes the first listed associate bank within the SBI group to split stock this year.        
	The SBI has seven associate banks, with three listed on the stock exchanges.         
	The listed banks are the SBBJ, the State Bank of Mysore and the State Bank of Travancore. Their shares have a face value of Rs 100 per share.        
	Market circles said the SBBJs stock split proposal was an attempt to improve the scrips liquidity. Last Friday, the SBBJ scrip ended at Rs 5,000 on the BSE. The market circles feel that the SBBJs move will tempt other listed entities to go for a stock split.        
	The State Bank of Mysore had once considered reducing its face value, but the plan was subsequently put on the back burner. A banker said the State Bank of Mysore and the State Bank of Travancore might also consider a stock split now.        
	The Union Cabinet had last year approved changes to the State Bank of India Subsidiaries Bank Act. It enabled the subsidiaries to implement stock splits.         
	The bill also allowed the SBI to reduce its holdings in each unit to 51 per cent. The SBI owns stakes ranging from 74 to 100 per cent in these banks. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha.        
	The SBBJ recorded business growth (deposits plus advances) of Rs 10,181 crore to touch Rs 59,427 crore in 2007-08, against Rs 49,246 crore in the previous year.         
	The bank posted a 3 per cent rise in its net profit to Rs 315 crore during the fiscal from Rs 305.80 crore a year ago.

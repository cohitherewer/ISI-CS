The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bankers divided over outlook for rates
                                                                                                            Bankers divided over outlook for rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Guessing game                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 27: Bankers are unsure about Reserve Bank governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy cutting interest rates in the central banks third-quarter review of its 2007-08 monetary policy on Tuesday.        
	A section of the banking community believes that a low rate of inflation and a widening gap between the Indian and the US interest rate will encourage Reddy to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points.         
	Others, however, feel inflation may not remain sedate, which will prompt Reddy to maintain status quo.        
	Repo is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides liquidity to banks. It now stands at 7.75 per cent.         
	Those who felt interest rates would not be lowered warned of potential inflationary pressures in the short term.         
	Rupe Rege Nitsure, chief economist of Bank of Baroda, said firm prices of the Indian basket of crude would soon force the government to hike petrol and diesel prices.         
	The more the government postpones, the higher is the risk of a sharp increase in (fuel) price, which can fuel inflation further, she added.         
	Nitsure believes that prices of some primary food articles may rise. She said the rabi sowing of wheat and edible oils did not look encouraging.        
	Experts say that though inflows from non-resident Indians can rise following the widening interest rate differential between the US and India, after the 75-basis-point cut by the US Federal Reserve, the RBI has other tools to curb such flows. For instance, it can change the interest rate ceiling on foreign currency non-resident deposits that is linked to the Libor.         
	However, those in favour of a rate cut feel the RBI governor can take a proactive stand by bringing down repo rates by 25 basis points.        
	This is because inflation is under control and the economy is showing no signs of over-heating.

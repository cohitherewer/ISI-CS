	Hyderabad, Jan. 21: Satyam Computer Services Ltd has posted a net profit of Rs 433.63 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 against Rs 337.23 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, an increase of 28.58 per cent. Revenues stood at Rs 2,195.56 crore, a year-on-year rise of 32.2 per cent.
    
	Standalone profit increased 28.45 per cent to Rs 441 crore from Rs 343.30 crore a year ago. The company reported an overall growth of 8.1 per cent in the quarter. 
    
	It also increased offshore work to 52.1 per cent from 50.4 per cent to tackle currency appreciation and enhance operating margin.
    
	Satyam is expected to grow at 29 per cent this fiscal.
    
	We have outperformed our guidance, said chairman B. Ramalinga Raju.
    
	The company also announced an all-cash acquisition of Chicago-based Bridge Strategy Group. The $35-million buyout has generated annual revenues worth $17 million and has strengthened Satyams consultant and enterprising solutions portfolio. 
    
	The company launched a service to meet the requirements of professional sports associations and federations.
    
	The chairman said 3,424 associates were hired in the quarter and attrition rate had been contained at 13.1 for the last six quarters. 
    
	Raju said Satyam had become the first Indian company to list its share on the NYSE Euronext.
    
	On the economic slowdown in the US, he said the situation was being monitored to ensure it did not affect the company as 60 per cent of its business was from the US. 
    
	Commenting on the rupee appreciation, he said the rupee had risen by 12 per cent and affected by 164 basic points. We have managed to resolve the situation through pricing, offshore work and utilisation, Raju said.

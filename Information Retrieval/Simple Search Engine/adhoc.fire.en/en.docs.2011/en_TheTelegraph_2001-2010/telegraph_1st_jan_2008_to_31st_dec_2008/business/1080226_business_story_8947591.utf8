	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Fujitsu India Ltd, the 100 per cent subsidiary of Japanese IT services and electronics major Fujitsu, plans to focus on India in a big way.        
	We are in the process of drafting a plan for the Indian market. The plan will focus on different areas such as retail or enterprise, said Mikito Kiname, chief executive officer of Fujitsu India Ltd. The emphasis will be on the laptop segment, Kiname added.        
	At present, Fujitsus operations in India are carried out by Fujitsu Consulting India, which is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Fujitsu USA.        
	Fujitsu Consulting India is involved in offshoring activities for its US operations, employing over 1,500 people in Pune, Noida and Hyderabad.        
	In India, Fujitsu is one of the leading vendors of telecommunication network equipment for the past 15 years, especially CDMA technology.        
	The products of Fujitsu span over computing (server, notebooks, PCs), telecommunication, biometrics, micro-electronics and electronic devices.        
	The price of Fujitsu laptops ranges between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1,50,000 in the premium segment. We import our products because it is economically viable. At present, we do not have any plans to manufacture, said Kiname.        
	Earlier, the Japanese firm had said it was targeting a 1 per cent share of the premium laptop market in India in the first year, 3 per cent in the second and 5 per cent in the third year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lloyds takes over HBOS
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Lloyds takes over HBOS

	London, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Britains Lloyds TSB sealed a rescue takeover of HBOS Plc on Thursday to create a dominant mortgage and savings bank in a $22-billion deal helped through by a competition law change.        
	Lloyds will offer 0.83 of its shares for each HBOS share, valuing them at 232 pence based on Wednesdays closing price of 279.75p, a 58 per cent premium over HBOSs last price of 147.1p, but less than a third of what they fetched a year ago. The deal values HBOS at $21.7 billion.        
	Lloyds CEO Eric Daniels will remain CEO of the enlarged group and Victor Blank will stay as the chairman.        
	There shouldnt be any impression this is a shotgun marriage or a forced marriage, this is something thats been looked at for a good long while, Daniels said.        
	The focus on HBOS came as other banks around the world staggered under the weight of the crisis and raised memories of Northern Rock bank, which was rescued by a state-bailout in February.

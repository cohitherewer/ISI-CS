The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mixed bag for infotech
                                                                                                               Mixed bag for infotech
										      Guest Column - ASHANK DESAI                        
	It is believed that for every one person employed in the information technology (IT) industry, there are four new jobs created.         
	For example, one person working in an infotech company will employ a driver or an assistant and so on. There is always a positive ripple effect. This gives us an idea of how important the sector is for us and the country as a whole.        
	We must look at it this way: the IT industry revenue of $60 billion is almost 6 per cent of the GDP, the industry employs 2 million people, which is almost 10 per cent of the entire organised sector employment.        
	Therefore, when the finance minister says that the sector is important for a knowledge economy, we know what that means.        
	Having said that, there are three important parameters that help us understand how the IT industry has fared in the budget.        
	First, boost to the domestic market, second, how much is being invested in infrastructure  ports, airports, roads  and third, taxation and benefits.         
	To begin with, the government is investing substantially in rural broadband, smart card data centres and so on. This will boost domestic IT sector. However, an increase in excise duty on packaged software from 8 per cent to 12 per cent to bring it on a par with customised software will not go down well with consumers.        
	In case of infrastructure, new educational institutions, such as IITs are coming up; there is a 20 per cent increase in outlay too. What is missing here, is however, a liberalised educational policy, more FDI in education, emphasis on power, roads and ports.        
	There is also no clarity on transfer pricing policy, tax benefits to special economic zones and software technology parks. So, from the IT sectors perspective, this budget has been a mixed bag.         
	For infotech burdened with rupee appreciation pressure, we were expecting relief from service tax to firms operating in STPIs, in line with exemptions already available in SEZs and extension of tax holiday for STPI units.        
	If we look at the larger picture, I appreciate the focus on agriculture. The budget 2008 may not be a great help to the IT industry but it is not regressive as well. I personally believe that you cannot have a year-on-year budget policy, instead you should have a five-year budget policy.         
	Every year the focus shifts to a new sector: some year it is agriculture, the next it could be pharmaceuticals and so on. Instead, we should have a five-year sectoral allocation policy.

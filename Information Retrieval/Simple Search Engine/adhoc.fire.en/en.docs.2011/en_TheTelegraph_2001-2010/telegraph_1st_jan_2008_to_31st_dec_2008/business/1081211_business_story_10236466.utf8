The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry growth to be weak in October 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Industry growth to be weak in October 
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Indias industrial output probably grew a weak 2.2 per cent in October from a year ago, sharply down from September, and analysts said slowing demand and deepening recessions in major economies threatened further slumps.        
	The median forecast in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts was well below the 4.8 per cent annual growth in September but above the upwardly revised 1.4 per cent in August, a 10-year low.        
	Recent figures are just a shadow of last years double-digit rates. Industrial output rose 12 per cent in October 2007.         
	Industrial growth is expected to hold on to a positive number in October, albeit with a likely print of low single-digit growth, said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank.        
	The support is expected to come from mining and power generation. Manufacturing will be key in explaining the sharp downslide in the index of industrial production.        
	India is battling to fend off the impact of the global credit crisis on domestic growth and restore investor confidence rattled by last months attacks in Mumbai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fight against inflation in full swing
                                                                                                               Fight against inflation in full swing
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                        PRICEY ACT                             
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The government has now turned its attention to keeping inflation in check.         
	Till a few days ago, the government had been asking the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates to keep the growth momentum going.        
	However, it wants to play safe now and continue with the policy of sucking excess money out of the economy, which will help ease the price pressure.         
	Inflation, currently running at around 4 per cent, is expected to rise over 4.5 per cent in a couple of weeks as a result of the cascading effect of todays diesel price hike on essentials such as vegetables.        
	According to top finance ministry officials, The high overnight rates that banks have to pay will have to continue for some more time to discourage speculative lending as also the high cash reserve ratio since these help to suck money out of the economy and dampen prices.         
	Cash reserve ratio (CRR) is the proportion of deposits which banks have to compulsorily keep with the RBI.        
	The RBI had raised interest rates on overnight loans to banks nine times since October 2004. The rate is now 6 per cent.        
	It had also directed banks to set aside more money as reserves five times since December 2006. This is the CRR, which is now at 7.5 per cent.         
	But with economic growth slowing down over the past few months because of RBIs tight money policy, the finance ministry had been lobbying for a rate cut.         
	Compared with 9.4 per cent in the last fiscal, the economy is expected to grow just over 8.5 per cent this year.         
	Probably keeping this slowdown in mind, finance minister P. Chidambaram had last month asked banks to lower their rates to revive loan growth and increase investment.         
	Growth of bank loans has fallen to 22.5 per cent this fiscal from 30 per cent in the previous year.        
	But inflationary pressure has put brakes on moves to cut rates.        
	In a lecture at the Institute of Economic Growth here today, RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said inflation was still high by world standards and it needed to be brought down further.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 29: Borrowers, who have been paying higher equated monthly instalments on their loans over the last three years, will have to wait for some more time to see a reduction in interest rates. 
    
	Though two nationalised banks today indicated that they could lower their lending rates in the days ahead, the voice coming from their private sector counterparts was of a possible reduction but only towards the beginning of March.
    
	This response from banks came after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) urged them to bring down lending and deposit rates in its review of the monetary policy today.
    
	Senior bankers said there was scope for bringing down lending rates. 
    
	Already two banks  Uco Bank and Canara Bank  are mulling a lending rate cut in the range of 25-50 basis points. 
    
	It is felt that these two banks can first lower interest rates on housing loans.
    
	While officials from the State Bank of India were not available for comments, indications coming from ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private sector bank, is of waiting for a month before taking a call on interest rates. 
    
	Renu Sud Karnad, joint managing director of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), said the corporation had not taken a decision and it was watching developments in the money markets. 
    
	Industry not amused
    
	India Inc was by and large disappointed by the RBIs announcements today. 
    
	While the CII said the focus on inflation was understandable, the Assocham and the Federation of Indian Export Organisations expressed their disappointment over the status quo in the bank rate. They said easing the monetary policy would have infused growth momentum in the sectors showing signs of sluggishness. 
    
	The Ficci said the RBI could have tinkered with the rates in the wake of the slowdown in industrial growth.

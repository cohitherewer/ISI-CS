	Sivaganga (Tamil Nadu), Oct. 25 (PTI): The government today said bank deposits were safe and there would be no impact of the global economic tsunami on them.         
	We have been insulated from the impact of global crisis on the banking sector. There is no need for any apprehension on part of depositors about any impact of the global recession as their deposits are covered under an insurance scheme, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.        
	He said the country would be able to achieve a growth rate of 8 per cent during the current fiscal.         
	At a time when most of the banks in the US are facing closure because of the crisis, Chidambaram said Indian banks were well protected.

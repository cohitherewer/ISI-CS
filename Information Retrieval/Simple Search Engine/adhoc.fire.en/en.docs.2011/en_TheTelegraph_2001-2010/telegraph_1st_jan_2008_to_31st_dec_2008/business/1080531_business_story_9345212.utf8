          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Srinivasan: Points to ponder                                  
	Calcutta, May 30: The opening up of general insurance to private sector participation in 2000-01 has failed to achieve the desired results.        
	At a recent conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Calcutta, public sector insurance companies said the growth in general insurance business in the last three to four years was attributed to the countrys economic prosperity rather than the policy of liberalising the sector.        
	The gross premium income of general insurance companies nearly trebled to Rs 28,130.68 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 9,982.20 crore in 2000-01, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 13.83 per cent. This is more than double the annual growth rate witnessed between 1997-98 and 2001-02.         
	At the time of liberalisation, it was envisaged that the entry of private players will increase insurance penetration in the country. However, despite high growth in premium income, the level of non-life insurance penetration (expressed in terms of gross annual premium as a percentage of GDP) staggered at 0.61 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) at the end of 2006-07 against 0.54 per cent in 1999, said G. Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of United India Insurance Company Ltd.         
	The non-life insurance density (which is per capita premium) in India at $5.2 is the lowest among the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries, he added.

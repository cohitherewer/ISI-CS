The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | TVS rolls out new version of Flame
                                                                                                               TVS rolls out new version of Flame
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	Chennai, March 10: TVS Motor Company today launched its 125cc motorcycle, the Flame, which was at the centre of a bitter patent row with rival Bajaj Auto.        
	The bike has a modified engine, following accusations by Bajaj of TVS infringing upon its patented technology.         
	TVS rolled out the vehicle with a single-spark engine after Madras High Court had restrained it from manufacturing, marketing and selling the Flame or any other bike with the twin spark plug technology that Bajaj had claimed as its patent.        
	Bajaj had filed a case, alleging that TVS had infringed on its twin spark plug technology patent.        
	The vehicle, priced at Rs 46,000 (ex-showroom across the country), has been fitted with the traditional single spark plug ignition system and the engine has been developed and patented by AVL, Austria, and licensed to TVS in India.        
	TVS Motor chairman Venu Srinivasan said the company expected to capture 12 per cent of the executive segment market for two-wheelers with the launch of the vehicle.        
	He said the Flame would strengthen TVSs presence in the 125cc, or the executive segment, which constitutes 50 per cent of the two-wheeler market in India.        
	Autorickshaw         
	TVS rolled out its 200cc two-stroke autorickshaw, the TVS King, yesterday.        
	The autorickshaw, which marks the two-wheeler makers foray into the three-wheeler market, will come in both the LPG and petrol versions.         
	The price of TVS King will range between Rs 90,000 and Rs 1.3 lakh, depending on the model and the states in which they are sold.        
	Srinivasan said the company planned to sell 30,000 units of the King in 2008-09, which would include a four-stroke CNG version for states such as Delhi.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: Gold prices crossed the Rs 14,000-mark in major markets to reach all-time highs. The lure of gold as a safe haven option in the present financial crisis coupled with the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar have pushed up prices.        
	Gold had slumped to around $750 per troy ounce in the second week of September from a peak of $1,003 in March.         
	However, as the US financial crisis spread, gold prices began their upward journey.         
	Gold became the natural choice for investors to switch over from equities, said P. Singh, an analyst with Anand Rathi, a brokerage house. The depreciating rupee, too, pushed up prices because the domestic markets are influenced by international prices.        
	In Calcutta, the price of pure gold (24 carat) touched Rs 14,565 today, up Rs 1,565 from Saturdays close of Rs 13,000. Gold was the highest in Calcutta.        
	In Mumbai, standard gold (99.5 purity) rose Rs 255 per 10 gm to open at Rs 14,075 from Rs 13,820, while pure gold (99.9 purity) spurted to Rs 14,145 from Wednesdays close of Rs 13,885.        
	Crude prices, on the other hand, dropped sharply today.        
	US light crude for November delivery was down $4.68 at $81.91 a barrel by 1427 GMT. It touched a session low of $78.61, its lowest since October 2007.

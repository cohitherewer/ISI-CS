	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Two-wheeler makers in the country are keen on electric bikes.
    
	These bikes run on electricity that is derived from batteries recharged from electrical outlets.
    
	With soaring fuel prices, firms expect a good demand for such bikes.
    
	To win converts, manufacturers are also spicing up their offerings.
    
	Take TVS Motors concept vehicle X-Fossil  which can move at speeds of 140 kilometres per hour and go from zero to 100 in just 3.2 seconds.
    
	X-Fossil is loaded with high-tech components and coloured white.
    
	According to Venu Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of Chennai-based TVS, X-Fossil is a concept bike which we have showcased. We want to show that even electric bikes have the power and style. 
    
	It has already evoked quite a response. We will study the interest shown by customers and consider its commercial production viability, Srinivasan said.
    
	Another player in this segment is Electrotherm. Mukesh Bhandari, chairman and managing director of the company, said the company expected to increase sales by 10,000 in 2008.
    
	Last year, Electrotherm sold 40,000 units.
    
	Electric bike as an idea is yet to catch up in the country. But, it is a concept for the future, Bhandari said.
    
	Electrotherm has two variants: Yosmart with a price tag of Rs 27,500 and Yospeed that costs Rs 8,000 more. 
    
	Indian laws rule out registrations for vehicles such as Yosmart that has a maximum speed of 25 kilometres per hour.
    
	According to a recent AC Nielsen market survey, the electric bike market in the country stands at around 5 lakh units. There are at least 10 small players. 
    
	 The market is at a very nascent stage and it will take at least 4-5 years to mature, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.

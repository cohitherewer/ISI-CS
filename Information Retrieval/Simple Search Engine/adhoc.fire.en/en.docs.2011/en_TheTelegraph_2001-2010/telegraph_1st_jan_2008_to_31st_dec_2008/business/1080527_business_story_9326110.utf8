          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                          New venture                                  
	Calcutta, May 26: Telecom service providers GTL Ltd and GTL Infrastructure are planning to set up a hub in Calcutta. The two companies have leased 20,000 square feet at Infinity Benchmark in Sector V.        
	We work closely with most operators in mobile network services and infrastructure. As operators in the eastern region are planning network expansion and upgradation, we expect sizeable business from this region, said a GTL spokesperson.        
	GTL Ltd and GTL Infrastructure are part of the Global group, which has six companies in its fold.         
	The group operates in 35 countries, with revenues of more than $600 million.         
	The Global group works in partnership with telecom service providers and original equipment manufacturers to offer life-cycle solutions and network, WiMAX and Internet protocol television services.        
	Its services include design, deployment, operation and maintenance of networks. It is also involved in infrastructure and energy management of networks.         
	The company plans network expansion in the eastern region by setting up towers and cell sites.        
	The eastern region presents tremendous opportunity for business growth. We already have 6,000 towers and plan to reach 25,000 in two to three years, the spokesperson said.

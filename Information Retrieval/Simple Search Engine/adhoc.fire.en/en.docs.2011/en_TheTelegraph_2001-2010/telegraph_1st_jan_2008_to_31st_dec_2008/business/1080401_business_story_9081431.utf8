The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank, tech stocks sink
                                                                                                               Bank, tech stocks sink
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 31: Banking and infotech stocks were mauled on Monday  many of them losing as much as 6 per cent of their value after corporate accountants were ordered over the weekend to reflect the true market value of forex derivative transactions that have gone sour in recent months.        
	The market was spooked by the directive issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)  the regulatory body for accountants  which raised the scary prospect of a stream of poor fourth-quarter results.        
	Investors dumped banking stocks with ICICI Bank  which recently admitted notional losses of Rs 200 crore on its derivatives portfolio  shedding about 8 per cent.         
	The bellwether sensex plummeted 727 points before settling at 15644.44. Sentiment had already sagged on Dalal Street after inflation surged to a 13-month high and the ICAI directive has pole axed several frontline stocks. The Nifty too stumbled by about 208 points and ended at 4734.50.         
	The ICAI had said forex derivatives would have to be marked to market in company balancesheets for the year ending March 31. The earlier deadline was in 2011.        
	Infotech companies, which earn most of their revenues in dollars and have used forex derivatives to hedge against a buoyant rupee, were pounded by the punters today.        
	Bluechips like TCS, Wipro, and Infosys all lost over 6 per cent on their BSE listed shares. Shares of HDFC Bank dropped by about 6 per cent while the SBI lost 5 per cent.         
	Rising inflation will continue to impact prices for some more time. Another major negative was the ICAIs directive for the forex derivatives to reveal their mark-to-market losses, said an analyst at Networth Stock Broking.         
	The FIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 865.79 crore in India according to the provisional figures today.         
	The markets took a downturn because the government will now act tough to curb the inflationary pressure. The ICAI directive was the second shock. The sensex will have a downside support at 14700 in the near term, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking.         
	Bar on stock tips        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today unveiled plans to stop brokers and traders from giving out stock tips to investors based on subjective and arbitrary information. The Sebi initiative is seen as a move to guard against insider trading.        
	Sebi said the exposure/ turnover limit given by the trading members should be commensurate with the known financial details of the clients. Trading members may be required to inform the clients upfront at the time of entering into member-client agreement about work history and background of their firm.         
	Derivatives dispute        
	The RBI may have to arbitrate in a row between a few leading corporates and banks over the valuations of forex derivatives.         
	The issue threatens to hurt fourth quarter results after the ICAI said over the weekend that all hedges would have to be marked to market.        
	Reddy admitted that he had received several representations from companies complaining against banks which had handled the forex derivatives for them.        
	Reddy said he did not anticipate any systemic problems from exposure to forex derivatives by banks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reserve Bank on full alert
                                                                                                               Reserve Bank on full alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, March 31: Reserve Bank of India governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy today said inflation  riding at 6.68 per cent  is unacceptably high and that the central bank is ready to take appropriate action after a proper assessment of the situation.        
	Reddys statement comes after finance minister P. Chidambarams comment last Friday that the government was ready to sacrifice a little bit of growth to collar runaway inflation. We are in full readiness to take appropriate action if and when we make a judgement that action is needed, Reddy said.        
	Reddys hawkish statement here today indicated that the central bank would take monetary measures in tandem with the supply side initiatives taken by the government to quell inflation.         
	At 6.68 per cent, inflation is riding at a 13-month high and way above the RBI target of 5 per cent for 2007-08.        
	Bond markets and bankers expect the RBI to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the repo rate. CRR is that portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the central bank. It now stands at 7.5 per cent.        
	The timing of the RBI action is important. Although the central bank is scheduled to review its monetary policy on April 29, many banks expect it to act sooner. For instance, IDBI decided to defer its plan to cut its prime lending rate (PLR) by 50 basis points to 12.75 per cent.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides liquidity to banks. It now rules at 7.75 per cent.         
	Some argue that if the central bank were to hike this rate, some of the interest rate reductions announced by banks over the past couple of months may be partially withdrawn.         
	Banks like the State Bank of India (SBI) had brought down lending rates on some loans by 50 basis points last month.        
	Reddy has virtually confirmed that some action is imminent. The only question is when and whether it will be only a CRR or a repo rate hike, said an analyst with a private sector bank.        
	Many feel that the CRR could be hiked in the monetary policy due on April 29. However, the general expectation is that interest rates are unlikely to rise after such a hike.        
	Reddy told reporters that the central bank had anticipated some pressure on inflation when it announced the monetary policy on January 29.        
	Our policy stance has taken these inflationary pressures into account when articulating the policy. However, inflation has turned out to be more than anticipated, he added.        
	Reddy said the high numbers were the result of the increase in prices for food articles, fuel and metals.

	New Delhi, Jan. 9: The government has decided to issue letters of intent (LoIs) first to existing telecom players such as Idea, the Tatas and Reliance Communications to complete their pan-India footprint and then to new entrants such as Unitech and S Tel. 
    
	This will give the department of telecom (DoT) time to reconsider the applications of ByCell and Indiabullss promoted Selena Infrastructure. The duo will have to first get clearances from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the ministry of home affairs for raising their foreign investment levels in India.
    
	According to senior DoT officials, The application made by Spice Telecom for 20 telecom circles, which has apparently been rejected in view of their inability to meet net worth requirements, will also be reconsidered. 
    
	The first batch of LoIs may be issued this week. The second phase is expected to begin later this month. 
    
	In the first round, six existing players who want to expand across the country will get the letters. These are Idea Cellular for nine circles, Tata Teleservices (three), Reliance Communications (two), HFCL Infotel (21), Shipping Stop Dot Com of the Ruias (21) and Shyam Telelink (21).
    
	In the second phase, eight LoIs will be issued to real estate player Unitech for 22 circles. The Unitech firms are Unitech Builders and Estates, Unitech Infrastructure, Adonis Projects, Aska Project, Azare Properties, Hudson Properties, Nahan Properties and Volga Properties.
    
	Swan Communications, in which Reliance Communications has a minority stake, will get LoIs for 14 circles, and Sterlite, Datacom Solutions and S Tel Ltd for 22.
    
	After getting an LoI, each company will get 15 days to pay Rs 1,651 crore as a fee for a pan-India licence. (A company will pay less if it has applied only for some circles). 
    
	The government will give spectrum first to the entity who is the earliest to pay the fee.
    
	However, a licence does not guarantee spectrum to an operator, the officials said.

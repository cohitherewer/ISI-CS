     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: Rating agency Crisil has assigned an above average rating to the proposed initial public offering of Reliance Power (RPL), which is estimated to raise Rs 10,500-11,500 crore. 
    
	The IPO has been assigned a 4/5 (four-on-five) grade. This will be the countrys largest IPO until now.
    
	The agency said the grade indicated that the fundamentals of the issue were above average compared with other listed equity securities in the country.
    
	Strong demand for power will catalyse regulatory facilitation for private participation in the power sector over the medium to long term. In this scenario, early movers such as Reliance Power will benefit from attractive business opportunities that are likely to come about as a result, especially if they achieve high levels of financial capability, as is likely for Reliance Power after its proposed IPO, Crisil said in a statement.
    
	According to Crisil, the grading also reflects Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Groups commitment that Reliance Power will be the sole repository of the groups economic interest in the power generation segment.
    
	Reliance Power filed the draft prospectus for its IPO in the first week of October. The IPO is understood to have been approved by Sebi. 
    
	The company proposes to issue 130 crore equity shares.
    
	Crisil grades IPOs on a scale of one to five. Grade one indicates poor fundamentals, while five-on-five is given to an issue with strong fundamentals.
    
	However, the agency observed that the grading was tempered by the fact that Reliance Power is planning to install capacity on a scale and within a time frame unprecedented in the country. Therefore, it is likely to face significant implementation challenges.

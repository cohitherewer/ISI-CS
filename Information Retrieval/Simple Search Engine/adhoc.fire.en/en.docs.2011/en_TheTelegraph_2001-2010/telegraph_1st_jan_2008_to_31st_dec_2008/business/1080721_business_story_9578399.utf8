                            Pillai: Keeping  options  open              
	Geneva, July 20 (PTI): India today said the level of cuts in agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs might be negotiated beyond the range proposed in the WTO draft if there was consensus among the rich and developing nations.        
	There are numbers in the text and whether we can go beyond is something that will be negotiated. It is possible on a few isolated cases that we may even go beyond the numbers if there is a consensus among ministers, commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said after a meeting of the G-33, the agriculture alliance of developing countries.        
	He said if developed countries such as the us went outside the range for cutting farm and industrial tariffs, then anybody else can also go outside the numbers.         
	The World Trade Organisation has convened a five-day mini ministerial meeting beginning July 21 to infuse urgency into the long running Doha trade talks.        
	We should know the vision tour of the 30-odd trade ministers for the entire agriculture and non-agriculture market access by tomorrow evening, Pillai said.        
	 India will also present its list of offers and demands for market access in services at the wto signalling conference scheduled on July 24.         
	Services chair ambassador Fernando de Mateo of Mexico is also expected to put out a text on services after the ministers conference. He has circulated a services report on July 17. At the moment there is nothing (in services). They are just good intentions, Pillai said.        
	India, which has a stronghold in services, is seeking greater market for its engineering, research and development, healthcare, construction and computer-related services.         
	Unless there are binding commitments in services, there would be no Doha deal, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath has said.

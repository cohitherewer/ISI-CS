	New York/London, Oct. 2 (Reuters): New signs of stress in the US economy drove down stocks on both sides of the Atlantic and sent oil lower on Thursday even as the US Congress worked toward passing a revised bill to rescue the ailing financial sector.        
	The reports on unemployment claims and factory orders painted a worrying picture, which could spell tough times for corporate profits. The number of people filing for new jobless benefit claims rose to a seven-year high in the latest week and factory orders showed a steeper-than-expected drop in August.        
	Wall Street fretted over the spectre of deterioration in the underlying economy and the prospects of the financial-sector bailout legislation, which the Senate passed on Wednesday night.        
	Investors pummelled shares of economic bellwethers, including Caterpillar and General Electric. Technology shares werent spared either.        
	The weak data is all an indication of how much damage this lack of activity in credit markets over the last year has done to the US and global economy, said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz amp; Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio.        
	The Dow Jones industrial average slid 305.69 points, or 2.82 percent, to 10525.38. The Standard amp; Poors 500 Index dropped 37.59 points, or 3.24per cent, to 1123.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 74.88 points, or 3.62 per cent, to 1994.52.        
	European stocks also trimmed gains, with investors cautious about Washingtons rescue plan.         
	The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1057.51 points, after rising as high as 1090.25 during the day.        
	Mining and industrial stocks took a beating, with ArcelorMittal sinking 9.3 per cent, Rio Tinto dropping 7.9 per cent and Siemens losing 4.6 per cent.        
	Earlier, deepening worries about the global economy kept Asia stocks in the red.         
	The benchmark Nikkei average fell 1.9 per cent to a three-year closing low. The broader Topix index fell 2.2 per cent to book its lowest close since October 2004. The Korean index Kospi fell 1.39 per cent.

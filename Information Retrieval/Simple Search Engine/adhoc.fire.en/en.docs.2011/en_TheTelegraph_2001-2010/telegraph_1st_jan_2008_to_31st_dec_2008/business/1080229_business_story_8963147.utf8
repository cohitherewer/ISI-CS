                                                                                                               FDI recipe for rural banking 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The economic survey today proposed privately owned rural agriculture banks with up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment and freedom to take over other private banks.         
	It also suggested a new bankruptcy law for quick exit of promoters from failed companies.        
	The rural banks should be allowed to expand freely in small towns when foreign direct investment rules for banks are liberalised in the country. They could be allowed to lend to agriculture and allied sectors anywhere in the country and to any industry located in a non-urban area.         
	State-owned Vijaya Bank chairman Prakash P. Mallya said, The move, if implemented, will definitely boost lending in the agricultural sector. While PSU banks are already present in a big way in the rural segment, foreign banks will now find it profitable to enter the farm sector.        
	The Left has, however, always opposed foreign control of Indian banks as they are apprehensive of the domination of the financial markets by multinationals. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said, It is unlikely anyone would come to set up an agricultural bank here.        
	The survey said the government needed to either introduce a separate section on bankruptcy in the company law or introduce a new bankruptcy law that facilitates exit of old or failed management as quickly as possible.         
	Current rules allow banks and financial institutes to take over assets of firms that have turned defaulters. However, the larger problem of bankruptcy of companies is not addressed by the law.        
	In India, one of the challenges is timely identification and reporting of adverse developments on loan accounts. Borrowers typically tend to delay reporting adverse events hindering timely corrective actions, said Sanjay Aggarwal, national industry director, financial services, KPMG-India.        
	The survey said in the current fiscal there had been a fall in credit growth till the first week of January. Any further decline will hit the countrys economic growth.        
	Tight monetary policy squeezed annual credit expansion down to 21.5 per cent by January 4 from 30.8 per cent a year earlier, it said.        
	With the Indian economy entering a higher growth trajectory, investment demand is expected to remain strong in the short to medium term.        
	It is however necessary that credit expansion is non-inflationary and productive sectors receive adequate credit at a reasonable rate, the survey said.

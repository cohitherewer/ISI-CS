     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: British business tycoon Richard Branson today offered to partner Indian companies to produce bio-fuels here.
    
	Branson also said he would announce a telecom venture in the next month and added that he would continue lobbying for a change in aviation rules to allow him to run a domestic airline in the country. 
    
	Citing the example of Brazil, where sugar-based ethanol is used as an additive fuel, Branson said the same practice could be introduced in India. In this Latin American country, 70 per cent of the cars run on bio-diesel (which is mixed with petroleum). Sugarcane is the source of this fuel and the ethanol that is used in these vehicles is processed from sugarcane. With India being a major producer of sugarcane, I think it should also follow Brazil, Branson said. 
    
	Branson, who runs clean energy company Virgin Fuels, said, I am willing to team up with Indian players to help make the transition. The world is awash with sugar, he said. So there is no fear of its shortage if it is used for the production of bio-fuel, he added.
    
	The flamboyant industrialist said he would be coming back in the next three weeks to make big announcements on his different ventures in India, including telecom. On his telecom plans in India, he said, Negotiations are at a very advanced stage.
    
	The Virgin Atlantic boss is also seeking permission from the government to start a domestic airline.
    
	Branson hopes the Indian government will allow foreign companies to run local airlines. Virgin Atlantic started services to India eight years back, and now wants to operate on domestic routes  where traffic growth is over 30 per cent.

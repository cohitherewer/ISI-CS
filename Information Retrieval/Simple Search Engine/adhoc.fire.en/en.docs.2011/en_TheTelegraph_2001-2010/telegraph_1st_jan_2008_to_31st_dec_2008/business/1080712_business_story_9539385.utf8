          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 11: A coalition of Is  Infosys, industrial growth and inflation  joined forces with surging global crude oil prices to spark mayhem in the market today.        
	The bellwether sensex plunged 456 points, or 3.28 per cent, to 13469.85 points with investors spooked by fears that the Reserve Bank of India might raise interest rates to combat inflation.        
	Although the market barometer finished with marginal gains for the week, observers fear that there can be more pain in store with crude oil prices again inching up.        
	It was a challenge for stocks right from the word go as IT bellwether Infosys announced a nearly 21 per cent rise in net profits for the first quarter ended June 30.         
	Though this figure was in line with street expectations, market observers were disappointed by the fact that Infosys had only raised the rupee guidance for the fiscal but left it unchanged in dollar terms.        
	Analysts attributed the revision in revenue guidance in rupee terms only to the depreciation of the Indian currency. Indications coming from senior Infosys management that the road ahead will be challenging led to shares of the Bangalore-based software services major plunging 7 per cent to Rs 1,676.45.         
	This is the largest fall recorded by the Infosys stock in over four years. The Infosys numbers also had its impact on other IT stocks and, as a result, the BSE IT index led the losers list with a drop of 6.73 per cent.        
	If Infosys numbers were a disappointment, there was more ahead as inflation rose to 11.89 per cent for the week ended June 28, higher than estimates of 11.75 per cent.         
	Even as more bad news came in that crude oil prices have inched up to $146 per barrel, the real shock for investors came when the countrys industrial output rose only 3.8 per cent in May. This was sharply lower than market estimates of at least 6 per cent growth.        
	Broking circles added that soon investors were seen dumping stocks across the board with capital goods, bearing the brunt.        
	What happened today, was the cumulative effect of Infosys results which were average, IIP numbers which was below market expectation and the sharp surge in crude oil prices which led to European bourses witnessing selling pressure, said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan.         
	Dua added that as long as crude oil prices remained firm, the stock markets would remain under pressure.        
	Reflecting the days events, the BSE sensex opened marginally higher at 14032.06, hit an intra-day low of 13351.34 after the IIP numbers came out and thereafter ended at 13469.85, a drop of 456.39 points, or 3.28 per cent.        
	With weak industrial numbers, shares such as Larsen amp; Toubro shed nearly 7 per cent to Rs 2,357.20 on worries that its order books may slow down.         
	On the other hand, bank shares ended lower because of apprehensions that the central bank may again raise interest rates as inflation is seen hitting 12 per cent shortly.

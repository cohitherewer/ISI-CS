                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bidding for fresh oil hunt gets delayed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          On hold                                  
	New Delhi, April 18: The government today postponed the bidding date for the seventh round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy by three weeks.        
	An official statement said the date had been pushed back to May 16 from April 25 based on a large number of requests from prospective bidders.        
	However, officials feel the real reason is the withdrawal of the seven-year tax holiday in oil and gas exploration announced in the budget this year. There are indications that the tax holiday could be restored.        
	We are waiting for clarity on whether the tax holiday will be there or not. In the absence of clarity, companies will make their own assumptions and submit bids. Some will assume the tax holiday is there and some may think it is not there, so bids will be different, a senior official said.        
	With Parliament still debating the budget proposals, companies have asked for a postponement of the deadline to ensure clarity of rules before they submit bids.        
	However, the official line is that after the road show in Perth on March 31, the petroleum ministry had been flooded with requests from bidders for an extension of the deadline so that they could form a consortium of exploration and production companies and firm up their bid parameters.        
	Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are expected to pass the Finance Bill on April 28 or 29. Finance minister P. Chidambaram is likely to restore the tax holiday during his reply to the Bill.        
	At present, section 80 IB (9) of the Income Tax Act provides for a deduction to an undertaking, involved in the production or the refining of mineral oil, of 100 per cent of the profits for seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial assessment year.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora had earlier taken up the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for an early resolution of the problem.        
	Deora also wrote to finance minister Chidambaram stating we should stand by the commitment given at the time the NELP policy was announced.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Paswan: Firm measures                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: The pharmaceutical advisory forum has proposed a cap on margins of non-branded generic drugs at 400 per cent of the post manufacturing cost to tighten price control measures against drug manufacturers.        
	Non-branded generic drugs, which constitute about 8 per cent of the Rs 30,000-crore pharmaceutical market, are not currently subjected to any such cap. Officials said the drugs were being sold at trade margins of between 500 and 1,100 per cent.         
	The meeting of the pharmaceutical advisory forum, comprising representatives from the chemicals and fertilisers ministry, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), consumer organisations and state drug controllers, today proposed fixing of margins of non-branded generic drugs at 400 per cent of the maximum allowable post manufacturing expenses (Mape).        
	We have asked the department of chemicals and fertilisers to study the implementation part of this suggestion and to work on the guidelines, said chemicals and fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	The government will also set up a committee to look into the profit margins of branded generic drugs.        
	A study conducted by the NPPA has shown that some of the branded generic drugs in the country are sold at prices poor people cant afford, said Paswan.        
	The ministry has written to state governments to make it compulsory for medical practitioners working in government establishments to prescribe only non-branded generic medicines.        
	The minister also said the government would set up a generic store in every district of the country to promote non-branded generic medicines.        
	Moreover, the ministry is also working towards fixing the prices of patented medicines in the country. It has constituted a committee to study the impact of the prices of these medicines and to suggest measures to reduce the prices.        
	More than 5,000 formulation packs are introduced in the Indian markets every year including both patented and generic medicines.

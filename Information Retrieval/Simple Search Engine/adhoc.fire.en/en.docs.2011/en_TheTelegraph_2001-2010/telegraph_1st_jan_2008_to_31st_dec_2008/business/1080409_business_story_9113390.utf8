	New Delhi, April 8: French luxury brand Cartier and Italian designer house Armani will soon set up shop in the country, with the government clearing their proposals to set up retail outlets.        
	Twenty proposals worth Rs 1,962.05 crore were approved by finance minister P. Chidambaram on the recommendation of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).        
	Armani will invest Rs 1.02 crore to pick up a 51 per cent stake in a venture that will retail its branded products, an official statement said.        
	A similar proposal came from Richemont Services for a joint venture to sell Cartier products in the country.         
	Armani has a franchise and a distribution tie-up with DLF and will introduce the Giorgio Armani label in the country.         
	The label caters to the premium customer and is one of the most expensive ranges from the designers stable. The market for luxury goods in India is growing at 20 per cent and was worth $2.2 billion in 2006, Ficci estimates said.        
	Other proposals include an offer from cement manufacturer Lafarge India to merge Lafarge India Holding with itself.        
	UTV Software Communications proposals will bring in Rs 923.94 crore through equity purchase in UTV Software and equity shares and warrants in UTV Global. The FIPB has, however, deferred its decision on eight FDI proposals, including that of Singapore-based Delight Investments, which had offered to invest in a Hindi newspaper group.        
	The board has recommended a proposal by Essar Power and Axis Pvt Equity to the cabinet committee on economic affairs as the investments in the two proposals were more than Rs 600 crore each. PSA Indias proposal to induct foreign equity of up to 49 per cent for Rs 240 crore through a preferential allotment of compulsorily convertible preferential shares has also been approved.

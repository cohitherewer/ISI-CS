The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NMDC starts price hike drill
                                                                                                               NMDC starts price hike drill
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, April 1: State-owned miner NMDC Limited has shot off letters to domestic steel companies, signalling a possible hike in prices.        
	This comes at a time when the Centre has initiated dialogue with miners to reduce iron ore prices.        
	NMDC is Indias largest iron ore producer, supplying to integrated steel makers that do not have captive mines. It also owns some of the best quality reserves in the country, at Bailadila in Chattisgarh.        
	In a letter written yesterday, NMDC said new prices would come into effect from April 1 though it stopped short of quantifying the increase.        
	NMDC has stated that the new price would be benchmarked against the fresh contract to be entered with Japan Steel Mills (JSM) for 2008-09.        
	JSM has not finalised the percentage increase/decrease in the prices for the year 2008-09 in respect to NMDC ore. Therefore, NMDC could not finalise the price with effect from April 1, 2008 for our long-term customers, the letter read.        
	The company, which produces about 30 million tonnes iron ore, asked steel companies to continue paying old prices for the time being. However, the new prices would have retrospective effect from April 1, and the differences would have to be paid by the steel mills.        
	Simply put, Indian integrated steel makers such as Ispat, Essar, JSW Steel and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd will have to pay 65 per cent more on lump and 88 per cent on fines with effect from today, though the announcement will come later.        
	This is because JSM members, such as JFE Holdings, Nippon Steel as well as Koreas Posco, had, in February, agreed to pay 65 per cent more to worlds largest iron ore exporter Brazils Vale for 2008-09.        
	NMDC officials had then said that the company would follow its global peers.        
	The Telegraph could not contact NMDC chairman Rana Som today for his comments.        
	Steel companies have been pleading the government to reduce the prices of domestic iron ore if they have to reduce steel prices to tame inflation.         
	They had said that public sector NMDC and Kudremukh Iron Ore Co should reduce prices, instead of mulling an increase.        
	Spot prices of iron ore and coking coal  two major ingredients for steel making  have gone up by 46 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively, in the last one year.        
	If NMDC raises prices, it would be the second hike by the company in six months. NMDC had earlier hiked prices across the board by Rs 570 per tonne.        
	Steel companies have demanded that NMDC should take into account the increase in October when it fixes the new prices.        
	While the global prices are being fixed on a year-to-year basis, NMDC is raising prices twice. It should deduct the hike made in October while fixing a new contract for us, an executive with a steel company that depends on NMDC said.

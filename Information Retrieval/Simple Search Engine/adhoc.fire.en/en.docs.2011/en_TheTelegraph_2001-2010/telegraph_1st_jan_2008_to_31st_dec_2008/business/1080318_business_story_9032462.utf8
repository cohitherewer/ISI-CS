          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          DOUBLE TREAT                                  
	New Delhi, March 17: General Motors plans to roll out a new small car in India in the next two years.         
	It is difficult to talk about pricing but we will look at an offering in the region of Rs 2 lakh, said David Reilly, vice-president, General Motors.        
	The company is looking at launching three-four models within four years. India is a very important area of the region and we have ambitious plans. We are not finished with introducing new products here, Reilly said.        
	Less than a year ago, General Motors India (GM India) launched the Chevrolet Spark, which is priced at Rs 3 lakh.        
	GM India also plans to increase its $300-million export business of automotive components by two to three times.        
	On exporting the small car, Reilly said, Obviously, we are looking to open up new markets. There is significant potential of making the country an export hub in the future.        
	GM India wants to corner 10 per cent of the Indian automobile market by 2010 against the current share of three per cent.         
	Reilly, who is also the president of GMs Asia-Pacific operations, said the company was looking at introducing low-cost pick-up vans and other mini vehicles manufactured by Chinas SAIC GM Wuling Automobile Company in other countries, including India.        
	At present, GM holds a 34 per cent stake in the Chinese company, with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation and Liuzhou Wuling Automobile having 50.1 per cent and 15.9 per cent, respectively.        
	Till now we have been producing cars which are low cost and very competitive only to meet the Chinese demand. But now we are seriously looking at introducing these outside China, including India, he said, without giving any time frame for the launch.        
	Reilly said the company would announce the details of its proposed $200 million powertrain engine facility in the country in the next two months.        
	GM India would start the trial run of its second plant, with initial capacity of 1.4 lakh units a year, at Talegaon near Pune by next week. The production capacity of the plant can be increased to three lakh units per annum.        
	We are making a lot of investment in the Pune plant and trying to raise the localisation rate to 90 per cent from the current 40-50 per cent, he said.

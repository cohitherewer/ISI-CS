	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Motorcycle maker Yamaha is eyeing a 10 per cent share of the Indian two-wheeler market by 2010 as it prepares to launch the FZ 150cc in the festive season.        
	The company also plans to bring in more bikes above the 125cc segment. We have been missing out on products above the 125cc segment. The company is now focusing on both performance and power bikes, said Pankaj Dubey, division head (sales and marketing), India Yamaha Motors.        
	To be launched in October, the FZ 150cc has an air-cooled engine. It is inspired by the FZ 1000cc and is expected to be priced in the range of Rs 65,000-70,000. An air-cooled engine relies on direct air circulation over the hot parts of the engine to cool it.        
	At present, the company has only one more motorcycle in the 150cc segment  the YZFr15, which is a sportsbike. Sales of 150cc bikes in India are between 60,000 units and 65,000 units, of which Yamaha says it has a market share of 24.2 per cent. The company plans to sell 25,000 units of the YZFr15 by the year-end. Of this, it has already sold about 6,100 units. It aims to sell about 30,000 units of FZ 150cc in the last quarter of the year.        
	Dubey debunked fears about Yamaha losing top managers. On the contrary we have lowered our employee attrition rate to 9 per cent this year from 23 per cent last year, he said.        
	Recently, Yamahas turnaround person, CEO and managing director T. Ishikawa, has quit to join Bajaj Auto. A few months back, the companys marketing and sales head, P. Sam, had quit to join Subhiksha Trading Services.         
	As part of its makeover strategy, the company has spruced up its product portfolio. It has launched two versions of the 125cc Gladiator in March, followed by the 150cc YZFr15 in June.        
	The Gladiator variants are priced at around Rs 47,000, and the YZFr15 costs Rs 97,425 (ex-showroom Delhi). The company hopes to sell about 1.8 lakh units this year in the domestic market against 1.17 lakh in 2007. Its performance has been hampered by a weak sales and distribution network.        
	Yamahas plans got a shot from the sales of motorcycle firms in July. Sales jumped 21.91 per cent to 4,57,178 units. Hero Honda Motors sold 2,60,324 units and rival Bajaj Auto, 1,13,440 units. Sales of TVS Motors rose 11.95 per cent to 39,448 units from 35,237 units in the same month last year.

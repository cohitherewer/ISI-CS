	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Textile mills affected by the high cost of cotton could get some relief in the stimulus package being worked out by the government, but there would be no reduction in the minimum support price.        
	Officials of the textile ministry expect a package under which working capital loans will be provided to mills at an interest rate of 7 per cent against the present rate of around 12-13 per cent.         
	The margin money to be provided by the mills may be reduced to 10 per cent from 25 per cent. The loan period may be extended to 9 months from 3-4 months.         
	This could provide some respite to mills hit by a drop in export and high domestic cotton prices, the officials said. There is a ground for intervention in the form of a stimulus package, but the minimum support price (MSP) cannot be reduced, a senior textile ministry official said.        
	The government had increased MSP for cotton by 40-50 per cent in August this year depending on the variety. The cotton prices were then ruling firm in the international market.         
	In mid-November the global cotton prices hit a six-year low. The relatively higher prices in India have hit the export of raw cotton and textiles.         
	The Centre had increased MSP of standard cotton (long staple) to Rs 3,000 a quintal for 2008-09 from Rs 2,030 in the previous year.

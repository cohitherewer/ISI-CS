	Mumbai, Aug. 28: General Motors, which aims to double its share in the fast growing and increasingly competitive Indian market, will invest more than $200 million to set up a powertrain facility at Talegaon in Maharashtra.         
	The facility, which will come up at the site of GMs second vehicle plant in the country, will have an annual capacity of 160,000 units that can be expanded to 300,000 units.        
	The plant will make petrol and diesel engines and is likely to be completed in the first quarter of 2010.        
	We cannot remain a global industry leader without a strong presence in India, General Motors India president and managing director Karl Slym told reporters here after signing the agreement for the powertrain facility with the Maharashtra government.         
	This will enable us to capture more opportunities in one of the fastest growing vehicle markets in the world, he said.        
	GM, which makes the Chevrolet-badged Tavera, Optra, Aveo and the Spark at a plant in Gujarat, will have capacity to make 140,000 vehicles in the new Talegaon facility, taking its India capacity to more than 2,25,000 units.        
	This is just one of a number of investments GM has made over the course of the last few years in emerging markets around the world and is an important component of GMs global strategy, Slym said.         
	In India, GM has invested more than $1 billion.        
	The US car maker expects to double its market share in India to 10 per cent by 2010.         
	The Talegaon facility will be primarily used for domestic market consumption. However, at a later cars may be exported, Slym said.        
	The work on the Talegaon facility for powertrain will begin immediately, he said.        
	The powertrain and the car manufacturing facilities will provide employment to 1,400 people.        
	Small car        
	GM will launch a small car in India in the second half of 2009, Slym said.        
	The US car company has no plan to take on Tatas Nano, billed as the worlds cheapest car and scheduled for launch in October.        
	Our engineers are working on it our Bangalore centre. The small car will be for the global market, he said.

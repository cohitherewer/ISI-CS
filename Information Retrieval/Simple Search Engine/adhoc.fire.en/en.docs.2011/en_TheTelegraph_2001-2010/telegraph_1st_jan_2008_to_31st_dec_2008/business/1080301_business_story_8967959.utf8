        Guest Column - A.M. NAIK                        
	The finance minister today presented the last budget of the UPA Government before it faces the general elections next year. The budget lays strong emphasis on growth in social sector and agriculture.         
	Tax rates: The budget does not propose to reduce the corporate tax rate which remains at 33.99 per cent. However, to encourage investors to remain invested for the long term, the FM has increased the tax rate on short-term capital gains from the transfer of listed equity shares or units of an equity oriented fund, from 10 per cent to 15 percent.         
	Dividend distribution tax: With a view to help domestic companies to efficiently structure their business, the FM has proposed to introduce a mechanism by which a domestic parent company can claim a set off of the dividends received from the subsidiary company against the distributable dividends while computing dividend distribution tax, subject to the conditions that the subsidiary company has paid dividend distribution tax and the parent company is not a subsidiary of another company.         
	The proposed amendment is to mitigate the cascading effect of dividend distribution tax up to one level.         
	Minimum alternate tax: With respect to the computation of minimum alternate tax (MAT), it has been clarified that the book profits shall be increased by the amount of deferred tax and the provision therefore, if debited to profit and loss account. Further, it also proposes that the amount of income tax to be added to the book profits shall include dividend distribution tax, interest on tax, surcharge and education cess. It is important to note that these amendments are proposed to be effective retrospectively from assessment year 2001-02.        
	Incentives and benefits: Currently, the benefit of amortisation of specified post commencement preliminary expenses for the extension of an industrial undertaking or for setting up of industrial unit is available to the manufacturing sector for five consecutive years. With a view to provide a level playing field to the service sector this benefit of amortisation has also been extended to the service sector.         
	To encourage outsourcing of scientific research, particularly by small companies who could not make substantial investment for building in-house scientific research facilities, it has been proposed that a weighted deduction of 125 per cent would be available to the person making payment to the company for scientific research.        
	To encourage investment in hospitals in non-metro cities, it is proposed to give a five year tax holiday to hospitals located in specified areas. Similarly, a five-year tax holiday has also been proposed for hotels located in specified districts having a world heritage site.        
	Fringe benefit tax: The provisions of fringe benefit tax (FBT) have been rationalised to provide that any expenditure incurred for crche facilities for the children of the employees, for sponsoring an employee who is a sportsman or to organise sports events for employees shall not be considered as employees welfare expenditure. Accordingly, such expenditure would not be liable to FBT.        
	Compliance procedures: The due date for filing of return of income by corporate taxpayers and persons required to get its account audited are proposed to be advanced from October 31 to September 30. This advancement of due date is also proposed to apply to FBT returns.        
	Payments to non-residents are subject to deduction of tax under Section 195. Currently the person making the remittance submits an undertaking and a certificate from an accountant to the Reserve Bank of India who in turn forward it to the assessing officer (AO). To monitor and track transactions in a timely manner, it is proposed to introduce e-filing of the information in the undertaking and certificate.                    THE AUTHOR IS CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF L T

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Ram Vilas Paswan (right) with MSTC chairman Malay Sengupta in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: The steel ministry has recommended a hike in the export duty on iron ore to 20 per cent from 15 per cent, Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said today.        
	Paswan said the recommendation had been sent to the finance ministry, and the government would take a call soon.        
	The move comes at a time when China has raised the export duty on metallurgical coke to 40 per cent from 25 per cent to discourage exports and ensure the availability of the raw material locally.         
	Till the domestic demand is fully met, there should be an export ban on high quality iron ore, Paswan said on the sidelines of MSTC Ltds 45th foundation day celebrations.        
	Iron ore prices have risen several fold over the last two years and contributed to rising steel prices. However, Paswan could not specify the level at which he wanted the prices to cool down. The government had held a meeting with steel producers last month to review prices and the health of the industry.        
	Indian steel prices are lower than their international counterparts. But with global steel prices also on a downslide, there is no reason why Indian prices should escalate, said Paswan.         
	In May, steel makers had agreed to roll back prices by Rs 4,000 a tonne and hold prices for three months. However, at the retail level, prices were allowed to rise.        
	The average price of hot-rolled coils, an intermediate product, rose to Rs 47,331.25 a tonne in mid-June from Rs 43,458.33 a month ago, joint plant committee data showed.        
	In April, the government had imposed a 15 per cent export duty on semi-finished steel products and a five per cent duty on galvanised sheets to make exports less attractive. The import of pig iron, mild steel products, sponge iron and semi-finished products were made duty-free.        
	Paswan expected steel prices to stabilise in the coming months.         
	Iron ore consumption during 2007-08 was 85 million tonnes (mt), of which 41mt were lumps and 44mt fines.

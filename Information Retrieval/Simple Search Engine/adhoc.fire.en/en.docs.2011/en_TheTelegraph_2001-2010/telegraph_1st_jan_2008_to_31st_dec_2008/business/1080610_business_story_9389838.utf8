                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil, MTN alliance talks gather pace
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ambani: Fast forward                                  
	Mumbai, June 9: Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications (R-Com) and African telecom giant MTN are expected to complete the due diligence process by tomorrow and move into the next stage of negotiations for the proposed alliance, sources said here today.        
	R-Com officials including Punit Garg, president of Reliance Globalcom, and S.P. Shukla, president (personal business), along with the company secretary and officials from the legal department are expected to return from London on Tuesday.        
	No formal discussions have taken place as yet on the equity swap ratio under the deal that will create the sixth largest telecom operator in the world. Talks on this contentious issue will begin later this week.         
	Over the weekend, R-Com president Anil Ambani along with other officials held meetings with Phuthuma Nhleko and MTN chief financial officer Rob Nisbet in London.        
	So far, both sides have been discussing the broad contours of the transaction. The buzz is that it will be a reverse takeover in which Ambani will swap a substantial part of his 66.12 per cent stake in RCom for a 34 per cent stake in MTN.        
	Sources said Ambani was not averse to R-Com becoming a subsidiary of MTN as long as he emerges the single largest stakeholder in MTN.        
	R-Coms shares rose Rs 7.30, or 1.34 per cent, before closing at Rs 554.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Meanwhile, MTN shares declined 4.65 per cent after opening at Rand 141 and were trading at Rand 134.30 in the evening on the Johannesburg stock exchange.

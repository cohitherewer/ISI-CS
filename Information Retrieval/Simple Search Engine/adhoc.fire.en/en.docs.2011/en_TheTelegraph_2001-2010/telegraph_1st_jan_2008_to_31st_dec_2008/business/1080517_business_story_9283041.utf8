	Mumbai, May 16: Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and some other US and European investors, will pick up a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Infratel, the telecom tower arm of Reliance Communications, in a pre-IPO placement.         
	Sources said the placement would value the company at Rs 60,000 crore. The investors will pick up the stake for Rs 3,000 crore, they added.        
	Although Reliance Communications officials declined to comment on the development, sources confirmed the pre-IPO (initial public offering) placement.         
	Earlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had approved Reliance Infratels IPO.         
	The Anil Ambani company plans to dilute 10 per cent equity through the IPO to raise around Rs 6,000 crore.        
	It aims to use the issue proceeds to develop passive infrastructure and set up telecom towers. Reliance Infratel has around 30,000 towers and plans to set up 60,000 by March 2009.        
	Market observers felt Reliance Infratel had got better valuation this time than last year, when it had privately placed a 5 per cent stake to a clutch of institutional investors, including Quantum Fund controlled by US billionaire George Soros, HSBC Principal Investments, Fortress Capital, New Silk Route, Galleon Group, DA Capital and GLG Partners.        
	While the latest deal values the company at around Rs 60,000 crore, the stake dilution last year had fetched Rs 1,400 crore, valuing the company at around Rs 28,000 crore. Reliance Infratel is awaiting clearances from the registrar of companies for its flotation.        
	Sources said the IPO would take another four months as the company would like to wait for the stock markets to recover.

   RBI boss to fight price rise, hasten reforms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao (centre) with deputy governors Rakesh Mohan (right) and Usha Thorat (left) in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Sept. 5: Duvvuri Subbarao, who took over as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today, said his immediate priority would be to check inflation which was running at just over 12 per cent.        
	Subbarao, who has been appointed for a three-year term against the normal tenure of five years, said he would push financial sector reforms in the short to the medium term.         
	The immediate priority for me as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India will be to manage inflation and anchor inflationary expectations, Subbarao told reporters after he took over from Yaga Venugopal Reddy. He is the 22nd governor of the RBI.         
	Four deputy governors welcomed Subbarao at the entrance to the central bank this morning. He then assumed charge after signing a note and a scroll.         
	The new governor, who was flanked by Y. V. Reddy and other deputy governors, said he would have his ears firmly to the ground on real sector reforms.        
	Observers interpreted Subbaraos statement on inflation to mean that the central bank would continue to look at raising interest rates as one of the ways to deal with rising prices.         
	This year alone, the central bank has increased the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and the repo rate by 150 basis points and 125 basis points, respectively, to rein in inflation. CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI. Repo is the rate at which the RBI provides liquidity to banks.        
	They reckoned that one of the key reforms that Subbarao would consider, perhaps next year, would be to grant foreign banks greater freedom.         
	The RBI is expected to review the restrictions that foreign banks have to deal with when they want to acquire local private sector banks.         
	Born on August 11, 1949, Subbarao holds a B.Sc degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and is an M.Sc in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.         
	He also holds an MS degree in Economics from Americas Ohio State University. He was a Humphrey fellow at MIT during 1982-83. He has a Ph.D in Economics with a thesis on fiscal reforms at the subnational level.         
	He also topped the All India Civil Service examinations in 1972. He was one of the first IITians to join the civil services.         
	Before joining the RBI, Subbarao was the finance secretary.         
	Earlier he was the secretary to the Prime Ministers economic advisory council (2005-2007), lead economist in the World Bank (1999-2004), finance secretary to the Andhra Pradesh government (1993-98) and joint secretary in the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry (1988-1993).

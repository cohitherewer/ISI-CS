          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 31: The government today promised to continue with executive actions on reforms, while it tries to persuade various political parties to give their support to stalled bills.        
	We will continue to take executive action to push reforms. When we reassemble in Parliament and tempers have cooled down, we can return to legislative reforms, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.        
	In tune with the governments pledge for executive actions, the Union cabinet today asked the 13th Finance Commission to prepare a roadmap for fiscal deficit targets that will bring subsidies on oil, food and fertilisers in the budget.        
	Chidambaram said that once the dust over the trust vote on the nuclear deal settled, I am sure that the leadership of parties will prevail upon their members to support key financial bills including insurance, banking regulation and pension bills.         
	Though the government has won the trust vote, the passage of several economic bills will be extremely difficult without the support of either the Left parties or the BJP.         
	With the BJP refusing to help the government, it would be difficult to pass any bill which is opposed by the Left. The minister was speaking at a function organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	Bills on insurance and pension reforms plus the one proposing voting rights to foreign investors in proportion to their stakes in banks have been stalled because of differences between the UPA and the Left.

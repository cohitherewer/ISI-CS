          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 10: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) today reported a 28 per cent rise in net profit after tax in the quarter ended March 31 at Rs 768.12 crore compared with Rs 550.05 crore in the year-ago period.        
	For the full year, the company reported a net profit after tax of Rs 2,436.25 crore.        
	The consolidated net profit of HDFC stood at Rs 2,713 crore for the financial year ended March 31, a 55.74 per cent growth rate over the year-ago period.        
	In 2008, the total income rose to Rs 8,819.42 crore from Rs 6,393.19 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Despite a robust performance, HDFC was one of the bigger losers on the stock market today, with the stock falling almost 5 per cent to end the day at Rs 2,101 against Rs 2,206.65 yesterday.        
	All financial sector stocks have lost today on the twin worries of inflation and interest rate hike. The realty prices have not fallen much. As a result there is a dearth of sales. Besides, the overall market condition has led to the HDFC stocks falling, said a research analyst from Religare Securities.        
	The loan portfolio, including loans outstanding, deposits and investments in preference shares and debentures for financing real estate related projects amounted to Rs 74,104 crore against Rs. 57,988 crore in the previous year, an increase of 28 per cent.        
	The spread on loans over the cost of borrowings for the year stood at 2.32 per cent against 2.18 per cent in the previous year.         
	The company recommended a dividend of Rs 25 per share.

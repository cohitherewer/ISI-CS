          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Muthuraman: New horizons                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: After two mining acquisitions in Africa, Tata Steel has ventured into North America for iron ore.        
	Tata Steel Global Minerals Holdings Pte Limited, Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, has entered into a binding agreement with New Millennium Capital Corporation of Canada to pick up a 19.9 per cent stake in the company for $22.6 million (Rs 106 crore).         
	It will also have an option to acquire an 80 per cent equity interest in New Millenniums direct shipping ore project which is located in the border regions of two Canadian provinces in the eastern part of the country  Quebec and Newfoundland amp; Labrador. Direct shipping ore is one category of iron ore         
	After the completion of the feasibility study, regulatory approvals and project financing, New Millennium expects to produce four million tonnes of iron ore per annum from the shipping ore project, starting 2010.        
	Besides this project, the agreement provides exclusivity to Tata Steel with respect to the LabMag taconite iron ore property, in Newfoundland amp; Labrador, which is 80 per cent owned by New Millennium.        
	The Canadian company will use the net proceeds from the private placement to develop the shipping ore project through a feasibility study to be completed in the second quarter of 2009.        
	Based on historical estimates, the shipping ore project has capacity to produce 100 million tonnes. Tata Steel has an exclusivity option for a 180-day period to acquire an 80 per cent equity interest in the project.         
	Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said, Because of its geographical proximity, Canada is a favourable location to source raw materials for Tata Steels European operations.

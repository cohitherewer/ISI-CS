The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AT amp;T eyes stake in Videocon mobile arm
                                                                                                               AT amp;T eyes stake in Videocon mobile arm
                              Call waiting                            
	New Delhi, March 16 (PTI): US firm AT amp;T is keen on a stake in Videocons subsidiary, Datacom, which has recently been issued a licence to offer mobile services throughout India.        
	If the deal materialises, it will be AT amp;Ts second innings in Indias cellular mobile services. Sources said the deal could be finalised in the next few weeks. When contacted, an AT amp;T spokesperson declined to comment on market speculations.        
	Sources, however, said AT amp;Ts senior management team would be in Delhi in mid-April to work out the details, and the US company might sign up Datacom as a strategic partner.         
	Datacom has announced an investment of Rs 6,000 crore to set up a pan-India network.        
	The sources said any deal would take shape only after the government allocated spectrum to new players since a licence was not enough to fetch a good value to the new players stakes.        
	On the other hand, the new players, who have been issued the licences but are awaiting spectrum, have alleged that existing GSM players have been delaying the process of frequency allocation by indulging in court battles to weaken the business case of the new entrants.        
	Datacom has also been approached by another foreign player, Telephonica of Spain, company sources said, but declined to elaborate.         
	Datacom said it was one company that could ensure a pan-India presence to a strategic partner, foreign or domestic.        
	On its business plans, Datacom officials said Rs 6,000-crore of investment had been lined up in the first phase, targeting 40 million subscribers in five years.        
	Besides Datacom, there are other new players such as Unitech, Shyam Telelink and Swan Telecom.        
	Induction of a strategic partner is essential as building a pan-India network is likely to involve an investment of over $5 billion (over Rs 20,000 crore) and it will be difficult for a new player to pump in the huge funds.        
	Datacom is on the top of the list to get spectrum for 19 circles, apart from Delhi and Mumbai.         
	This will give further leverage to the company to strike a deal with a strategic partner ahead of others.

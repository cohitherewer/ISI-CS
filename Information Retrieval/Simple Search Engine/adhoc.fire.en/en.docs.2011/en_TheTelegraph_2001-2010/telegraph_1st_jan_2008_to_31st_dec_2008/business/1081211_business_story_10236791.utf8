          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Passenger car sales shrank by a fifth, while truck and bus sales fell by half in November, casting a pall of gloom over the Rs 1,50,000-crore automobile industry.        
	According to analysts, sales fell on account of high interest rates and reluctance among buyers to go for big-ticket purchases because of the current economic slowdown.        
	In our history, we have never seen all the segments down so badly together in a month, Dilip Chenoy, director-general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), told reporters while releasing the sales figures for November.        
	Car sales in November fell 19.4 per cent to 83,059 units from 103,031 in the corresponding month a year ago. Commercial vehicle makers sold 20,637 units in November compared with 40,879 units a year ago. Two-wheeler firms managed to sell 431,171 bikes, down from 540,553 last year.        
	Auto makers, however, are optimistic that the duty cuts announced by the government last week and lower interest rates can bring cheer to the market next year.        
	The 19-per-cent drop in car sales is the lowest in two years, according to Siam. The biggest drop in this decade was in February 2003 when sales skidded 30 per cent. After reviewing the impact of the fiscal measures on January purchases, Siam will review its annual sales forecast in February.         
	However, auto makers can take some heart from exports which zoomed 61.88 per cent to 1,46,337 units in November against 90,398 units in the same month last year.        
	Tata Motors move        
	Tata Motors has slashed prices across its entire range following the 4 per cent cut in cenvat. The prices of passenger cars  the Indica and the Indigo family  have been reduced by Rs 12,000- Rs 23,000, while the Safari and the Sumo models will be cheaper by Rs 16,000-Rs 36,000.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: Reliance Communications (R-Com) has chosen the EDGE (enhanced data rates for GSM evolution) platform for its GSM services, sources said. The company, which is Indias No. 1 CDMA operator, has received GSM spectrum last week. It had received a pan-India GSM licence earlier.
    
	EDGE will enable the company to offer high-speed data services in conjunction with voice services, the sources said.
    
	Anil Ambani, the chairman of R-Com, is looking at negotiating a 100-million-line GSM tender at highly competitive rates. He is exploring the possibility of average costs per digital exchange line (or per connection) that will be 50 per cent lower than what his rivals paid. If successful, R-Com will get an advantage in pricing vis--vis mobile tariffs.
    
	R-Com is believed to have called the shortlisted foreign GSM equipment vendors for final negotiations, which are expected to start by Wednesday. While R-Com officials declined to comment on the companys plans, industry sources said it would start work on its GSM network within a week. 
    
	To cut down on implementation time, the equipment vendor is likely to set up an assembly hub in the country to cater to the mammoth size of the network. 
    
	In its statement after receiving approval for GSM spectrum, R-Com said it would target 6 million new GSM subscribers every month. It aims to have 20 per cent of new subscribers in its network.
    
	The company also said it would aggressively target the existing GSM subscriber base of 172 million. 
    
	Reliance Telecom, an R-Com subsidiary, now offers GSM services in eight circles.

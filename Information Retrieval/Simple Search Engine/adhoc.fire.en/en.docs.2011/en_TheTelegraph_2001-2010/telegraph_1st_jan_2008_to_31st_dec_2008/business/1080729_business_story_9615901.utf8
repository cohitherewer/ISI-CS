          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Britannia chairman Nusli Wadia (right) with CFO Durgesh Mehta in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 28: Britannia Industries will invest between Rs 75 crore and Rs 100 crore in capacity expansion during the current financial year.         
	The investment will be funded through internal accruals, said Durgesh Mehta, chief financial officer of Britannia Industries, at the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting.         
	In 2007-08, Britannia saved Rs 120 crore by adopting various cost-control measures. The company will reinforce the actions taken in 2007-08 to eliminate cost disadvantages and cut non value-adding activities to secure profitable growth, said Mehta. We will maintain margins by reducing operating costs through better use of equipment and energy, he said.        
	The biscuit manufacturer today reported a nearly 20 per cent growth in net sales to Rs 693.3 crore for the April-June quarter this year from Rs 578.9 crore in the same period a year ago.         
	However, its profit before tax improved marginally to Rs 48.6 crore from Rs 48 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year primarily because of higher expenditure on raw materials and interest payments.         
	The companys bottomline was hit hard by the rising interest rate and wheat and corn prices, in particular.        
	In the current fiscal, Britannia aims to launch products catering particularly to the health food segment, which it believes has good growth potential. The countrys top biscuit maker is expanding its dairy portfolio and considering other options to tap a growing demand for processed foods. Were looking at expanding our dairy portfolio and evaluating other opportunities, said a senior official.        
	The company expects to maintain operating margins at the 2007-08 level of 9 per cent despite a steep rise in the costs of raw materials such as wheat, corn, milk powder and vegetable oil.        
	We are also looking at inorganic growth opportunities abroad, Mehta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India wont relent at WTO talks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       India wont relent at WTO talks
                            
	Geneva, July 19 (pti): India today said it would not give away concessions committed to developing countries even if it meant breakdown of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (wto) meeting of trade ministers on Monday.        
	The meeting has been called for infusing urgency into the Doha round of trade talks.        
	There is no hope or scope of any concession which will compromise Indias industries such as engineering, chemicals, textiles, automobiles. Provisions for their protection in the July 2004 framework agreement and the Hong Kong declaration cannot be diluted. If this means a breakdown of talks, so be it, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said here.        
	India also charged that the negotiating texts on opening markets have given carve-outs to the US and EU.        
	The us and eu have already been given carve-outs in the July 10 text as if they were developing countries. We oppose these, Nath said.        
	The July 10 wto draft on agriculture has extended the base period for calculation of the subsidy cut in a way that would enable the us to give at least $5-billion extra doles to its farmers, a senior commerce ministry official said.         
	Similarly, tariff caps have been worked out in a manner to help the rich nations, he said.        
	The WTO is convening a five-day mini-ministerial meeting from July 21 for negotiating on two sets of proposals circulated on May 19 and July 10. The draft proposals have evoked strong reactions from India and several other developing countries.

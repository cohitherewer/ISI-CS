     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 1: Interface Inc is looking at the possibility of setting up a manufacturing unit here.
    
	Roughly six years ago, the Atlanta-based company entered the country through InterfaceFLOR, its modular flooring division.
    
	A leading designer and manufacturer of modular carpets, Interface will take a final call on its India unit after assessing raw material availability and market demand.
    
	InterfaceFLOR is a leading player in carpet tiles and it has seven manufacturing facilities in the US, Thailand, Australia, England, Ireland and the Netherlands. 
    
	Since it entered India in 2001, InterfaceFLOR has sold more than 1.5 million square metres of carpet tiles. Its sales have jumped from little over Rs 1 crore to Rs 70 crore during this period. 
    
	At present, the company imports carpet tiles from its facility in Thailand to sell in the local market.
    
	According to Raj Menon, country manager of InterfaceFLOR India, a volume of 10 lakh square metres is the likely trigger for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. Though the company expected to attain that volume next year, Menon said other factors would also play a crucial role.

	New Delhi , Jan. 20: Gordon Brown, the UK Prime Minister, today said his government would facilitate the setting up of a network comprising Indian and British venture capitalists. 
    
	Addressing an entrepreneurship summit here, Brown said: It may be of interest to many of you who want to start their own businesses that we are creating a new network which will provide venture capital funds. 
    
	He said the network would be for ideas in India which can be developed in Britain and ideas in Britain which can be developed in India. 
    
	Brown and a large delegation of British business leaders arrived in the capital today after a two-day visit to China where he focused on trade, investment and on controlling the climate change. 
    
	These issues are also expected to dominate talks with Indian leaders. 
    
	Brown said he was in India at a time when trade between the two countries had doubled in the last five years and was rising by 20 per cent a year.
    
	The relation between the two countries is stronger than ever and cooperation should be increased in trade that will bring prosperity to both the countries, he said.
    
	The UK is Indias fourth-largest trading partner, accounting for 3.56 per cent of Indias foreign trade in 2006-2007. 
    
	India has emerged as the second-largest investor in Britain, with investments totalling over $1.9 billion in the last year alone. 
    
	As examples of greater investment links between the two countries, Brown cited the acquisition by Tata Steel of Corus and Vodafones takoever of telecom firm Hutchison Essar.
    
	Arun Sarin, chief executive of Vodafone, and Richard Branson, head of the Virgin group, are part of Browns delegation.
    
	Branson said his group was planning to enter the mobile phone segment, the details of which would be announced in a month or two. 
    
	He did not comment on the possibility of an alliance with Tata Teleservices. 
    
	The Tatas and Branson had held talks in May over the possibility of a 50:50 joint venture in telecom.
    
	I am coming back again in three weeks time and on that occasion I may have more to say on the business ventures. On this trip I am not doing any business. I am supporting the UK Prime Ministers visit and meeting a lot of entrepreneurs, he said.
    
	The Caparo group, led by Lord Swraj Paul, today said it was planning a six-fold increase in investments to reach sales of $1 billion in the next 10 years.
    
	Brown inaugurated a Rs 83-crore auto component unit of the group in Greater Noida.

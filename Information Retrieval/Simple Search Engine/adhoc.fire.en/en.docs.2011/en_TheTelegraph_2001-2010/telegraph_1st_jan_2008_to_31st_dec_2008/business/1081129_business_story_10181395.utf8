          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Fiscal deficit touched Rs 1,17,070 crore between April and October, which is almost 88 per cent of the target for 2008-09. In the corresponding period of the previous year, the deficit had reached 54.5 per cent of the target.        
	Earlier this week, finance minister P. Chidambaram had said India was likely to miss the revenue and fiscal deficit targets for the current fiscal as the government planned to spend additional money to boost aggregate demand in the economy, which has shown signs of slowing down.        
	In February, the government had set a fiscal deficit target of Rs 1,33,000 crore, or 2.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, for 2008-09. The target was 2.8 per cent in the previous year.        
	Revenue deficit, which represents a gap between current expenditure and current revenue, has already crossed the estimates for the whole year by 57.7 per cent, till October.

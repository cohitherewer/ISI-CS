	Mumbai, July 7 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to set up facilities in their branches for the exchange of soiled and damaged currency notes.         
	Even the mutilated currency notes, with essential features intact, can be exchanged at designated branches of the banks, the RBI said while issuing a master circular on the exchange of notes and coins.        
	The circular also asked banks to provide customer services more actively and vigorously.        
	It also clarified that currency notes with slogans and messages of political nature written on them would cease to be legal and could not be exchanged with fresh notes.        
	The bank branches will be required to provide new and good quality notes and coins of all denominations to customers.

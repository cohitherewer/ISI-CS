	Mumbai, Sept. 18: Lupin Ltd has acquired a majority stake in Pharma Dynamics, a South African generic company.         
	Though the Mumbai-based pharmaceutical company did not disclose the size of the transaction, it is understood to be somewhere around $25 million. Lupin had earlier acquired stakes in German marketing firm Hormosan Pharma and Australias Generic Health.         
	According to Lupin, Pharma Dynamics is one of the fastest growing generic companies and commands a premium image with a clear leadership in the cardiovascular segment.         
	Pharma Dynamics reported revenues of $14 million for the year ended February 2008. The South African market is estimated at $2.5 billion. Generics constitute a third of the market.         
	Pharma Dynamics is expected to launch at least 12 products this year, much higher than the industry norm of about four new products a year.         
	Through this partnership, Pharma Dynamics will gain access to Lupins product pipeline and manufacturing expertise, while Lupin can access the established brands and supply chains in South Africa, Lupin said.         
	According to Kamal Sharma, managing director of Lupin, With the synergies of the two companies, we expect to be in the top league in the South African market very soon.         
	Lupin expects its profitability to increase over the next three years, following the acquisition.         
	Pharma Dynamics founder Paul Aley will continue to be the CEO.

	Calcutta, May 20: Calcutta-based Ushacomm, a subsidiary of Usha Martin, is weighing overseas acquisitions.        
	The company develops products for telecom companies in the area of customer care and billing.        
	Indian companies are overheated and valuations will be better abroad. However, the domestic market will aid implementation and delivery, said Ushacomm executive director Saugata Banerjee.        
	Banerjee said the company was planning the acquisition to increase its range of billing solutions.        
	Although there are no definitive talks at the moment, we are looking at areas such as customer relationship management and business intelligence, he said.        
	The company has a development centre in Calcutta. It has 150 employees around the world and 45 international clients. It plans to ramp up its headcount by 33 per cent by the end of this year. The company is also planning to cater to other utility companies.        
	We have thought about diversifying into other utility companies where billing forms the core of the services. Our billing solutions are versatile and can adapt to the needs of various industries, Banerjee said.        
	Ushacomm is in talks with power and other utility companies as part of this plan.        
	The company today said it had won a $2-million contract for Nepal Telecom.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora holds out pipeline hope
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Deora holds out pipeline hope
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Petroleum minister Murli Deora (extreme right) in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 14: India hopes to resolve the transit fee issue with Pakistan next week for the Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline during petroleum minister Murli Deoras visit to Islamabad.         
	We have some small differences on transit fees. But I am very optimistic that we can sort out the problems, Deora told reporters at a gas summit.        
	Deora and his secretary M.S. Srinivasan will be in Islamabad on April 23 and April 24 for the steering committee meeting of another project  the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project.         
	Project sponsor Asian Development Bank has called the meeting to formally induct India into the project and sign the heads of agreements.        
	On April 25, Deora has a meeting with officials in Pakistan, where he will discuss the IPI project. Washington is opposed to India joining the IPI pipeline as the money could be used by Tehran for its nuclear weapons programme.        
	A technical team will be leaving for Pakistan tomorrow to hold talks between April 16 and 18 and to finalise the deal.        
	Officials said India had not been attending talks on the IPI project since mid-2007 as it wanted to first resolve the issue of the transit fee payable to Islamabad for wheeling the gas through that country.        
	New Delhi and Islamabad have reached a broad understanding on the formula to calculate the transportation tariff to be paid to Pakistan but the difference is on the quantum.        
	Islamabad is seeking $0.493 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) as a transit fee, while New Delhi has offered 0.15 dollars per mBtu ($60 million a year) for providing security and the right of way to the pipeline, officials said.        
	Originally, Iran was supposed to supply 150 million cubic metres (mcm) of gas per day through the pipeline, with India getting 90mcm and Pakistan 60mcm. Now, Iran has revised the supply in the first phase to 60 mcm, which will be shared equally by the two neighbours.        
	Oil bids        
	The government today said the seventh round of bids under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (Nelp VII) would not be postponed though there was a lack of clarity on tax holidays on gas production.        
	The tax holiday withdrawal (in the Union Budget) is a problem but it is not a deal breaker. The April 25 deadline for the Nelp VII bidding holds, Srinivasan said. The petroleum ministry has requested the finance ministry to reinstate the seven-year tax holiday for the hydrocarbon exploration and production segment, he said.         
	ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said, The tax holiday is an issue of sentiment. The withdrawal is a breach of that sentiment.        
	Srinivasan said it was too early to conclude if big oil companies were keeping away from the auction because of the withdrawal. He said companies mostly bid in the last week before the deadline. We still have some more time to figure out whether the interest being shown in Nelp VII is good, he added.

	 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has signed a joint venture agreement with Jaiprakash Associates to set up a 2-million-tonne cement plant at Bokaro, Jharkhand. It will use slag produced at SAILs Bokaro Steel Plant to make cement. SAIL will hold a 26 per cent stake in the joint venture and the remaining 74 per cent will be with Jaiprakash Associates. At present, SAIL is selling slag to cement companies through medium-term contracts but it still has sufficient excess slag to sell to other units. This prompted the steel maker to look for cement joint ventures which could use up all its remaining slag.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Durables firms eye price hike after Diwali
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                      Pocket pinch                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Consumer durables firms are keen on raising prices after Diwali because of the global financial crisis.        
	The Rs 23,000-crore industry is feeling the pinch of the depreciation of the rupee and high interest rates on consumer loans which have eroded its margins.        
	Manufacturers such as LG, Haier, Godrej Appliances and Canon are mulling price increases after Diwali to protect their margins.         
	For the industry, the festive season has been disappointing as it expected the disbursements of arrears under the Sixth Pay Commission to fuel demand.        
	The liquidity crunch on account of the global financial crisis has made consumer loans dearer leading to dampened consumer sentiment.        
	Besides, the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has increased production costs.         
	Spooked by the crisis, foreign institutional investors have been pulling out dollars from India which has led to the fall in the value of the rupee.        
	The depreciating rupee has a negative impact on traded products and is putting tremendous pressure on the bottom line. We are trying to absorb the impact as much as possible through sourcing efficiency. However, some of the burden will have to be passed on to consumers, George Menzes, chief operating officer of Godrej Appliances, said.        
	Durables firms import inputs such as pre-coated sheets, plastics and chemicals as well as custom-built units such as LCD and plasma televisions. The depreciation of the rupee has increased their prices.        
	Korean major LG Electronics India Limited said declining margins would force it to increase prices of its imported products.        
	After Diwali, we will be studying our sales and profit structure and other cost factors. There are chances that we might increase the prices of some of our products by three per cent to five per cent, said Moon B. Shin, managing director, LG Electronics India.        
	He said the prices of some of LGs imported products such as high-end LCD televisions, refrigerators and washing machines might go up. Though we also have our manufacturing facilities in the country, we still import a lot of the material and component from other countries, he said.         
	Haier Appliances chief operating officer and director Pranay Dhabhai had views similar to Moon B. Shin. Dollar appreciation brings an increase in the prices of high-end products. Since companies have stocks in the pipeline, the resultant effect doesnt immediately count. Post-Diwali, theres a possibility that we will hike prices by at least five per cent, Dhabhai said.        
	Digital copiers and printer leader Canon India said the company was already feeling the heat of the rising dollar. Alok Bhardwaj, senior vice-president of Canon India, said, The rupee-dollar exchange rate was fixed at Rs 43, but now the dollar has risen to Rs 48 against the rupee, forcing us to go for a price hike of 5-10 per cent. However, we will announce the increase in price after the Diwali shopping season.

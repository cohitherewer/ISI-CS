          A STAFF REPORTER                          FRESH BREW                                  
	Calcutta, July 9: Tea exports from January to May rose to 66 million kg from 62.6 million kg last year, buoyed by a shortfall in Kenya.        
	Export revenue from January to May last year stood at Rs 597.01 crore, while this year it was Rs 651.02 crore.        
	We are experiencing increased demand in all our export markets for good quality Indian tea. Be it Unilever, Twinings or any other major international tea buyer, everyone wants good quality Indian tea. The prices have also gone off to a good start and it looks to be a good year for export, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director, McLeod Russel India Ltd, the largest producer in the world. McLeod exports 27 million kg of its production of 75 million kg.        
	According to figures released by the Indian Tea Association, north Indian exports fetched higher prices at Rs 112.78 per kg from Rs 116.62 per kg last year.        
	The resolution of the payment problem in Iraq, improved demand from Egypt and Pakistan coupled with a depressed Kenyan market signify a good year for exports.        
	Between January and May, production was up by 13 million kg to 240.2 million kg from 226.4 million kg.        
	During the same period, the Kenyan crop went down by 36.9 million kg to 134.6 million kg from 171.5 million kg.        
	The Calcutta export auction fetched an average price of $2.08 per kg compared with $1.67 per kg last year.        
	The prices at Kenyan auction in Mombasa till May were slightly higher at $2.32 per kg compared with $1.71 per kg in the same period last year.        
	However Sri Lanka, which mainly produces and exports orthodox varieties, commanded much higher prices at $3 per kg, up from $2.29 per kg.        
	India is also looking at increasing its basket of orthodox production from 80 million kg to 120 million kg in the next few years.        
	Domestic auction prices also looked up, especially in Calcutta, though the amount routed through auctions went down from 38.5 million kg to 34.4 million kg.        
	The prices of north Indian tea were higher by almost Rs 10 till May at Rs 77.6 per kg compared with Rs 67.48 per kg.        
	For south India, tea routed through auctions rose to 60.7 million kg from 49.9 million kg, while prices were higher by Rs 2.84 per kg.

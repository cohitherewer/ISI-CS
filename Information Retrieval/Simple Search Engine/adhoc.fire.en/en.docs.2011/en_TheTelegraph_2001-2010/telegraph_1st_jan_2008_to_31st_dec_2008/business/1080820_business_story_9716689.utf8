          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: The dispute between GSM service providers and Reliance Communications over interconnectivity is heading to the telecom tribunal.        
	Existing GSM players, through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), is planning to approach the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal against a directive by the telecom regulator to give connectivity to the new GSM network of Reliance Communications (R-Com).        
	We are certainly examining legal options and will file a petition with the telecom tribunal soon, officials of the Coai said.         
	GSM players are arguing that R-Com needs to enter into a separate interconnect contract with them for its GSM foray. R-Com, however, maintains that there is no need for a separate agreement since its GSM service is under a dual technology licence that permits firms to offer both GSM and CDMA services.         
	An interconnection agreement among operators permits subscribers of one operator to call subscribers of another operator.        
	The existing agreement applies only to the interconnection between GSM networks and R-Coms CDMA network. There is a material change in the licence conditions, as the GSM network roll-out is a new aspect. Hence, the interconnection agreement has to be renegotiated, said T. V. Ramachandran, director- general of the COAI.         
	According to the COAI, R-Com has to be treated on a par with the other new entrants.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had last week directed existing GSM operators, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Essar, to provide interconnection to R-Coms GSM mobile phone services within seven days ending August 21. It warned of legal action for possible contravention of the direction.

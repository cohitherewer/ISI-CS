          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Mumbai, July 13: Industrial growth has slowed to 3.8 per cent in May and the bruising effects of the slowdown will be felt on corporate balance sheets in the first quarter that ended June 30.         
	Last week, Infosys had kicked off the earnings season with a 21 per cent surge in net profit but then spooked the investors with a benign guidance for the second quarter (July-September).         
	But analysts are predicting a stream of poor profit numbers from India Inc and badly crimped margins. Several sectors have had to wrestle with soaring input costs and havent been able to pass on the burden to their customers. Cement makers, capital goods units and non-integrated steel players are expected to see squeezed margins.         
	The capital goods sector has underperformed vis--vis the broader market and this has sparked worries that companies in this sector may not be able to execute their huge order books. Companies such as Bhel and Larsen amp; Toubro have also seen input prices inching up and there are concerns whether they have a price variation clause built into their contracts.         
	On the other hand, volume growth in the cement sector has been subdued because of the early arrival of the monsoon and other reasons. Several companies have been unable to pass on higher raw material costs to consumers because of government intervention.         
	However, these industries will not be the only ones to report disappointing first quarter numbers. The automobile and banking sectors are also expected to be hit by high interest rates. In the case of auto manufacturers, rising interest rates have depressed sales even as high input costs have pared their margins.         
	On the other hand, many banks are likely to report poor numbers because of lower non-interest income, largely because of falling treasury incomes. The only sectors that are expected to report modest to better numbers include the pharmaceuticals, telecom and FMCG sectors.         
	Analysts feel that the oil and gas companies will see a mixed set of results with private sector refiners such as Reliance Industries reporting strong gross refining margins.         
	Given such an outlook, analysts are warning that investors should be prepared for more reverses in stock values. However, opinions differ.         
	Angel Broking which expects the sensex companies to deliver a 16.6 per cent compounded annual growth rate in net profit over 2008-10, lower than its previous estimates of 21.1 per cent, say that at the current valuations, markets have already discounted worries over rising inflation, high crude oil and interest rates.

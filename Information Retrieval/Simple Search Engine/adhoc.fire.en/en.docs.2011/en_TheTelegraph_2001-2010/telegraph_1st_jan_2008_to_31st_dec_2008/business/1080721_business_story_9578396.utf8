The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | After MTN, battle lines drawn over gas
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       After MTN, battle lines drawn over gas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani                                
	Mumbai, July 20: Mukesh and Anil Ambani are set to lock horns again over a gas supply arrangement, while their feud over South African telecom firm MTN lingers.         
	The tiff over gas, running for more than a year, is between Mukeshs Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and the younger Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) over the supply of natural gas from RILs fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin to RNRL.        
	On Tuesday, a division bench of Bombay High Court will hear a dispute over the implementation of a gas supply agreement between the two entities.         
	After the split in the Reliance group, following the death of patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani, a gas sales purchase agreement was signed, which specified that RIL would sell gas to RNRL and public sector NTPC at the same rate.        
	It specified that the Anil Ambani group would lift gas generated from the Krishna-Godavari fields at $2.34 per mmbtu (million metric British thermal unit).         
	According to the Anil Ambani group, RNRL is entitled to 28 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metres per day) of gas. It can also get an additional 12 mmscmd of gas, if RILs contract with NTPC does not proceed. The group has also claimed that it is entitled to a certain portion of gas from RILs other fields.         
	Complications arose when the petroleum and natural gas ministry objected to the price of $2.34 per mmbtu, stating that the government stood to lose revenue of over Rs 20,000 crore if gas is sold to RNRL at this price. Later, the Centre came out with a gas pricing of $4.20 per mmbtu for the Krishna-Godavari gas.         
	RNRL, in 2006, moved Bombay High Court against RIL over the execution of the gas agreement.        
	The court directed RIL not to enter into contracts to sell the gas to companies other than RNRL and NTPC, while telling the brothers to settle the dispute. However, they failed to reach an agreement within the stipulated time.         
	The stakes are high for both the brothers. For RNRL, the gas will be a feedstock for the groups massive plans in power generation. On the other hand, RIL wants court approval for entering into contracts with third parties for the sale of gas, as production is expected to commence shortly from Reliances D-6 field in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	RILs counsel Harish Salve had also argued before the court that if gas was to be sold to RNRL at $2.34 per mmbtu, the company would lose $ 8 billion.         
	Officials from both the groups, however, refrained from making any comments as the matter is sub-judice.        
	A further twist was given last month when an empowered group of ministers outlined the utilisation mechanism for gas flowing from Reliances D-6 field.         
	The empowered group asked Reliance Industries to supply gas first to fertiliser units and then to LPG plants. Existing power plants and city gas distribution units will be the last to get the Reliance gas.         
	This has limited Anils options. All gas produced from areas awarded under Nelp would have to sell the fuel in accordance with the marketing priorities determined by the government, the empowered group had said.

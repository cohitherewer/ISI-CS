	Mumbai, Jan. 22: Hyderabad-based Satyam Computer Services Ltd plans to list its American depository shares on the Euronext, which is in Amsterdam. This will make Satyam the first Indian company to be listed on the Euronext.
    
	About 20 per cent of the companys revenues come from Europe. We are not listing to expand our capital, but to provide us an access to the European markets, Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said here today. 
    
	Listing on the Euronext will provide many benefits to the exchanges customers and to Satyams investors. 
    
	In addition to making investing in Satyam easier, it will enable extended trading  investors can purchase stocks on the Euronext and sell it on the New York Stock Exchange the same day.
    
	On the potential impact of the US slowdown on the companys revenues, Raju said, Our customers continue to access our services extensively as in the past. However, we are trying to get a better understanding of the slowdown in the US. 
    
	V. Srinivas, chief financial officer of the company, said there had been no effect of the recession and the companys contract prices were up almost 2 per cent.
    
	The company is set to acquire the US-based consulting firm, Bridge Strategy Group, for $35 million in an all-cash deal. Satyam Computer registered growth of 32.17 per cent in services revenue and 28.59 per cent in profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2007.

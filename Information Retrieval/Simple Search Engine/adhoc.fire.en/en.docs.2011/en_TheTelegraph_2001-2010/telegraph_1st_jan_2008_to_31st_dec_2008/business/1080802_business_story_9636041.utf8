          A STAFF REPORTER                          DSouza: Cautious                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Cognizant Technology Solutions has cut its revenue growth outlook for the full year to 32 per cent from 38 per cent because of economic slowdown.         
	The revised revenue guidance for the full year now stands at $2.81 billion. For the third quarter, Cognizant has pruned its revenue expectation to $723 million.        
	However, the IT firms revenues for the second quarter increased to $685.4 million, up 6.6 per cent sequentially from $643.1 million in the first quarter of 2008.         
	Cognizant CEO Francisco DSouza said, Due to the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and sagging consumer and business confidence we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year.        
	However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects given that our pipeline of large deals remains healthy, our market position remains strong and the trend towards increasing offshore spending continues, he added.        
	The company, which has a considerable presence in India, has reported a 26 per cent increase in net profit at $103.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared with $82.3 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Operating margin was 17.5 per cent excluding stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million.        
	Cognizant has grown its European business by 83 per cent year-on-year, which at present comprises 20 per cent of its revenues, while the US contributes a little over 78 per cent. The company employs 59,300 people  up 1,300 from March 31 this year.         
	The main areas of growth for the company have been IT infrastructure services, business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing.

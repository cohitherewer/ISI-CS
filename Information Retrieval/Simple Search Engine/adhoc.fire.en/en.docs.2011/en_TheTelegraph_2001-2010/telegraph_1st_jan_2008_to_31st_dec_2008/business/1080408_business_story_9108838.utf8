          A STAFF REPORTER                                        Malay Mukherjee      
	Calcutta, April 7: Malay Mukherjee, a key aide of Indian billionaire steel maker Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, is set to join the board of directors of ArcelorMittal, the largest steel company of the world.        
	Mukherjee, who hails from Asansol in Bengal, is on the group management board of the company.         
	He looks after the businesses in Asia, Africa, the CIS countries and divisions such as mining, stainless and pipes and tubes.        
	I am delighted with such an honour, Mukherjee told The Telegraph from his office in London.        
	Mukherjee, who joined the Mittals in 1993, leaving a plum job in public sector behemoth Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), will join the board as a non-executive member.        
	His name would be proposed for the post at the annual general meeting of ArcelorMittal on May 13  the day he retires from the group management board, the executive board which is entrusted with the day-to-day activities of the company.        
	He has been an exceptional colleague over the years, someone with deep operational experience, impeccable judgement and great professional integrity, L.N. Mittal said in a statement.         
	His counsel has been invaluable and he has played a very considerable role in helping ArcelorMittal become the leading steel company that it is today. On behalf of all my colleagues who have worked extensively with Malay, we are very sorry to see him go, Mittal added.         
	However, I am very pleased that our collaboration will continue on the board of directors, where I have no doubt Malays views will be invaluable in the companys next stage of development, he said.         
	When asked what had prompted him to join the then Ispat International, Mukherjee said: It was a challenging job offered to me (to run Mittals early acquisition in Mexico). I took it. I was also impressed and inspired by the vision of L.N. Mittal. At SAIL, Mukherjee was executive director (works) of Bhilai Steel Plant.         
	A bachelor of science from IIT Kharagpur, Mukherjee joined Ispat International when it had a capacity of 1.3 million tonnes.        
	In 2001, he was appointed chief operating officer, first of Ispat International and subsequently of Mittal Steel Company, which became the worlds largest steel company following the merger among Ispat International, LNM Holdings and International Steel Group.        
	Mukherjees appointment to the board of directors comes at a time when ArcelorMittal is embarking on two of its most ambitious projects till date in India.        
	He was personally involved with the Jharkhand and Orissa greenfield plants, which will have a capacity of 12 million tonnes each.        
	Going forward, I hope to be involved directly in the development of projects in India, he said.

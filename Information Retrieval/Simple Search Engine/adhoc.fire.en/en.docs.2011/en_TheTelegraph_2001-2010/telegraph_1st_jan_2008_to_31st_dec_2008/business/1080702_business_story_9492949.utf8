	Calcutta, July 1: The life insurance joint venture floated by the Bank of Baroda (BoB), Andhra Bank and the UK-based Legal amp; General will start operations in the first quarter of 2009-10.        
	We expect to get the licence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority early next year and the joint venture will underwrite its first policy sometime in the April-June period in 2009, BoB chairman and managing director M.D. Mallya said at a banking conclave here today.         
	The BoB holds a 40 per cent stake in the life insurance joint venture with Legal amp; General owning 26 per cent and Andhra Bank, 34 per cent.         
	The BoB is in the process of reviving its non-banking businesses such as credit cards and mutual funds. We have appointed a consultant for BoB Cards and on the basis of its report well take a call on whether we should sell off or invite a strategic partner into the subsidiary, Mallya said. However, he didnt disclose when the consultant will submit its report.         
	Last year, the public sector bank had sold a 51 per cent stake in its asset management subsidiary BoB Mutual Funds to Italy-based Pioneer Investments.         
	BoB Pioneer Mutual Fund will commence operations from this month, Mallya said.

	New Delhi, June 9: State-owned Oil India Limited plans to come out with an initial public offering (IPO) around August-September.        
	Sources said the board meeting of the company, held today, decided to go ahead with the IPO despite the bear run in the market and the spike in global crude oil prices. Oil India plans to dilute an 11 per cent stake through the flotation. According to sources, 10 per cent of the stake was meant for the public and another 1 per cent will be divested to employees.        
	The IPO comprises a net issue of up to 24,045,438 equity shares for the public, while 2,404,544 shares will be reserved for subscription for eligible employees.        
	The company expects to mop up at least Rs 1,500 crore through the offering and has got the necessary approval from the government.        
	JM Financial Consultants, Morgan Stanley India Company, Citigroup Global Markets and HSBC Securities and Capital Markets are the lead managers to the issue.         
	The government owns about 98 per cent equity in unlisted Oil India. The proceeds from the IPO will be used for the companys exploration and production activities for the next five years. Oil India plans to invest Rs 15,000 crore in the next five years in oil and gas exploration and production and another Rs 2,000 crore in its downstream foray into refining.

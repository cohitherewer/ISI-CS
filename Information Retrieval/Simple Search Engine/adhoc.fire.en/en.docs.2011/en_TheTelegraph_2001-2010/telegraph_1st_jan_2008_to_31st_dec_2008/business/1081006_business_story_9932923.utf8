                                I repaid my lender bank this year the outstanding principal of a house loan worth over Rs 3 lakh and settled the account. Can I claim a deduction of Rs 1 lakh out of this Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act? I am a woman pensioner below 65 years of age?          Mandira Dasgupta, Calcutta
                    You can claim deduction of Rs 1 lakh out of the principal repayment under Section 80C. The overall limit of deduction under Section 80C is Rs 1 lakh. So, you cannot claim deduction in other avenues allowed under the section.                                  Form fix      What is the difference between Form 15G and Form 15H regarding non-deduction of TDS on bank fixed deposits?         Dhiman Mitra, Katwa
                    Both 15G and 15H are self-declaration forms for non-deduction of tax at source. While Form 15G is meant for resident individuals below 65 years, 15H should be used by senior citizens who are 65 years or above during the financial year. One cannot file Form 15G if ones total income from dividend or interest other than securities or withdrawal or surrender value of pension plan of insurance for which deduction u/s 80CCA was availed exceeds Rs 1 lakh. If the tax liability on estimated total income, including those for which Form 15G is submitted, is not nil, Form 15G cannot be submitted.                                  Tax count      I am above 70 years. In 2008-09, my annual income will be Rs 1,30,000 from pension, Rs 12,000 from interest on post office monthly income scheme, Rs 49,000 from interest on bank deposits, Rs 43,000 from interest on Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (the investment was made before April 1, 2008). Am I entitled to get tax benefit in the SCSS? Will I have to file tax return? What will be my tax liability?        Sunil Kr Sarkar, Sonarpur
                    Your total income in 2008-09 will be Rs 2,34,000. The basic exemption limit on annual income for senior citizens is Rs 2,25,000. Since you have invested in the SCSS before April, you cannot avail of the deduction under Section 80C. You will have to pay tax on the excess income. The tax rate will be 10.3 per cent, including educational cess. You will have to pay Rs 927 as income tax for the current financial year.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: Two-wheeler manufacturers have gone into a deep skid  but they are hoping they will pull out of the rut in 2008.
    
	Sales have plummeted over the past 10 months  and they have to gear up to face a new threat next week when the Tatas rip the five-year veil of secrecy on the Rs 1-lakh car at the Auto Expo in Delhi.
    
	Sales of two-wheelers have been hurt as banks have started to tighten credit on vehicle loans amid uncertainty over interest rates.
    
	Leading two-wheeler manufacturers such as Bajaj Auto Ltd have in recent times been focusing more on high-end bikes. Although analysts say that the ratio between economy and high-end motorcycles continue to be tilted towards the former in the ratio of 60:40, they feel that the Rs 1-lakh car has the potential of denting sales of the premium bikes.
    
	All three two wheeler companies  Bajaj Auto, TVS and Hero Honda  have gone through a harrowing time this fiscal. The December sales figures capped the depressing story: sales of TVS Motors fell for the tenth consecutive month to 97,576 units, lower by 5.4 per cent a year ago, while unit sales at Bajaj Auto sank 7 per cent to 199,470 units during the month. Overall, motorcycle sales dropped by 6 per cent to 176,441 units from 187,063.
    
	At this point of time we are maintaining our negative view on the industry, says Archit Kumar, auto analyst at Religare Research. Kumar, who is circumspect about the industrys prospects in the coming months, added that though new launches will lead to some improvement in sales numbers during the current quarter, how the industry will fare thereafter will depend on how interest rates behave.
    
	He said the Rs 1-lakh car could pose a threat to high-end motorcycles, provided it retails at this price tag. Its not this car alone that the sector will have to contend with towards the second half of this year.
    
	An auto expert said the two-wheeler industry would have to lure the customer back to their showrooms. They have been launching various models, but most of them have been variants. There has been no major innovative launch as such, he added.
    
	The importance of interest rates or bank finance on the segment cannot be missed as nearly 80 per cent of the two-wheeler sales are financed by banks. 
    
	Analysts say that on paper, interest rates offered by banks are a little over 15 per cent, but the effective rate can go to as high as 20 per cent. 
    
	Even if interest rates go up by 100 basis points, the equated monthly instalments rise by roughly Rs 150. The bigger problem is that banks are simply not giving two-wheeler loans, fearing that it may lead to a rise in delinquencies, sources said.
    
	With inflation remaining low at just over 3 per cent, the Reserve Bank of India could trim interest rates. The industry is hoping that it does since its fortunes seem to depend very crucially on this factor.
    
	We believe that concerns on interest rates and further monetary tightening are easing. This will increase the flow of funds to provide two-wheeler loans. Lower delinquency risks would prompt banks to consider reducing financing rates, brokerage Motilal Oswal has said in a report.

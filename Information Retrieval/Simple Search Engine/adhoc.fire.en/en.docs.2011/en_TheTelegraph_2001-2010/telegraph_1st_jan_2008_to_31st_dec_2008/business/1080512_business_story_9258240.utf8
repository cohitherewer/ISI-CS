The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt softens stand on rice export
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt softens stand on rice export
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Rich harvest                                  
	New Delhi, May 11: The Congress-led government may partially lift the ban on rice export.         
	Top officials said a rethink on the ban on non-basmati rice export was a possibility following successful procurement of wheat by state-run agencies.         
	Led by the Food Corporation of India, the agencies bought 18 million tonnes (mt) of wheat, 62 per cent more than last year, aided by measures that prevented large private firms from buying or stocking the grain. They also procured 23 mt of rice.        
	Policy-makers said consumers had started substituting rice with wheat and vice-versa in most parts of the country and hence, control measures took into account the total wheat and rice supplies in the country.         
	An easing of the ban (on non-basmati rice export) will help the importing countries of Africa and Asia such as Bangladesh, Myanmar and Cameroon, to reduce prices, said the officials.         
	According to them, export, when allowed, will be subject to a floor price as well as a quota. Not more than 2-3 mt of the 94-95mt non-basmati rice produced in farm year 2007-08 (July-June) will be exported.         
	The government had earlier banned the export of non-basmati rice after its price touched Rs 1,500 a tonne, 30 per cent more than last year. Earlier we were not sure of the wheat crop. Now with the crop coming out to be normal and the procurement being good, thanks to the exclusion of big private players such as Cargil from the market, India can afford to relax its export ban a little, the officials said.         
	Punjab and Haryana, which together produce around 40 per cent of the total wheat output, sold nearly 15mt of wheat to the government. State-run agencies buy wheat and rice as a buffer against inflation and natural calamities as well as for nationwide distribution through ration shops.         
	Though the government bought wheat at a rate that is about a third of the global price, at Rs 1,000 a quintal, farmers had little choice as private players were barred from buying and stocking in large quantities.        
	The agriculture ministry says India will produce a record 76.78 mt of wheat this year compared with the previous high of 76.37 mt in 2000. Experts consider this figure as inflated. They, however, agree that with strong administrative measures, the country may manage to control prices. The officials said the government should have 21mt of wheat stocks by July 1.         
	Notwithstanding encouraging procurement, the officials said the current comfort levels were merely a feeling.         
	We have to address the fact that the demand for foodgrains is growing as our population and income levels keep going up every year. The only long-term solution is to grow more food.         
	Earlier, in a presentation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, experts and planners had talked of reversing the negative trend in foodgrains production by focusing on the eastern part of the country  Bihar, eastern UP, Orissa, Assam and Chhattisgarh.         
	According to some senior policy-makers, With yields plateauing off in the north Indian states, where we initiated the first Green Revolution in the 1960s, farmers in these states have started moving on to other crops. We need to address this by focusing on the states in the east, which are rich in water resources and can easily be the launching pad for a second green revolution.         
	Foodgrain production has been falling consistently since 1996 as farmers in the major wheat-growing regions of Punjab, western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been shifting to other crops.

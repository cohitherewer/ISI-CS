The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre sees easy mine rule
                                                                                                            Centre sees easy mine rule
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Simple solution                                  
	New Delhi , Jan. 27: The Centre feels it may not need to negotiate with states on giving priorities in mine leases to firms that pledge to process minerals in states where they get leases.         
	These issues are part of the national mineral policy, which the Centre is finalising.        
	State chief ministers had urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to make significant changes in the policy, including the insertion of clauses on the processing of minerals.        
	However, central government officials say states such as Jharkhand have started giving out leases without making it mandatory to process the mineral within their boundaries.        
	Several companies, including Jindal Power, Core Minerals, Bhushan Steel and Horizon, have recently been recommended licences without the mandatory provisions.         
	Some of these states had such clauses in earlier mining leases but did not have them now, the officials said.         
	Since the states are not insisting on them (the provisions), we can safely decide on a policy which allows market forces to determine the setting up of steel plants, the officials said.         
	 The mineral policy and its fiscal implications are being finalised now. Some of the implications may get reflected in the coming Union budget.         
	 States had earlier said they wanted to link licences with steel or iron plants within their boundaries.         
	This was the only way they could force industry to create jobs. Besides, the states earn little from royalties, leaving processing units as the sole option for development.        
	Officials said one reason for not inserting clauses could be the possible revision of royalty norms.        
	To increase collections, the Centre is planning to charge royalty on an ad-valorem basis against the current practice of levying low specific rates.         
	An ad-valorem royalty of 7.5 per cent is likely to be charged on iron ore, which may increase earnings of states such as Orissa and Karnataka four- to six-fold from this mineral alone. A specific duty is a fixed sum assessed on an article without a reference to its market value.         
	An ad-valorem tax, on the other hand, is determined according to the cost or market value of the article.        
	Royalty on iron ore currently varies from Rs 11 a tonne to Rs 27 a tonne depending on composition of the ore.         
	ArcelorMittal move        
	The worlds largest steel maker, Arcelor-Mittal, has chosen Torpa and Kamdara blocks in Khunti and Gumla districts of Jharkhand as the sites for its proposed greenfield steel project of 12 million tonnes capacity in the state, reports PTI.        
	Now that they have selected sites, they might go for acquisition of land on their own or can approach the state government, Jharkhand industry secretary K.K. Khandelwal said.

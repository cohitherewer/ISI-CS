   Talking Point : Budget 2008-09
                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: With elections to 11 states this year and a general election due next year, the Congress-led government is likely to pull out all the stops on spending in this years budget.
    
	Among the proposals under discussion are a big write-off package in farm loans, wage hikes for central government employees from next year, a package of sops for the weaker sections, insurance schemes for unorganised sector workers and a higher outlay for social sectors and infrastructure. 
    
	Top finance ministry sources said alternative packages were being prepared for the write-off of farm loans that could cost anywhere between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 60,000 crore. 
    
	The government is planning a waiver of up to 80 per cent of the loans of small and marginal farmers who have less than 5 acres. Larger farmers could have waivers of up to a quarter of their loans. Officials said the final shape of the package would depend on the waiver formula of the government for farmers who have between 5 acres and 10 acres and for those with 10 acres and 15 acres.
    
	This is a political issue and will be decided by the cabinet, the officials said. More than 17,000 farmers had committed suicide last year, with Maharashtras cotton belt and Andhra Pradeshs peanut regions being the worst hit. 
    
	However, the officials admitted that the sop would not touch those grappling with loans from moneylenders. 
    
	Wage plan
    
	They said the Centre would be budgeting for a 25-30 per cent hike in the salaries and wages of its employees from the next calendar year. 
    
	The report of the Sixth Pay Commission on this is expected later this year. Annually, the central governments wage bill for its 3 million staff is estimated to go up by Rs 20,000-24,000 crore. 
    
	Since the increase, if it happens, will be from January 1, the actual hike for the next fiscal will be a third, or about Rs 6,000-8,000 crore.
    
	The finance ministry will also be making provisions for pensions to unorganised sector employees. 
    
	Under the proposal, the state and the employees would contribute to a scheme that would guarantee a monthly pension of Rs 200 for people above 65 years and living below the poverty line. Provisions will be made for a health insurance scheme announced last year covering 1.2 crore families of unorganised sector workers. Among the clutch of schemes for the unorganised sector workers is one that will offer a death or a disability benefit of up to Rs 30,000 to those with below-the-poverty-line status.
    
	Sops for SCs
    
	For the Scheduled Castes, which are a 14-crore-strong vote bank, the government is planning model villages with better housing, drinking water and boarding school facilities, besides entrepreneurial loans. 
    
	We will tie up with the Bharat Nirman programme as well as with several centrally sponsored schemes such as the Indira Awas Yojana, the slum improvement scheme and the drinking water mission, the officials said. 
    
	The funds will be concentrated on the villages where the Scheduled Castes are a majority. Some Rs 4,500 crore will be spent on housing alone, the officials added. There are also plans for 136 special Navodaya Vidyalayas, with reservations for Scheduled Caste students. These schools will cost about Rs 2,000 crore.
    
	These Navodaya Vidyalayas are boarding schools that provide quality education to rural students. 
    
	Growth of rural infrastructure is also a priority. More money will be allocated to the rural jobs scheme, the chosen vehicle for ramping up rural infrastructure.

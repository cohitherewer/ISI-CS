          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             GROWTH MODE          
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: Sherwin- Williams Company Ltd, one of the largest paint companies in the US, is looking at consolidating its position in India.         
	The company plans to distribute ancillary products through retail stores.         
	In 2007, Sherwin acquired Mumbai-based Nitco Paints for an undisclosed sum.         
	Nitco is a manufacturer and seller of exterior paints and coatings used in offices, high-rise apartments, malls and hospitals.         
	Founded in 1866, Sherwin sells coatings and related products under brand names such as Sherwin-Williams, Dutch Boy, Krylon and Minwax.         
	Initially, Sherwin used to import its products and now has a manufacturing facility at Taloja in Maharashtra. Recently, it approached the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for marketing ancillary products.         
	The board gave a go ahead to the proposal on the condition of Sherwin setting up production facilities along with test marketing.         
	It also stipulated that the manufacturing would be done by its Indian subsidiary and not a third party.         
	The company has been permitted to do test marketing for two years         
	Sherwin is not the only overseas company vying for a share of Indias paint market, dominated by Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac and ICI.         
	Norwegian paint company Jotun Paints, which opened its first unit in April this year in Pune at an investment of over Rs 100 crore, plans to set up another unit in north India.         
	According to reports, it intends to strengthen its retail network in the country. The size of the domestic paint industry is estimated at around Rs 14,000 crore. More than 60 per cent of the industry comprise organised players.         
	Nippon Paint of Japan is already present in the country. Its product range includes automotive, decorative, industrial, marine and road-marking paints.         
	The company has drawn up an investment plan of over Rs 400 crore for expanding its operations over the next two years.

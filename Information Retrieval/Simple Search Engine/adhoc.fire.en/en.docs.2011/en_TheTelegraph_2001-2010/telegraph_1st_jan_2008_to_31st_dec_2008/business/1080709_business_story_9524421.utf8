	Mumbai, July 8 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India today asked banks to follow the rules laid down by it for granting loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).        
	According to the RBI guidelines, banks should not insist on collateral security from SMEs for advances up to Rs 5 lakh but only take into account the viability of their projects, the apex banks deputy governor Usha Thorat said at a seminar organised by the Indian Banks Association here today.        
	However, some banks were not adhering to the guidelines and were asking for collateral, she said, adding that in many cases banks had not even analysed their SME portfolios properly.        
	For SME loans up to Rs 5 lakh, banks are not supposed to ask for collateral security...(but) a few banks are insisting on that... Very few banks have analysed their own SME portfolios, Thorat said.        
	SMEs account for nearly 39 per cent of the countrys manufacturing output and more than 34 per cent of exports, according to directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics data for 2007.        
	The RBI had last year asked leading banks such as the State Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Canara Bank and Indian Bank to conduct a survey in certain districts to ensure whether banks were complying with its norms.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 28: HDFC Bank today reported a 44.55 per cent growth rate in net profit for the first quarter ended June 30.         
	On a consolidated basis, the private sector bank posted a profit of Rs 464.35 crore in the reporting period against Rs 321.23 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	The quarterly results reflected the performance of the entity formed after the merger of the Centurion Bank of Punjab with HDFC Bank on May 23.         
	The results for the same period last year were on a standalone basis. HDFC Bank, therefore, said that the results were not comparable.        
	According to the bank, total income during the quarter grew nearly 60 per cent to Rs 4,215.2 crore against Rs 2,641.7 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.         
	Net revenues increased 48.7 per cent to Rs 2,3169 crore from Rs 1,558.1 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The banks net interest income, which represents its performance in core operations, increased 74.9 per cent to Rs 1,723.5 crore, driven by average asset growth of 68 per cent and a net interest margin of just over 4.1 per cent.        
	Fees and commissions were the main contributor to other income for the period under review and this increased 37 per cent to Rs 511.2 crore.

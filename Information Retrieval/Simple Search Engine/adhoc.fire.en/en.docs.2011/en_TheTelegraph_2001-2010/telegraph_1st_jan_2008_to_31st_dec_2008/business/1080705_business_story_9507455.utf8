          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 4: The government today cleared 28 foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals totalling Rs 1,327.7 crore, including 51 per cent FDI of Marks amp; Spencer (M amp;S) for single-brand retail business.         
	British retailer M amp;S has been permitted to bring in 51 per cent FDI for single-brand retail operations, the finance ministry said in a statement issued today. The retail major has joined hands with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail and plans to open up to 50 stores in the country over the next five years.         
	The new stores will add to the 14 existing franchise stores operated by M amp;S in the country, the company said while announcing its annual results earlier in London.        
	In another case, Parryware Roca, a joint venture (JV) between EID Parry and Spains Roca, was permitted to increase foreign holdings to 100 per cent from 50 per cent with an investment of Rs 741.48 crore.        
	In April, EID Parry, a Murugappa group company said it had decided to sell its stake in Parryware Roca JV to its partner, Roca of Spain.        
	The board of EID Parry had decided to sell the 47 per cent stake it holds in the JV. Parry will, however, retain the balance 3 per cent share. Roca acquired the 50 per cent stake in Parryware in 2006 for a sum of Rs 275 crore. For Roca, the deal will ensure its strategy to stay ahead of competitors in the bathroom products market.        
	New Delhi-based Eldeco Infrastructure and Properties was given the green signal to induct foreign equity worth Rs 195.67 crore by way of subscription and acquisition of equity shares.         
	The firm will transform into an operating cum holding company from an operating company.         
	Based on the recommendations of the foreign investment promotion board in its meeting held on June 24, 2008, finance minister P. Chidambaram has approved 28 FDI proposals, while 11 proposals including those of Interglobe Enterprises, Asia Motorworks and Russell Square were deferred.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RIL banks on refining margin
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukesh Ambani: Confident                                  
	Mumbai, April 20: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to report robust fourth quarter profits tomorrow, buoyed by its refining operations.        
	Analysts are betting that RILs gross refining margins (GRMs) will expand to $14 a barrel from $13 per barrel a year ago. If that hope is realised, RILs net profits can surge 25 to 30 per cent during the three-month period ended March 31.        
	The gross refining margin, which is the difference between the value of petroleum products produced and the price of crude oil, has buoyed the financial performance of RIL in the last few quarters.         
	Singapore standard        
	Reliances GRMs have been higher than the Singapore refining margin, which is seen as the regional benchmark. Although the Singapore refining margin was flat at nearly $7 per barrel during the March quarter, RIL is expected to outperform the benchmark by a huge margin because of its ability to process different kinds of crude.        
	At a time when the GRMs of other Indian companies are estimated to be anywhere between $7 per barrel and $10 per barrel, analysts predict that the GRMs at RIL will top $14 a barrel. In a recent report, Angel Broking estimated that GRMs at RIL would be strong at about $15 per barrel.         
	During the third quarter ended December 31, 2007, refining revenues at RIL grew to Rs 26,154 crore from Rs 20,870 crore and GRMs were strong at $15.4 per barrel. RIL is expected to post a net profit of around Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 3,700 crore during the fourth quarter, representing a growth rate of almost 30 per cent. Its turnover is likely to be around Rs 33,000 crore.         
	Strong demand        
	Analysts reckon that oil refiners will continue to perform well because the demand for petro-products remains strong.        
	A major development during the January-March quarter was the surge in global crude prices, which crossed $100 a barrel in the first week of January. Since then, global crude oil prices have remained firm and recently topped $115 a barrel.         
	There are no signs of a retreat in crude prices. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) is due to meet only in September. We dont expect any surprises from Opec till then. Hence, oil prices will continue to remain high, said Rohit Nagraj, an analyst at Angel Broking.         
	There is, however, some concern over the petrochemical business. The third quarter (October-December 2007) had seen lower sales, and margins were also crimped by the high naphtha prices. Not much has changed in the fourth quarter. High naphtha prices will depress margins of paraxylene and purified terephthalic once again.         
	While feedstock prices remain high, volumes could also be low. This could impact the overall margins of the company, said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.

	New Delhi, Nov. 24 (PTI): P. Chidambaram today cautioned against the use of the word recession for the Indian economy. He said the countrys growth would moderate in this difficult year but would still be the second fastest in the world at the rate of 7-8 per cent.        
	A recession is defined as two successive quarters of contraction of GDP. I wish to emphasise that India is nowhere near a recession. We may expect a moderation in growth rate in the current year to a level between 7 and 8 per cent, he said.         
	Chidambaram said India would show high positive growth during the second quarter of this fiscal.                           
	data for which are slated to be released later this week.                          
	Indian economy grew by 9 per cent in 2007-08 and by 7.9 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal. He said the economy would rebound in the second half of 2009-10.        
	Reiterating that the industry should cut prices to deal with the slowdown, Chidambaram said, We have already given Rs 31,000 crore as post-Budget duty concessions. I am open to examining cases where fiscal support or concessions are required for any sector.

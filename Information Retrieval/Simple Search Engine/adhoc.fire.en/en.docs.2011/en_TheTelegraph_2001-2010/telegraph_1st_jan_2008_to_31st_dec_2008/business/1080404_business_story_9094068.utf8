          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 3: Market regulator Sebi today introduced a direct market access (DMA) facility for institutional investors. The facility will enable investors to get direct access to the exchange trading system through the brokers infrastructure but without any manual intervention.         
	At present, clients have to contact brokers to buy or sell orders and it is only after a manual intervention by the brokers that the order gets executed. The new facility will help traders get direct control over their orders. This will ensure faster execution, reduced errors, greater transparency, increased liquidity and lower transaction costs. The technology will also lead to better use of hedging and arbitrage opportunities through decision support tools and algorithms for trading.         
	The trading cycle of institutional clients gets delayed because of the time gap between the order call and the execution of the trade. With DMA, a separate terminal will be provided for the client, which will show the real time data of the market similar to what is accessible by the broker, a Sebi official said.         
	Interested brokers will have to apply with the stock exchanges giving details of the software system proposed to be used.

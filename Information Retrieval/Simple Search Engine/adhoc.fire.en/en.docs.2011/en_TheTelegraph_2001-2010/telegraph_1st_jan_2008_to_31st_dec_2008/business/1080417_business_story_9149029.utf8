          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Pawar: Fight time		    
	New Delhi, April 16: The government today said it could take a decision on banning futures trading in essential commodities within the next 10 days.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told the Lok Sabha that if the panel on futures trading did not submit its report within 10 days, the government would approach the Forward Markets Commission, which regulates futures trade, to take a decision on banning the trade in essential commodities.        
	Edible oils, sugar and potatoes are among the essential commodities that face a ban.        
	The Left parties have demanded a ban on futures trading in essential commodities blaming it for the price rise.         
	In the last budget, the government announced the setting up of the Abhijit Sen committee to assess the impact of futures trading on farm commodities. The committee is yet to submit its report.        
	Last year, trading was banned in wheat, rice, urad and tur, amid fears expressed by political parties that the prices of these commodities were going up due to futures contracts.        
	However, Forward Markets commission chairman B.C. Khatua had denied this.

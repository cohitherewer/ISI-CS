          A STAFF REPORTER                          Shah in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Engineering exporters are planning to expand further in Asean to make up for their losses in the West following the financial crisis.        
	Trade with the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) comprises around 30-33 per cent of engineering exports. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore are the main markets.        
	The focus on the Asean market, which is the single-largest trading bloc for our sector, comes at the right time. After the signing of the India-Asean free trade agreement, exports to Malaysia are expected to double in the next three to five years, said Rakesh Shah, chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC).         
	The Asean market is much easier to access than the European Union which has many non-tariff barriers, Shah said.        
	It takes 32 days to ship to the US markets compared with six to eight days for Asean. The US and Europe account for around 40 per cent of the engineering exports.        
	Domestic exporters, however, are not able to cash in on the stronger dollar because of the unstable rupee.         
	The government had asked us to get used to a stronger rupee through hedging. Most of us have entered into forward contracts at the rate of Rs 39-42 a dollar for the next six months. So, a stronger dollar will not impact us, Shah said.        
	We want a stable currency regime. For someone who has hedged $2 million, even a Re 1 loss in exchange rates will amount to a loss of Rs 20 lakh a day, he said.

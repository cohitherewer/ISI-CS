          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kohli in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Bharti Airtel today announced the launch of its direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television service to be available in 62 cities from Thursday.        
	This is a right time for Airtel to enter the market. The launch of the Airtel digital TV is the culmination of our three screens strategy, which is to be present across mobile phones, computers and TVs. We are sure that Airtel will take over as a leader in the sector, Airtel chief executive officer and managing director Manoj Kohli said.        
	We believe that the DTH segment in the country offers immense growth potential. With added benefits of Airtels strong brand equity and wide distribution network, we are well placed to emerge as a leading player in the segment, he said.        
	Airtel will be the third among telecom operators and the fourth, overall, to enter the DTH space. Dish TV, Tata Sky and Reliance Big TV are the other players.        
	Airtel digital TV uses the MPEG4 standard with DVB S2 technology, which translate into picture clarity and high quality audio experience. This technology also enables the delivery of more complex interactive content, Kohli said.

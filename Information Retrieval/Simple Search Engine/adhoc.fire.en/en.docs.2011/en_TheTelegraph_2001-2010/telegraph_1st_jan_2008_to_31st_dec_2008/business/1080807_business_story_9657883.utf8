	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Tata Motors will ramp up its dealer network for passenger cars ahead of the launch of the Nano.        
	Inviting applications from prospective dealers, the company said, This will maximise our opportunities, even as Tata Motors constantly expands its portfolio of passenger vehicle products and services, including the recently unveiled peoples car, the Tata Nano.         
	At present, the companys passenger car brands include the Indica, Indigo, Sumo and the Safari.        
	Tata Motors has invited applications for opening dealerships in Delhi and in Ghaziabad. It also plans to carry out a similar exercise in the other parts of the country.         
	The Nano is being manufactured at Singur and is expected to roll out by September-October. On Tuesday, Bengals industry minister Nirupam Sen said the first batch of Nano would roll out as scheduled before the Pujas.        
	However, the Nano is yet to find a mention in the passenger car dealership application forms, which require applicants to give their five-year sales and service estimates for the existing five Tata brands  the Indica, Indigo, Indigo-Marina, Safari and the Sumo.        
	India is on a fast growth trajectory and is expected to continue this pace throughout the next decade. With a turnover of over Rs 32,000 crore, Tata Motors is already Indias largest automobile company, the company said.

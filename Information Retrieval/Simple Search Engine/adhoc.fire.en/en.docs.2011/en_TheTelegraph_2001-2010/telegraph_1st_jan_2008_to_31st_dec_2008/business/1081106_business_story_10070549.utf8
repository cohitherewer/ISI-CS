          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ramanathan: Hopeful                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: Private banks are considering a cut in lending and deposit rates within a fortnight, according to finance secretary Arun Ramanathan.         
	Their representatives had met Ramanathan today to review the impact of the liquidity crisis on the financial sector.        
	Private banks had also assured the government that they would continue to keep open their existing lines of credit to small and medium enterprises, non-banking finance companies and mutual funds.         
	Though declining to comment on the interest rate cuts, private banks admitted a downward revision in lending and deposit rates was inevitable.         
	Earlier, ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive officer K.V. Kamath had said his bank would review interest rates in the next few days after assessing the impact of Saturdays monetary relaxations by the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Yesterday, PSU banks promised to cut lending rates by up to 75 basis points and deposit rates by 50 basis points after a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Sources said there was a strong possibility of Axis Bank, the countrys third largest private sector lender, revising its lending rates in two to three weeks. The bank will initially cut its lending rates by 50-75 basis points.

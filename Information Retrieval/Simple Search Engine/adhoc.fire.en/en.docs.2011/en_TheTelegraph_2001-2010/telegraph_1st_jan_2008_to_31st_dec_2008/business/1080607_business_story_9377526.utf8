The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vedanta sets sights on Liberian ore
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vedanta sets sights on Liberian ore
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Agarwal: Betting big                                  
	Calcutta, June 6: Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Resources has bid for a large iron ore deposit in Liberia, following in the footsteps of ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel.        
	The FTSE-100 company, which is the promoter of Sterlite, Hindustan Zinc and Sesa Goa, is one of the four companies in the fray for the Bong range of iron ore mines in the west African country.        
	Apart from Vedanta, BSGR Resources of Israel, China Union Investment and Bell Resources of Korea are in the race.        
	The development underlines the growing appetite of Vedanta Resources, which is globally known as a non-ferrous player, for a greater presence in the red-hot iron ore business.        
	The company, which hit the headlines last weekend when subsidiary Sterlite bought US copper miner Asarco for $ 2.6 billion, had entered the iron ore business last year with the acquisition of Sesa Goa  Indias largest exporter of iron ore  from Japans Mitsui.        
	Mining activity at the Bong range mines in central Liberia had come to a standstill following the civil war in the country.        
	Now the Liberian government has decided to reopen the mine for international bidding. At one point of time, there were speculations about the Bong range being devoid of ore.        
	The investment in the Bong mines could be in the range of $ 1.6 billion, and the name of the successful bidder would be known in six weeks.        
	Vedanta officials were not available for comment.        
	Industry observers said that many old mines, previously deemed as unviable, are now making commercial sense following record prices.         
	Iron ore prices have gone up 65-75 per cent this year.         
	If Vedanta makes the cut, it would be a giant stride for the non-ferrous major in its attempt to turn itself into a complete mining company.         
	The company has also plans to set up a steel plant in Orissa and is currently in talks with potential overseas partners.        
	ArcelorMittal had earlier won the rights for northern Liberias Nimba mines. The first consignment of ore from Nimba will be despatched in April 2009.        
	Tata Steel is also bidding for an iron ore mine in western Liberia.        
	It has also won a licence to mine iron ore deposit in neighbouring Ivory Coast. Sterlites acquisition of Asarco is the largest buying abroad by an Indian company this year.        
	Asarco, formerly known as American Smelting and Refining Company, is an over-100-year-old company and currently the third largest copper producer in the US. The agreement is subject to the approval of a US bankruptcy court. Sterlite said it would take six to seven months to complete the acquisition.         
	Asarco, which owns three copper mines in Arizona, US, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005 after it was sued for $1 billion over environmental cleanup and asbestos claims. It has been looking to sell its assets to emerge from bankruptcy.

                                I am 56-years-old. I received Rs 4 lakh from PPF. How can I invest the same in bank fixed deposits/shares/mutual funds in the name of my wife and son (who is an adult) without clubbing the income with me? Both of them dont have any taxable income. Should I gift/lend the money them?          B.K. Basu, Bhadrakali
                    If you gift money to your wife, any income from that gifted money will be taxed in your hand because your wife doesnt have any independent income source. However, any income from gifts to your adult son wont attract any tax for you. Instead, it will be considered as your sons income and he will be liable to pay the tax, if any. You can gift the entire amount to your son and he can gift part of it to his mother. The mother, even if she is a housewife, can get the gift from her son without the income being clubbed to your income.                                  Cash course      I am 64 -years-old. I had invested Rs 50,000 in a tax-saving fixed deposit with a nationalised bank last year. The fixed deposit is in my name and my wife is a joint holder. Will my wife be allowed to encash the fixed deposit within the five-year lock-in period in the event of my death?         G.K. Dhar, Calcutta
                    Yes, your wife can withdraw the money within the lock-in period by making an application with the branch manager of the bank. She will have to furnish the death certificate as a proof. The Bank Term Deposit (Amendment), Scheme, 2007, notified in December last year, has provided for this premature withdrawal provision.                                  Youth at your side      I am 20-years-old. I have saved Rs 20,000. I want to invest this in such a scheme from where I can get good returns?        S. Hazra, Calcutta
                    This is the best time to start investing. Your investment horizon should be long term. Equities offer the best return compared with any other asset class over a longer period of time, say five years or more. Dealing in stocks directly may not be a good idea as you are just a beginner. The diversified equity schemes of mutual funds will serve your purpose. Invest in some well performing equity mutual funds now since the markets are ruling low at the moment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                INCHING UP		    
	Mumbai, May 5: Bank of India (BoI) today raised interest rates on some deposits by 50-75 basis points, the first nationalised bank to do so after the central bank announced its monetary policy last week.        
	Banking analysts said the hike had many implications  depositors might get attractive interest rates on one hand, while on the other, lending rates might also inch up over a period of time.         
	In its monetary policy on April 29, the Reserve Bank of India had raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent. Earlier on April 17, CRR was raised by 50 basis points.        
	After the second round of the CRR hike, though most banks had said that lending rates would not be raised, industry believes that rates will go up when banks feel the impact of the twin CRR hikes.        
	BoI today said that it had revised interest rates with effect from May 1 on domestic rupee term deposits for loans of various maturities in two ranges  less than Rs 15 lakh; and Rs 15 lakh-Rs 10 crore.        
	For deposits of less than Rs 15 lakh, the rates for those having a maturity period of 1 year to less than 2 years will be 9.15 per cent against 8.50 per cent earlier. For deposits of 2 years to less than 3 years, the rates have been hiked to 9.25 per cent from 8.75 per cent; for 3 years to less than 5 years, the revised interest rate will be 9.50 per cent against 8.75 per cent earlier.        
	BoI said that in the Rs 15-lakh-Rs 10-crore category, the rates on deposits of 1 year to less than 2 years had been raised to 9.15 per cent from 8.50 per cent. On deposits of 2 years to less than 3 years, the bank will now be paying 9.25 per cent against 8.75 per cent earlier; for deposits of 3 years to less than 5 years, the rates will stand at 9.50 per cent against 8.75 per cent earlier.

	The State Bank of India today raised the interest rates on deposits of NRIs with effect from May 1. It raised the rates on non resident external rupee deposits as well as on foreign currency non resident deposits.

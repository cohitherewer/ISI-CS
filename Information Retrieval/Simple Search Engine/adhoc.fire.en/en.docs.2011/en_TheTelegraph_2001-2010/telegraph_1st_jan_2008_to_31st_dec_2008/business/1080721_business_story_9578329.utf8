                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Q amp;A      Gift dilemma
                                I want to gift some money to my daughter-in-law from my superannuation benefits. She has got PAN and will invest the gifted amount in a post office monthly income scheme for her future earnings. Please explain the tax liability?          Anup Bose, Madhyamgram
                    der Section 64 (1) (a) of the IT Act, if you make any monetary gift to your daughter-in-law, her income from the gift will be included in your total income and you will have to pay the income tax. However, if your daughter-in-law receives the gift from her father, mother, uncle, aunt or uncle-in-law, the income from such a gift will be assessed as hers. In that case, if her total annual income, including the income from the gift, is less than Rs 1,80,000, she wont have to pay any income tax.                                     Be at ease      I had bought a money back policy from LIC for my daughter. I have been paying premium for the policy and showing this in my income tax return. Recently, LIC sent a cheque of Rs 12,500 in my daughters name as the policy payout. My daughter has become an adult. Shall I calculate this money as my income and pay income tax?        Manoj Kumar Dutta, Calcutta
                    The sum of Rs 12,500 received from LIC is not taxable under Section 10(10D).                       Escape route      Im 75-years-old. My tax liability for the financial year 2007-08 is around Rs 5,000, after the deduction of Rs 1 lakh under Section 80C on a total annual income of Rs 3.18 lakh from bank fixed deposits and pension. Banks also deducted a tax of Rs 12,000 at source. Is there any way to avoid the tax payment?        A.K. Bose, Golf Green
                    You cannot save any tax outgo for the financial year 2007-08. However, in 2008-09 your tax liability will come down because the basic exemption limit on annual income for senior citizens has been raised to Rs 2,25,000. So, after a deduction of Rs 1 lakh under Section 80C, your taxable income will come down to Rs 2,18,000, that is below the threshold limit. Hence you wont have to pay any income tax. As for TDS, a bank is bound to deduct the tax if your total interest income from deposits exceeds Rs 10,000 in a financial year. However, TDS is not applicable in post office schemes.

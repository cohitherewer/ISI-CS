The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam board to grill Raju on Jan 10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Satyam board to grill Raju on Jan 10
          G.S.RADHAKRISHNA       
	Hyderabad, Dec. 28: Satyam Computer Services has decided to hold its board meeting on January 10 with a broader agenda than the one set for Mondays aborted conclave.         
	Mondays board meeting  called off abruptly over the weekend  was supposed to consider a share buyback offer.         
	The company has said the board of directors will now also debate a farrago of questions raised by its seething independent directors after the storm broke over the aborted plan to acquire Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties  two companies in which Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju and his sons hold a substantial stake.                  
	The Satyam board will now meet nine days ahead of another scheduled meeting on January 19 that is supposed to consider the results for the third quarter ended December 30.   
	In a late night press release on Saturday, Ramalinga Raju said the company recognised the serious nature of certain questions raised by the Satyam board of directors over the events of the last two weeks.         
	In order to ensure that these questions are properly addressed... the Satyam board has decided to broaden the scope of its deliberations beyond a possible buyback of its stock, he said.         
	It was not immediately clear what these questions were. Sources in the company said Mondays board meeting had been postponed after two eminent directors  Harvard professor Krishna G. Palepu and Pentium chip inventor and venture capitalist Vinod Dham  had raised pointed questions about the valuation of Satyam itself after the market mauled the stock. Both will be flying down from the US to attend the board meeting in Hyderabad.         
	The company had announced its plan to acquire the two debt-laden companies for $1.6 billion, sparking angry outbursts from shareholders who were told the Rajus had no plans to seek their consent. The plan was dropped the very next day.         
	The market valuation of Satyam is Rs 9,125.76 crore as of Friday, falling 40 per cent from December 15 when the controversy erupted and raising the spectre of a possible takeover bid.         
	Even as the controversy snowballed, several independent directors said they had raised a number of questions regarding the buyout before the management convinced them that the deal would be beneficial for the company.         
	The independent directors were incensed by the manner in which the management had tried to project the view that the boards decision was unanimous. Mangalam Srinivasan, the companys longest-serving independent director, resigned last week after owning moral responsibility to vote for the proposal after raising several objections.         
	There has been a lot of speculation about a management reshuffle with the possibility of Ramalinga Raju stepping down from the post of chairman. The promoters hold only an 8.61 per cent stake in the company. However, sources rubbished the rumours.         
	The agenda before the board is not the resignation of either the directors or the chairman but the need for urgent initiatives to stop the slump in the companys valuation and share prices, said a company spokesperson.         
	Another independent director, Prof. V.S. Raju, former director of IIT, Delhi, ruled out his resignation but said he had also raised certain issues for clarification.         
	I am not resigning but I will voice the concerns of the stake holders, V.S. Raju said over the phone from Visakhapatnam when asked to comment on the swirling rumours about his exit from the board.        
	There have been demands for the resignation of some of the independent directors such as former Union cabinet secretary T.R. Prasad, V.S. Raju and Indian School of Business dean M. Rammohan Rao who had attended the board meet that cleared the Maytas deal.        
	Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Satyam management has also sought more time to file the minutes of the December 16 board meeting with the Registrar of Companies. The RoC had directed Satyam to file its reply by December 29.         
	We have sought more time to file our reply as it is not possible to do so within such a short period, said a spokesperson for Satyam.

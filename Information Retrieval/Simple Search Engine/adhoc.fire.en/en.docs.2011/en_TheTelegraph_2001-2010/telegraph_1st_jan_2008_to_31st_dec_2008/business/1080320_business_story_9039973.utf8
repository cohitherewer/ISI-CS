The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loud buzz on 3G debut
                                                                                                               Loud buzz on 3G debut
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; JAYATI GHOSE                          NEW RINGTONE                                  
	New Delhi, March 19: The government plans to roll out third generation (3G) mobile services next month, ahead of the release of extra spectrum for 2G services.        
	Top officials said that the Telecom Commission was expected to meet next week to finalise guidelines for the rollout of the service and the allocation of spectrum.         
	3G mobile services support faster downloads and more data transmission, enabling operators to provide broadband and high-end services.         
	The government is expected to auction spectrum and not allocate the scarce resource as was done for 2G.        
	This will allow global players with deep pockets to enter the fray and heat up the mobile phone industry, which is highly competitive in terms of services offered but has just a handful of players dominating the market.         
	Besides Vodafone, Bharti, the Tatas and Reliance Communications, foreign players such as AT amp;T, Frances Orange and UKs Virgin Mobile are expected to bid for 3G.        
	Once the Telecom Commission has finalised the guidelines, the matter will be taken up to the political leadership for clearance, said officials.         
	The Congress-led government is keen on further progress in telecom as it sees this sector as one where it has a good record.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja, too, is keen to be seen as someone who has left his imprint on telecom.        
	Raja has earlier said that the government could auction up to 25MHz of spectrum for 3G with five companies getting a licence.        
	The 3G guidelines, being finalised by the commission, propose spectrum in the 2.1 GHz band for GSM players and 800 MHz band for CDMA operators.        
	The guidelines also suggest that in the event of a merger or an acquisition, the new entity will have to pay the government 25 per cent of its new valuation (as a kind of a fee), said the officials.        
	Earlier, the department of telecom had proposed a bar on mergers and acquisitions in 3G for an initial period of five years to discourage trading in spectrum.         
	The 25 per cent payment to the government would come into effect after the five-year cooling off period, the officials said.         
	Besides a one-time spectrum fee, the draft guidelines said, an operator will have to pay annually 0.5 per cent of its adjusted gross revenue as a recurring charge for the use of spectrum.        
	After three years, the fee will be one per cent of adjusted gross revenue.

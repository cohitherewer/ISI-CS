                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mega power project faces land hurdle
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Stumbling block                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The mega power project at Bedabahal in Orissa is facing a land acquisition problem, which can delay bidding for the over Rs 16,000-crore project, in which the Tatas, Reliance Power and Larsen amp; Toubro are interested.         
	About 2,600 acres for the 4,000MW project is yet to be acquired by the state government. Given the opposition faced by the Orissa government to land acquisition for various projects, sources said it would not be a smooth affair.        
	Though the state government is yet to acquire the land for the power unit, the Union coal ministry has allocated three coal blocks  Meenakshi, Meenakshi B and Meenakshi dipside  to the project, which is in Sundergarh district.        
	Sources said the project using super critical technology would evoke keen interest from domestic and international players because the Centre had not only allotted coal mines but also allowed the sale of surplus coal from the mines.         
	The state government, on its part, has dropped the demands for the payment of a cess and supply of cheap power, following opposition from the Union power ministry. It had earlier said the successful bidder should pay a cess of six paise per unit and sell 33 per cent of electricity within the state.        
	Orissa has assured continued water supply to the coal-based project from the Hirakud reservoir and the Ib river. Power Finance Corporation plans to appoint a technical consultant for the project by the end of the next month.        
	The special purpose vehicle for the project along with the state government would get the land, environmental clearance and coal blocks before starting the process of inviting bidders. If the land is acquired, bids will be invited from May next year, the sources said.        
	Each mega power project has a capacity of 4,000MW and requires an investment of between Rs 16,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore.        
	Bidding has taken place for three projects, with Reliance Power bagging the rights to develop two of them  Sasan in Madhya Pradesh and Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Tata Power will develop the Mundra project in Gujarat.

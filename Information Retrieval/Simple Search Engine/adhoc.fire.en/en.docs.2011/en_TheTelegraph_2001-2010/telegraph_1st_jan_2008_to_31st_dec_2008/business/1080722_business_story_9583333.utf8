The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Idea-Spice strategy to escape rule trap
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Idea-Spice strategy to escape rule trap
          JAYATI GHOSE                          New game plan                                  
	New Delhi, July 21: Idea Cellular and Spice Communications, involved in a merger exercise, may sell their new licences in six circles.         
	Idea might sell its new universal access service licences (UASL) for the Karnataka and Punjab circles, because Spice is an existing operator in the circles.        
	Spice, on the other hand, might sell its new universal access service licences for the Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Maharashtra circles, where Idea is present. The licences for both Idea and Spice are effective from January 25, 2008, and the companies are yet to start operations.        
	The move is a bid to circumvent the intra-circle merger and acquisition norms issued by the government on April 22, which prohibits such mergers for three years. This restriction, along with the 10 per cent cap on cross-holding in a circle, put constraints on spectrum, which the merged entity can hold in a given circle till July 2011.         
	Sources said that Idea-Spice might opt to sell the licences to new entrants in the telecom space.        
	The department of telecom (DoT), while announcing the merger guidelines, had said an operator must complete three years in a circle before it can merge or be acquired by another operator.         
	This rule does not apply to new players such as Datacom, Unitech, Swan and Loop Telecom, who were granted licences earlier this year.         
	In spectrum, the guidelines of the DoT allowed the merged entity to keep spectrum held by the merging companies but had put a stiff rider  the new entity had to meet subscriber criterion within three months.        
	Idea has 8.2 Mhz of spectrum in Andhra Pradesh where it has 3.55 million subscribers. Spice was recently granted 4.4 Mhz in Andhra Pradesh, which will be Ideas.         
	This will increase spectrum with Idea to 12.6 Mhz, which is against the merger norms, according to which Idea needs to have 9 million subscribers to have 12.6 Mhz spectrum.        
	In June, AV Birla groups Idea Cellular acquired a 40.8 per cent stake in BK Modis Spice Communications. Subsequently it made an open offer for another 20 per cent of Spice, which will commence on August 22.        
	The deal caught the attention of the DoT in the context of its intra-circle merger and acquisition norms and spectrum held by the merged entity.        
	However, any tough interpretation of the norms may have to wait till the Congress-led government emerges from its current political problems.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lack of clarity on sop hits oil block sale

	New Delhi, April 13: Differences between the petroleum and finance ministries over tax benefits to oil companies have hit the process of bidding for oil blocks under the seventh round of the new exploration and licensing policy (Nelp).         
	There are just 10 days to go before companies submit their bids.        
	The petroleum ministry had given a seven-year income tax holiday to oil companies. However, the finance ministry has proposed to withdraw the relief in its Finance Bill 2008-09.         
	According to officials, the opposite views held by the two ministries can force bidders, both global and domestic, to rework their strategy.        
	Petroleum ministry officials said they had told the finance ministry that a lack of clarity on the issue might have an adverse impact on bids.         
	Sources said petroleum minister Murli Deora had taken up the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and sought an early solution to the issue.         
	Besides, in a letter to finance minister P. Chidambaram, Deora had stated that we should stand by the commitment given at the time of unleashing Nelp.         
	He said the tax holiday under Nelp was finalised by the Union cabinet and could not be changed while the bidding process was on.         
	Under Section 80 IB (9) of the Income Tax Act, companies undertaking the production and refining of mineral oil will get a 100 per cent tax relief on profits for seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial year.         
	With the introduction of the proposed changes, the tax holiday stands withdrawn if operations begin after April 1, 2009.         
	Further, in the explanatory memorandum of this years budget, the term mineral oil does not include petroleum and natural gas, which means the tax holiday may also be withdrawn from the exploration and production sector.         
	The government had extended the last date for submitting bids under Nelp to April 25 from April 11 not only to meet the growing interest in the blocks but also for some clarity on the withdrawal clause by then.         
	Officials said firms would finalise their partners in the last few days, and a lack of clarity could affect their business strategies.         
	There has to be clarity on the tax issue. However, this would not force us to abandon our decision to focus on India. But, certainly it would force us to rework our strategy and recalculate our risk, said a senior official of an oil company.         
	Several Indian firms are holding talks with leading global companies for tieups to increase their chances of getting blocks.         
	The government has given additional weightage to domestic companies that enter into alliances with global majors having experience in deep sea oil and gas exploration.         
	According to sources, international oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil Chevron Corporation, both of the US, British firm BG and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation are likely to bid with Indian partners for the 57 blocks.         
	State-owned exploration leader ONGC is in talks with ExxonMobil, while Shell, Reliance Industries, ONGC and Indian Oil are wooing US major Chevron Corporation, sources said.

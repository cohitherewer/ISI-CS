          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 29: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today sounded another warning on inflation even as it maintained that the medium to long-term prospects of the Indian economy remained robust.        
	The comments in the central banks annual report for 2007-08 came a day after inflation dipped to 12.40 per cent during the week ended August 16.        
	The RBI said there were some upside risks to inflation. While freely priced petroleum products (such as ATF) have been adjusting continuously to crude oil prices, administered petroleum product prices have been revised upwards only twice since February last year. Therefore, even as the prices of items such as ATF could move in tandem with international prices during the rest of the year, those of administered products, barring kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas to an extent, may necessitate some upward revision.        
	Besides oil, coal and electricity prices pose upside risk to inflation. Iron and steel, oilseeds and cotton are some of the other commodities that can witness a rise in prices.        
	In a strong indication that inflation continues to be well above its acceptable levels, the central bank averred that as inflation rates had hardened beyond tolerable levels, monetary policy would continue to address aggregate demand pressures which appear to be strongly in evidence.        
	The RBI said the finances of the Centre might also come under pressure with the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission award, loss of revenues on account of the reduction of duties on petroleum products, likely increase in fertiliser subsidy and implementation of the debt waiver scheme for farmers.        
	There is a need to ensure that the effectiveness of monetary policy is not diluted by fiscal expansion, it said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Visa Steel shuts down Orissa unit 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 27: Visa Steel Ltd has temporarily closed its ferro chrome unit at Kalinganagar in Orissa because of dwindling sales.        
	The plant went on stream a year ago when prices of ferro alloy, used in stainless steel, were ruling high.         
	However, the prices have halved from their peak in the last few months because of the global economic crisis.        
	There is hardly any buyer even at lower prices. We have piled up huge stocks. There is no point running the plant, said Vishambhar Saran, chairman of Visa Steel.        
	The ferro chrome unit is part of a 1.5-million-tonne integrated special and stainless steel unit coming up at Kalinganagar.        
	Six months back, ferro chrome prices were in the range of Rs 1,10,000-1,15,000 a tonne. The prices have now dipped to Rs 50,000-55,000 a tonne.        
	Saran said the prices of chrome ore, the raw material for ferro chrome, did not fall in line with the finished product.        
	Visa, however, plans to go ahead with its joint venture project with Chinas Bao Steel for another ferro chrome plant.

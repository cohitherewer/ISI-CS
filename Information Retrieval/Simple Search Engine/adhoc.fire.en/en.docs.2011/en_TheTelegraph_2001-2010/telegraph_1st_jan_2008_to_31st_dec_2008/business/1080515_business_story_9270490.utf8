	Calcutta, May 14: The slowdown in the US and the sub-prime crisis will affect the Rs 2,500-crore IT education and training market in the country.        
	An increasing number of IT and ITeS companies are looking to reduce hiring costs and are deferring recruitment plans.

	Aptech is one of the largest IT training and education companies in the country and trained around 3.5 lakh students last year.        
	In IT sectors such as hardware engineering, there will be an estimated shortage of eight lakh skilled engineers by 2010.         
	Hence, a sluggish pace of training can have a significant affect the quality of manpower available for the industry.        
	According to a report by the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the number of technology jobs is expected to reach 1.7 million by 2010 end.

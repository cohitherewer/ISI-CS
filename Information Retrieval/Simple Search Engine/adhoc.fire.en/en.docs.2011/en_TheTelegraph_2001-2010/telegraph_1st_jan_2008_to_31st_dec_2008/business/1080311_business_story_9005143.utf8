The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Weak markets fail to scuttle PSU issue plan
                                                                                                               Weak markets fail to scuttle PSU issue plan
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                        
	New Delhi, March 10: The UPA government is pressing ahead with its agenda of listing public sector units (PSUs), despite a bear run in the markets and signs of a slowdown in the US economy.         
	Exploration firm Oil India could come out with an initial public offering (IPO) as early as next month followed by National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited (NHPC) in July-August.         
	Air India will also come out with an issue in the second half of 2008. Oil India will offer up to 2.64 crore equity shares to raise Rs 1,500 crore.         
	NHPC proposes to issue 16.7 crore equity shares, comprising 10 per cent of newly issued shares and 5 per cent divestment by the government.        
	Other public issues which could hit the markets include those of National Thermal Power Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Coal India Limited and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited.         
	The IPO of Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, which drew bids for 27.3 times the shares on offer, in an initial sale last month, has provided enough confidence to the government to hit the market.        
	Besides, the sound fundamentals of the entities have encouraged the government to proceed with the issues.        
	P. Chidambaram has stated the intentions of the government on divestment in his budget speech and post-budget interactions. He had said the government would list all PSUs in the market.         
	There is great scope for stake sales in public sector companies, the finance minister had said, adding the budget had factored in possible wage increases of government employees, once the pay commission submitted its recommendations, and a Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver to farmers.        
	More PSUs may enter the market if the government implements a proposal of the finance ministry, made in a discussion paper, to raise the public shareholding limit of listed companies to at least 25 per cent.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mutual fund duo dare crisis with new offerings
          VIVEK NAIR                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 19: The mutual funds industry has come out with all guns blazing to generate returns during the present financial crisis.        
	Two fund houses  Principal Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund  are targeting investors with new offers, at a time when equities are giving nightmares to investors.         
	Principal and UTIs schemes are equity-oriented mutual funds.         
	The plan is to invest at least 65 per cent of the proceeds in equity and equity-related instruments.         
	The fund houses are confident of attracting investors at a time when the sensex has sank below 10000.        
	The duo have a common selling point  with valuations at attractive levels, this is the right time for long-term investment.         
	Among the two, the new fund offer of Principal Mutual Fund is already on and will close for subscription tomorrow.         
	Sources from the fund house said that the offering had received an okay response.         
	Principal Mauritius, Punjab National Bank and Vijaya Bank have stakes of 65 per cent, 30 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in the fund house.         
	Called the Principal Emerging Bluechip Fund, the scheme seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing around 65 per cent of the proceeds in equity and equity-related instruments of mid-cap companies and five per cent in small-cap companies.         
	The rest will be invested in debt and other equities.        
	Mid-cap stocks, like others, have taken a pounding this year.         
	From the highs in January this year, the Bombay Stock Exchange mid-cap index has plummeted 64 per cent against a 52 per cent fall in the value of the sensex.         
	UTI Mutual Fund is also targeting investors in these turbulent times.         
	It is coming out with UTI Wealth Builder Fund-Series II which will open for subscription on Tuesday.         
	It hopes to attract investors as asset allocation will be in both equities (65 per cent) and gold (35 per cent).         
	The yellow metal, considered a safe haven, has given good returns this year.         
	The fund house expects gold to provide stability to an investors portfolio.         
	Gold exposure will be taken through gold exchange traded funds.        
	Attractive valuations make this the right time for investors to enter. Moreover, the asset allocation of the scheme will also be in gold, which has given superb returns, officials from UTI Mutual Fund said.         
	According to Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Researchonline, bringing out these schemes is a good move, but there can only be few takers as investors are excited in such schemes only when the markets are booming.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paswan pushes for rollback

	New Delhi, May 23: Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan has urged the finance ministry to roll back the export tax recently imposed on steel products.        
	Steel producers have demanded the rollback of export duty and we have forwarded the request to the finance ministry, Paswan said.        
	The government had recently imposed up to 15 per cent export duty on various steel products to increase domestic availability  a decision that was criticised by the industry.        
	According to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the export tax could shrink profit margins and force steel makers to defer expansion plans.        
	The chamber had said that projects recently announced by companies such as Sterlite Industries, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Mittal Steel could be delayed because of the recent steps taken by the government.        
	Following an agreement between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and steel manufacturers, Paswan said, there would be no increase in steel prices till the first week of August.        
	For the three months beginning May 7 there will be no increase in steel prices, though there has been a considerable rise in international markets. Indias steel prices will remain unchanged for three months ending August 7, Paswan said.        
	It is a matter of satisfaction that steel makers have reduced prices on their own despite surging prices in global markets. We are monitoring the situation and will take appropriate decisions soon, steel secretary R. S. Pandey said.        
	According to Pandey, domestic steel prices declined by 10-15 per cent between March and May even as global prices surged.        
	Paswan said steel was likely to see an investment of Rs 8,70,640 crore by 2020 and the capacity will go up to over 290 million tonnes.

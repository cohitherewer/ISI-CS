          OUR BUREAU                          Lalu Prasad: Considerate                                  
	New Delhi, June 5: The Indian Railways will not raise passenger and freight rates despite a steep increase in fuel prices, railway minister Lalu Prasad said on Thursday.        
	The railways transport the bulk of ore, coal and petroleum products in the country, and any hike in rates would bump up prices and add to inflation, which is threatening to touch 9 per cent.        
	It transported 795 million tonnes of freight during the last financial year.        
	The fuel price increase will cost the railways Rs 560 crore for the remaining 10 months of the current financial year.        
	Railways have decided to absorb the diesel price hike by improving its productivity, efficiency and volumes, the minister said.        
	The government-controlled retail price of diesel, the fuel used in trains, was hiked by 9.5 per cent, or Rs 3 a litre, on Wednesday.         
	The railways consume 2.27 billion litres of diesel annually, Lalu said.         
	It would look at reducing freight rates further to compete against trucks and boost earnings by gaining more traffic, he added.

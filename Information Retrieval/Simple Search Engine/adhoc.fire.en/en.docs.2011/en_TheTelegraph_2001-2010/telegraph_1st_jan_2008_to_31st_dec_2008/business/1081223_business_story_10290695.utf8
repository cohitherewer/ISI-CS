          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Extra cover                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The government today introduced a bill in the Rajya Sabha to raise foreign direct investment in insurance to 49 per cent from 26 per cent and allow the entry of foreign reinsurers.        
	Analysts said the bill was unlikely to become a law because the current term of the government would end soon  the Lok Sabha polls are due next year  and it needed the support of either the Left or the BJP.         
	ICICI Prudential Life Insurance executive director N.S. Kannan said the higher FDI rule would help the industry access the much-needed capital. This FDI will be long-term foreign capital and is not volatile money.        
	Aviva India head T.R. Ramachandran said, Increasing FDI would help the insurance sector to further expand, launch innovative distribution channels, upgrade technology, enhance the current product portfolio and bring in global best practices.        
	Public sector general insurers will be able to raise funds from capital markets, once the bill becomes an act.         
	To encourage more players in health insurance, the bill proposes to reduce minimum investment in the business to Rs 50 crore from Rs 100 crore.        
	The bill proposes to change the definition of foreign companies to permit Lloyds of London to do business. Lloyds is not a company and has been set up by a separate act of the British parliament.        
	According to the analysts, the most important change is the opening up of re-insurance, till now restricted to state-run General Insurance Corporation.         
	The bill seeks to remove the restrictions on divestment by Indian promoters.        
	It will become mandatory for general insurance companies to underwrite third party risks in motor vehicles.        
	ING Insurance chief representative N.N Joshi said, It will be a very significant development for the industry if the bill goes through. It will help expand the capital base and reduce dependence on the Indian promoter to get capital.        
	Unions plan stir        
	Trade unions of public sector insurance firms called for a strike tomorrow against the FDI norms in the bill.        
	All India Insurance Employees Association joint secretary A.K. Bhatnagar said, It is beyond imagination as to how the companies which are struggling in their own countries are being allowed to increase stake in India.

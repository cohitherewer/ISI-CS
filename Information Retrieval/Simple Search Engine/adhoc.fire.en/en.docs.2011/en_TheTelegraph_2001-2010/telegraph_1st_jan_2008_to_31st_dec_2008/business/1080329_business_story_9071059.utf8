The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Luxury import relief in sight
                                                                                                               Luxury import relief in sight
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Kamal Nath                          
	New Delhi, March 28: India may reduce import duties on luxury products to stem revenue losses from luxury brands bought by Indians travelling abroad.        
	The government is also planning to increase foreign direct investment in single-brand retailing.         
	India has high tariffs and we recognise that if you go abroad and buy, then the country loses revenues. Therefore, we are working on both duties and countervailing duties, commerce minister Kamal Nath said here at a conference.         
	Nath said he had forwarded proposals for duty cuts to the finance ministry.         
	He, however, said there was a need to differentiate between high-end and low-end products. India is unwilling to reduce tariffs on low-cost imports, which can hit its own industries, he added.        
	Foreign luxury brands target about 100,000 millionaires in the country and millions more who can be categorised as upper middle class.        
	Nath said he felt foreign luxury brands would not pose any problem for local businesses. The government allows up to 51 per cent foreign direct investment in single-brand retailing and wholesale marketing.        
	In recent years, the Left Front had stalled attempts to open up multi-brand retailing to foreign stores. However, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said the government was planning to raise the cap in single brand retail to 100 per cent.         
	About the high tariffs that India imposed on imported wines and spirits, the minister said it protected the countrys interest and also countered discrimination against Indian whisky.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ECB prop for core sector
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ECB prop for core sector
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          DOLLAR DELUGE                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: The government today allowed infrastructure firms to raise up to $100 million from overseas markets, while increasing the external commercial borrowing (ECB) limit for all other firms to $50 million from $20 million.        
	Finance ministry officials said the ECB limit was being raised to increase the inflow of hard currencies which could stabilise the weakening rupee.         
	The rupee fell to a 13-month low of Rs 43.21 to the dollar last week and ended at 42.78 today, down 0.12 per cent from yesterday. The rupee has fallen by nearly 8 per cent since the beginning of 2008 on the back of rising oil imports.        
	It is positive for the rupee and should be positive for interest rates, said A. Prasanna, an economist at ICICI Securities. Analysts believe the easing of overseas borrowing norms will put pressure on domestic banks to either lower or at least hold lending rates.         
	While inflows would add more money to the economy fuelling inflationary pressures, the rise in the rupee would help in keeping the countrys rising oil import bill under check.         
	Foreign institutional investors would also be allowed to invest up to $5 billion and $3 billion in government and corporate bonds, respectively, up from $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion at present.         
	The interest rate ceiling for overseas funds has also been raised. Companies can now raise funds for three to five years at a rate of 2 per cent higher than the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and at 3.5 per cent plus Libor for loans maturing beyond five years.        
	The government, however, retained restrictions on the end use of ECBs that were introduced in August last year to check the swelling liquidity in the system. The government had limited foreign debt that an Indian company could bring home to $20 million a year and made approval from the Reserve Bank mandatory.        
	Firms will also continue to be able to raise up to $500 million under the automatic route. Firms can either borrow under the automatic approval route or by applying to the Reserve Bank of India.

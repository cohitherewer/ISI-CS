          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Ramalinga Raju and former Union cabinet secretary T.R. Prasad  one of the two independent directors who remains on the board of Satyam Computer Services  are digging in for a major battle to restore the embattled companys reputation and soothe the fears of employees.        
	In separate emails sent out today, Raju and Prasad tried to clear the air of suspicion and intrigue that had hovered over the company since December 10 when the company first announced, and then swiftly aborted, plans to acquire two Raju-owned companies.        
	I am of the view that resigning from the board now is like deserting a troubled ship, Prasad said in an email sent out to reporters.        
	He said he would stay on to restore the confidence of all the stakeholders in the company  the employees, its customers, vendors and shareholders. The objective was to strengthen Satyams governance standards and increase the size and alter the composition of the board.         
	I intend continuing on the board at least till this commitment is fulfilled, Prasad said in an apparent disapproval of the way other independent directors had resigned at a critical time.        
	One interesting development was the fact that the registrar of companies had given Satyam time till January 12 to submit the minutes of the infamous December 10 board meeting where the buyout of Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties had been cleared.        
	As part of his damage control exercise, Raju sent out an email to employees in which he assured that the the board and the leadership team are doing everything possible to get Satyam back on track.        
	He emphasised that Satyam was completely committed to the IT services and BPO business, as we have been since our inception.        
	He said the diversification strategy through the plan to acquire the Maytas twins was formed with the belief that doing so would not imperil our leadership in our core business or lessen our commitment to it.        
	Satyam did not  and does not now  intend to retreat from IT and BPO services in any way, and going forward, Satyam will focus exclusively on these markets, Raju said, sending out a strong message to its customers who, he claimed, continued to show a high level of trust.        
	However, employees at Hi-tech City  which houses one of Satyams many offices in Hyderabad  appeared to be in a sombre mood.        
	The time has come for us to think of Satyam without Raju, said one project leader. The corridors were abuzz with speculation about who might provide the new leadership at Satyam.        
	We are busy saving our jobs, muttered 25-year-old Neha Agrawal when asked how she planned to celebrate the New Year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil retailers up the ante
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil retailers up the ante
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Red alert                                  
	New Delhi, May 16: State-owned oil marketing companies want to stop giving new LPG connections as well as stop the import of diesel.         
	Global prices of crude have touched $127 per barrel, and the companies fear losses of Rs 200,000 crore this fiscal from selling fuels below costs.        
	However, the government has decided not to agree to the oil retailers demand. Officials said had the government agreed, it would prove to be politically disastrous.         
	The proposal to stop LPG connections was made earlier in December too, officials said.        
	The companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited  in a joint petition to the petroleum ministry have suggested these measures as their losses from the sale of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene have now touched Rs 550 crore a day.        
	If the companies stop issuing new connections, they could prevent a loss of Rs 305.90 per cylinder.         
	They have also suggested stopping diesel import as they faced liquidity problems for selling the fuel below cost.         
	Oil companies had imported almost 2.3 million tonnes of diesel in 2007-08 against 0.96 million tonnes in 2006-07.

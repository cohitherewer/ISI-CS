	New Delhi, May 7: The government is planning to offload its residual 26 per cent equity stake in Tata Communications, formerly known as Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL).         
	However, in doing so the government would stand to lose control of over 773 acres of prime land valued at around Rs 1,000 crore in various cities.        
	In 2005, the Tatas had an option to acquire the remaining stake but the same could not be done as the two parties  the government and the Tatas  failed to resolve the contentious issue of surplus land lying with the company.         
	According to officials, the government may first try and resolve the land issue and then sell the residual stake.         
	The government holds a 26.12 per cent stake in Tata Communications. Going by the market price, the value of the residual stake is a little over Rs 3,650 crore, said industry analysts.

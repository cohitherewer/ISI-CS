	Mumbai, Oct. 7: Measures taken by the RBI and Sebi failed to lift market sentiments, with the sensex losing another 106 points to remain below the 12000-mark at 11695.24.        
	In volatile trading, markets witnessed alternate bouts of buying and selling.         
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued to sell, while domestic financial institutions bought certain index heavyweights. FIIs have been moving out of equities because of worries relating to the global economy and fears over the credit crisis spreading to other regions.        
	Trading began on a strong note as the markets reacted positively to the booster doses announced yesterday by the RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).         
	The market regulator had relaxed restrictions on participatory notes, while the banking regulator brought down the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points to 8.5 per cent.         
	The sensex opened with a gap at 12068.11 and rose to an intra-day high of 12181.43. However, at the higher levels, FIIs sold aggressively, resulting in the BSE bellwether slipping to an intra-day low of 11501.85.        
	Investors, particularly, FIIs and the high net worth individuals are booking profits at every peaks. Had the domestic institutions not come, the index would have closed deeply in the red, an analyst said. The benchmark index showed a variation of over 679 points and ended with a drop of 106.46 points.        
	Asian indices ended mixed after an intra-day recovery, while the European markets, too, showed a mixed trend in early morning trading. Among the heavyweights, ITC ended lower by 3 per cent at Rs 174.55, TCS plummeted 7 per cent to Rs 575.80 Infosys Technologies, the countrys second-largest software exporter, fell over one per cent to Rs 1,304.10, its lowest in more than two years.        
	Bank stocks, which had appreciated earlier during the day, failed to hold on to their gains. Stocks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank ended lower by 1.1 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively, at Rs 485.20 and Rs 1,127.70.

	 Tokyo, Dec. 13: Toyota Motor Corp is likely to further cut its earnings forecast and report an operating loss of about 100 billion yen ($1 billion) in the October-March period, Japanese media reported. But analysts say with the yen soaring and global vehicle sales sliding more than expected, Toyota is well on its way to slipping into the red in the second half.

	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Satyam Computer is contemplating legal action against the World Bank following the latters refusal to withdraw a statement on banning the Indian firm from doing business with the bank for eight years on charges of data theft.        
	Asked about the World Bank spokespersons refusal to either apologise or withdraw the statement, a Satyam spokesperson said from Hyderabad, We are considering all options at our disposal.        
	The board of Satyam is meeting on Monday and will discuss the issue.        
	Satyam and the World Bank traded charges today on whether the multilateral institution was right in banning Indias No. 4 software firm.        
	Earlier in the day, Satyam through a release had asked the World Bank to apologise and withdraw the statement  which the bank flatly refused.        
	The bank stood by its statement issued on its Indian website on December 23, World Banks India spokesperson Sudip Mazumder said.        
	The Satyam release said: The World Bank (should) immediately withdraw those statements, issue a new statement apologising to Satyam for the harm done to the company due to the banks actions, and provide Satyam with a full explanation of the circumstances related to the banks inappropriate statements.         
	Asked if the bank would apologise as demanded by Satyam, Mazumder had said any comment had to come from its headquarters in Washington. However, the bank stands by its statement, he added.        
	On Tuesday, the World Bank clamped down on Satyam charging the Indian firm of malpractices, including bribery.        
	The bank had said that Satyam was declared ineligible for contracts for providing improper benefits to bank staff and for failing to maintain documentation to support fees charges for its sub- contractors.        
	According to the bank, a year back it had found that a former vice-president, Mohamed Muhsin, had secured contracts and purchase orders worth $100 million for Satyam in return for the Indian companys stock options at preferential prices. Satyam was allowed to work for the bank till 2008.

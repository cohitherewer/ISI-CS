          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subbarao: Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, June 21: The central government is banking on the Reserve Banks money tightening measures to help curb inflation in a big way.         
	The first line of defence is monetary policy action, finance secretary D. Subbarao said here today. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to take steps to curb prices, he added. The rate of inflation has touched 11.05 per cent for the week ended June 7 and is expected to climb further to top 13 per cent in the weeks ahead.         
	Reserve Bank governor Y. V. Reddy met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram today to discuss the situation. The Reserve Bank is expected to increase both the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate, said D. Joshi, chief economist for market rating agency Crisil.         
	Though the RBI is scheduled to make its quarterly monetary policy announcement on July 29, officials hinted that a decision could be taken much earlier.        
	Although demand is not a problem right now, its management has to be part of the solution, Subbarao said. There are limits to how much we can manage on the supply side. So much of the response has to be through demand side measures, he added.        
	On June 4, the government had scrapped taxes on imports of crude oil and cut duties on other fuel products, sacrificing revenues worth Rs 22,000 crore to cushion consumers from high fuel costs.         
	The finance secretary, however, expected inflation to rule high in the next few months. Inflationary pressures will continue in the next few months, Subbarao said.         
	The inflationary trend in the months ahead will depend on the price of crude and the rupees exchange rate, Subbarao said. Crude oil prices almost doubled in the past 12 months to touch an all-time high of $139.89 a barrel on June 16.

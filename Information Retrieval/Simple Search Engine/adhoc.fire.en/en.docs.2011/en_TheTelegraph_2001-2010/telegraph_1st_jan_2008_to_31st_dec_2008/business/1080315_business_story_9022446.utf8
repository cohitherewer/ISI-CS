          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 14: Bankers are upbeat about the finance ministers compensation proposal.        
	According to Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, It will certainly be beneficial to our balance sheets. Moreover, we can use the money to give out fresh loans. Effectively, it amounts to conversion of some of the non-performing loans into productive loans.        
	An official from another public sector bank said the cash compensation would also bring down the transaction costs for banks as they would not have to bear any expenditure in chasing defaulters.        
	Bank stocks, particularly the scrips of the public sector entities, have been hard hit since Chidambaram announced the farm loan waiver package in the budget.

   Twin steps to tackle inflation          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, June 24: The Reserve Bank of India tonight raised the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points each  a move that could make all types of borrowing costlier.        
	The CRR hike will suck Rs 19,000 crore out of the banking system.        
	The Reserve Bank move comes a day after governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy said in Pune that the central bank was tossing a number of options to tackle runaway inflation.        
	This is the second increase in the repo rate  the short-term rate at which commercial banks borrow from the RBI  this month.         
	It rises to 8.5 per cent with immediate effect.        
	The cash reserve ratio  the amount of deposits that banks have to keep with the RBI  increases to 8.75 per cent from 8.25 per cent and will take effect in two stages on July 5 and July 19.        
	The RBI hopes that the CRR hike will reduce the lending ability of banks, thereby enabling the central bank to more effectively manage aggregate demand and temper inflationary expectations.        
	On the other hand, by raising the repo rate, it has sent a strong signal to banks to hike interest rates.        
	The stringent measures announced by the apex bank came within days of Reddys meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram in New Delhi to discuss steps that were needed to control inflation in the face of a surge in oil prices that accounted for a 94 per cent increase in the latest inflation number.        
	The RBI had last increased CRR by 25 basis points on April 29 to 8.25 per cent.         
	On June 11, the RBI had raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8 per cent to contain inflationary pressures.        
	The late night RBI action came as a huge surprise to bankers and bond markets, particularly after Reddys remarks in Pune yesterday that the central bank would take a calibrated action towards tackling inflation.        
	Bankers felt that the RBI would not immediately come up with money-tightening measures and even if it hiked rates, it would be marginal.        
	This is perhaps for the first time since the central bank started wielding the rate axe four years ago that CRR and the repo rate have been raised simultaneously.        
	We were expecting only a 25-basis-point hike in the repo rate and a CRR increase was largely ruled out as liquidity in the system is tight, said an official from a private sector bank.        
	Explaining the reasons for the rate hike, the RBI said monetary policy had to urgently address aggregate demand pressures, which appear to be strong. It said growth in money supply was also above the target.        
	The central bank said, At this juncture, the overriding priority for monetary policy is to eschew any further intensification of inflationary pressures and to firmly anchor inflation expectations.        
	The major focus of the policy is to deal with rising global crude prices through a well-managed and smooth adjustment process.        
	The rate of inflation had touched a 13-year high of 11.05 per cent for the first week of June after the latest round of fuel price hike got reflected in the price figures.        
	The RBI said excluding the fuel sub-group, inflation rose to 9.61 per cent from 5.92 per cent a year ago.         
	Inflation based on consumer price index for industrial workers and urban non-manual employees stood at 7.81 per cent and 6.99 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis in April 2008 compared with 6.67 per cent and 7.74 per cent a year ago.        
	According to the RBI, moderating and managing aggregate demand is a critical element of this approach, so that pressures on prices are not intensified.        
	The central bank said that fiscal pressures were emerging due to the possibility of enhanced subsidies on account of food, fertiliser and fuel as well as for financing deferred liabilities relating to farm loan waivers.         
	These have implications for additional pressures on aggregate demand and a potential spillover in the external sector.        
	Admitting that its measures were painful, the RBI pointed out that this had to be viewed in the context of the new reality of high and volatile energy prices not necessarily being a temporary phenomenon any longer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UBS in fresh capital hunt
                                                                                                               UBS in fresh capital hunt
                            
	London, April 1 (Reuters): UBS has asked investors for more cash after taking another $19-billion writedown today and Deutsche Bank predicted another hit.         
	However, shares of European banks rallied on hopes that the end of another torrid quarter could mark a low point.        
	UBS doubled its writedowns from its exposure to risky assets, making it the worst-hit bank from the US sub-prime crisis and subsequent credit crunch.         
	The Swiss bank also parted company with its chairman and said it would hive off its ailing businesses into a separate unit.        
	The news of the bank seeking to raise 15 billion francs ($15.04 billion) through a rights issue in a second emergency attempt to shore up its balancesheet was not a surprise, but more dramatic than expected by many.        
	Its shares surged 6 per cent as some viewed the bold move as more positive than smaller, regular writedowns, which one analyst had said could result in death by a thousand cuts.

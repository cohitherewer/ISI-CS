The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | In a fix
                                                                                                              Q amp;A      In a fix
                                I have a fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 in a five-year tax saving scheme with a bank. The FD will mature in 2013 and Ill get an accumulated interest of Rs 29,955 on maturity. Will the interest amount of Rs 29,955 be taxable on maturity of the FD or shall I consider the annual average of Rs 5,951 (interest income) for income tax calculation?          B.D. Prasad, Calcutta
                    The tax calculation on the interest income on the fixed deposit will be same as that for savings in an NSC. You can show the annual interest income every year to calculate your tax liability and at the same time claim tax deduction on the interest income under section 80C as reinvestment in the tax-saving deposit.                                  Sharing information      If a person invests more than Rs 1 lakh in shares during a financial year, will he have to furnish additional information with the income tax department?        Ajoy Kumar Ghosal, Calcutta
                According to Section 285BA(3) of the income tax act, specified financial transactions, including purchase of shares worth more than Rs 1 lakh, either through a public or rights issue, have to be reported. It is the responsibility of the company issuing the shares and not of the investor to inform the income tax department.                                   Income matters      The maximum amount of income tax that can be saved by investing Rs 1 lakh in instruments under section 80C is Rs 20,000. Then, why are some financial companies claiming a tax save up to Rs 33,990?        J. Nath, Chittaranjan
                    The amount of tax that can be saved by investing Rs 1 lakh in instruments under section 80C depends on a persons income tax bracket. If your annual income is between Rs 1,10,001 and Rs 1,50,000, your tax rate is 10 per cent. The rate is 20 per cent for income between Rs 1,50,001 and Rs 2,50,000. Beyond this, the rate is 30 per cent. There is also a 3 per cent education cess on all tax brackets and people with an income of more than Rs 10 lakh will also have to pay a surcharge at the rate of 10 per cent. For those with an annual income of above Rs 10 lakh, the tax rate is 33.99 per cent. So, people with an income of more than Rs 10 lakh can save Rs 33,990 by investing Rs 1 lakh in tax-saving instruments.

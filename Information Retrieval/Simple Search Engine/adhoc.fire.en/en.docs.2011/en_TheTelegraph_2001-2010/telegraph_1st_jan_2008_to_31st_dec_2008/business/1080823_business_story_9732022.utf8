                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jharkhand bonanza for SAIL
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Glad tidings                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The political flux in Jharkhand has paid sudden dividends to Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) which has received vital clearances to expand mining at Meghataburu and Kiriburu hills.        
	SAILs plans to expand its Bokaro Steel Plants capacity almost four-fold to 17 million tonnes (mt) by 2020, making it the largest steel mill in India, had been stymied for some time with the Jharkhand government refusing to clear any of its mine expansion and lease renewal proposals.         
	However, with the Madhu Koda regime under pressure to exit, the state has permitted the public sector steel company to expand mining at Meghataburu and Kiriburu.        
	Earlier this year, the Jharkhand government had recommended ArcelorMittal for a lease over a 500-hectare iron ore bearing mine at Meghataburu. Mittal has proposed a 12-million-tonne steel mill in Jharkhand in return for a grant of iron ore mines.        
	SAIL had been unable to start mining in other areas of its Kiriburu and Meghataburu leases because of red tape and intransigence on the part of the Jharkhand government in giving it environment and forest clearances.         
	The steel behemoth wants to start mining at Kiriburus south block which has a reserve of 60mt and Meghataburus central block which has a reserve of 80mt.         
	Bokaro Steel, which needs about 10mt of iron ore annually to produce 4.5mt of steel, plans to increase output to 7.5 mt within the next two years and to 17 mt by 2020.         
	In the past, the Jharkhand government had frustrated SAILs attempt to renew the iron ore lease at Chiria, whose ore is of very good quality.         
	For SAIL, the unsaid quid pro quo is that if Jharkhand gives it the Chiria lease, the public sector steel company will not only invest more in Bokaro Steel but also set up a new plant at Saraikela.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                      
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The government today stopped short of big-ticket changes in foreign direct investment (FDI) norms as it eased caps in civil aviation, refineries, mining and commodity exchanges.
    
	Norms for FDI were reviewed for the first time in two years as despite 9 per cent growth, the country is not attracting as much investment as China. Foreign investments are expected to double to $30 billion this fiscal, which are far below Chinas $74 billion in 2007.
    
	The government raised FDI in airline maintenance, repair and overhaul organisations; flying training institutes; and helicopter and sea-plane services to 100 per cent from 49 per cent.
    
	In cargo and non-scheduled airlines, the limit has been raised to 74 per cent, while in ground handling it will be raised to 74 per cent after security clearances are obtained.
    
	However, the government did not change the limit for scheduled passenger airlines, which will continue to remain capped at 49 per cent through the automatic route. No foreign airline will be allowed to directly or indirectly participate in the business.
    
	In petroleum, the cabinet has done away with the norm that makes it mandatory for multinational oil marketing companies to divest 26 per cent stake within five years. 
    
	The government raised FDI in PSU refineries to 49 per cent from 26 per cent. 
    
	A 100 per cent FDI in the mining of titanium has been allowed. In commodity exchanges, the government has allowed foreign investment up to 49 per cent.
    
	Jute price
    
	The government has increased the minimum support price for raw jute by Rs 195 to Rs 1,250 per quintal for 2008-09.
    
	The cabinet also decided to merge 50 per cent industrial dearness allowance with the basic pay of employees of profit-making central public sector enterprises.
    
	Fresh proposals
    
	The government today approved 34 foreign direct investment proposals worth Rs 2,288.40 crore in various sectors, including a Rs 580-crore plan of Global Asset Holding Corporation for investment in telecom.

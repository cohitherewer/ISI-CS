	New Delhi, April 8 (PTI): The Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco) is likely to post a profit after tax of around Rs 370 crore for 2007-08 compared with Rs 308.38 crore a year ago.        
	The company looks to an increase in profit because of improved recoveries and the reduction in the cost of borrowing funds, Hudco chairman and managing director K.L. Dhingra said.        
	Hudco has achieved sanction of Rs 13,492 crore against Rs 12,162 crore in 2006-07.        
	However, these figures are provisional as the exact figures will be known in a few days, Dhingra said.        
	The loans have been sanctioned for a variety of projects, including housing for the economically weaker sections of the society, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, infrastructure projects such as water supply, roads, drainage system, power and emerging sectors along with integrated development of townships and many other innovative projects.        
	Till now we have sanctioned 15,982 housing and urban development projects, Dhingra said. These projects are worth Rs 2,64,675 crore, for which Hudcos loan commitment is Rs 80,463 crore, he added.        
	 The projects, once completed, will help provide over 1.41 crore residential units, over 5.31 lakh developed plots and 67.09 lakh sanitation units.         
	Hudco has prepaid high cost borrowings amounting to Rs 681 crore during the year.        
	The percentage of sanction for the government sector has improved to 60 per cent compared with 50.09 per cent in the previous year, Dhingra said.        
	We have given maximum emphasis on weaker sections and low income group housing with 92 per cent of the total dwelling units sanctioned by Hudco earmarked for these categories in the urban and rural areas, he said.        
	 The government has launched the JNNURM scheme in December 2005 to encourage the creation of financially sustainable inclusive cities.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subbarao in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao today took stock of the ongoing financial crisis.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and finance secretary Arun Ramanathan were also present at the meeting which took place at the Prime Ministers residence late in the evening.        
	Chidambaram will address the media tomorrow and is expected to issue a statement on further measures to be taken by the government.        
	The policy-makers are understood to have discussed steps to infuse more liquidity into the system, including the introduction of schemes to attract foreign investments.        
	The liquidity situation is comfortable. Everything is under control. We have reviewed the situation, Subbarao told reporters after his meeting with Chidambaram.        
	His meeting with the Prime Minister and Chidambaram comes a day before the crisis committee headed by Ramanathan meets in Mumbai.        
	According to officials, the RBI governor is considering a further cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), a relaxation in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) and a possible trimming of the repo rate.        
	The CRR was cut last week by 150 basis points to 7.5 per cent, while the SLR now stands 25 per cent.        
	The cash reserve ratio is that portion of deposits that banks must park with the Reserve Bank of India. The SLR is the percentage of deposits that banks must invest in approved securities  usually gilts.         
	The government is also planning to introduce a new millennium deposit scheme, offering high interest rates to NRIs who have surplus funds and can earn more with a sovereign guarantee. A similar scheme launched in 2000 yielded over $5 billion.        
	We believe everything is under control. I cannot tell you what measures are going to come. We have done everything that had to be done, Subbarao said after his meeting with Chidambaram.

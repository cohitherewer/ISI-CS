  - Telecom networks work overtime as watchdog, operators turn proactive        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                IT rsquo;S OFFICIAL		    
	Mumbai, May 5: Bharti Airtel today said it was in talks with MTN to acquire a stake in the South African telecom player.        
	Indias largest telecom company is looking to acquire around 51 per cent stake in MTN, reports said.        
	Though both sides denied the reports throughout the day, they issued separate statements late in the evening.        
	The discussions are exploratory in nature and may or may not lead to any transaction. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the companys securities until a further announcement is made, MTN said in a filing with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.        
	The African telecom companys current market capitalisation stands at about $35.5 billion while that of Bharti Airtel is about $43 billion.        
	Bharti will have to shell out $18 billion to fund the acquisition.         
	After refusing to comment on reports all afternoon, Bharti finally said it was in talks with the company after MTN informed the stock exchange.        
	Bharti Airtel Limited has entered into an exploratory discussion with MTN Group Limited, South Africa. Current discussions are still at an early stage, are exploratory in nature and may or may not lead to any transaction, a Bharti spokesperson said late in the evening.         
	After reports that Bharti was planning to bid for a stake in the company, the MTN stock climbed to a record high in Johannesburg this afternoon.         
	MTN rallied 7.51 rand, or 5.2 per cent, to 152.01 rand, the highest in its 14-year history.         
	The stock traded at 149.80 rand at 3:30 pm and was the most active stock on the bourses today.         
	MTN is a leading telecom player in Africa and West Asia. It has a subscriber base of 68.20 million in 21 countries across the two continents.         
	There were rumours during the day that Reliance Communications (R-Com) was also in the fray to buy a stake in MTN. R-Coms market capitalisation is $30 billion.        
	An R-Com spokesperson said, Reliance Communications has substantial international operations and has recently acquired telecom licences in Uganda. The company is continuously evaluating various growth opportunities globally, both organic and inorganic, on an ongoing basis.         
	Bharti shares slipped Rs 4.75, or 0.53 per cent, to close at 893.85 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Meanwhile, R-Coms stock fell Rs 6.95, or 1.24 per cent, before closing at Rs 554.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government would now go ahead with the unfinished economic reforms agenda after its victory in the confidence vote.        
	With 275 votes, this government has an absolute majority and this gives us the confidence to go forward, he said after the trust vote.        
	Crucial legislations in insurance and banking and bills to set up a pension regulatory body and one for the unorganised sector are pending following opposition from the Left parties that were till recently providing outside support to the UPA.        
	The government will be approaching other members who are not opposed to economic and social reforms and so we will move ahead with the reforms, Chidambaram said.        
	We have crossed a major bridge that is the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. Now, we will move ahead on economic and social reforms, he said.        
	The finance minister said he intended to reach out to those who might have voted against the government.        
	According to Chidambaram, many of them were obliged to support the bills because they supported these legislations during the committee meetings.        
	He said the bills reported favourably by the parliamentary committees would get priority.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora said the victory in the trust vote would help the country push for obtaining energy security by diversifying its basket to include nuclear energy in a big way.        
	GDP growth         
	Earlier during the debate on the nuclear deal, Chidambaram today said that the revised estimates of farm growth would take Indias GDP growth for 2007-08 to 9.1 per cent.         
	He said India should follow the Chinese model of growth.         
	Chidambaram said, I have no hesitation in saying that I do not envy China. I want to emulate China. I want India to become an economic power, an economic super power.

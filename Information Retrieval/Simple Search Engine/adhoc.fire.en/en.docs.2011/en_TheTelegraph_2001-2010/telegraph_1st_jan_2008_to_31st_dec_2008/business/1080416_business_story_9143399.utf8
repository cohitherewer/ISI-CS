          STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 15: Indian chief executives expect the economy to grow at a moderate growth rate of 7.9 per cent in this financial year.        
	This was the finding of a survey done by industry chamber Assocham. The factors behind the projection are domestic inflation and high interest rates, which are affecting industry and consumer demand, the survey said.        
	About 66 per cent of the respondents stated that the US recession, domestic inflationary pressures, high interest rates and supply constraints had started hurting industrial growth and consumer demand.        
	This might further impact the growth rate in gross domestic product in the current fiscal, Assocham president V.N. Dhoot said while releasing the survey.        
	Around 75 per cent of the chief executives felt the challenges thrown up by the appreciating rupee and soaring prices of crude oil and industrial metals might come in the way of high growth rates.        
	While exports grew at a healthy rate of 23 per cent in dollar terms during April-February 2007-08, a slowdown was visible in rupee terms with exports growing only 9 per cent.         
	Eighty-three per cent of the respondents said it would be even more difficult to attain the export target of $200 billion in 2008-09 because of the appreciating rupee, global inflationary pressures and tough competition from China in capturing new markets.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 18: A realty fund sponsored by Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited has picked up a 45 per cent stake in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) floated by the Mumbai-based Lodha group for Rs 250 crore.         
	The SPV has been formed to develop a luxury residential cum commercial project in Hyderabad. The total cost of the project will be Rs 920 crore.        
	Under the terms and conditions, the HDFC-sponsored fund will stay invested in the SPV till the project ends in 42 months from the zero date, Lodha group director Abhinandan Lodha told reporters.        
	Last year, the Lodha group had won the auction to acquire 12.9 acres of land from the Andhra Pradesh government for Rs 256 crore.        
	Hyderabad is in its infancy in township development compared with other cities. Our project is the first premier development there, Lodha said.        
	The group has received Rs 2,400-crore private equity investment so far. Last September, it had got $410 million investment from Deutsche Bank Singapore. JPMorgan and ICICI Ventures had also invested in it.        
	The group, Lodha said, is also considering a public issue. We are on an aggressive growth path. This is why we are keenly pursuing the initial public offering, Lodha said.         
	The company may get additional investment from private equity players in the next six to eight months.        
	Lodha, however, said the IPO would depend on various factors, including market behaviour and the actual financial need of the company.        
	We will monitor how the market spans out and how much funds we require, he said.                     
	It could take another 12-15 months to decide on the matter, Lodha added.

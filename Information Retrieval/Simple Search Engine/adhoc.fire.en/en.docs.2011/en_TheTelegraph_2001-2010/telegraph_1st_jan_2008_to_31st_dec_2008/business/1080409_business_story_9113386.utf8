          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 8: The government is set to release GSM spectrum to both new and existing mobile operators in some southern circles by next week.         
	Spectrum for the remaining circles will be given after the policy for third generation (3G) spectrum is finalised, said officials of the department of telecommunications (DoT).        
	In the first phase, start-up spectrum will be given for the Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Orissa and the Tamil Nadu (including Chennai) circles. The DoT plans to allocate spectrum in all the other circles after the release of spectrum by the defence authorities. The officials said defence would vacate around 40-45MHz by the end of this year.        
	In the second phase, radiowaves (spectrum) will be allotted in two to three more circles, including Maharashtra and Bihar. The exercise will be completed by the end of April, the officials said.        
	According to the DoTs wireless planning and coordination wing, some 45MHz in the 1,800MHz band is available for operations in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Therefore, new players will get 4.4MHz of spectrum for initial operations in the four circles, the officials said.         
	Bharti Airtel, the No. 1 cellular operator in the country, is expected to get additional spectrum in the three southern circles in the first round. Bharti has been adding more than 2.5 million subscribers on a monthly basis, which makes it eligible for additional spectrum in certain circles, the officials said.        
	In January, Bharti got spectrum in five circles  Bengal, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh (west), Assam and Haryana. The company is still waiting for extra spectrum for its operations in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Bihar.         
	Among the new players which will get spectrum are Videocon-promoted Datacom; Shyam Telelink, which has joined hands with Russian telecom giant Sistema; realty major Unitech; Swan Telecom; BK Modis Spice Communications and S Tel.        
	Around 50MHz is available in nine circles, which is sufficient to accommodate all the new players as well as meet the demand of existing operators, the officials said.         
	However, in some important circles, such as Delhi, only one of the new players could get initial spectrum.         
	On the basis of the first come, first served policy of allocation, Swan Telecom could be the first in queue for spectrum in Delhi.

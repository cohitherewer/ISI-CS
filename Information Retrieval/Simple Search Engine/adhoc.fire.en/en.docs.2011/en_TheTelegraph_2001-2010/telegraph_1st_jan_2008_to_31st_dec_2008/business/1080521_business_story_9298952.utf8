          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, May 20: Jute commissioner Binod Kispotta has rejected the consumer affairs ministrys suggestion to use an alternative packing material for five million tonnes of foodgrain because of the poor quality of jute bags.        
	The ministry had proposed the use of a synthetic material for long-term security of foodgrains .         
	The jute commissioner has opposed this move saying that under the jute packaging act, it is mandatory to use jute as the packing material.        
	In a letter to the director of jute in the Union textile ministry, Kispotta said the quality complaints in the past two years accounted for only 0.84 per cent of the total purchase made by different agencies.         
	This does not appear to be alarming, Kispotta added.         
	In the past two years, around 23 lakh bales of jute bags were procured.         
	Of these, faults were found in around 19,427 bales, which is less than 1 per cent of the total purchase.

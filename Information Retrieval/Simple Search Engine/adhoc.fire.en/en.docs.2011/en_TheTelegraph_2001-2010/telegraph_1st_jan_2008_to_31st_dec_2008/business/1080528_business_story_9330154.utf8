          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: The telecom dispute settlement and appellate tribunal (TDSAT) today refused to grant relief to Bharti Airtel in its spat with BSNL.         
	Last week, BSNL had disconnected Airtel from its points of interconnection at Malleswaram in Bangalore over the non-payment of dues worth Rs 66 crore.        
	At this stage I am not inclined to pass any order in this case, said TDSAT chairman Justice Arun, observing wide differences in both sides, and posting the matter for hearing on July 16.        
	Bharti Airtel is believed to be considering approaching the high court for a decision at the earliest.        
	During the proceedings at the tribunal, the counsels appearing for BSNL submitted that the dues from Bharti Airtel were genuine and BSNL would not restore connection until the amount was paid.        
	BSNL also said it had disconnected Reliance on similar grounds earlier and any such restoration would show a bias against the other player.        
	On being asked by the tribunal whether the consumer would suffer from any such disconnections, BSNL replied that everything was done in a legal manner as Airtel was sent a three-week notice. We have sent them a three week notice. Even after three weeks we waited for another four days. They were sleeping on that and when the connections were disconnected, they are pleading for urgency, said the counsel appearing for BSNL.         
	According to the state-run firm, Bharti would have to pay 100 per cent of the dues for the restoration of connection.         
	Actual dues were Rs 98 crore and after adjustments they have been reduced to Rs 66 crore.        
	The dispute between the two telecom players is for the period between May 2003 and June 2005 over unregistered calls because of an absence of caller line identification.

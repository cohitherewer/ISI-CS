          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Sept. 1: Reliance Industries will start pumping gas from its Dhirubhai-6 field in the Krishna-Godavari basin by the end of October  almost a month later than scheduled.        
	There will be a slight delay because of technical factors, petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey told reporters today. There will be no penalty for the delay.         
	In Mumbai, the company said it had dropped plans to hive off an 80 per cent stake in the gasfield to four wholly owned subsidiaries since it had already raised the cash needed to start commercial production.         
	D-6 is touted as the biggest gusher among Indias oil and gasfields with proven reserves of over 11.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF).         
	The gasfield is expected to initially produce 25 million metric standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) which will go up to 40 mmscmd by next March.         
	But there are several claimants to the gas, including Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) and NTPC  both of which insist they have iron-clad agreements that entitle them to the gas at a price of $2.34 per million British thermal units (mBtu).         
	The government has fixed a price of $4.20 per mBtu for gas supply from the D-6 block to fertiliser plants under a complicated formula approved last year.         
	In a statement issued today, RIL said it had abandoned the plan to transfer the stake to four subsidiaries since it no longer needed to raise money.         
	It said the application for the stake transfer was submitted to the government four months ago to retain flexibility for raising finances for the project.         
	Our projects are nearing completion and we have successfully raised the finance and so do not wish to pursue the application, the statement added.         
	RIL holds a 90 per cent stake in the D-6 block while Niko Resources, the Canadian oil major, owns the rest.         
	The move to scrap the plan was reported in a section of the media over the weekend, sparking speculation that Mukesh Ambani-run RIL was ready to respond to brother Anils overture for reconciliation talks.         
	Anils lawyers had made the suggestion to Bombay High Court last week.         
	Arguments in the case resumed today before a division bench comprising Justices J.N. Patel and K.K. Tated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax tweak hurts RIL, spooks sensex
                                                                                                               Tax tweak hurts RIL, spooks sensex
          VIVEK NAIR                           Jittery                                
	Mumbai, March 9: Reliance Industries  the largest private sector company in India and the top-weighted stock in the 30-share sensex  could see its valuations plummet if the finance ministry fails to clear the air on a tax tweak in Budget 2008 that seeks to deny oil and gas prospectors the benefit of a seven-year tax holiday.         
	The blow to oil companies arises from an amendment to Section 80-IB of the Income Tax Act, which tax experts say, can badly hurt companies such as Reliance Industries (RIL) and ONGC.         
	While the Finance Bill 2008 is curiously silent on the change, the explanatory memorandum which amplifies on all the amendments in the bill, talks about phasing out the provision for 100 per cent tax deduction on the profits earned by oil prospectors and refiners under sub-section 9 of Section 80IB.         
	The tax blow comes from an innocuous line in the relevant explanation: For the purpose of this section, the term mineral oil does not include petroleum and natural gas, unlike in other sections of the act.         
	In one stroke, the seven-year tax holiday that oil companies were counting on has disappeared in a puff of smoke.         
	While petroleum companies are scrambling to lobby against the amendment, brokerages and other market pundits have already started voicing fears that this could potentially roil the already skittish stock markets.         
	Last week, ICICI Bank stunned the stock markets by admitting a $264-million notional loss on its credit derivatives portfolio that was impacted by the sub-prime credit crisis in the US. It was the first indication that Indian entities werent insulated from the financial crisis that rocked the US and Europe last August.         
	The BSE sensex has plunged 21 per cent since the start of 2008. But the tax blow to RIL  which has a weightage of 14.61 per cent in the bellwether index  and ONGC (9.13 per cent weightage) could further weaken sentiment. RIL has a market capitalisation of over Rs 3 lakh crore.         
	Tax experts have already started quibbling over the tax amendment. Some argue that the memorandum is part of the budget papers and that RIL will not qualify for the tax break. But the mavens in the petroleum industry are contesting that view.         
	The Oilfield Regulation amp; Development Act clearly defines mineral oil to include natural gas and petroleum. Moreover, we already qualify for tax reliefs under Sections 42, 44BB and 293A which include petroleum and natural gas within the definition of mineral oil. We will make a representation on this to the finance ministry, said Y. Sahai, director of the Petroleum Federation of India.         
	The memorandum says: It is proposed to insert a new proviso in sub-section (9) of section 80-IB so as to provide that no deduction under this sub-section shall be allowed to an undertaking engaged in refining of mineral oil if it begins refining on or after the first day of April, 2009.         
	Some argue that the change may not affect RIL which is due to start commercial exploitation of gas in the Krishna-Godavari basin later this year.         
	The tax change also comes at an inopportune moment. The petroleum ministry is due to start the process of bidding for 57 oil and gas blocks in April. It can deter foreign oil giants from stumping up bids.         
	Various brokerages have in the past given the oil exploration and production business a value between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,400 in a sum of the parts valuation. On Friday, the RIL stock closed at Rs 2248.80 on the BSE.         
	In a recent report, S. Varatharajan, director, research (oil and gas/petrochemical sectors), at IDFC-SSKI said, Based on the clarification, RILs KD-D6 development would not fall under this as its production would start by September 2008 ... We estimate the impact on the value of RILs existing discoveries at around Rs 175 per share.         
	Vartharajan added that the impact on companies such as RIL would be much higher if new discoveries were counted in. While RILs share price is now ruling at around 2,248, it has come off the 52-week high of Rs 3,252.10.                                 
	Despite such a correction, ABN Amro said the valuations of the company continue to be fairly good. Giving a sell recommendation on the stock, the brokerage said the market valuations of RILs E amp;P assets were too aggressive and that the margins on its current businesses would decline.         
	ABN Amro said the margins in refining and petrochemicals would fall because of a slowdown in global GDP growth.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bansal: Hurdles ahead                                  
	New Delhi, July 25: The government today said state-run banks might post lower quarterly profit growth because of higher interest rates and mark-to-market losses.        
	There may be a slight impact on profit growth in the first quarter, said Pawan Kumar Bansal, minister of state for finance.        
	Analysts estimate that the State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys biggest bank by assets, may post a modest 4.2 per cent increase in first-quarter profit as it needed to set aside more funds for losses on bonds and increasing bad loans.         
	This will be the slowest profit growth in six quarters for the SBI, which has more than 10,000 branches across India and overseas.         
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said on July 11 that the bank was likely to post double-digit net profit growth in the first quarter of 2008-09.        
	Allahabad Bank, which had announced its first quarter results last week, reported a 53 per cent drop in net profit.         
	The drop was mainly on account of a rise in the interest rate on government securities, which forced the bank to make a provisioning of Rs 264.08 crore, K.K. Agarwal, executive director of the bank, said.         
	Bansal also said that the government would push for private players in pensions and higher voting rights of foreign entities in private sector banks, during the monsoon session of Parliament.         
	Tabled in 2005, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill is yet to be passed by Parliament because of opposition by the Left parties.         
	The bill proposes the entry of private entities in the management of pension funds.        
	The Left has also opposed the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, which proposes voting rights of foreign investors in banks in proportion to their equity holding. The voting right is now capped at 10 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Holds out hope                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The government is likely to cut fuel prices after December 24, when the assembly polls in six states will be over.        
	We can look at fuel prices only after the assembly polls as any announcement now will violate the election code, petroleum minister Murli Deora said.        
	The final round of polling in Jammu and Kashmir will end on December 24.        
	Both the ruling allies and the Opposition parties want the government to cut fuel prices as the three state-owned oil firms have started making profits for the first time in three years.        
	A petroleum ministry official said oil companies wanted the gains from the sale of petrol and diesel to partially offset the loss from kerosene and domestic LPG sales.        
	The Indian basket of crude has tumbled to $45.50 a barrel on Thursday, according to latest data available with the petroleum ministry.        
	Making a case for a cut in auto fuel prices, former petroleum minister Ram Naik said India is the only country where ATF is cheaper than petrol.

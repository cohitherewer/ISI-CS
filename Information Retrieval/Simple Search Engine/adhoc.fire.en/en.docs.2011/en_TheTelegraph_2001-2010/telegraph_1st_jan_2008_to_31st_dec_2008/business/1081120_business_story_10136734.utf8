          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: The rupee for the first time closed below the 50-mark against the dollar on sustained demand for the greenback and weak equity markets.        
	It ended at 50.03 to the dollar, a fall of 35 paise over its previous close of 49.69.         
	On October 24, the rupee had moved below the 50-mark, only for the Reserve Bank of India to intervene and keep it above that psychological level.        
	The weak close has once again ignited fears among dealers of the currency hitting the 52-mark over the next few days.         
	Analysts apprehend that the dollar outflows from India are likely to persist with mounting worries over more economies slipping into recession.         
	The rupee, which has been losing its ground against the dollar for the past two days, has fallen nearly 27 per cent since January         
	Foreign institutional investors have pulled out nearly $13 billion from the equity markets so far in the current calendar year. These investors had pumped more than $17 billion into equity markets last year.         
	Dealers said there was a strong demand for the US currency today from oil refiners for their import payments, though the availability of the dollar was extremely limited.         
	While the domestic unit was steady in morning trade after opening weak at 49.72, it came under pressure when shares surrendered their gains.         
	The central bank, too, did not intervene.         
	The 30-share sensex on the Bombay Stock Exchange today closed at 8773.78 points, lower by 163.42 points from its last close, on account of weak cues from overseas markets and profit booking by cautious investors.         
	The barometer had surged nearly 300 points, or 3.3 per cent, and traded above 9000 in early trade before selling pressure emerged.        
	Barring Shanghai Composite which soared 6.05 per cent, other Asian indices were down by about 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent.

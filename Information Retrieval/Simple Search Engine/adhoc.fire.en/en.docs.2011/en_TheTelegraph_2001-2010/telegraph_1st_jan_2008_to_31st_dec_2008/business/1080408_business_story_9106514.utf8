	 New Delhi, April 7: Indias oldest fast food chain Nirulas plans to set up nearly 150 outlets across the country, including in Calcutta and Mumbai, within three years.        
	Though it has not finalised the location in Calcutta, Nirulas expects to open an outlet by early next year, with more to follow during the three-year expansion period.        
	The fast food chain plans to expand to Rajasthan and western India this year. By 2011, the number of outlets is likely to go up to 200 from 57 stores now.        
	Sudipta Sengupta, senior vice-president, Nirulas said, Even if I put it very conservatively I will say that we are now growing at the rate of 50 per cent.         
	Nirulas is planning to grow both organically and inorganically. We are going to have 5 stores in Rajasthan in 2008 and our franchise partner in this state is going to be South Asian Hospitality Services, Sengupta said.         
	The fast food chain, which has managed to withstand the charge of multinationals such as KFC, McDonalds and Dominos Pizza, is preparing for its foray into western India.        
	Mumbai and its suburbs will have around 10 outlets by the end of this year. It currently has 35 outlets in Delhi and in the National Capital Region.        
	As part of its brand revamp plan and to attract more footfalls, Nirulas has added many low-priced items on its menu. This is also a strategy to stay ahead of competition. The focus is on innovation and growth. We are expanding menu choices, increasing the number of locations and setting competitive rates for our products, Sengupta said.         
	Nirulas is also modifying its menu to suit regional tastes. We localise the menu slightly depending on the city or the state we are going into.        
	The first Nirulas outlet opened in Delhi way back in 1934, and since then, it has been selling western snacks and meals such as burgers, pizzas, cakes and ice creams as well as Indian fast food such as kebabs. You cannot go wrong if the right products are sold at the right price in the right ambience and by the right people, Sengupta said.        
	Delivery is a growing trend in fast foods,and Nirulas is trying to take on home delivery specialists such as Dominos in this field. Currently, its ratio of dining to delivery service is 80:20.         
	The Indian fast food market is estimated to be $10 billion and is growing at 40 per cent annually. The market is dominated by small players, but big chains are expanding rapidly.

	Calcutta, April 1: Market capitalisation of stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) grew 45.17 per cent and 50.53 per cent, respectively, in the last fiscal, despite sharp corrections in stock prices over the last two months.        
	An index of shareholder wealth, market capitalisation of a company is its share price multiplied by the number of shares available for trading.         
	At the end of todays trading session, market capitalisation at the BSE was Rs 51,46,205.69 crore compared with Rs 35,45,041 crore at the end of March last year, up 45.17 per cent.        
	Investor wealth grew faster on the NSE where market capitalisation increased 50.53 per cent to Rs 48,58,122 crore from Rs 32,27,377 crore a year ago. However, the wealth burst has bypassed most Indian households as only 6.3 per cent of the households financial assets are held in shares and mutual funds.         
	According to estimates of the Reserve Bank of India, the household sectors financial savings in 2006-07 were Rs 7,58,751 crore, of which only Rs 47,608 crore was in shares and mutual funds.         
	Given the increases in market capitalisation on the BSE and the NSE, the households assets in shares and mutual funds grew between Rs 21,504.53 crore and Rs 24,056.32 crore in the 2007-08 financial year.         
	While 1,400 companies created wealth worth Rs 18,00,000 crore during the financial year, some 1,000 companies saw depletion in market capitalisation by Rs 2,50,000 crore. IT companies, affected by the appreciation of the rupee, posted losses in their share prices.         
	The Reliance companies, followed by heavy engineering companies such as Bhel and Larsen amp; Toubro, and some finance companies such as HDFC and the State Bank of India led the wealth creation.

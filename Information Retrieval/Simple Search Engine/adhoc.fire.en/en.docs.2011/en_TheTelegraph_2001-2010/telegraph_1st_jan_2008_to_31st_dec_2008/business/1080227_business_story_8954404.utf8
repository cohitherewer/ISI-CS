	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The railways today reduced fares on all air-conditioned classes but airlines remained unimpressed by the small cuts.
    
	The non-plussed airlines feel trains will have to learn to fly first to beat them, something which the Indian Railways says it may do in the future with trains travelling at the speed of 300-350 km per hour in dedicated high-speed corridors.
    
	For the last two years, Lalu Prasad had been trying to counter low-cost airlines, which were eating into the traffic of prestigious trains such as the Rajdhani Express, by reducing fares in AC-I and AC-II classes. 
    
	The minister hopes that this years round of cuts will help bust competition.
    
	Airlines, however, do not see any threat from the fare cut. 
    
	According to GoAir managing director Jeh Wadia, The Indian passenger has always followed a process of upgrading as he moves up the economic ladder ... This trend will continue. This is because the Indian Railways cannot provide the time efficiency that air travel offers. Moreover, GoAir takes the launch of Go-Mumbai smart card as a huge compliment to the power of the Go brand.
    
	SpiceJet director Ajay Singh said, We dont think we will lose out ... if the railways have dropped fares, it goes to prove we are on the right track. We think we will continue getting more and more passengers because trains just cant fly.
    
	The fare basket offered by the airlines still remain attractive. Flight tickets between Delhi and Calcutta or Mumbai are priced in the range of Rs 2,500 and Rs 7,000. 
    
	Second-class Rajdhani tickets between Delhi and Calcutta cost about Rs 1,950, while AC-I tickets cost nearly Rs 3,250.
    
	The 33 per cent growth in the aviation sector last year has led the ministry to take a hard look at making fares more realistic and attractive for the common man, Wadia added.
    
	The railways have also been toying with the idea of high-speed passenger corridors. 
    
	However, there is disagreement over the project within the railway ministry. 
    
	Lalu Prasad himself is not believed to be too keen on the project.
    
	However, if and when this does come about, airlines will face trouble. 
    
	Sudipto Bose, an aviation sector analyst, said, Empirical evidence abroad have shown that high-speed trains are the preferred mode of transport for distances of up to 500-800 km. Flights take over beyond that distance.

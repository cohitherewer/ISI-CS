The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry puts on a brave face
                                                                                                               Industry puts on a brave face

	New Delhi, April 4: Industry fears a squeeze in demand, if interest rates go up in the wake of high inflation.        
	Those facing pressure on input costs, however, plan to hold on to the price line for the next few months to push sales.        
	The government needs to take immediate steps to curb inflation. Both steel and copper prices have gone up considerably in the last four months. However, we have increased prices only once, Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director, Samsung India Electronics, said.        
	Zutshi said the durables industry had tried to absorb the input price hikes for a long time but the pressure on it to pass on the burden to consumers would increase if the prices continued to rise. There are no plans to increase prices at least for the next three months.        
	The two-wheeler industry is concerned that the rise in inflation will lead to an increase in interest rates, slowing demand and growth.        
	According to Pawan Munjal, managing director, Hero Honda, The single biggest issue that we have had in the two wheeler industrys decline is the interest rate. Not only is the rate very high, but also the banks have withdrawn from markets which happen to be very good markets for our sales.         
	In real estate, Omaxe executive director (finance) Vipin Agarwal said, It (rising rates) will have a very negative impact on the real estate industry. The demand has already slowed down and any further rise in the cash reserve ratio and interest rates will further dampen sentiments.         
	Basmati curbs        
	There was a mixed response to the governments decision today to withdraw the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme benefits of basmati rice exporters as a strategy to check inflation.        
	According to Prem Garg, managing director of basmati rice exporter Shivnath Rai Harnarain, Our costing will be affected as the DEPB relief on basmati rice is 1.5 per cent which translates to around $30 per tonne.        
	However, Abhay Lakhman, analyst, Religare Commodities, said, Indias only competitor is Pakistan. India produces and exports better varieties of basmati rice, hence exports of high quality rice are not likely to be affected.

	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Inflation rose marginally to 12.14 per cent for the week ended September 6 on the back of costlier fruits and vegetables.         
	The finance ministry described the increase as stable.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also expressed confidence that inflation would moderate further in the coming months.        
	The rise in the inflation rate  a week earlier it was 12.10 per cent  came as aviation turbine fuel turned cheaper because of falling global crude oil prices.        
	Prices of food and vegetables were up six per cent, while wheat and urad dal rose three per cent. Some minerals such as fire clay shot up 37 per cent.        
	Analysts said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) might hold on to current interest rates in its October policy review because of the changed global situation.        
	The RBI may either hold the interest rate or increase the repo by 25 basis points, said D. K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil.        
	Tushar Poddar of Goldman Sachs said, In view of the measures taken by the RBI this week, the probability of a rate hike during the October meeting has diminished.

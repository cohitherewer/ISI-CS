          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 23: Industry bodies Ficci, CII and Assocham have sought clarification from finance minister P. Chidambaram on whether they are liable to pay service tax.        
	The central board of excise and customs (CBEC) had served a showcause notice demanding Rs 33 crore as service tax from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and sought details on membership fee from the others.        
	Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said, I have spoken to the finance minister personally on whether the chambers are liable to pay service tax. To this, he clearly said chambers were non-profit making entities.        
	Mitra said Ficci was registered under section 25 of the companies act and was not liable to pay tax.         
	An entity registered under this section is considered a non-profit organisation and is free from tax liabilities.        
	He added that the chamber worked not only for industry but also for larger national interest. Our primary work is policy change ... This is not for industry (alone), he said.        
	Assocham, along with five of its regional promoter chambers, had also written a letter to the finance minister requesting him to consider chamber activities as charitable and make them eligible for tax exemption.        
	We and our promoter chambers have jointly submitted a memorandum to the finance minister to review this issue. We (the chambers) dont come under the purview of service tax, Assocham secretary-general D.S. Rawat told The Telegraph.        
	We are helping the government by providing the expertise, he added.         
	Sources said apex chamber CII had also taken up the issue with the finance minister. CII officials, however, were unavailable for comments.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The department of telecom (DoT) will soon issue licences to nine firms which got the letters of intent (LoIs) last month. This will be followed by the allocation of start-up spectrum to roll out mobile services. 
    
	However, DoT officials could not confirm the dates when the licences would be issued and spectrum allocated.
    
	Telecom minister A. Raja today signed the file and the DoT would soon start issuing unified access service (UAS) licence to new players, including real estate company Unitech Ltd and consumer electronics maker Videocon Industries, among others, said officials.
    
	As of now, nine aspirants  S Tel, Shyam Telelink, Swan Telecom, Loop Telecom (a subsidiary of BPL Telecom), Spice Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Teleservices, besides Unitech and Videocon units  have been invited to procure licences.
    
	The companies had deposited the requisite fees and bank guarantees with the DoT on the day they got the LoIs, vying with each other to become the first applicant to get spectrum. 
    
	However, with as many as seven new operators waiting to get telecom licences, the government is now finding it difficult to make adequate spectrum available to all of them. 
    
	The government will follow a first come, first served rule regarding payment of fees for the allocation of spectrum, even if the seniority is by a fraction of a second, senior officials said.
    
	Players may not object to this approach as all are likely to be accommodated simultaneously in circles where spectrum is available, they added.
    
	However, Idea Cellular and Spice Communications had warned the government that they should be considered ahead of others as their applications had been pending since December 2006.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Manufacturing output fell sharply during November, pulling down the countrys industrial growth to 5.3 per cent from 14.4 per cent in the same month a year ago. 
    
	Manufacturing output in November fell to 5.4 per cent from 15.7 per cent in the same period last year.
    
	Policy-makers said this could force the Reserve Bank to take a re-look at interest rates during the monetary policy review later this month. 
    
	Rate cut signal? 
    
	Union commerce minister Kamal Nath said, I see this as a signal to review consumer spending and may be loosening a bit (of monetary policy). He said he would not describe the situation as a slowdown. Economy has to guard against inflation, while propping up consumer spending, he added.
    
	Analysts differ
    
	Analysts feel the slide was because of the holidays and sluggishness in consumer goods and exports and will not trigger an interest rate cut.
    
	Output is usually less after Diwali, which was celebrated in November last year, Saumitra Chaudhuri, economic adviser at ICRA, said.
    
	HDFC Banks chief economist Abheek Barua echoed his view. Decline in the IIP is on account of shutting down of plants after Diwali. The IIP growth rate will go up to 8-9 per cent in the coming months, quot; he said.
    
	I dont think industrial output is the primary input in a monetary decision now. I dont think a rate cut will happen this time, he added.
    
	Sonal Varma, economist with Lehman Brothers, said the sharp slowdown was the result of base effects, loss of working days and tighter monetary conditions. We expect industrial output to grow 9.1 per cent in 2007-08, she added.
    
	Inflation data
    
	Separate data on Friday showed annual inflation of 3.5 per cent at the end of 2007. However, analysts expect it to go up as the impact of record oil prices will be felt.
    
	Markets were little moved after the data was announced, with the yield on the 10-year federal bond steady at 7.53 per cent, while the rupee was a tad stronger at 39.29 per dollar.

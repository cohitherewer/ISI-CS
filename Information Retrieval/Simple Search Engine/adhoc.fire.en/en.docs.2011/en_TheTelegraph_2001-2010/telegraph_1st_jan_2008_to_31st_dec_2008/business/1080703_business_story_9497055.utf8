The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twist to Sterlites Asarco bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Twist to Sterlites Asarco bid
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Agarwal: Tough competition                                  
	Calcutta, July 2: In a temporary setback to Anil Agarwals Sterlite Industries Ltd, a US court has allowed Grupo Mexico to bid for bankrupt American copper producer Asarco LLC.        
	Sterlite, the largest non-ferrous company in India, had won an auction to acquire the assets of Texas-based Asarco for $2.6 billion on May 30.        
	But Asarcos estranged parent, Grupo Mexico, then came back to the bidding game, offering as much as $4.2 billion for Asarco.        
	A bankruptcy court last night allowed Grupo Mexico to present its reorganisation plan.        
	This will in effect turn what seemed to be a straight takeover for the Indian company into a competitive bidding process.        
	The court has also allowed a break-up fee of $52 million and other protections sought by Sterlite. If the Asarco board approves the Grupo plan, Sterlite will get the fee.         
	When contacted, a Sterlite official said it was too premature to comment.        
	Grupo Mexico had lost control over Asarco three years back when the Tuscon-based company filed for bankruptcy.        
	Asarco, previously American Smelting and Refining Company, is an integrated copper mining, smelting and refining company with approximately 2,600 employees.         
	It operates mines, mills and a smelter in Arizona and a smelter and a refinery in Texas.        
	The company is 100 years old and the third largest copper producer in the US. It produced 235,000 tonnes of refined copper in 2007.         
	Asarcos mines currently have estimated reserves of approximately 5 million tonnes of contained copper.         
	For the year ended December 31, 2007, Asarco had total revenues of approximately $1.9 billion.        
	In the auction, Sterlite had bought only the assets of Asarco. It has not taken up the huge liabilities of Asarco.        
	From the reorganisation plan proposed by Grupo Mexico, it appears that the company wants to take over Asarco as a company and, in all probability, with liabilities.         
	The offers of Sterlite, which is a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange-listed Vedanta Resources Plc, and Grupo Mexico are, therefore, not comparable. It is before the bankruptcy court to decide on the offers.

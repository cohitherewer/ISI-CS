The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Monday meet on price spiral
                                                                                                               Monday meet on price spiral
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, March 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will review the rising prices of food and commodities on Monday and could come up with measures to cut duties and curb exports.        
	The cabinet committee on prices will meet on Monday, finance secretary D. Subbarao said today.        
	Singh will take stock of the situation with his cabinet colleagues, including agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, finance minister P. Chidambaram, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and commerce minister Kamal Nath.        
	The government may have to resort to a new round of measures to rein in inflation, analysts said. Fiscal concessions could include tax cuts on metals and food products. The government could further disincentivise exports and cut duties to bring down prices.        
	We expect commodity prices to go down when there is recession in the developed countries, Subbarao, who has been holding several internal meetings in the ministry, said.        
	If you look at past recessions in the US, there is usually some depression in commodity prices. But this time, there is an elevation in commodity prices together with signs of recession in the US, the finance secretary said.        
	Subbarao said exports had come under double pressure because of the appreciation of the rupee and low demand due to recession in the US.

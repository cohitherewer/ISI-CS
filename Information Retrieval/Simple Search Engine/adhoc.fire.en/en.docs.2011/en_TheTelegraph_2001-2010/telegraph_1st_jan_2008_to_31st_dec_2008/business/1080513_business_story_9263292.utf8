	Calcutta, May 12: Jindal Stainless Ltd has entered into a pact with Indonesias PT Antam Tbk to set up an integrated project in the Southeast Asian country.        
	The two companies today signed a joint venture agreement for the integrated project, which requires an investment of $700 million, or Rs 2,800 crore.        
	The project, which will be located in Southeast Sulawesi of Indonesia, will include a nickel smelting and stainless steel facility.        
	Antam will have a 55 per cent stake in the project and Jindal will own 45 per cent.         
	It will have an initial capacity of around 20,000 tonnes of contained nickel in ferro nickel and around 250,000 tonnes of stainless steel.        
	The project shall process nickel ore from Antams Mandiodo mine.        
	Whether the final product will be stainless steel slabs or stainless steel long products will be decided on the basis of a market survey that will be commissioned soon.        
	Antam will contribute with its expertise in mining and nickel processing and Jindal with its specialisation in stainless steel processing and marketing.        
	The combination of a stainless steel processing mill with a nickel plant and a mine will result in significant cost savings, making the venture highly competitive.        
	The joint venture is likely to be called as PT Antam Jindal Stainless Indonesia.         
	Construction is expected to start from early 2009 and the plant is expected to be commissioned by the middle of 2011.

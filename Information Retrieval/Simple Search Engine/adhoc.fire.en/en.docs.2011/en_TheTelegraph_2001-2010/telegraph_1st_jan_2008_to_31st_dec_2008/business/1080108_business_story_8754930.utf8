     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The government is disappointed that the money invested in the farm sector has not helped raise farm productivity.
    
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today expressed dismay at the fact that the huge sums being pumped in by the government in irrigation and farm extension have not helped raise productivity or increase the number of acres under irrigation. Government had allocated over Rs 8,000 crore to agriculture.
    
	He was speaking to leaders in the agriculture sector, farm economists and agro processing companies during a pre-budget consultation.
    
	We told him that the way out could be to encourage projects in the public-private domain besides involvement of farmers in implementation of projects, said agricultural expert P. Chengal Reddy. 
    
	Ashok Gulati, Asian director of the International Food Policy Research Institute, said: The finance minister is quite concerned that productivity in the farm sector has stagnated. Production of wheat and rice are not going up... So there is a concern that we need to increase the productivity and overall production.
    
	The finance minister also expressed his helplessness over the demand of direct fertiliser subsidy to farmers, stating that there was a lack of political consensus on the issue, Reddy added. 
    
	As part of the farm package which may be worked out, Nabard has sought to issue tax free bonds, officials said. 
    
	The government has adopted a policy of discouraging tax free bonds, but officials said it might consider them as Nabard needed to refinance itself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms on security alert
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Firms on security alert

	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Firms are realising the need to beef up their security apparatus after the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	Security is not a box to be bought, but a long-term solution. There have been so many attacks and blasts in the past and every time theres a huge demand to increase security. But nothing really comes out of it, said Pramoud Rao, managing director of Zicom, a Mumbai-based security system provider.        
	He said Zicom got flooded with queries from government agencies, commercial entities and residential associations, but sales had not really gone up. Zicom Electronic Security Systems, Bartronics, Gemini Communications and Bharat Electronics are some of the top manufacturers of security systems.         
	Security companies feel companies need to build up an arsenal of protective devices.         
	There should be vehicle scanners, turnstiles and metal detectors at entry points. Once inside, X-ray baggage machines, biometric identification systems, a trained team of guards and advanced CCTV cameras should be in place. However, analysts said less than 10 per cent of companies had such a set-up.        
	The Confederation of All India Traders has sought citizen policing and the augmentation of security surveillance.        
	The analysts said surveillance needed to be more intrusive. Multiple checks, including complete car scans, guests identification requests, all-luggage scans and action-sensor cameras can help plug gaps.         
	According to industry chamber Assocham, companies will now increase their security budgets by 35-40 per cent. The private security business in India will become a Rs 50,000-crore industry in four years as firms have increased their spending on safeguards after the Mumbai terror strikes, it said.        
	We are seeing a rise in demand in the last six months, essentially from top-end residential projects, said Sudhir Rao, chief executive officer of Bartronics.

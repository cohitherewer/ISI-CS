	New Delhi, Feb. 4 (pti): Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said he was a bit sceptical about achieving the $160-billion export target for this fiscal because of a global slowdown, particularly in the US, and the sharp rise in the rupee.
    
	However, Nath was confident of exports being in the range of $150-155 billion by the end of 2007-08.
    
	Nath was speaking on the sidelines of a book release function organised by the Council for Leather Exports.
    
	Nath said the government was giving a priority to labour-intensive sectors such as leather, toys and sport goods to increase their competitiveness.

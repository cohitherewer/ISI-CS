     OUR CORRESPONDENT, 
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 17: Sebi has proposed that for initial public offerings (IPOs) of up to Rs 250 crore there should be a price band of 25 per cent on the issue price on the day of listing.
    
	This is meant to help those long-term investors who see the value of their holdings shoot up dramatically on the first day of trading only to fall subsequently. 
    
	Recently, it has been noticed that there are significant price and volume spikes on the day of listing of IPOs. This was particularly noticed in IPOs of issue size up to Rs 250 crore, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said. 
    
	It said public holdings in many such IPOs were as high as 25-30 per cent of a companys equity capital and the price may not sustain on subsequent days leading to long-term investors becoming dissatisfied. 
    
	Before arriving at the proposed price band, Sebi reviewed IPOs in the context of their issue size, price variations on the day of listing, maximum variations on the day of listing as well as price variations on subsequent days.
    
	Currently, stock exchanges do not apply price bands on the day of listing of an IPO for issues up to Rs 500 crore. On subsequent days there is a price band of 20 per cent.

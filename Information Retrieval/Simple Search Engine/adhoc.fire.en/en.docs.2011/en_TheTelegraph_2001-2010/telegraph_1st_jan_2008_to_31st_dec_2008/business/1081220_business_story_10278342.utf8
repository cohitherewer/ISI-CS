          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          K.V. Kamath and Chanda Kochhar in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)      
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: Existing home loan borrowers of ICICI Bank can look forward to reduced EMIs in the days ahead, according to Chanda Kochhar who has been anointed as the successor to chief executive officer K.V. Kamath.        
	ICICI Bank had cut its loan rates for new borrowers earlier this month by 150 basis points. But the benefit had not been extended to the banks existing borrowers.         
	Kochhar was talking to reporters after the board of directors elevated Kamath to the position of a non-executive chairman. Kamath will replace Narayan Vaghul who retires next year.        
	Both Kamath and Kochhar, who have been awarded five-year tenures, will take up their new positions on May 1, 2009.         
	Kochhar, who is now the joint managing director of the bank, said there were several signs of a fall in interest rates. One of the key signals was the sharp correction in the yields of government securities, which had impacted wholesale deposit rates as well.        
	The interest rate cycle is turning. Gradually, the cost of funds and lending rates will come down, she added.        
	Kochhar said the bank would reduce its interest rates (both deposit and lending) as and when its cost of funds decreases.        
	Kamath, who will lay down his executive responsibilities from April 30 next year, forecast that inflation would be in the range of 2.5 to 3 per cent. Single digit lending rate and double-digit growth is what we should look forward to one year from now, he said.        
	Kochhar takes over at a time when the banking sector has been hit by the economic slowdown and there are concerns that this can result in defaults going up.        
	However, she said ICICI Bank was in a better position because of its solid capital position, healthy distribution network and strong retail and corporate presence.        
	Kochhar also revealed that the bank had received approval from the Reserve Bank of India to open 600 branches across the country.

	Mumbai, May 5: Pune-based DS Kulkarni has braved the US sub-prime crisis to commence work on a housing project in New Jersey, which is close to New York.        
	A year-and-a-half back, we purchased a 12-acre land in Princeton in New Jersey and plan to develop 11 single family customised homes. According to the rules in the US, our site work building road and electricity connection  is complete, said Sumit Arora, vice-president (strategic planning and business development), DS Kulkarni Developers Ltd.        
	The company is targeting New Jerseys large Indian population. The development is happening in a place called Plainsboro, which has a good academic environment, too, he said.        
	It plans to sell 11, 6,000-square-foot duplex homes for $1.2-1.3 million each.         
	Our sample home is ready and the first one to be put up for sale will be ready by July this year. We expect to close our first sale by July-August this year, Arora told The Telegraph.        
	The project is being developed by DSK Woods LLC, which is a 100 per cent subsidiary of DSK Developers Corp. The company has invested $10 million in the project. It has raised another $8 million from local debt.        
	The five-bedroom homes will mostly attract Asian buyers. We have tried to keep in mind a very Asian clientele. We have customised the homes to suit their tastes, said Arora.        
	DS Kulkarni, which came out with its follow on offer in 2006, will also be looking at funding in the later stages. The company does not plan to induct a private equity investor.        
	Indian developers have set up housing projects in West Asia, especially Dubai, because of the sops provided by the government and favourable laws. However, such projects are rare in the US.        
	The Hiranandanis, Akruti City, Ansal Properties, the Rahejas, the Seth group and HDIL are some of the prominent developers in West Asia.        
	 A lot of Indians are planning to have a home abroad. These serve mostly as either a second home or a home for their children who are studying in the US. New Jersey and California are some of the prominent locations, said Pranay Vakil, chairman of Knight Frank India.

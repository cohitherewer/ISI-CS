                                                                                                               Chip hub draws big names
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 3: The government has received investment proposals worth Rs 65,000 crore for chip manufacturing units and solar cell facilities.         
	Reliance Industries is leading the pack with an investment proposal of Rs 30,500 crore for two units that will make photovoltaic cells and semiconductor chips.         
	The semiconductor chip unit will be set up first at an investment of Rs 18,521 crore over 10 years. The facility will come up at Navi Mumbai, Hyderabad, Mysore or Haryana. The company will decide on the location after negotiations for incentives with each state.         
	The solar cell plant will be set up at a cost of Rs 11,631 crore at Jamnagar, Gujarat. Semiconductor chips are used in electronic equipment, mobiles, computers, SIM and smart cards. Photovoltaic or solar cells convert solar energy into electric energy, which can be used to power equipment and recharge a battery.        
	The government, which has offered fiscal incentives to help build a hub for semiconductors and chip makers, said the two plants would create 15,000 jobs.        
	Reliance plans to start work on the units in the next 8-10 months and wants to float a special purpose vehicle, said sources.        
	RIL may also acquire chip units in Korea and Taiwan, sources said. The company is in talks with Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Infineon for a tie-up.        
	Videocon also plans to set up an LCD fabrication plant at an investment of Rs 8,000 crore in Navi Mumbai.        
	Other proposals include Signet Solars solar photovoltaic plant at an investment of Rs 9,672 crore and Moser Baer PV Technologies proposal for a silicon cells, modules and thin film concentrators facility for Rs 6,000 crore.         
	KSK Energy Ventures also plans a solar panel facility at an investment of Rs 3,211 crore, while Titan Energy System proposes a solar cells manufacturing unit at an investment of Rs 5,880 crore.

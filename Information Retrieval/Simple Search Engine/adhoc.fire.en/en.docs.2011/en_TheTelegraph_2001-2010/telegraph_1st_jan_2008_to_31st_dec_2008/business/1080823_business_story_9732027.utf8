	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The tussle between the commerce and the finance ministries over interest rate relief to labour-intensive export items is heading for the Prime Ministers Office.        
	While the finance ministry wants the scheme to be discontinued by the end of September because the interest subvention (relief) puts an additional fiscal burden, the commerce ministry wants the four-per-cent subvention to continue. The country has set a $200-billion export target for this fiscal, up from $150 billion in the last fiscal.        
	Caught in the middle are exporters who are facing higher input costs, a rising interest rate and decline in global demand.        
	Officials said commerce minister Kamal Nath had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking his intervention to ensure the continuation of the relief to textiles and other labour-intensive sectors as they were facing stiff competition from neighbouring countries.        
	They said the finance ministry was opposed to the continuation of the scheme as it was announced in the wake of the appreciation of the rupee.         
	Since the rupee has depreciated against the dollar, there is no case for such a sop.        
	The RBI has notified the closure of the subvention scheme with effect from September 30. It has asked banks to notify the move to exporters to give them adequate time to make the necessary adjustments.         
	In April, the scheme had been extended by a year till March 31, 2009.        
	Under the scheme, exporters will get a 2 per cent relief on pre-shipment and post-shipment credit in various sectors, especially employment-intensive ones such as handicrafts, textiles, leather and leather products, carpets and marine products.

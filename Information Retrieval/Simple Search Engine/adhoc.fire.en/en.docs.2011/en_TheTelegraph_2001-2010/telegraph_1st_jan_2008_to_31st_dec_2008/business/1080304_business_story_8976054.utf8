     A.M. NAIK
               
	T he finance minister has done a commendable job in balancing political, social and economic compulsions in this budget. 
    
	Riding on the back of a robust growth rate, he has focused on inclusive growth with initiatives in sectors such as education, rural housing, roads, drinking water, health and agriculture. 
    
	Recognising the move towards a knowledge-based future, the budget provided for the creation of skill training institutes, IITs and Indian Institutes of Science. This is a welcome move forward.
    
	The finance minister has attempted to revive both investment and consumption, while retaining the focus on inclusive growth. 
    
	Investment in the economy is already at a new peak and the momentum will continue in light of the increased gross budgetary support as well as an additional Rs 10,000 crore earmarked for capital expenditure. 
    
	The farm loan waiver as well as the thrust on credit for several socially relevant sectors and support programmes for marginalised sections will add to the equitable growth initiatives.
    
	He has shifted focus from outlay to outcome. Monitoring and efficient administration of the various schemes will be critical to effective implementation of these programmes.
    
	He has provided growth impetus to several key sectors, especially power, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. 
    
	The continued focus on infrastructure projects such as the national highways programme and the ultra mega power projects is critical for economic development.
    
	By raising the personal income tax exemption limits and rationalising the tax slabs, Chidambaram has ensured that the common man has a higher disposable income. This will result in increased demand and will stimulate growth.
    
	Good infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic development. The emphasis on the national highway development programmes and on the irrigation and water management projects will boost the manufacturing and capital goods industry.
    
	In keeping with his commitment, the finance minister has continued to pursue the process of a reduction of excise duty. However, the reduction in peak customs duty on project imports will further adversely affect Indian manufacturers from artificially priced Chinese competition.
    
	The decision to eliminate the cascading effect of the dividend distribution tax is a step in the right direction. 
    
	The finance ministers intention to widen the market for corporate bonds, currency and derivatives will provide an additional avenue for funding the infrastructure sector.
    
	The finance minister has managed to keep fiscal and revenue deficits in check and has created an effective tax administration that has increased collections significantly in the last few years.
    
	This budget recognises the reality of large capital inflows and aims to monitor them without moderating them. This is necessary to contain inflation without affecting the rate of growth.
    
	Larsen and Toubro chairman and managing director A.M. Naiks column was inadvertently messed up in the Budget Special of The Telegraph on March 1. We are reproducing it. The error is regretted.

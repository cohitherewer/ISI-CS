The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Regulator mum on city gas price
                                                                                                               Regulator mum on city gas price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 1: The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board today laid down criteria for companies bidding for city gas distribution projects but did not specify the price at which consumers would get the gas.        
	The projects will be awarded through a competitive bidding process on the basis of a network tariff, gas compression charges, the length of a pipeline to be laid and the number of households to be covered in a city, the oil regulator said in a statement.        
	An industry official said since the regulations did not give any weightage to the final consumer price, it would favour companies which had their own source. They can bid for very low network tariff and win the bids, the official said.        
	The government plans to roll out city gas networks in about 200 cities over the next five years. This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore, which works out to about Rs 300 crore per city.        
	At present, only about half a million people use natural gas, which is about 30 per cent cheaper than the traditional liquefied petroleum gas. The government aims to extend the reach of city gas to 20 million households over the next few years.        
	Piped natural gas is distributed to retail customers in a few cities by companies such as Indraprashtha Gas, Mahanagar Gas and Gujarat Gas.        
	A company winning the rights to set up a gas network in a city will have five-year marketing exclusivity. After five years, the network will be thrown open to competition but a fresh entrant will not be allowed to lay a new pipeline. It will have to use the existing network for which it has to pay a fee to the original operator, the oil regulator said.        
	The original company will have lifetime exclusivity of 25 years for the pipeline network.        
	Companies such as Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas, which already have gas distribution projects in New Delhi and Mumbai, respectively, will have to reapply for authorisation.        
	Moreover, the marketing exclusivity for them will be three years compared with five years for firms operating in new cities.

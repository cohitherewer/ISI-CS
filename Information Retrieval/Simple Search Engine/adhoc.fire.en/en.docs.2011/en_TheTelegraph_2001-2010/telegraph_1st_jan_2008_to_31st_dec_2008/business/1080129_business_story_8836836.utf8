	Calcutta, Jan. 28: Realty company Emaar MGF Land will invest between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 1,200 crore in three hotel projects in Calcutta.        
	The company, part owned by Dubai-based developer Emaar, has already started work on a twin hotel complex on the EM Bypass. It has also signed a deal with the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) for a hotel on Russell Street.        
	There will be a 300-room JW Marriott and a 250-room Holiday Inn on the 6.24-acre EM Bypass plot by the end of 2010. It will unveil a 300-room Park Hyatt on the RCTC property.        
	The company is also planning integrated townships in and around the city.         
	The first of the lot is coming up on a 40-acre land along the Kona Expressway, with a built-in 100-room budget hotel and other amenities. Three more townships are in the pipeline.

	Calcutta, Sept. 24: LG Electronics India is looking at a turnover of Rs 11,000 crore by the end of this year.        
	The Korean consumer durables firm is revamping its strategy as sales in July-August failed to meet expectations because of factors such as high input costs and inflation.        
	We are in the process of revamping our strategy and have been absorbing most of the costs till now without passing on the same to customers. We plan to reach Rs 11,000-crore turnover by the end of this year out of which the television segment is set to contribute around Rs 3,000 crore, said Amitabh Tiwari, business group head (consumer electronics and kitchen appliances), LG Electronics India.         
	Last year, the company reported a turnover of Rs 9,500 crore. LG is aiming at a 30 per cent market share in the flat-panel segment by the end of 2008. Of the total television sales this year, around Rs 600-650 crore came from LCD television.        
	Tiwari said the company expected the global financial meltdown to have a recessionary impact on the Indian market.        
	LG Electronics had raised prices of its colour televisions by about four per cent from August 1.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug 19: Rupert Murdoch-owned STAR Group is exiting Balaji Telefilms Ltd.        
	STAR is is selling its 25.99 per cent stake to the Indian promoters of Balaji Telefilms for Rs 190 per share that translates into a little over Rs 322 crore.        
	The Murdoch company had bought the stake at a little over Rs 120 crore in 2004.        
	The two sides are also modifying a content supply agreement under which Balaji Telefilms was not allowed to showcase their shows on certain prime time slots on other channels.         
	As part of the process of disengagement, agreements that were signed between Balaji Telefilms and STAR in April 2007 relating to joint ventures for regional language channels have also been terminated.

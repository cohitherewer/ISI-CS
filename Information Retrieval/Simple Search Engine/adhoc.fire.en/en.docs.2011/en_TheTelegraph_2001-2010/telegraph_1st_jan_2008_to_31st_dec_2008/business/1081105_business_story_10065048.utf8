The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh Birla petitions to thwart Lodhas 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fresh Birla petitions to thwart Lodhas 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Harsh Lodha: Long battle                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 4: The Birlas have opened another legal front in the battle to wrest control over Birla Corporation Ltd, the flagship company of the MP Birla empire which is now governed by the Lodhas.        
	Family members of the Birlas have filed two separate petitions before the Company Law Board (CLB) seeking to block the change in the ownership of the shares in the two investment companies belonging to Birla Corp.        
	The petitions also sought to appoint an administrator for the shares of Gwalior Webbing and Baroda Agents that the late Rajendra Singh Lodha had transferred to himself after the death of Priyamvada Birla. Gwalior Webbing is a key investment company of the MP Birla group.        
	Priyamvada Birla had a majority stake in the company that has holdings in nine manufacturing firms within the group, including Birla Corp, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Ericsson, through a maze of investment companies.        
	The petitions were filed by the sisters of M.P. Birla  Radha Devi Mohta and late Laxmi Devi Newar (through her executors). The petitions in effect sought to block the transfer of the shares to Harsh Lodha. The latest move comes close after the Lodhas obtained stay orders from courts in Calcutta and Jabalpur and foiled attempts by the Birla family to free the MP Birla flagship from Lodha control.        
	The Telegraph reported yesterday that Rameshwara Jute Mills, a Birla-controlled company, had filed two interim petitions in an ongoing case involving Birla Corp and Vindhya Telelinks.         
	The Birlas had received a favourable result from the CLB which passed an interim order restraining Birla Corp from holding any board meetings except to adopt quarterly results. This order was stayed by Calcutta High Court on October 24. Jabalpur High Court stayed the entire proceedings with respect to Vindhya Telelinks.        
	The petitions by the sisters of MP Birla were filed yesterday. The case came up for hearing before the CLB bench in Delhi where heated arguments took place today.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of solicitor firm Fox amp; Mandal and counsel for Lodha, said the CLB did not pass any interim injunction. It had asked affidavits to be filed and the matter to be heard subsequently.        
	These attempts are considered by our clients as an attempt to cripple the function of the MP Birla group and take advantage of a tragedy, Mandal told The Telegraph.

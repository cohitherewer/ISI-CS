                              Sarin: Strong outlook                            
	London, July 22 (PTI): British telecom giant Vodafone today posted a 19.1 per cent jump in revenues at 9.8 billion for the quarter ended June 30, propelled by strong growth in India and Europe, among other regions.        
	During the three months ended June, the company added 8.5 million subscribers across the world, which took the total subscriber base to 269 million.        
	The firm registered more than 50 per cent growth in total revenue in India.        
	However, Vodafones India-born chief executive Arun Sarin, who will be stepping down later this month, said the company faced a more challenging environment.        
	Notwithstanding this more challenging operating environment, we continue to benefit from a diversity of assets and services, with strong revenue growth in eastern Europe, West Asia, Africa and the Asia-Pacific and another good quarter of data revenue growth offsetting weakness in Spain, Sarin said in a statement.        
	While we expect revenues around the bottom of the outlook range, our continued focus on cost reduction enables us to reiterate our operating profit and cash flow guidance for the year, he added.        
	In the June quarter, India accounted for most of the increase in subscribers in the Europe-Asia region, which saw an addition of 7.8 million new customers.        
	India accounted for most of the increase, adding 5.1 million customers in the quarter. The total customer base in the region reached 122.6 million and included 49.2 million customers in India, making it the largest subsidiary by customers within the Vodafone group, the statement said.         
	Further, Vodafone has estimated revenues for the current fiscal to be on the lower end of the projections.        
	Revenue is now expected to be around the bottom of the 39.8 billion to 40.7 billion outlook range, reflecting first quarter performance, recent economic weakness and lower than expected equipment revenue, the telecom major said.        
	Following the warning that the topline would be hit by the economic slowdown, shares of Vodafone plunged as much as 12 per cent on the London Stock Exchange. In early morning trade, the scrip was trading at 130.25 pence, down 12.73 per cent.        
	The results will be the last for Sarin, who will be replaced on July 29 by his deputy, Vittorio Colao, after five years.        
	Sarin had spearheaded Vodafones push into emerging markets to offset slowing growth in more mature European countries, but analysts questioned whether this would now be enough.

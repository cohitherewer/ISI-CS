The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel, farm futures ban on agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Steel, farm futures ban on agenda
										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      Govt to leave no stone unturned to stamp out inflation                  
	New Delhi, April 15: The government is likely to introduce more tough measures to curb inflation, including a ban on futures trading in several farm commodities and steel.                     
	Inflation raced to 7.41 per cent in late March, its highest since November 2004, because of a rise in the prices of metals, food and fuel.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram said more steps were in the offing. I do not know when the cabinet committee on prices will meet but when it meets, I expect some measures.         
	Edible oil is one of the commodities facing a ban on futures trading, officials said.        
	Over the past one-and-a-half month, the government has covered rice exporters, steel and cement makers in a swathe of curbs to check prices.        
	Civil supplies inspectors in Maharashtra and Delhi raided grain godowns over the weekend, while the Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat governments imposed limits on the stock of foodgrains that traders can keep to prevent hoarding.        
	After the crackdown on traders, the prices of some food products fell 5 per cent in three days, traders said.        
	The cabinet committee on prices is expected to decide on banning steel exports, slashing the duty on steel and zinc imports to zero, reducing the countervailing duty on construction-grade steel and hiking export duties on iron ore.        
	However, the duty on iron ore has sparked a debate among the commerce, finance and the steel ministries.        
	If the duty on iron ore exports is raised, it could be 15 per cent of the value of exports, instead of the present Rs 50 a tonne on low-grade ore and Rs 300 a tonne on high-grade ore.         
	The commerce ministry is opposing the move to slap higher duties on iron ore exports, arguing it would kill exports. Besides, the mining industry has already made long-term commitments to overseas buyers. However, the finance ministry is unwilling to reduce taxes on steel items, unless there is a commensurate rise in the iron ore levy.        
	The steel ministry is pressing for a higher tax on ore export as it will keep ore at home and reduce its prices, which will benefit steel makers.

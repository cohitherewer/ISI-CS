	Calcutta, May 11: Deloitte amp; Touche Consulting India is considering buyouts in the domestic consulting space.        
	We are interested in acquisitions in the consulting space. This is part of our focus on servicing the Indian market better as our clients re-orient themselves to tap the opportunities here, said Roopen Roy, managing director of Deloitte amp; Touche Consulting India.        
	Roy declined to comment on whether Deloitte was in talks with prospective companies.         
	Consulting makes up $8.9 billion, or 45 per cent of Deloittes global revenues of $20-billion in 2006. In the US, consulting fetched $3 billion, second only to auditing which garnered $9 billion.

	According to global estimates, the demand for consultants at the Big Four in the last two years has increased around 15 times. The Big Four is the worlds four top accountancy and professional services firms, comprising KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst amp; Young and Deloitte.        
	Deloitte recently won an Asian Development Bank project for deploying information and communication technology for e-governance in Assam.        
	The project involves a feasibility study for identifying cost effective technologies and a pilot plan in one location demonstrating the use of the technology in the PPP model and developing a plan for subsequent scaling up, Roy added.

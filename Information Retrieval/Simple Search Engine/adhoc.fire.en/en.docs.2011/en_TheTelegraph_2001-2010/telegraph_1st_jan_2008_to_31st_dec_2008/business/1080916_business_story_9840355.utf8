                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Emami sweetens Zandu open offer 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Emami has upped the ante against the warring promoters of pharmaceutical company Zandu which it intends to acquire.        
	The city-based FMCG player has more than doubled the open offer price for minority shareholders of Zandu to Rs 15,000 a share compared with Rs 7,315 apiece offered in June this year.        
	If fully accepted, the open offer will cost Emami Rs 241.92 crore. The Zandu scrip was stuck at the lower circuit in a weak Bombay Stock Exchange today, closing five per cent down at Rs 16,728.         
	While the market price is still higher than the open offer price by more than 10 per cent, it is still off its peak by 32 per cent. The stock had skyrocketed in May after Emami announced that it bought a 23.6 per cent stake from the Vaidya family, one of the promoters of Zandu. The share price went up further after the other Zandu promoter, the Parikh family, opposed Emamis move to gain control of the company.        
	The Parikhs moved the Company Law Board as well as market regulator Sebi to stop the acquisition and the subsequent open offer for acquiring another 20 per cent from the minority shareholders.        
	However, the Company Law Board set aside its complaint, while Sebi allowed the open offer. Following the clearance from the market regulator, Emami today raised the offer price. The schedule of the offer will be announced soon.        
	We have always kept the interest of minority shareholders in mind and thus decided to come up with a revised offer in the wake of prevailing market trends. This is an excellent opportunity for the shareholders to realise the best value for their shares, Harsh V. Agarwal, director of Emami, said in a statement.        
	The Parikh family holds about a 33 per cent stake in Zandu and Emami around 27.5 per cent. The Parikhs have spurned an Emami offer to share management jointly.

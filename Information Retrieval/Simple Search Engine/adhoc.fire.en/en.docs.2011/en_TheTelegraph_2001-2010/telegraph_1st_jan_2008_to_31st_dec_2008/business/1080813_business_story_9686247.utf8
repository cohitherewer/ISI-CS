The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Weak industry show spreads gloom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Weak industry show spreads gloom
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Industry grew 5.4 per cent in June this year compared with 9.8 per cent growth a year ago.        
	For the April-June quarter, too, growth was much lower at 5.2 per cent compared with 10.3 per cent a year ago.        
	Analysts blamed the discouraging show on high interest rates, while worried finance ministry bureaucrats said they would brainstorm to arrest the slide.        
	What is worrying is that the growth of six core infrastructure industries, which include mining, petroleum, electricity and steel and account for 26.68 per cent of industrial production, has also slowed down, said officials.        
	Data for six core infrastructure industries, which were also released today, showed their growth at a sluggish 3.5 per cent in the April-June quarter against 6.4 per cent a year ago.        
	Except coal, almost all industries underperformed, a plan panel advisor said.         
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, told The Telegraph that the IIP figures go to prove that overall industrial performance in India continued to remain weak. According to Joshi, the growth rate has halved because of monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over the past year coupled with the slowing down of global economy and pressures coming from high commodity prices, particularly crude oil.        
	We are in an industrial scenario which appears decisively weak. The IIP may pick up but it is going to be slightly subdued vis-a-vis last year. The underlying trend is that growth is weakening, he added.        
	Amid the slowdown in industrial growth, the Prime Ministers economic advisory council will release its economic outlook for the current fiscal tomorrow. It is likely to scale down the growth projection to 7.5-8 per cent from the earlier 8.5 per cent.        
	Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, Industry is expectantly looking at the government to move ahead with the reforms agenda to give a leg-up to industrial growth.        
	Sonal Varma, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said the sharp surge in interest costs over the past two months, rising margin pressure on firms, weakening foreign demand and infrastructure bottlenecks had moderated industry growth. We expect this weakness to spread to the services sector because of the financial sector turbulence.

	The markets reacted sharply to the fall in industrial growth with the benchmark sensex taking a hit of over 290 points to cut its five-day winning streak.        
	The sensex opened strong and even touched a high of 15579.78 but turned negative after the release of data on industrial production.        
	Marketmen said bourses rose in early trade tracking the fall in global crude prices to below $113 a barrel in Asian trade today and the overnight rise on Wall Street. However, weak IIP (index of industrial production) data dampened the positive sentiment.        
	 The sensex finally ended at 15212.13, a fall of 291.79 points, or 1.88 per cent, over its previous close.

   OUR CORRESPONDENT
        
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today recommended a bidding process for licences to mobile TV service providers. 
 
	Releasing its recommendations on mobile TV, Trai said spectrum would come with the licence. 
 
	According to Trai chairman Nripendra Misra, With the advent of mobile television services in the country, consumers will get more choice in watching television in terms of what they watch, how they watch and when they watch. 
 
	Service providers have two options: offer the service using a telecom network with already-allotted spectrum or the broadcasting method.
 
	The service will be digital, with the choice of technology left to the service provider, though the technology must be recognised by an authorised body.
 
	Trai said existing telecom operators would not require an extra licence and could offer the service using spectrum in their possession.
 
	Licences, however, were necessary for those who would use the broadcast method. Trai also proposed a limit of 74 per cent for foreign direct investment, while fixing the tenure of a licence at 10 years. Broadcasting entities cannot hold more than 20 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of an operator.
 
	For better utilisation of spectrum, the sharing of the terrestrial transmission infrastructure of Doordarshan should be permitted on a mutual agreement basis and in a non-discriminatory manner. 
 
	Mobile TV operators, too, will have to offer their infrastructure for sharing. Broadcasting entities cannot hold more than 20 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of an operator.

	Mumbai, June 27: Rising interest rates and a falling demand may dent the realty market in India. However, the long-term prospects for the sector continue to be good, feels the industry.         
	At a seminar on the real estate market in India here today, most of the realty players admitted that there was a liquidity crunch because of the rise in interest rates. However, this is not going to deter long-term investors from investing in India, they added.        
	Termed as Elephant Investors, these investors such as pension funds and endowment funds are just waiting in the wings to enter the Indian market, said Ajoy Veer Kapoor, managing director of Saffron Asset Advisors Pvt Ltd.        
	There are around 21 India-dedicated real estate funds that are raising money in the international market. In the next nine months, I believe nearly $7 billion will be entering the country through various India-dedicated funds, Kapoor said.         
	While long-term players are looking at India, short-term players based in the US and Europe, such as the hedge funds and private equity players, are more interested in their local markets, said Alex Hayim, director of REIT Property Management India.

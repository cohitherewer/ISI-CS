                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Giuliani to guide Ranbaxy
                            
	New York, Sept. 18 (PTI): Ranbaxy Laboratories has hired former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani as an adviser after the US blocked the import of 30 of its generic drugs citing manufacturing deficiencies.        
	The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued two warning letters to Ranbaxy alleging procedural violations at its plants at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh and Paonta Sahib in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Giuliani, a high-profile Republican leader and former US attorney in Manhattan, will provide advice and review compliance issues. Ranbaxy has been accused of selling generic drugs, which did not meet FDA standards.        
	The regulators said they would not approve more drugs manufactured at the two plants until their concerns were met. The firm said it would try to swiftly resolve the issues.        
	The regulators alleged that the company used raw chemicals from unapproved sources and fabricated data to meet FDA standards.        
	Giuliani, whose popularity skyrocketed for effective handling of the situation after the September 11, 2001 terrorist strike on the World Trade Center, had unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this year which was ultimately clinched by John McCain.        
	Announcing the appointment of Giuliani, Ranbaxy affirmed its commitment to co-operate with the FDA to address the issues and put into place measures, which will allow its products to be released in the US.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BA, Qantas in merger talks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BA, Qantas in merger talks

	London, Dec. 2 (Reuters): British Airways is in talks with Australias Qantas Airways about a merger, signaling further consolidation in an industry struggling to cut costs in the economic downturn.        
	British Airways (BA) also said in a statement that prior merger talks between it and Iberia were continuing.        
	BA has previously said it is determined to be at the forefront of industry consolidation. It is in talks with Iberia and American and this is of a piece with those efforts, Blue Oar Securities airline analyst Douglas McNeill said.        
	They are out to create a global player, which is an audacious goal that would be difficult for any management team to pull off, he said.        
	Any merger with Qantas would be via a dual-listed company structure, BA said.        
	In 1993, BA acquired 25 per cent of Qantas in the first step toward privatisation of the Australian carrier but sold out 11 years later.        
	Its a good move for BA and Qantas, a trader said. Basically, it means they would have got long-haul flight-sharing with Qantas. Qantas has a big exposure in the Far East, so ultimately it will cut down the cost for BA.        
	Earlier on Tuesday, Australian transport minister Anthony Albanese said Qantas would remain majority Australian-owned. A discussion paper for the industry, to be released on Tuesday by the government, would keep the existing cap on foreign ownership of Qantas at 49 per cent, Albanese said.        
	But he said he would not be opposed to one foreign airline buying 49 per cent of Qantas, the worlds 10th largest airline by market value, which has slashed jobs to combat the economic downturn.        
	Shares of British Airways, which had been up 5.1 per cent ahead of the announcement, extended their gains to trade as much as 17.5 per cent higher at a two-month high of 164 pence.

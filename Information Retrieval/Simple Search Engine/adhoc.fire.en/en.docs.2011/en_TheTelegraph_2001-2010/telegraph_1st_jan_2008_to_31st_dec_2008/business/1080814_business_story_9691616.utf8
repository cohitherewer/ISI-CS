	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Argentum Motors, floated by former Hyundai president B.V.R Subbu, has acquired a controlling stake in Heulize S.A, a French automobile design and engineering company, for Rs 158 crore.         
	Argentum, which bought the production facility of erstwhile Daewoo Motors, is engaged in contract manufacturing of automobiles.        
	Heulize became bankrupt in December last year. The French district court in Bressuire today approved, the safeguard plan proposed by Argentum and Groupe Henri Heuliez and Heuliez SA.        
	It is learnt that the terms and conditions of the new agreement between Heuliez and Argentum were presented to the court, which looked into the French firms bankruptcy protection proceedings.        
	Heuliez specialises in retractable hardtop roofs for cars.        
	Gerard Queveau, chairman of the supervisory board of Groupe Henri Heuliez, said, This is a new beginning for Heuliez. The entry of Argentum will bring new opportunities and open new markets for Heuliez.

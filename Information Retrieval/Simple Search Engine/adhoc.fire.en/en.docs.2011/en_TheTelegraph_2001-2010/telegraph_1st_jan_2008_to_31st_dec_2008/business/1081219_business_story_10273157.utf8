          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Inflation dropped to a nine-month low of 6.84 per cent, providing the Reserve Bank of India much needed headroom to take aggressive monetary measures.        
	Analysts said the central bank might cut interest rates sharply to arrest a deflationary trend in the economy. The textbook definition of deflation is falling prices accompanied by declining output and employment.         
	The greater-than-expected fall in prices also sparked brisk buying on the bourses helping the benchmark sensex on the Bombay Stock Exchange to close above the crucial 10,000-point level for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half months.         
	Inflation dipped 1.16 percentage points for the week ended December 6 from 8 per cent in the previous week, mainly because of a reduction in the prices of petrol and diesel. The government had cut the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 2 per litre, respectively, earlier this month.        
	The inflation trend is clear and this will translate into lower interest rates. The RBI must be keeping a watch and take steps if necessary, said Ashok Chawla, the economic affairs secretary in the finance ministry.        
	N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said, If there is no offtake of credit available in the market and with continued stimulus package for different sectors, there is a fear that this can result in a deflationary trend in the economy.        
	According to Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities, We expect monetary and fiscal policy responses to continue. We expect a second fiscal stimulus package and we are pencilling in a 250-basis-point cut in the cash reserve ratio, a 150-basis-point cut in the repo rate and a 100-basis-point reduction in the reverse repo, all by mid-2009.         
	On the BSE, the sensex closed with gains of 361.14 points at 10076.43, a level last seen on November 5. All sectoral indices closed higher, with real estate and banking gaining 7.27 per cent and 7.06 per cent, respectively.

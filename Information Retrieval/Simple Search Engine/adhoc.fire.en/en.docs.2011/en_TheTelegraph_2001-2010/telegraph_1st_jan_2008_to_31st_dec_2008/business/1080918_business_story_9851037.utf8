                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Barclays buys pieces of Lehman
                            
	London, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Barclays Plc, which over the weekend balked at acquiring stricken Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, agreed to pay about $1.75 billion for some of the banks prime US assets following its bankruptcy filing.        
	Most of the price tag was accounted for by Lehmans New York headquarters and two data centres, while the British bank will pay just $250 million in cash for Lehmans North American investment banking and capital markets businesses.         
	The operations include fixed income and equities sales, trading and research, and investment banking.        
	The deal, announced late on Tuesday, would unite two big debt trading houses and could staunch the flow of customers fleeing Lehman in the wake of the largest bankruptcy in the US history.        
	The Lehman operations to be acquired have about 10,000 employees, estimated trading assets of $72 billion and $68 billion in liabilities.        
	Late tonight, Barclays said it might pick up some of Lehmans assets and employees in Europe and Asia. Options, not obligations, Barclays group chief executive John Varley said of the possibility of salvaging more of Lehmans businesses.

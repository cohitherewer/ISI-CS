          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Soaring high                                  
	Mumbai, July 26: The State Bank of India today stunned the Street by reporting a 15.08 per cent vault in net profit at Rs 1,640.79 crore in the first quarter ended June 30.        
	The countrys largest commercial bank had earned a net profit of Rs 14,25.81 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.        
	Analysts had expected the bank to post profits in the region of Rs 1,500 crore.        
	The sharp spurt in net profit was underpinned by higher fee-based income.         
	The better-than-expected growth in its bottomline came amid challenging circumstances. The SBI said it made a mark-to-market (MTM) provision of Rs 1,656.61 crore on its investment portfolio.         
	Banks that hold government securities in the available-for-sale category have to mark them to market. Since the prices of these securities have taken a beating because of rising interest rates, they have to make a higher MTM provision.        
	The bank was able to offset the impact of higher provisioning with higher fee-based income and access to low-cost deposits through its huge branch network.         
	The bank has significantly checked the growth in interest expenses to 30.37 per cent during the quarter against 43.92 per cent recorded in 2007-08, the bank said.         
	Other income of the SBI jumped to Rs 2,403.87 crore from Rs 1,138.59 crore in the same period last year.        
	Although profit growth was way ahead of analyst estimates, it declined by 12.87 per cent on a sequential quarter basis. In the fourth quarter of 2007-08, the bank posted a profit of Rs 1,883.25 crore.         
	Banks traditionally see a slower first quarter growth in net profit over the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal. The only difference is that this time the decline has been sharper. In the first quarter of 2007-08, net profits had declined just 4.5 per cent on a sequential quarter basis.        
	This trend could be partially explained by the sharp growth in provisions during the first quarter of this fiscal. Provisions of the SBI rose to Rs 1,549.47 crore from Rs 159.37 crore in the same period last year.        
	A statement from the bank added that while total income recorded a growth rate of 35.50 per cent, non-interest expenses recorded a marginal rise of 9.42 per cent indicating continued control over cost.

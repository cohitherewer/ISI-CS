	New Delhi, June 16: Oil companies are planning to sell subsidised non-branded diesel to retail customers and sell the more expensive branded variant to commercial establishments to trim losses.        
	Industry sources said this was part of the marketing strategy being worked out by the oil companies as they were selling diesel at a loss of Rs 28.58 a litre even after the recent price hike. They, however, said there would not be any rationing for retail customers.        
	Petroleum ministry officials said the oil companies did adopt marketing strategies to remain competitive.         
	Oil companies are not required to sell subsidised diesel to commercial establishments and the prices of branded fuel are not controlled by the government, officials said.        
	Diesel is used by truckers and any hike in its price has a cascading effect on inflation. The government continues to subsidise the fuel heavily as it battles a seven-year high inflation of 8.75 per cent.        
	After the government increased excise duty on large cars, sports utility vehicle and multi-utility vehicles, the industrys efforts to boost sales of branded fuel is seen as a move by the oil companies to come out with measures to stay financially viable.        
	The annual consumption of diesel in the country is around 58 million tonnes. About 20 to 25 per cent of the fuel is consumed by large industrial units and other commercial establishments.         
	Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) officials said they would be pushing branded diesel, priced at Rs 3 higher than the normal fuel in Delhi, to these units. Oil prices are rising and so is diesel demand, but we cannot raise prices, so the more we sell the more we lose. So, we plan to push more branded diesel to minimise the losses, they said.        
	IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the company would not be importing diesel as its demand had been increasing around 20 to 25 per cent and the fuel was being used by many industrial units, spurring demand.         
	Industry officials said most of the diesel was being used by industrial units as it was cheaper than other fuels such as furnace oil and naphtha. There is also a higher demand from power generators, shopping malls and housing projects using diesel generators for backup supply.        
	Ajay Bansal, general secretary of the Federation of All-India Petroleum Traders, said the oil companies had reduced the supply of diesel by about 50 per cent and were pushing the branded products.         
	This is not a fair move on part of the oil companies even after the government has raised the prices of normal petrol and diesel, Bansal added.

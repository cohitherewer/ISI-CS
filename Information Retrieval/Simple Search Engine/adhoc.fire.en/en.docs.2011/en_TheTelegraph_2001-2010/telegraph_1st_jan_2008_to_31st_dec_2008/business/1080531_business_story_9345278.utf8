                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fuel price suspense lingers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          HEAT IS ON                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: The UPA government today moved closer to taking a decision on raising the prices of petrol, diesel and domestic cooking gas, with the indication that maximum caution would be exercised in the wake of inflation touching 8.1 per cent.        
	A high-level meeting was held at the residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which was attended by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Murli Deora, among others.         
	UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, too, took part in the discussions to assess the political implications of a price hike.        
	Before this meeting, Mukherjee held talks with Chidambaram and Deora to finetune a bail-out package for state-owned oil marketing companies, which includes a price hike, a rejig in duties and more oil bonds.        
	Sources said the government was considering a hike in the price of petrol by about Rs 3, an increase in oil bonds, a cut in the import duty on crude oil from 5 per cent to zero and a rise in LPG cylinder prices by Rs 20.        
	A hike in the price of diesel is not being considered because the fuel is used in trucks, which is used to ferry the bulk of commodities in the country.         
	A rise in the price will have a cascading impact on the price of commodities.        
	However, the government could curb the use of diesel as subsidised diesel might spur demand for the fuel and affect the finances of the oil companies.        
	There is the possibility of the cabinet meeting tomorrow to decide on price hike, after a Congress Working Committee meeting and the government takes on board its allies, sources said.         
	The government may announce any decision on a hike next week to deny the Opposition BJP, whose national executive is meeting on Sunday in Delhi, from scoring brownie points.

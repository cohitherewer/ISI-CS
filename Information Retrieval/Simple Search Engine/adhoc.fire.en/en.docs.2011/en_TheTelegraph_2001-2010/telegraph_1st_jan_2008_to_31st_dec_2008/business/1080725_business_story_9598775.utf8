	New Delhi, July 24: After rising continuously for two months, the rate of inflation today dipped marginally, giving some breathing space to the UPA government in its fight against price spiral.         
	For the week ended July 12, inflation slowed to 11.89 per cent against 11.91 per cent in the previous week. Inflation a year ago was at 4.76 per cent.        
	The last time when inflation eased was for the week ended May 10 when it came down to 7.82 per cent from 7.83 per cent recorded for the week ended May 3.         
	Data showed that the price of coffee went up by eight per cent, while fruits and vegetables were costlier by two per cent. Though the index for fuel, power and light showed no increase, manufactured products rose 0.05 percent.         
	The index for basic metal, alloys and metal products rose marginally because of higher prices of lead ingots.         
	The finance ministry in a statement said, Inflation on a week-on-week basis had continued to remain stable.        
	Analysts said they did not believe that prices had stabilised. They differed on whether the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would hike rates in its monetary policy review next week. Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi said the RBI could raise the repo rate by 25 basis points. However, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said, The RBI could wait and watch for a couple of more weeks before hiking the interest rate.

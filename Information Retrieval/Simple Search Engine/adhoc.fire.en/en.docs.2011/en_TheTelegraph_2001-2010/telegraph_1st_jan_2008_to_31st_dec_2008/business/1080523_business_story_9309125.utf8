	New Delhi, May 22: Hit by the rising cost of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), airlines could restructure the surcharge into a three-tier system to retain passengers.        
	At present, airlines follow a two-tier surcharge formula, charging Rs 1,950 for distances below 750 km and Rs 2,350 for longer flights.        
	Industry sources said airlines could introduce a segment of 1000-1500 km and impose a new surcharge.        
	ATF prices rise with surging crude oil prices, and airlines increase the surcharge component of fares to cushion the impact.         
	However, the industry has been demanding lower and uniform taxes on ATF to make air travel affordable and help low-cost airlines avert losses.        
	A rise in the fuel surcharge has led to just a 12 per cent rise in passenger growth during January-March against 35 per cent a year ago. Airlines have increased the fuel surcharge by around Rs 1,000 from Rs 1,350 in December 2007, when crude prices were hovering at around $95 per barrel.

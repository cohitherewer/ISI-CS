          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The government is working on a series of sector-specific stimulus packages, which could be announced separately or together.        
	Top officials said inter-ministry meetings were held this week to work out the details for textiles, engineering and capital goods. Duty changes to protect steel, facing competition from cheap Chinese products, were also discussed.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, who is answering all questions related to his previous charge, the finance ministry, today told the Rajya Sabha that if necessary, further measures to stimulate economic growth will be taken.        
	He said policy-makers were more keen on boosting growth than checking inflation, unlike in the earlier part of this fiscal. India is nowhere near recession. We are (only) affected by slowdown in global growth.         
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar is leading a senior group of mandarins in the preparation of the packages.        
	Textile is the first in line for the stimulants, which may include incentives, indirect subsidies and a line of credit.        
	FDI dip        
	Foreign direct investment fell 26 per cent in October. Commerce minister Kamal Nath said FDI during April-October stood at $18.7 billion.        
	Excise collections, too, dipped 15 per cent in November. Collections till the month were lower by 1.5 per cent at Rs 73,878 crore.         
	Customs duty was also lower by 0.8 per cent in November at Rs 8,931 crore. Duties till November grew 13 per cent to Rs 75, 551 crore.        
	The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council today said there had been 65,000 job losses. The sector might be forced to lay off a similar number in the next two months.

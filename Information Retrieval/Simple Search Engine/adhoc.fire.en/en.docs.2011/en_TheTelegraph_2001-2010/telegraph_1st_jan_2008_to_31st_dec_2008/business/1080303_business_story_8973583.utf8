The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Virgin seduction: receive calls, get credit
                                                                                                               Virgin seduction: receive calls, get credit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson in Mumbai on Sunday. (Reuters)                          
	Mumbai, March 2: Richard Branson, the flamboyant British billionaire, today ignited a revolution in Indias mobile world with the offer of rock-bottom call rates and a unique cash back offer for receiving calls.         
	Bransons Virgin Mobile India, which stormed Indias telephony market under a franchisee agreement with Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTL), is introducing features such as SIM card-based CDMA services with the option of an easy upgrade of handsets. But possibly the best feature is that every Virgin subscriber will get 10 paise credit for every minute of incoming calls they receive from any network.         
	Theres more: after the first two minutes of calls each day (which will be charged at Re 1 per minute), all Virgin Mobile outgoing calls on local networks for the rest of the day will be charged at 50 paise per minute.         
	The offer easily beats the lowest call rates in the industry: 99 paise per minute from Reliance and Re 1 per minute from Airtel. Virgin Mobile customers will enjoy this rate without any commitment or extra charge.         
	We intend to take the Indian market by storm with our dramatically different services, cheaper calls and attractively priced handsets. It helps that so far, there is no mobile service in India aimed at young people, Branson said at the launch.         
	The other major CDMA player, Reliance Communications, refused to comment on Virgin Mobiles competitive offerings.         
	Promising personalised customer support, all Virgin Mobile customers will be called back by the same call centre agent to address their query.         
	Branson said as part of their specialised Indian market offering, Virgin would have password-protected SMS folders for Indian youngsters to keep prying parents away.         
	Virgin Mobile India will provide youth-oriented mobile services on the TTL network.         
	Virgin will exclusively license the Virgin Mobile brand and technology expertise in the area of mobile value-added services and handsets to TTL.         
	Branson said Virgin would be paid an annual royalty depending on the companys financial performance.         
	The company expects to break even in three years and add five million youth subscribers by then, he added.         
	Virgin Mobile is the worlds first mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) and does not maintain its own network. Instead, it enters into contracts to use the existing networks of other providers, on which it offers services under the Virgin brand.         
	The company chose the franchisee route in India since MVNO services are not yet permitted in the country.         
	True to style, Branson unveiled his mobile brand with a 15-storey jump off a hotel building.         
	The company will launch 15,000 handsets and 40,000 top-up outlets across 50 cities in the initial phase.         
	For the Tatas, the tieup with Virgin Mobile will bring a segmented approach to the customer base and greater teledensity. Over the next several months, we intend to build mobile segments targeted at working women, kids and senior citizens too, said TTL managing director Anil Sardana.         
	Asked why he opted to go with Tata Teleservices, Branson said he was impressed by Tatas uncluttered CDMA network. The Indian telecom market is growing like no other. Our product is good and we need only a small per cent of the market to do well, he said.         
	Asked if he would rope in a brand ambassador, Branson said: I definitely need a younger ambassador. Im getting too old to jump off buildings.         
	And what motivates the maverick billionaire?         
	We want to carry on challenging established companies across the world and shake them up. Were supporting people who can do that. The idea is not to sit on profits but reinvest them, said Branson.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 30: Essar Oil Ltd plans to raise up to $2 billion (Rs 8,000 crore) to part-finance the expansion of its refinery and marketing network along with exploration and production activities.
    
	It is looking at a variety of options that include global depository receipts, American depository receipts, foreign currency convertible bonds and a qualified institutional placement.
    
	The Ruia group company said the amount could be raised either in the domestic or in the international markets. 
    
	In November last year, the board of Essar Oil had approved plans to increase capacity of its Vadinar refinery to 34 million tonnes from 10.5 million tonnes by 2010. 
    
	The move involved an expenditure of around $6 billion (Rs 24,000 crore). 
    
	The first stage of expansion will involve de-bottlenecking and the addition of more advanced bottom upgrading units such as delayed coker. The second phase of expansion will see a new set of distillation units, including addition of all secondary units and a coker.
    
	After the expansion, the refinery is expected to produce high-quality petroleum products that meet most environmental norms. 
    
	The board had also cleared plans to issue global depositary shares to the promoters on a preferential basis at Rs 200 a share to raise $2 billion.
    
	The company today said it has commissioned all the processing units of the Vadinar refinery. 
    
	The units were expected to reach full capacity by the end of this quarter. 
    
	Dispatch facilities by rail and road have also been commissioned.

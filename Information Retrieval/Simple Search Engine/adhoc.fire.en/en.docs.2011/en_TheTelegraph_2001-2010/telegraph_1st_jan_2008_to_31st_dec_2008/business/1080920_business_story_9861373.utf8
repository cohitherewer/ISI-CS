          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Scindia: Call waiting                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: The government is examining the possibility of allowing mobile operators to share spectrum.        
	The issue of spectrum sharing is in progress and a decision will be taken in the next two months, said Jyotiraditya Scindia, minister of state for telecom and information technology, on the sidelines of a telecom summit.        
	Spectrum sharing, if allowed, will enable service providers to sell or lease their surplus spectrum to other operators in the same circle, ensuring an efficient use of radiowaves which is a scarce resource.         
	Spectrum is radio frequency required by cellular operators to offer mobile services        
	According to analysts, the proposal will help new and existing cellular operators who have been seeking additional spectrum, with an increase in the number of their subscribers, but are unable to get it because of scarcity.        
	Spectrum sharing is different from mobile virtual network services. Virtual network operators buy airtime in bulk from licensed operators and resell it directly to consumers. They do not own the spectrum.         
	Spectrum trading can be implemented either through the auction route or the first come, first served basis to increase the economic efficiency of the assignment, said a researcher at Analysys, a UK-based telecom consultancy firm.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) plans to hire a consultant who will advise it on the need, timing and approach towards spectrum trading.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) will ask Trai to form the guidelines on spectrum sharing, while ensuring that the move does not lead to hoarding.         
	Countries such as New Zealand, the US, Australia and Singapore allow spectrum trading in varying degrees.        
	On foreign players being allocated 5 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum for providing 3G services, Scindia said the DoT was looking into the matter.        
	Foreign players have demanded additional spectrum and have told the government they would not be able to run 3G services with 5Mhz of spectrum.

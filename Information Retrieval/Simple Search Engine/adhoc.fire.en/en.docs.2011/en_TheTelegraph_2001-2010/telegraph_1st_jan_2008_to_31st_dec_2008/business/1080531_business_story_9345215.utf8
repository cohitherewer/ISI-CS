          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Slavova in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 30: An Indian company needs to make 60 different tax payments on an average every month. Total central and state tax payments by a company in a financial year account for 70.6 per cent of its earnings, and it takes 271 days to file documents with regulators.         
	These were some the facts brought out by the World Banks global study on Doing Business 2008 jointly published with its private investment arm International Finance Corporation.        
	India was ranked at 120 among 178 countries in terms of its attractiveness for setting up a business.        
	A corporate lawsuit on contract enforcement takes around 1,420 days to be resolved in India compared with 281 days in Russia, 406 days in China and 616 days in Brazil. It takes 10 years to close a business through insolvency proceedings against 1.7 years in China, 3.8 years in Russia and four years in Brazil.         
	These embarrassing facts had prompted the Indian government to invite the foreign investment advisory services (FIAS) wing of the World Bank in December last year to prepare a report card of 17 cities on how they fared in implementing regulatory reforms to create an investment-friendly environment.         
	Apart from rating the 17 cities on the basis of ease of doing business, the report will also highlight the best procedural practices adopted by the states. It will provide an action plan for both the central and state governments to further reform the environment for doing business in the country, said Stefka Slavova, a senior economist at the Doing Business reform unit under FIAS.         
	The World Bank today held an awareness workshop in the city organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry along with the Department of Industrial Policy amp; Promotion under the ministry of commerce and industry.

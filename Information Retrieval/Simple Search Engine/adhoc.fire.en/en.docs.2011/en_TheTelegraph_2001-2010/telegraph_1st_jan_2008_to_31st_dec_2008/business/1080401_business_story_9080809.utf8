	Vadodara, March 31: Alembic, Indias oldest pharmaceutical company, is finalising a contract manufacturing agreement with a multinational to make active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for bulk drug applications.        
	Under the deal, Alembic will get $25-30 million annually. The agreement is for an initial period of three years and will be extended to five.        
	Terming the deal as one of the largest drug outsourcing contracts in the country, Alembic chairman and managing director Chirayu Amin said: Its our strategy to become part of the backend supply chain of large companies.        
	He refused to name the MNC partner, citing confidentiality clauses.         
	At present, API and intermediaries account for 35 per cent of the companys business. The company recently acquired an API manufacturing facility in Gujarat.        
	I think we are 10 years late on the international scene, said Pranav Amin, director of Alembic Ltd. But in the next three years, were going to work on international markets, he added.         
	The markets on his radar include Europe, Canada, South America and the US.

	In research and development, Alembic has signed an outlicensing deal for a new drug delivery system platform technology with UCB Pharma of Belgium.         
	Our target is to touch a turnover of Rs 2,000 crore in the next four years. Were also looking to improve our domestic rankings, said Amin.        
	At present, Alembic is ranked 18th in the Indian formulation market with a market share of around 1.92 per cent. However, it is a market leader in the macrolides segment of anti-infective drugs in India, accounting for 45 per cent of this segment.        
	Alembic exported Rs 300 crore of formulation drugs and intermediaries to the US and European markets in the current fiscal.         
	It is now planning to double exports to Rs 600 crore over the next two years.        
	The Rs 1000-crore Vadodara based company is also planning to set up a pharmaceutical special economic zone in Gujarat. The project is awaiting clearance from the state government.        
	The company recorded sales of Rs 759 crore during the nine months ended December 2007 against sales of Rs 721 crore in the previous financial year.         
	With its Rs 159 crore acquisition of Daburs non-oncology business in the current fiscal, Alembic has entered the high growth lifestyle segment of cardiology, diabetes and gynaecology.         
	Were planning to build the brands we acquired from Dabur. We have set a five-year payback period for this acquisition, said Pranav Amin.

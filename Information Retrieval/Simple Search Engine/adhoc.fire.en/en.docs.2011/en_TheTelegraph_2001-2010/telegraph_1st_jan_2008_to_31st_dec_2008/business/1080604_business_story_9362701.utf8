                              Wagoner: Feel the heat                            
	Wilmington, Delaware, June 3 (Reuters): General Motors Corp has announced a series of steps to cut jobs, costs and its exposure to slow-selling trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUV) in response to a rise in gasoline prices that the auto maker now sees as permanent.        
	While speaking to reporters after a restructuring plan was approved by the board, GM chief executive Rick Wagoner said the company would close four North American truck plants and add shifts at two plants for making more popular models.        
	Wagoner said GM was also reviewing the Hummer brand and could sell the military-derived SUV, which has become synonymous for gas-guzzling excess.

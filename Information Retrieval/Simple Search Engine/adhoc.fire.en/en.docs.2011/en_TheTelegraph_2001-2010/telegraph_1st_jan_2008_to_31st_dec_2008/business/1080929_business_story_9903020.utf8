	Calcutta, Sept. 28: The number of mutual funds in the country may soon cross 50, with as many as 17 applicants, including some foreign ones, awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).        
	Recently, Religare Aegon Asset Management Company, a joint venture between Ranbaxy group-promoted Religare Securities and the Netherlands-based Aegon, got final regulatory approval. With this, the total number of funds in the country goes up to 37.         
	Last month, Sebi allowed Goldman Sachs Asset Management Company to launch a fund. The other two fund houses to debut in the current fiscal were Bharti AXA Mutual Fund (in April) and Edelweiss Mutual Fund (in May).         
	Till August, 34 fund houses, excluding Edelweiss and Goldman Sachs, had Rs 5,44,535 crore of assets under management.         
	Japan-based Nikko Asset Management and Shinsei Bank, Dawnay Day International of the UK, Singapore-based Schroder Investment Management and South Africas Sanlam Investment Management have sought regulatory approval.        
	Domestic companies planning a foray into the business include Axis Bank, Jaypee Capital Services, Peerless General Finance amp; Investment, Srei Infrastructure Finance and brokerage houses such as India Bulls, India Infoline, Motilal Oswal, ASK Investment Holdings and Matrix Financial Services.         
	DLF and Union Bank are also planning to enter the business, but they havent filed any application with Sebi till last month. DLF is planning a joint venture with Citibank.        
	Mumbai-based HDIL Constructions is the only company that has proposed a real estate mutual fund.        
	Well soon file prospectus for both debt and equity products with the regulator. The asset management company will have around 15 operational branches at the time of the first product launch and this will increase to around 30 branches in over 25 cities by March next year, Saurabh Nanavati, CEO of Religare Aegon AMC said.        
	Vetri Subramaniam will head Religare Aegons equity portfolio, while Ashish Nigam will take charge of the AMCs fixed income portfolio.        
	The coming months will see the sharpest increase in the number of funds available to investors in the country, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research, a Delhi-based company that tracks the industry.         
	 However, what benefits investors is not the more number of funds but the improvement in products and services that competition presumably delivers, he said.

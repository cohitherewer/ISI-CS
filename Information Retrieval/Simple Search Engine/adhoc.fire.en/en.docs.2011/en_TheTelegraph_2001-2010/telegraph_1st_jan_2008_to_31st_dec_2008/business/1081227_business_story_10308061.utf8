	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The cascading effect of a drop in the prices of crude and manufacturing products helped inflation touch a nine-month low of 6.61 per cent for the week ended December 13, a decline of 23 basis points over the last weeks figure.         
	However inflation was much lower at 3.84 per cent in the corresponding week last year.         
	The second-round of effects of the fuel price cut coupled with the impact of duty reductions are kicking in. Moreover, the effect of falling manufactured goods inflation is also doing its bit, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, economist at Bank of Baroda.         
	Among food items, vegetable prices fell more than 3 per cent followed by tea, cereals, and spices, while sea fish, wheat and bajra got dearer. Among other food articles, the price of rice fell 1 per cent, while fruit was dearer by 0.2 per cent.        
	The declining inflation trend will continue and that gives the RBI enough leg room to cut borrowing costs, said A. Prasanna, an analyst at ICICI Securities.         
	A further cut in rates will help minimise the downside risks to growth and restore confidence in the markets, he said.        
	Earlier in this month, the price of petrol was cut 10 per cent, while diesel became 6 per cent cheaper.

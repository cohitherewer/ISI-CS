          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 25: A share swap ratio of one HDFC Bank share for every 29 shares of Centurion Bank of Punjab (CBoP) has been proposed for the merger of the two private sector banks.        
	The merger ratio values CBoP at Rs 50.80 per share or a little over Rs 9,500 crore. Although the merged entity will have the largest branch network among private sector banks and create other benefits, the stock market was cool to the swap ratio. The HDFC Bank stock dipped by 3.5 per cent to Rs 1,422.70 while the CBoP share tumbled 14.5 per cent to Rs 48.25.        
	Brokers said HDFC Bank shares came under pressure because of apprehensions that it was paying a higher price while CBoP was pounded as the swap ratio was way below market expectations. Ahead of todays board meeting, the market was speculating a share swap ratio of 1:20.         
	The combined entity will have a nationwide network of 1,148 branches, a strong deposit base of around Rs 1,200,00 crore and net advances of around Rs 85,000 crore. The balancesheet size of the combined entity will be over Rs 1,500,00 crore.         
	The advisers        
	The share exchange ratio approved by the respective boards was based on the recommendations made by Dalal amp; Shah, chartered accountants, and Ernst amp; Young Pvt Ltd, who acted as independent joint valuers to the transaction.        
	The draft scheme of the amalgamation, the due diligence report and other matters will be considered by the board of HDFC Bank at the meeting scheduled on February 28. The board of CBoP will also meet on the same day.        
	HDFC Bank said in the event of the merger of CBoP with HDFC Bank being approved at its meeting on February 28, it would consider making a preferential offer to its promoter Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), to enable HDFC to maintain its 23.28 per cent shareholding in the merged entity. The size of the preference issue is put at Rs 3900 crore.        
	Top-level change        
	CBoP chairman Rana Talwar has been offered a seat on the board as non-executive director and Shailendra Bhandari, managing director of the bank, will be invited to join the board of the merged entity as executive director. HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri and Talwar told reporters that the merger would yield a host of benefits.        
	We believe that Centurion Bank of Punjab will be the right fit in terms of culture, strategic intent and approach to business, Parekh added.

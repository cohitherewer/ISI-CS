          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Trim Trauma                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 7: The Tata groups expensive UK acquisitions are facing the heat of meltdown.        
	Following the announcement of job cuts at Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover, it is now the turn of Tata Steels Corus to trim workforce.        
	Corus today said it would lay off 400 workers from its distribution division to stay competitive.        
	The development comes within three weeks of the companys decision to cut production by 20 per cent for three months. The plan is to reduce crude steel production by around 1 million tonnes. Coruss annual production of crude steel is about 20 million tonnes.        
	The decision was aimed at aligning steel production with demand, which is now affected by the global financial crisis. Corus attributed the job cuts to volatile marketing conditions.        
	Job losses include 95 at the steel giants plant at Shotton in Northeast Wales and 50 in South Wales.         
	Another 100 jobs will go at eight sites in West Midlands and 50 in two locations in Leeds.         
	Though the distribution division of Corus took many cost-cutting initiatives, it was not sufficient to offset the downtrend, necessitating the cuts.        
	Workers losing jobs will be offered support services to tide themselves over the difficult period. Wherever possible, the jobs will be shed through voluntary redundancy, Corus said.        
	The division employs 2,400 workers at 36 sites in the UK and Ireland.        
	Earlier this week, Jaguar Land Rover said it would consider cutting 300-400 jobs by the end of January. It has already curtailed working hours and closed some facilities. The Tata Motors arm had previously announced that it would take 198 staff off its rolls as part of its annual efficiency drive.        
	When Tata Steel had acquired Corus in early 2007, job assurances were discussed between the workers unions and the Tatas. There was a tacit acknowledgement from the Indian company that no jobs would be lost after the acquisition.

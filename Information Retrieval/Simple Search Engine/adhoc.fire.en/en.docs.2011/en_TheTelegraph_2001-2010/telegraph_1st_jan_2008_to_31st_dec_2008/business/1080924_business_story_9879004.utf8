The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC wants more for gas
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ONGC wants more for gas

	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has asked the government to increase the price of its gas to $4.2 per million British thermal units (mBtu). The Tariff Commission had recommended a price of $2.5.        
	The increased rate will be on a par with the proposed price of Reliance Industries for its gas from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. However, this will be much less than the international rates of $10-12 per mBtu.        
	The state-owned firm supplies gas at a government-administered price of $1.90 per mBtu to power and fertiliser units.         
	Senior officials of the company said they had asked the government to increase the price to match the rate fixed by the empowered group of ministers for the Reliance gas from the KG basin. They said the government had agreed, in-principle, that ONGC deserved a higher gas price.         
	ONGC is seeking a higher price for the incremental gas production from fields given to it on a nomination basis.        
	Company officials said the PSU was losing around Rs 700 crore annually by selling 48 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas below the cost of production.        
	ONGC would earn Rs 2,000 crore extra if prices were raised to $2.50 mBtu, as recommended by the Tariff Commission.         
	The policy for areas awarded under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp) is clear. Oil and gas from Nelp blocks are guaranteed market price. But even in nomination (older) fields we are making fresh investment to raise production or arrest the decline that sets in with age. For incremental production, we should be given market price, officials said.        
	Petroleum ministry officials said they were considering the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. Higher prices will, however, impact segments such as power and fertiliser.        
	Of the 90 mscmd of gas available in the country, around 53 mscmd is fixed by the government.

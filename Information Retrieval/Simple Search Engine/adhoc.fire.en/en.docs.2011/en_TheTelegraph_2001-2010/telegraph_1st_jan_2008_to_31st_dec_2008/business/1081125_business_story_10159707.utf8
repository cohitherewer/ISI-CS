The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dhoots to go it alone in telecom 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoots to go it alone in telecom 
          PIYA SINGH                                  SOLO SHOW              bull;Datacom has pan-India licence for 22 circles         bull;It will launch GSM services on April 15 next year in Chennai         bull;Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are next in line      Mumbai, Nov. 24: The Dhoots are not planning to tie up with a partner for their foray into the tough telecom market unlike the other newbies.        
	Datacom Solutions, a subsidiary of consumer goods maker Videocon Ltd, is ready to roll out GSM services in select states early next year without a joint venture partner as it has not yet received an appropriate valuation for its pan-India telecom entity.        
	We have spoken to everyone in the business and we really dont believe that this is the time to get the right valuation. So, we will launch without a partner on April 15 next year in Chennai followed by Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, said Videocon managing director R.N. Dhoot, who belongs to the promoter family.         
	Datacom has been in talks with telecom giants such as Americas AT amp;T to Turkeys leading mobile operator Turkcell. It has a pan-India licence for 22 circles and is awaiting additional spectrum.        
	Dhoot may be confident about launching a new business without equity participation or technical knowhow from a global player. However, the reality is that the groups foray into telecom has been marred by controversy.         
	It has been engaged in a tussle with the minority shareholders, the Nahatas of HFCL, from whom it had bought a 64 per cent stake in Datacom Solutions.        
	Datacoms CEO Ravi Sharma left the company recently, and the hunt is on for a replacement.         
	There is not much clarity on how the Dhoots plan to fund this mega rollout, which is estimated to require investments of Rs 6,000 crore in the initial phases followed by another Rs 6,000 crore. There have been reports that technology vendors are starting to wonder how the new telecom players will fund their plans.        
	R.N. Dhoot is, however, unperturbed and feels that a foreign partner is not mandatory for a rollout. He reckons that it is more important to create a large subscriber base. Please remember that Videocon is a household name.         
	Besides, we have 16 crore customers. If we can attract 10 per cent initially, we will be fine. Technology is available locally and the biggest factor that will go in our favour is that we have a well spread out distribution network of Videocon showrooms, Planet M stores and service stations, he said.         
	The Datacom managing director, however, refused to say how the group planned to fund its telecom venture.         
	A questionnaire sent to Venugopal Dhoot, who is responsible for managing the groups finances, went unanswered.         
	In the past, Venugopal Dhoot had said that he would look at a mix of equity from a partner, debt and internal accruals to fund his new businesses, including telecom.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi/Mumbai June 6: Telekom Malaysia may increase its stake in Spice Communications to gain management control.         
	The BK Modi-led Spice Communications, which is currently negotiating with various interested parties for an equity sale, said it was considering all options.        
	Spice is keen to scale up operations to compete more effectively with rivals such as Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Vodafone Essar.         
	The New Delhi-based telecom firm is 40 per cent owned by B.K. Modi and his family and 39.2 per cent by Telekom Malaysia, with the rest being held by public shareholders and institutions.         
	A team of Telekom Malaysia officials today met Modi, the chairman of Spice, to work out a stake-sale deal. Confirming the move, Modi said, There is no development today. It will happen over the weekend.        
	Sources said Telekom Malyasia might hike its stake to 51 per cent to infuse investments to help Spice expand its network.         
	Telekom Malaysia, Southeast Asias second largest telecommunications company, had earlier planned to increase its shareholding to 74 per cent.        
	Sources added that the Modi family was looking to sell around 14 per cent stake, while retaining 26 per cent.         
	While Modi is asking for a price of Rs 90 per share, some interested parties have offered a little over Rs 70 per share, said sources. This is a 34 per cent premium on Spices current share price of Rs 51.95.        
	Sources said Idea Cellular, an AV Birla group company, which is also in negotiations, had proposed to buy out the Modi family and the public shareholders as well as acquire some of the shares of Telekom Malaysia. Officials of Telekom Malaysia also met the representatives of Idea today.        
	If this transaction goes through, the promoters of Idea are likely to hold a 80 per cent stake in the merged entity, with Telekom Malaysia owning 20 per cent. However, both Idea Cellular managing director Sanjeev Aga and an AV Birla group spokesperson declined to give any specific comments on the deal.         
	Last year in June, merger talks between Spice and Idea broke down over valuation differences.        
	Spice runs mobile networks in Punjab and Karnataka under brand name Spice Telecom. The company has over 4.2 million subscribers across these circles.         
	Spice had earlier applied for a pan-India telecom licence, but the department of telecom allowed it to operate in only four more circles  Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Maharashtra  rejecting its plea for 16 other circles.        
	It has recently announced an investment of around Rs 1,200 crore in 2008 to expand operations in the Punjab and Karnataka circles.

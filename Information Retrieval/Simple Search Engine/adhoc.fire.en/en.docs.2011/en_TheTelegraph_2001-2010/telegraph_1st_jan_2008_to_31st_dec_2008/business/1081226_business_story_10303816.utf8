          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 25: Bearish conditions prevailing in the secondary markets severely hit initial public offerings (IPOs) during 2008. Companies were able to mobilise only Rs 16,927 crore through IPOs and follow-on offerings, a fall of 63 per cent over Rs 45,137 crore raised in the previous calendar year.        
	Prithvi Haldea of Prime, which tracks developments in the primary capital market, said the amount raised in 2008 was 31 per cent lower than that in 2006 when companies had garnered Rs 24,679 crore.        
	Given the buoyant state of the market a year ago, Prime had estimated that companies would raise Rs 75,000 crore in 2008.        
	The year also saw the largest ever IPO in India from Reliance Power for Rs 10,123 crore, which alone accounted for 60 per cent of the years total mobilisation. Prime said there were only two issues of over Rs 1,000 crore each compared with six in the preceding year. Around 22 of the 38 issues were for less than Rs 100 crore. Of these, 14 were for less than Rs 50 crore.        
	With secondary markets collapsing, the response from the public to the issues was also very subdued. Only six of the 38 IPOs (16 per cent) were oversubscribed more than 10 times, compared with 50 out of the 101 IPOs in 2007.        
	Haldea said around 14 issues barely managed to get a one-time subscription. Moreover, three IPOs had to be cancelled because of a lack of response, including the Rs 5,436-crore issue of Emaar MGF and the Rs 564-crore float of Wockhardt Hospitals. Another company had to call off its IPO even before it opened for subscription.        
	The bearish conditions had another fallout. While companies generally rush to open their IPOs immediately after getting all the approvals, 37 companies allowed their 90-day approval to lapse because of adverse market conditions These companies had been looking to raise Rs 29,164 crore from the markets.

                                                                                                            Think twice
        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay studies the shortcomings of zero-interest loans, which always look enticing                                            
	In 2006, the Reserve Bank had issued a circular to commercial banks asking them not to give consumer durable loans at low or zero interest rates by adjusting the discounts offered by manufacturers or dealers of consumer goods.         
	The RBI felt such schemes lacked transparency and distorted the pricing mechanism of such loans.         
	And sure enough, if you explore these low interest rates you will realise there are several hidden costs involved.         
	Zero interest        
	A couple of years ago, Ritam Basu went to buy a double-door, frost-free refrigerator. The dealer quoted a price of Rs 18,000.         
	After some bargaining, the dealer agreed to give him a discount of Rs 1,500 and sell the 210-litre fridge for Rs 16,500, provided he paid the entire amount in cash.         
	But an offer from a finance company for zero interest financing of consumer durables caught Ritams eye. According to the offer, if Ritam could make a down payment of Rs 4,500, the financier would pay the rest.         
	Ritam would have to repay the amount in six instalments of Rs 2,250 each. The thought of zero interest financing was quite lucrative. But an enquiry into how it worked revealed some surprising facts.         
	Processing fee        
	Ritam would have to pay a 2 per cent (Rs 360) processing fee to get the financing facility. Moreover, he wouldnt get the discount that the dealer was willing to offer in an all-cash deal. Instead, this discount would go to the financier.         
	In effect, the financing option would have cost him Rs 1,500 plus Rs 360 or Rs 1,860.         
	The financier, thus, was not providing Rs 13,500 on zero interest. Rather, the financier would get Rs 1,860 for lending the amount. This translates into an effective interest rate of 13.78 per cent! This was higher than the interest rate charged by many banks on consumer durable or car loans.        
	Lesser duration        
	Moreover, zero interest financing is available for six to eight months or up to a year, unlike a bank loan that can be repaid over a period of two to three years.         
	Hence, zero is not always zero  at least when it comes to financing. One has to pay 20 to 30 per cent of the printed price of the item purchased upfront and forego the dealers discount that may vary between 8 and 12 per cent depending on ones bargaining power. Equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will also have to be paid to the financier in advance in post-dated cheques. And, if one fails to pay a single instalment, a penal interest is charged on the entire borrowing.         
	Low interest        
	Dealers of auto and consumer goods often offer a low-interest financing facility in a tieup with financial institutions.         
	However, the question is are these schemes good enough? Not exactly.         
	In such schemes, one has to pay the EMIs for three to six months in advance. The remaining amount can be paid in post-dated cheques. The loan, however, will be for a longer tenure of two to three years.         
	Moreover, the borrower will have to pay processing and hypothecation fees.         
	Advance EMI        
	The catch in a low-interest, advance EMI scheme is the calculation of interest. While the borrower gives three to six EMIs in advance as margin money (like down payment in case of a zero-interest offer), the interest is calculated for the entire invoice amount.         
	Let us take the example of the refrigerator. The interest amount on Rs 18,000 at 5 per cent for one year will be Rs 900. But one has to pay two EMIs of Rs 1,575 upfront. There will also be a 2 per cent processing fee. So, one has to pay Rs 900 plus Rs 360 for a loan of Rs 14,850 (because two EMIs have already been paid upfront). Thus, one ends up paying an interest rate of 8.5 per cent, instead of 5 per cent.         
	A consumer durable manufacturer allows a certain margin on a product to the dealers. The dealers pass part of it to consumers as cash discount. A buyer will lose this discount if he opts for a hire purchase rather than an all-cash deal.         
	Financiers illustrative calculations would never mention this invisible component.

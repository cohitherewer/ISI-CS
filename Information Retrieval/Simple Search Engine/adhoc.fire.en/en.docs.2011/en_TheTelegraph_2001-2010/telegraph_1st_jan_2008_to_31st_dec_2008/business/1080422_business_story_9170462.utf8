          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, April 21: The sensex today jumped 258.13 points to 16739.33 as investors took heart from encouraging fourth-quarter results and strong global cues, while shrugging off the hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by the central bank.        
	Shares of banks, expected to take a hit from the rise in CRR, rose over 3.4 per cent, led by ICICI Bank. The 50-share Nifty breached the psychological 5000 mark to close 78.60 points higher at 5037.         
	Companies also reported lower than expected mark-to-market losses, lifting market sentiment. The fourth quarter numbers have been pretty decent so far and are largely in line with our expectations. Although we were expecting an immediate reaction against the hike in CRR, the market seems to have digested the negatives over the weekend. This is a positive sign, Hitesh Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking, said.         
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased CRR by 50 basis points on Thursday to rein in inflation, which has touched 7.14 per cent. The move, expected to suck up about Rs 18,500 crore from the system, had raised concerns about banks ability to fund expansion plans of industry.        
	According to Ambareesh Baliga, head of research, Karvy Stock Broking, The market moved on strong global cues and positive fourth quarter numbers. The mark-to-market losses disclosed till now are lower than expected. This shows banking growth is here to stay. The markets are expected to decide its course according to the fourth quarter results.         
	Margin requirements on institutional investors, too, did not affect trading volumes.        
	Foreign institutional investors were net buyers to the extent of about Rs 170 crore, while domestic institutions bought stocks worth Rs 111.58 crore. Regulatory changes like margining do not have a long term impact on the markets. Since the market managed to hold on to its rising levels today, we dont think the margin imposition will impact the markets growth any more Baliga said.         
	Metal stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange gained about 4 per cent, while IT stocks dropped about 1 per cent, as a result of a correction from last weeks surge on the back of Infosys fourth quarter results. In Asia, Japanese shares stormed to a two-month closing high, while Hong Kongs Hang Seng index rose about 2 per cent.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Call waiting                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The telecom regulator has suggested that instead of sharing revenue, cellular firms should pay 2 per cent of the highest bid amount in the upcoming 3G auction as an annual spectrum fee.         
	Standalone 3G players should pay an additional annual fee of 3 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue as they could use 3G spectrum to provide 2G services as well.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) was responding to the department of telecommunications (DoT) query about spectrum charges for standalone 3G firms and 2G players keen on offering 3G services.        
	Trai said 2G players entering 3G should pay 2 per cent of the highest bid amount in the 3G auction as the fee.         
	At present, GSM operators pay around 2-6 per cent of their annual gross revenue as spectrum fees, while CDMA operators pay 2 per cent.        
	Explaining the 2 per cent levy, Trai said: The move from a spectrum charge that is linked to revenue to a flat rate linked to market-based prices will be simple and easy to implement.        
	The DoT had recently amended its 3G guidelines to stipulate that firms would need to pay 1 per cent of their revenue from 3G services as spectrum charges compared with 4-6 per cent in 2G services.         
	However, this required separating revenues earned from 2G and 3G services  a process which the telecom department has been unable to formulate. GSM players had bitterly opposed the DoT amendment.        
	Trai had suggested that the 2 per cent levy should be charged after a year of operation because operators need to be given time to commence services after the grant of spectrum.        
	Last week, the regulator said it would bring out a consultation paper shortly on a DoT proposal for a lock-in period for promoters equity in 2G.

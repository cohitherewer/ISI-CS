	Calcutta, July 16: ICICI Bank, the largest private sector bank in the country, is set to increase its service charges from August this year.         
	Last month, IDBI (formerly IDBI Bank) revised its fees. Kotak Mahindra Bank did it in January and the State Bank of India raised its service charges in February this year.        
	A higher service charge means one will have to shell out more money to make a demand draft from ones bank and a higher penalty if a cheque drawn on or deposited in the bank account is dishonoured. Banks have also raised their fees for collecting outstation cheques, issuing statement of accounts on ad hoc basis, duplicate passbooks and a host of other services.        
	ICICI Bank, which had already increased the average quarterly balance requirement in a regular savings account to Rs 10,000, plans to charge Rs 50 per demand draft up to Rs 10,000 and Rs 3 per Rs 1,000 thereafter, subject to a minimum of Rs 75 and maximum of Rs 15,000, from August 1. At present, the bank charges Rs 2 per Rs 1,000, subject to a minimum of Rs 50 and maximum of Rs 10,000.        
	The bank is also increasing the price for cheque books. While it is giving 50 payable-at-par cheque leaves every quarter for free, the bank will distribute only 30 such cheque leaves without any charge. Any additional cheque leaves will cost Rs 2 per leaf. This means, one will have to pay more if one writes more than 30 cheques in 121 days, or one cheque in four days, beginning August this year.         
	Banks are increasing their service charges to shore up their non-interest income in the current financial year. With deposit rates going up and a significant slowdown in credit growth, banks are feeling the pinch of declining net interest margin. In the face of a plummeting stock market and unprofitable treasury operations following the rise in interest rates, banks are also expected to take a hit on income from investments.         
	Income from core banking operations are likely to suffer during the first two quarters, at least in the current financial year. Hence, banks are on the look out for increasing their fee-based and other non-interest income, said M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of Union Bank of India. As the cost of deposits is also going up, banks are looking to mobilise more low-cost deposits. Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank had already raised the minimum average quarterly balance for their savings accounts to Rs 10,000 earlier this year.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       One more casualty in US 
                            
	New York/Washington, Sept. 26 (Reuters): The US government has closed Washington Mutual Inc and sold its banking assets to JPMorgan Chase amp; Co for $1.9 billion.        
	Washington Mutuals collapse by far the largest failure of a US bank  is the latest of a series of takeovers and outright failures that have transformed the American financial landscape and wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder wealth.        
	These include the disappearance of Bear, government takeovers of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurer American International Group Inc, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, and Bank of Americas purchase of Merrill.        
	The transaction came as Washington wrangled over the fate of a $700-billion bailout of the financial services industry.        
	President George W. Bush has acknowledged that there are disagreements over the plan, which is aimed at clearing bad debts of banks and reviving frozen credit markets that threaten to plunge the US economy into a deep recession.         
	But he said he expected Congress to pass the legislation and a White House spokeswoman said it felt like a deal was close.        
	There are disagreements over aspects of a rescue plan but there is no disagreement that something substantial must be done, Bush told reporters at the White House.

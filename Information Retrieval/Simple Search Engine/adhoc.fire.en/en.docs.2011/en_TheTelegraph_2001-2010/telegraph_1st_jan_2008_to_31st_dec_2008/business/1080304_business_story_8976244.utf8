	Mumbai, March 3: Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd, of the Gammon group, will enter the capital market with its initial public offering (IPO) of 165.50 lakh equity shares of Rs 10 each.         
	The price of the issue will be determined through 100 per cent book building.        
	Gammon India director Himanshu Parikh said the company wasnt deterred by the withdrawal of IPOs such as that of Wockhardt Hospitals and Emaar MGF Land Ltd because of a poor investor response.        
	We are confident of our company. We aim to raise around Rs 300 crore from the market, he added.        
	He said the company could come out with a follow-on issue if it required more capital. Gammon India undertakes projects on a public-private partnership basis and follows the build-operate-transfer model.         
	Gammon Infrastructure has 13 projects to develop roads, bridges, ports, power plants and a special economic zone. Four of these projects are operational and five others are being developed.        
	Gammon India owns 82.5 per cent in the unit, while a private equity fund holds another 12.5 per cent.         
	We have an operating margin of close to 80 per cent. Around 70 per cent of our work comprises road construction, 8 per cent ports, 7-8 per cent advisory services and rest from amp;M (operate and manage) activities, said Parag Parikh, head of finance.        
	The issue will open on March 10 and close on March 13.

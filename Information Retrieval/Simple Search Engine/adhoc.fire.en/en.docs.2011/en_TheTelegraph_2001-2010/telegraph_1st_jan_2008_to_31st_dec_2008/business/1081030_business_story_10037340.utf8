	Mumbai, Oct. 29: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today reported a 35 per cent drop in net profit for the second quarter of the year ended September 30 at Rs 185.7 crore against Rs 285.9 crore last year.         
	M amp;M attributed the poor show to an exchange rate loss of Rs 117.8 crore because of the depreciation of the rupee.         
	Lower octroi refunds, which dipped to Rs 27 crore compared with Rs 92.9 crore in the year-ago period, also impacted the companys performance.         
	Gross revenue and other income for the period under review grew 14.1 per cent to Rs 3,695.2 crore from Rs 3239.5 crore during the same period last year.         
	Though both the automotive and farm equipment sectors performed well during the quarter, M amp;M said an increase in input costs, the fall in the value of the rupee and a steep rise in interest rates had exerted considerable pressure on its operating margins and profits.         
	Profit after tax during the quarter stood at Rs 237.8 crore against Rs 217.4 crore a year ago, a growth rate of 9.3 per cent.         
	During the first half of the fiscal, gross revenues and other income of M amp;M rose 18.6 per cent to Rs 7,367.5 crore from Rs 6,212.4 crore a year ago. Net profit for the six-month period was Rs 355.2 crore against Rs 477.1 crore last year.         
	Profit after tax during the period was Rs 458.7 crore compared with Rs 412.7 crore a year ago, a growth rate of 11.2 per cent.         
	On a consolidated basis, gross revenues and other income for the second quarter grew 19 per cent to Rs 7,741.4 crore from Rs 6,502.6 crore last year.         
	Profit after tax for the quarter was Rs 373.3 crore against Rs 392.6 crore earned in the previous year.         
	In the automotive sector, domestic multi-utility vehicle sales grew 8.9 per cent against industry growth of 5.1 per cent.         
	In pick-ups, the company registered a growth rate of 20.2 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Aviation plea on jet fuel under review
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aviation plea on jet fuel under review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Relief in sight                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The government is considering the airline industrys demand to cut taxes on jet fuel by giving it a declared goods status, which will reduce state taxes on the fuel to a uniform 4 per cent.        
	At present, tax on jet fuel varies from state to state. While Andhra Pradesh levies the least at 4 per cent, Tamil Nadu and Bihar charge 29 per cent. In Bengal, the tax is at 25 per cent.        
	However, any move by the Centre to cut the tax may attract flak from states already hit by declining revenues in a year when industrial growth has been sluggish.         
	A high-level committee, headed by cabinet secretary K. M. Chandrasekhar, which is studying the severe financial crunch faced by the airline industry, has asked the finance ministry to examine the pros and cons of making jet fuel declared goods to bring down its prices and help the ailing aviation industry come out of the red, official sources said.        
	The civil aviation ministry has pitched for rationalising taxes on jet fuel to bring them down to international levels. The cost of jet fuel in India is almost 45-50 per cent higher than that in Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok and Hong Kong.        
	The high rate of sales tax on air turbine fuel (ATF), which varies from 4 per cent to 29 per cent, is the primary reason behind the exorbitant price of jet fuel.         
	While the airline industry has demanded a uniform sales tax of 4 per cent on ATF by giving it a declared goods status, the ministry favours an upper ceiling of 12.5 per cent, considering the revenue constraints faced by the state governments.

                                                                                                               Tighter duty drawback rules
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 12: Apparently concerned over the misuse of benefits by exporters, the finance ministry today proposed to introduce a new system to monitor the reimbursement of taxes under the duty drawback scheme with effect from April 1.        
	While inviting public comments, the ministry proposed that under the new system, notices would be issued by the customs to recover the drawback paid on export consignments in respect of which export proceeds had not been realised.        
	Admitting a lack of appropriate system to cross-check the figures provided by exporters, the draft circular said, it has become necessary for the department of revenue to put in place an in-house monitoring mechanism to monitor the realisation of proceeds for exports made under the drawback scheme.        
	In its report tabled in Parliament yesterday, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had also pointed out that under many export promotion schemes, exporters were submitting fake valuation bills to avail themselves of tax benefits, causing revenue loss worth thousands of crores of rupees.        
	Under the proposed bank realisation certificate module, exporters will be required to submit a port-wise certificate from the authorised dealers providing the details of shipment. The proposal was formulated by the ministry after holding consultations with the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, the Apparel Export Promotion Council, the Council for Leather Exports, the Engineering Export Promotion Council and the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts.        
	Duty drawback is paid to exporters to reimburse the taxes paid on goods during the course of production. At present, the monitoring of realisation of export proceeds in respect of goods exported under the drawback scheme is done on the basis of export outstanding statement received from the Reserve Bank of India.        
	The data is consolidated half-yearly and a large number of export consignments, especially up to Rs 10 lakh, are not reported through this statement.

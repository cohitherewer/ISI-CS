          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hard times                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 16: The collapse of Lehman Brothers has sent a frisson of anxiety through the banking industry.        
	On Tuesday, ICICI Bank  the countrys largest private sector bank  said it had an exposure of $80 million to senior bonds floated by Lehman Brothers and would have to make a provision of $28 million to cover for the expected losses.        
	ICICI Bank said only 50 per cent of the amount might be recovered. The bank had earlier made a provision for $12 million and had decided to top it up. The investments were made by its British subsidiary, ICICI Bank UK Plc. ICICI Bank Plc had invested 57 million euros (around $80 million) in senior bonds of Lehman Brothers.        
	There is no other material impact on ICICI Bank or ICICI Bank UK Plc because of the exposure to Lehman Brothers, Chanda Kochhar, joint MD and chief financial officer of ICICI Bank, said.        
	Kochhar said as of June 30, ICICI Bank and its subsidiaries had consolidated total assets of Rs 484,643 crore. ICICI Bank UK Plc had total assets of about $8.7 billion on that date. Kochhar tried to play down the impact of the Lehman exposure. She said ICICI Bank Plcs investment in the senior bonds of Lehman Brothers constituted less than one per cent of its total assets and less than 0.1 per cent of the consolidated total assets of the ICICI group.        
	This is the second time this year that ICICI Bank has been caught flat-footed on its overseas exposures. A few months ago, the bank made headlines because of the mark-to-market losses it suffered on its derivative exposures.         
	The market learnt of ICICIs exposure to the Lehman bonds through brokerage reports, which triggered huge selling in ICICI Bank shares on the stock exchanges today. The scrip closed at Rs 591.35, down nearly six per cent over Mondays level.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Growth drive                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: GM India today said it was on track to roll out its third mini car in India by the second half of 2009. The announcement comes at a time when other car firms are postponing their launches because of the global slowdown.         
	According to GM India managing director Karl Slym, the car will be a premium model. It will not only be manufactured in India but also in Europe and North America. At present, GM sells two mini cars  the Spark and Aveo UVA.        
	The global launch of the car will be followed by the rollout of the premium sedan Cruze. Slym said both the vehicles would be manufactured at the companys second plant at Talegaon, near Pune.        
	On reports of the company slipping into the red, Slym said, We can look after our operations. All our expansion activities are funded through our internal accruals.         
	Goldman Sachs had suspended its rating of US-based General Motors Corp on Thursday. Goldman said GM needed at least $22 billion of aid from the US government.        
	Apart from GM, other companies are going slow on their plans for new models in India.        
	Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Fiat and Hyundai have put their plans on the backburner.        
	The much awaited Nano from the Tata stable is likely to be rolled out in March next year, though there is no official confirmation.        
	The Maruti A-Star, which was slated to be launched in October, will now hit the road by November-end. Hyundai has also deferred the launch of the i20 to January.        
	Manufacturers have no option but to wait for the right time to launch their products since sales have been declining and financing is still a problem, auto analyst Murad Ali Baig said .        
	Fiat India has deferred the launch of the Linea, its mid-sized sedan, to December. The Grand Punto, which was due for launch in December, will come out next year.

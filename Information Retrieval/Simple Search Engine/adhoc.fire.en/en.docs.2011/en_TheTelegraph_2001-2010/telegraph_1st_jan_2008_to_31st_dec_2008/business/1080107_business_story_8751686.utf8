	Calcutta, Jan. 6: Parsoli Corporation Ltd, the only Islamic investment advisory and brokerage firm approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), is planning to launch an asset management company. 
    
	The asset management company will be set up as a subsidiary within 18 months to take up mutual fund activities, Zafar Sareshwala, managing director and chief executive officer of Parsoli, said on the sidelines of an Islamic investment opportunity conference here today.
    
	Parsoli Corporation will soon approach Sebi for its approval.
    
	Germanys Baader Wertpapierhandelsbank AG, a securities trading bank, which holds a 24.9 per cent stake in Parsoli Corporation, will also be a partner in the mutual fund business, Sareshwala added. 
    
	The German bank picked up 9.99 per cent in Parsoli in January 2006. 
    
	It increased its shareholding to 24.99 per cent later that year. 
    
	After a preferential allotment of convertible debentures, our stake in Parsoli Corporation will increase to a little over 40 per cent in April this year, said Uto Baader, chairman of the Baader group.
    
	Baader, who is also the president of the Munich Stock Exchange and a member of the strategic advisory board of the Stuttgart Stock Exchange, said German bourses might explore the possibility of picking up stakes in Indian regional stock exchanges.

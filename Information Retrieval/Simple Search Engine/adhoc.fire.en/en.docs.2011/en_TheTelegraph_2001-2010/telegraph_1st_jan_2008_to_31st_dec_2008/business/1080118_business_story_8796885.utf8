     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 17: Rising steel import is a cause for concern at Tata Steel, Indias No. 1 private steel maker, which also wants a clear policy on mine allocation that will facilitate the setting up of new plants.
    
	B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, said import would touch 5 million tonnes (mt), which in terms of value was Rs 10,000 crore.
    
	This is expected to go up to 10mt in less than three years, or Rs 20,000 crore.
    
	Speaking at the 2nd Asian Mining Congress in the city, he said India should add 5mt of new steel capacity every year but that was not happening.
    
	Apart from the problem of land acquisition which by itself is enormous in India, we simply dont have a transparent mineral policy. What is the method of allocation, what principles are to be used, a lack of speed, the situation is much more complicated and serious than what most people think, he said.
    
	Oman investment
    
	Muthuraman said Tata Steel would invest Rs 600 crore in the next three years to develop the Oman limestone field, which the company acquired yesterday.
    
	We are expecting 10mt limestone from there. It will be used both for Europe facilities and in India, he said.

	New Delhi, Aug 1: The government will convene a meeting of the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) to review the ban on export of non-basmati rice.        
	Commerce and industry Kamal Nath today said the meeting would deliberate on the options for non-basmati rice after taking stock of the total availability of the foodgrain.        
	There will be a meeting of the EGoM, which will review food stock, crop availability and take a decision on this issue, he told industry leaders at a seminar here.        
	Headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, the empowered group includes Nath, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	Among various other food items, the government had banned the export of common rice in March to improve its domestic availability and rein in inflation which has since come close to the 12-per-cent- mark.        
	Besides a ban on the non-basmati variety, the government imposed restrictions on basmati rice such as a minimum export price of $1,000 per tonne and an export tax.        
	Nath said the empowered group would decide on continuing a ban on futures trading on eight agricultural commodities, including urad and tur.        
	On the botched WTO talks, Nath said, I am disappointed because we came so close to running the last mile. We should continue with the engagement and I hope talks will resume soon.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 3: Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), has stumped up Rs 15,100 crore to convert 12 crore warrants into shares.        
	The warrant conversion will increase the promoters holding in the oil giant to 55 per cent from a little over 51 per cent. RIL told the stock exchanges today that it had allotted 12 crore equity shares to various promoter group companies after they exercised their right to conversion.         
	The warrants had been issued to these companies on April 12 last year.         
	These equity shares will be subject to a lock-in for three years from the date of allotment of the warrants.        
	As a result of the share allotment, the paid-up equity capital of the company will go up to Rs 1,573.79 crore.         
	The conversion price for the warrants was fixed at Rs 1,402 per share, which put the cost of these shares at Rs 16,824 crore.         
	Ambani had paid 10 per cent of the amount then. The rest was paid today.        
	He will be acquiring these shares fairly cheap even though the stock has been badly hammered on the bourses lately. The RIL shares today closed at 1,760.95, a drop of nearly 7.7 per cent as analysts worried that the prospect of a global slowdown would crimp RILs margins in its refining and petrochemical businesses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Brokers want FM to reverse tax tweak
                                                                                                               Brokers want FM to reverse tax tweak
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY amp; JAYATI GHOSE                          DEMAND DRAFT                                  
	New Delhi, March 6: Brokers want finance minister P. Chidambaram to bring back the rebate on securities transactions tax.         
	They say the move to discontinue the practice of setting off the securities transactions tax against income tax has seen liquidity drying up for most brokerages and an increase in volatility.        
	This is because small players have exited the market, leaving the field to only big foreign institutional investors who could swing the market any way they chose, the brokers said.        
	Th governments decision not to allow STT (securities transactions tax) to be offset against tax liability will affect liquidity badly, said Nirmal Aggarwal, president of the Association of National Stock Exchange Members of India.         
	The brokers have conveyed their anguish to Chidambaram at a conference organised by the association here today.        
	They will be meeting him again tomorrow to press for a review with the argument that the move impacts not only them but also market volatility.         
	According to Sanjay Gupta, managing director of OPG Securities, which deals in arbitrages, Arbitrage seekers and jobbers are impacted by the move and volatility is on the rise as they exit the market. Nifty intra-day volatility has gone up to 6 per cent.         
	Arbitrage seekers purchase and sell the same security at the same time in different markets to take advantage of the price difference, mainly between the cash and derivative segments.        
	A jobber, on the other hand, deals in a particular stock, mainly in the cash market, trading on short-term fluctuations.        
	The brokers feel the government is subjecting them to double taxation by not allowing STT to be set off against income tax.        
	However, market analysts have a different opinion.         
	KPMG partner Nikhil Bhatia said, With STT being treated like any other deductible expenditure against business income, the total tax outgo for investors will go up. However, it should not impact investor sentiments to such an extent that they would exit from markets.        
	Brokers said STT was an advance tax when it was introduced, but the government had now turned it into a separate tax.        
	Jobbers, who account for 70 per cent of the volume of transactions on the NSE, have come together in a separate organisation, called the Intermediaries and Investor Welfare Association.        
	In a letter to the finance minister, they said the move reversed a decision taken by Chidambaram in 2004-05.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 6: After wrapping up the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) deal early this week, Tata Motors today indicated that it planned to bring the two luxury brands to India.        
	Ravi Kant, managing director of Tata Motors, told analysts at a conference call that no time frame had been set for the entry of the two marques into India.        
	Although the sales of the two models are small in India, Tata Motors sees a good future for JLR vehicles in India as two other competitors  Mercedes and BMW  are performing well.        
	We cant bank on too many numbers, but Mercedes and BMW are doing well, Kant said.        
	On Monday, Tata Motors had announced that it had completed the JLR acquisition for $2.3 billion. David Smith, the acting chief executive officer (CEO) of Jaguar Land Rover, is now the new CEO of the business.        
	Smith, who also participated in the conference call, said that JLR was banking on other markets to offset slow sales in developed markets such as the UK and the US.        
	Sharing JLRs global plans, Smith said the slowdown in the two territories would be offset by strong numbers from new growth markets such as China and Russia.        
	In May, Jaguar sales rose 27 per cent to 1,757 vehicles in the US, while Land Rover sales fell 30 per cent to 3,003 units.         
	JLR intends to continue spending $700 to 800 million on research and development every year. It will also earmark 10 per cent of its sales revenue for capital expenditure.        
	Ford Motor Company, which contributed around $600 million to the Jaguar Land Rover pension plans, will supply components at commercial terms for the next seven to nine years. Its next pension fund infusion will be in 2009, Smith said.        
	According to Smith, while margins at JLR have been rising over the past three years, new launches are likely to have a positive impact on sales.        
	While admitting the tough emission norms that the EU plans to implement from 2012 would pose a challenge, Smith said the focus would be on improving efficiencies and trimming costs.        
	Kant said Tata Motors had no plans to use JLRs network to distribute its cars such as the Nano in overseas markets. JLR makes premium products and the Nano is at the other end of the spectrum. We have no plans to use the JLR network.        
	The JLR acquisition deal covers the ownership of Jaguar and Land Rover, manufacturing plants, two advanced design centres in the UK and a worldwide network of national sales companies.        
	Tata Motors had recently announced a Rs 10,000-crore capital expenditure plan over the next three years, which would include launching 100 new products or variants, streamlining of existing production facilities and the setting up of four greenfield units.

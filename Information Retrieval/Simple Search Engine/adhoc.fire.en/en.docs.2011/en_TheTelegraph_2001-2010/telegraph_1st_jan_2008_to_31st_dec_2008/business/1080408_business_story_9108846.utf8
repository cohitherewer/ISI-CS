The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi plans cross-listing recast
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sebi plans cross-listing recast
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 7: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) plans to take measures to smoothen cross-listing of companies on exchanges in India and abroad.         
	The market regulator plans to simplify the cross-listing procedures to broaden the secondary market platform for foreign companies and help Indian companies plug into advanced economies.         
	It is our belief that companies which are listed abroad will be interested to enter the Indian market. Similarly, Indian companies that have operations in other countries will be interested in listing abroad. We want to see how to smoothen this process, Bhave said.         
	The US and the European markets are already making serious efforts to promote cross-listing of companies, Bhave added.         
	Apart from big bulls such as Infosys, Wipro, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Tata Motors, there are several other Indian companies whose shares are traded on foreign exchanges. Many Indian companies are waiting to receive regulatory approvals to get listed abroad.         
	Recently, the New York Stock Exchange Euronext CEO Duncan L. Niederauer said the exchange was considering listing in Asian markets, including India.         
	Lenient regulatory norms for foreign investors helped to open up the financial sector and turned India into a favoured investment destination for a number foreign fund managers, brokerages and investment bankers.         
	We welcome foreign investment through FIIs into the domestic market, Bhave said. But we are yet to see listing of foreign companies on Indian bourses.         
	Bhave said the regulator had not received any reaction from the foreign companies even after formulating regulations for the issue of Indian depository receipts, a way by which overseas companies can access this market.         
	The market watchdog will meet foreign funds and their custodians to discuss issues relating to the proposed margins imposed on institutional investors in the cash market.         
	The FIIs and custodians have requested a meeting with us. We will certainly meet all institutions who face any difficulties, Bhave said.

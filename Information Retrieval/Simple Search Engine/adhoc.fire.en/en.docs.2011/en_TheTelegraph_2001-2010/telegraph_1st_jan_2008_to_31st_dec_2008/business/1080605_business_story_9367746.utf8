          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 4: The steep rise in fuel and LPG prices is just the beginning. The government today said there could be an aftershock.        
	It plans to revisit fuel prices in about four months and draw a road map to bring domestic prices on a par with global crude prices, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said.         
	Crude prices, after touching a record $135 a barrel on May 22, are now down to about $125 a barrel. Todays rise in petrol, diesel and LPG cylinder prices is based on a crude value of $113 a barrel.        
	Srinivasan said the measures announced today  the price rise, the duty rejig and more oil bonds  would bring down the gap between domestic prices and global crude prices in 2008-09 to Rs 41,992 crore. The earlier forecast was a massive Rs 2,45,305 crore.        
	He said the finance ministry would issue bonds worth Rs 1,35,000 crore, but in a separate press conference, revenue secretary P.V. Bhide said the government would issue bonds worth about Rs 94,600 crore.        
	The bonds would be issued on a quarterly basis, and on being informed about the revenue secretarys comment, Srinivasan said the two sets of figures would be resolved at the end of the first quarter.        
	State-owned oil companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will absorb Rs 20,000 crore of the losses this year, against Rs 16,125 crore last year.        
	Officials said the government had decided to increase the subsidy contribution by upstream firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL) to Rs 45,000 crore in this fiscal from Rs 25,708 crore last year. ONGC and OIL give discounts on the crude they sell to the companies.        
	The hike in fuel prices  Rs 5 per litre for petrol, Rs 3 per litre for diesel and Rs 50 per LPG cylinder  will give the oil companies an additional earning of Rs 21,123 crore, while the government will forego Rs 22,660 crore of revenues by way of duty cuts.        
	The government announced an across-the-board 5 per cent cut in customs duties on oil products, bringing the rates on crude to zero, on petrol and diesel to 2.5 per cent and on other products such as aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and naphtha for non-fertiliser use to 5 per cent.        
	Besides, the excise duty on petrol has been cut by Re 1 a litre to Rs 13.45 and on diesel to Rs 3.60.         
	IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the package announced today addressed the liquidity and profitability issues faced by the retailers.         
	Oil panel        
	As a long-term strategy to deal with the oil crisis, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today constituted a committee headed by former cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi to go into the financial position of oil companies.        
	Saumitra Chaudhuri, member, Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, and Arvind Virmani, chief economic advisor, Government of India, will be the other members of the committee.         
	The committee will examine the impact of the increase in oil prices between 2004-05 and 2008 on the financial health of oil companies  upstream exploration firms, refiners and downstream marketing entities.

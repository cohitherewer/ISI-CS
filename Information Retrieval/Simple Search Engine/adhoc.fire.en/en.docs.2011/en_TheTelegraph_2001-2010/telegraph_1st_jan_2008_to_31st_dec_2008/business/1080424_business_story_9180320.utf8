          OUR BUREAU                                                Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar (second from left) with state ministers of   agriculture and agriculture marketing in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)          
	New Delhi, April 23: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today ruled out importing wheat as the country is expected to have a bumper crop this year.        
	Just two days ago, minister of state for agriculture Akhilesh Prasad Singh had informed Parliament that the Centre had asked four states, including West Bengal, to import wheat for distribution through ration shops.        
	There is no question of (wheat) imports this year. In fact, we might be able to keep some reserves for next year, Pawar told reporters here.        
	According to government estimates, wheat output may climb to 76.8 million tonnes (mt) in this crop season  July 2007 to June 2008  against 75.8 mt in the last season.        
	On Monday, Singh said the Centre had directed four states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal  to import wheat between March and May.        
	He said the central government would subsidise the import. Bengal was the first to take up the offer  in early April, the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation floated a tender to import 186,000 tonnes of wheat. The tender closes on May 5.         
	To stem increases in the price of the foodgrain, the government imported 1.8mt of wheat in 2007 and another 5.5mt in the previous year. It also stopped futures trading in wheat and lentils as well as exports of edible oils and rice.        
	Pawar said government agencies might buy 17-19 million tonnes of wheat from farmers this year, exceeding their target of 15 million tonnes. He said the government had already reached 60 per cent of the target.        
	Farmers are selling about one million tonnes a day and we hope this trend to continue for at least the next 10 days, he said. Whatever wheat will come to the market, we will buy. Yesterday, the Centre had forecast bumper foodgrain this year, though experts had cast doubts on the declared figure of 227.32 mt.        
	T. Haque, who chaired the governments committee on farm prices till last month, said: The figures are inflated. The figures we had with us showed that foodgrain production was likely to be 218 million tonnes during 2007-2008, a million tonnes less than earlier estimated.        
	The government is under attack both within Parliament and outside over three-year-high inflation of 7.41 per cent, fuelled by rising prices. Since March, the government has slashed import duties on edible oils, banned the export of cement and non-basmati rice and withdrawn export sops on steel to increase supplies and control inflation.

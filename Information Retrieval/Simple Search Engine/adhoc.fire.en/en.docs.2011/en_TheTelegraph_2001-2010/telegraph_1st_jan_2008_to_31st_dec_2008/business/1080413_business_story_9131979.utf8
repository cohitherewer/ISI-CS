The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cement import to be doubled
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cement import to be doubled

	New Delhi, April 12: The government is planning to double cement import from Pakistan to put a leash on the spiralling inflation, which has touched 7.41 per cent.         
	The country plans to increase the import of cement to 4,000 tonnes a day to get rid of the disparity between demand and supply, commerce secretary G. K. Pillai said.         
	Why allow exports when there is a shortage? We are going to double imports from May, he said.        
	India allowed duty-free import of cement from Pakistan last year, as domestic firms were running almost at full capacity and would not be able to meet the demand in near future.        
	Indian companies plan to increase cement output by 100 million tonnes within 2010. This will ease pressure on prices, Pillai said. The government banned cement export yesterday.         
	The ban will not impact the SEZs, Union commerce minister Kamal Nath said on the sidelines of an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	Asked whether the government was considering imposing a similar ban on steel exports, Nath said the steel ministry was working on the issue. The cabinet committee on prices will take a decision at its meeting next week.        
	The message is clear that the government is ready to take whatever steps are required to control inflation, he said.        
	Speaking on the export target, the minister said the Indian economy had adequate momentum to sustain a growth rate of 22-23 per cent in exports.        
	If we maintain the same growth rate, or raise it by 1 or 2 per cent, we will reach $200 billion, he said.

	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd is looking at bringing in more products from its global portfolio.         
	The Rs 1,200-crore FMCG company is planning to introduce personal care products and over-the-counter drugs.         
	The company, which owns iconic brands such as Dettol and Disprin, sells over 15 brands. It recently launched air freshner brand Air Wick and the Clearasil acne cream from the Boots stable.        
	According to Chander Mohan Sethi, chairman and managing director of Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd, We are looking at segments such as personal care and over-the-counter drugs and have a wide array of product portfolio to choose from.         
	We had acquired Boots in early 2006, which has brands including Nurofen painkillers and Strepsils throat lozenges. We are constantly evaluating our product mix and are trying to find the best mix for current market conditions, Sethi said.        
	He said the company was focusing on the liquid handwash segment after investing heavily in the Dettol brand.         
	Household penetration of handwash is only seven per cent in the country. One can imagine the market potential, Sethi said. The disinfectant market in the country is over Rs 2,000 crore.        
	In the UK, the group is set to relaunch the Clearasil Base range and launch the new Dettol hand sanitiser.        
	Suitable domestic acquisitions are also on the radar for the company.        
	We have acquired global brands for a strategic fit and are always on the lookout for new opportunities, Sethi said.        
	After Boots, Reckitt bought the US cough and congestion medicine group, Adams, for 1.1 billion last year, which brought cough medicine Delsym and decongestant Mucinex into the companys portfolio.         
	In 2007, Reckitt reported an 18 per cent increase in its net profits at 905 million.                          
	The company, which traces its origins to 1814, was formed by a merger in 1999 between Reckitt and Dutch firm Benckiser. It now has operations in 60 countries and employs around 22,000.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, April 29: The government today changed duty rates on a raft of items to improve their availability and fight inflation.        
	Import duties were lowered on some raw materials such as skimmed milk powder, while export duties were slapped on cement and basmati rice.        
	In the amendments to the Finance Bill 2008-09, P. Chidambaram also scrapped the import duty on pig iron, zinc and metallurgical coal, which will provide some relief to big steel makers.        
	The finance minister also replaced the specific excise duty on a 50kg cement bag costing Rs 250 with a 12 per cent ad valorem duty, while imposing the export duty of Rs 8,000 on basmati rice.        
	Chidambaram also extended the tax benefits to software firms by a year till March 31, 2010 and to refineries till March 31, 2012.        
	Chidambaram said, The food situation has improved in the last two-three weeks. Let us see how these measures come together and impact inflation.         
	We are ready with a set of administrative measures. We will discuss these measures in the next few days, he said.        
	The duty changes announced today will lead to a net burden of Rs 1,500 crore on the exchequer.        
	To ensure adequate availability of milk, the customs duty on skimmed milk powder was reduced to five per cent from 15 per cent. On butter oil, the customs duty was reduced to 30 per cent from 40 per cent.        
	Import duties on cut and polished coloured gems and stones have been scrapped, while the import duty on newsprint was reduced to 3 per cent from 5 per cent.        
	Chidambaram extended the excise duty exemption on electric cars to electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers. To ensure availability of clean potable water, the government exempted replacement kits for water filters from the current 14 per cent excise duty.        
	Finance Bill passed         
	The Lok Sabha today passed the Finance Bill 2008-09 after Chidambaram moved several amendments incorporating the duty measures to contain inflation.        
	The bill was passed through voice vote. Now the bill will go to the Rajya Sabha and thereafter to President Pratibha Patil for assent.        
	While changes in the customs duty rate will come into effect from today, export duty rates will be effective from the day the Finance Bill gets the assent of the President.

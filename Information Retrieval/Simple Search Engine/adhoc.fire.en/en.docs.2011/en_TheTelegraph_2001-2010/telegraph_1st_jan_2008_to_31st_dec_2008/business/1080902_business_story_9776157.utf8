          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: Reliance Industries is keen to acquire ready-to-wear brands as it strives to become the No. 1 player in textiles by 2010.        
	As part of this strategy, the company has relaunched the Vimal brand. The company is launching ready-to-wear clothes for the first time, with a focus on mens formals. Anand Parekh, president of Reliances textile business, said the company would look at cornering a 35-40 per cent share in menswear from 15 per cent now.        
	He said reaching the top spot in two years was a difficult task, prompting the company to look at acquisitions. It is a good strategy. Organically, you cannot just reach that figure. We have to do both.         
	Parekh, however, refused to say whether the target firm would be an Indian or a global brand. We are focusing only on mens formals and that is where we will be. The leading ready-to-wear mens brands are Van Heusen, Arrow, Louis Philippe, Color Plus and Parx.         
	Parekh was here to launch the first Vimal store in the city in a brand new format. The company will soon have five more stores in Calcutta. In the last 10 months, Reliance has opened 12 new format stores in 11 cities.         
	All the stores are company-owned, and the plan is to have 25 outlets by the end of the year.        
	Nationally, the textile and apparel market is a Rs 100,000-crore one, with the share of ready-to-wear clothes being Rs 35,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore.        
	Reliance products are available in 2,500-3,000 stores across all formats such as big retail chains and multi-brand outlets. It hopes to expand this number to 10,000-12,000.        
	Export thrust        
	Reliance makes 22 million cubic metres of fabric yearly. In terms of value, 50 per cent is exported. It has now ventured into the export of readymade garments, with leading global retailers procuring their branded products.        
	Reliance also plans to enter the womenswear segment at an appropriate time.

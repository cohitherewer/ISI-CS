	New Delhi, June 5: Graphites electrode manufacturer HEG Ltd is expanding its manufacturing capacity to 80,000 tonnes per annum from 60,000 tonnes per annum at an investment of Rs 190 crore.        
	The board has approved expanding manufacturing capacity at Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh, the company said. The capacity expansion will be completed by the last quarter of 2009.        
	The funds for expansion will be generated from internal accruals. The market is very bullish. We are connected to the steel industry and, internationally, steel is in a very good shape, Ravi Jhunjhunwala, chairman, HEG Limited, said.        
	However, he said the availability of needle coke, a key raw material, was critical to capacity expansion.        
	The company was working on options such as procuring more needle coke from existing suppliers and tapping the global markets. We are fighting to get everything that is available in the market. That is the major challenge in this whole thing, Jhunjhunwala said.        
	HEG is also investing Rs 90 crore to expand its captive power generation capacity by 33 mega watts.

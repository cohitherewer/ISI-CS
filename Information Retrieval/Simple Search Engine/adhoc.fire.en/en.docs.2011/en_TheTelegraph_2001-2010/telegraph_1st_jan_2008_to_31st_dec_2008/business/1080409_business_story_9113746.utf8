                              Dell: Hopeful                            
	Tel Aviv, April 8 (Reuters): Dell Inc expects to expand its profitability this year as the company shifts its resources to faster growing markets, chief executive Michael Dell said on Tuesday.        
	Dell, in his first official visit to Israel, told reporters that the worlds second-largest computer maker was working to reduce costs to make its retail business profitable.        
	We are thinking in a long-term context, Dell said.         
	 quot;Last year growth in EPS (earnings per share) was 15 per cent. We have a goal to increase our EPS, and we have the right plans in place to grow EPS on a healthy basis.        
	He reiterated the companys plan to buy back another $1 billion of its own shares in the current quarter after repurchasing $4 billion in the fourth quarter.        
	Last year, Dell broke away from its direct-sales model to sell computers in retail outlets in the US.

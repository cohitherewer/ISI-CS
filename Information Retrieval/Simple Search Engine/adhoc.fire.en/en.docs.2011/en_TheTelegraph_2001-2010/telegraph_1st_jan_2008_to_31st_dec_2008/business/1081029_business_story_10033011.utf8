The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil price rises to $65 a barrel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil price rises to $65 a barrel
                            
	London, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Oil rose to nearly $65 a barrel on Tuesday, tracking a recovery in European and Asian stock markets as dealers returned to buy beaten-down shares.        
	The market also drew support from evidence that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) would act upon last weeks decision to cut output as the United Arab Emirates state oil company reduced volumes to term customers.        
	Opec ministers said they were ready to take further action. US light crude for December delivery rose $1.43 to $64.65 by 1236 GMT.        
	London Brent crude gained $1.06 to $62.47.         
	The credit crisis, which began with failing US mortgages, has widened into a worldwide rout as investors have dumped stocks and commodities, shunned higher-risk emerging markets and sought out the safest government bonds and currencies.        
	Global economic turmoil has already had a major impact on fuel consumption and some analysts have predicted $50 a barrel  widely seen as the cash cost of production for many newer oil projects  is possible in the short term.        
	US crude has already dropped nearly 60 per cent from a record of above $147 a barrel in July to a low of $61.30 on Monday, its weakest for 17 months.        
	Opecs announcement last week that it would cut output by 1.5 million barrels per day initially did little to stem oils fall as the market was sceptical about the reduction of supply.        
	Opecs secretary general said that if prices continued to fall, it could decide to hold another meeting before its next scheduled talks in December.        
	For the next indication of the balance of supply and demand, traders were looking ahead to US fuel stocks data to be released on Wednesday.

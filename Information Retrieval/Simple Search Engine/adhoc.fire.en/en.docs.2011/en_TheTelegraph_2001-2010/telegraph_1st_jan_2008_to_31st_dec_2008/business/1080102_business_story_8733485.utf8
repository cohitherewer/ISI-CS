             Short circuit
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 1: Ailing tyre maker Dunlop India has taken West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL) to court after the Bengal government outfit snapped power supply to its Sahagunj factory in Hooghly.
    
	The company has moved a writ petition that will come up before a vacation bench of Calcutta High Court tomorrow.
    
	The Dunlop management has sought the courts direction for immediate restoration of power at Sahagunj which is without electricity since the evening of December 24.
    
	Dunlop has also sought compensation for losses suffered because of the non-availability of power for more than a week.
    
	The problem started when Axis Bank, formerly UTI Bank, withdrew Dunlops letter of credit (LoC) that was a security deposit for WBSEDCL.
    
	The company submitted a new LoC on December 31 from ICICI Bank, but WBSEDCL rejected it as it was not irrevocable, which is mandatory under the rules set by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).
    
	Under an irrevocable letter of credit or bank guarantee, the bank pays the electricity distribution company the energy bill of the consumer irrespective of whether the consumer pays the money to the bank or not.
    
	Without any security we didnt have any means to recover the dues if the company fails to pay the bills. But again they brought a similar defective LoC. We are bound by CERC regulations, a WBSEDCL official said.
    
	WBSEDCL denied having received any legal notice so far. We have not got anything so far. If Dunlop decides to take the legal course, let it be, the official added.
    
	Dunlop officials argued that a company in the process of reviving itself should not be clubbed with others.
    
	There is no outstanding to WBSEDCL. We have paid Rs 5.38 crore to them so far. This issue could have been negotiated without snapping power, they pointed out.
    
	The West Bengal State Electricity Board, which had been split into two, one being WBSEDCL, had distributed power without any bank guarantee to Sahagunj for seven years before Ruia took over in December 2005. 
    
	The company is now burdened with clearing arrears of Rs 13.42 crore that had arisen mainly because of the distribution of free power.

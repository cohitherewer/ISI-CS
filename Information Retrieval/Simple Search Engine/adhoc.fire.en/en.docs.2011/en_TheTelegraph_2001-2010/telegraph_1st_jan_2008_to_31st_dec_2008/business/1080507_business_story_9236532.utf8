                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reliance closes all pumps
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        Deora: Tough Time    
	New Delhi, May 6: Reliance Industries has closed all its 1,432 petrol pumps in the country.         
	There have virtually been no sales from the pumps as buyers preferred the outlets of public sector companies where fuel prices were lower by as much as Rs 8-10 per litre.        
	Reliance owned less than three per cent of the 36,936 petrol pumps in the country. Of the total retail outlets, state run Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited own 34,304 pumps.         
	Besides Reliance, the other private players are Essar Oil and Shell India.        
	Reliance has informed that sales at their retail outlets were negligible due to price differential between private and public sector outlets, leading to the closure of all their 1,432 pumps in the country with effect from March 15, petroleum minister Murli Deora informed the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Public sector firms currently sell petrol at a loss of Rs 13.97 a litre and diesel at a discount of Rs 20.97 per litre.         
	This revenue loss is made up by the government through oil bonds and a subsidy share from upstream firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd and GAIL (India) Limited.        
	Private entities such as Reliance were not entitled to the subsidy and priced fuel from their pumps at much higher rates, leading to a fall in market share.        
	The prices of sensitive petroleum products are fixed by the public sector oil marketing companies in consultation with the government, Deora said.         
	Private oil companies are not subject to pricing restrictions by the government and are free to take their pricing decisions on commercial considerations.        
	However, Essar Oil and Shell India have not closed their petrol pumps, he said.         
	Reliance had the highest number of petrol pumps in Gujarat with 246 outlets, followed by Maharashtra (160), Uttar Pradesh (132), Andhra Pradesh (129) and Rajasthan (107). Deora said IOC, BPCL and HPCL planned to set up 1,830 more petrol pumps in the country during the 2008-09 fiscal.        
	Gas dispute        
	The restraint on Reliance Industries to sell natural gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 field to third parties will continue till July 22, after Bombay High Court today ordered status quo to be maintained in the case filed by Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Natural Resources.

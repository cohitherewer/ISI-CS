               Hard times
              
	New York, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc said on Tuesday a huge write-down for mortgages triggered a nearly $10-billion quarterly loss, about twice analysts estimates, and that it was raising $14.5 billion, slashing its dividend and cutting 4,200 jobs.
    
	The capital infusion from investors, including the Singapore government, former Citigroup chief executive Sanford Sandy Weill and Saudi prince al Waleed bin Talal, Citigroups largest individual shareholder, may help the largest US bank steer through the credit market and housing crises, though analysts said Citigroup faced a tough road ahead.
    
	People knew it would be a kitchen-sink quarter, said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl amp; Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. I dont think theyre out of the woods yet.
    
	Citigroups fourth-quarter loss of $9.83 billion was its first since the bank was created in 1998 from the merger of Citicorp and Weills Travellers Group.
    
	It stemmed largely from $18.1 billion of write-downs and related expenses for exposure to sub-prime mortgages, plus a $5.41-billion increase in credit costs, including a $3.85-billion charge to boost reserves.
    
	The net loss of $1.99 per share was roughly twice as large as analysts expected. Citigroup cut its quarterly dividend 41 per cent to 32 cents per share from 54 cents, a move that could save it about $4.4 billion a year.
    
	You expected the figures to be shocking, said Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global in London. You cannot say its definitively over but you have got to say this is probably the big one.
    
	Citigroup shares fell 44 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $28.62 in pre-market trading. The shares have fallen 47 per cent in the last year, compared with a 28 per cent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index. 
    
	Citigroup said it was raising $12.5 billion from a private sale of convertible preferred securities.
    
	It said this included $6.88 billion from a Singapore fund, and investments from Weill and his family foundation, al Waleed, the Kuwait Investment Authority, Capital Research amp; Management, and the state of New Jersey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airtel appetite for buyouts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airtel appetite for buyouts

	New Delhi, Nov. 3: Bharti Airtel is looking for overseas acquisitions, just five months after being rebuffed by South Africas MTN over an alliance.        
	There are plans, but there is no immediate target, said Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Enterprises.         
	He said valuations of telecom firms across the world had moderated. Bharti Airtel is an arm of Bharti Enterprises.        
	Bharti officials said the company was looking at possible acquisitions in emerging markets where it would be able to replicate its low-cost business model. They were confident that the global credit crisis would not pose a challenge.        
	Earlier this year, Bharti was in talks with MTN for a merger, but the talks failed in May as the Indian firm did not agree to a structure that would have made it a subsidiary of the South African company.         
	Bharti said more than a dozen international bankers were eager to fund the MTN deal, which was worth more than $60 billion.         
	Besides telecom, Bharti Enterprises has interests in financial services and retail. It runs life insurance, general insurance and asset management businesses in partnership with Frances AXA and is planning to expand.         
	There is no slowdown in Bhartis retail expansion plans, and its first medium-sized store will open in December, said Rajan Mittal, managing director, Bharti Enterprises.        
	The retail firm has opened 10 stores ahead of the opening of its wholesale centres in partnership with Wal-Mart in the first quarter of 2009.        
	Rajan Mittal said Airtels Sri Lankan operations would start in December.         
	We will roll out the services next month as all formalities are done and issues relating to inter-connectivity have been sorted out, he said.        
	The telecom giant had been facing problems because of the reluctance of local carriers to give inter-connections.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: The government plans to invite expressions of interest (EoIs) for 14 closed tea gardens in Bengal and Kerala next week.
    
	The law ministry is expected to clear the proposal and we hope to invite expressions of interest for the gardens, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce.
    
	In Bengal there are 13 closed gardens, and the EoIs will be invited for nine.
    
	Section 16(E) of the Tea Act empowers the Tea Board to take over gardens closed for over three months. Under the act, the board can also find new owners for the gardens.
    
	Ramesh said the Bengal government had earlier cancelled land leases of two gardens  Ramjhora and Kathaguri  and had issued EoIs. The bids, which closed on Tuesday, will soon be opened and the gardens revived. 
    
	He said negotiations were already under way between existing and prospective owners of the Samsing and Bharnobari gardens. 
    
	A shortage of technical staff and researchers was affecting the development of the industry in North Bengal, the minister added.
    
	He said the Union cabinet has approved the proposal of vesting the Tea Board with powers to recruit technical staff and researchers. Their salaries will be on a par with researchers of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
    
	Ramesh said the department of biotechnology had so far contributed Rs 4 crore for research on tea. A consortium of research organisations in Assam is involved in the project. They are working on a mosquito-free variety and on developing a winter crop.
    
	The minister said tea was plucked throughout the year all over the world, but in Bengal and Assam, whose crop constitutes 80 per cent of the countrys production, there were no activities for three months in winter because of the absence of a seasonal variety.

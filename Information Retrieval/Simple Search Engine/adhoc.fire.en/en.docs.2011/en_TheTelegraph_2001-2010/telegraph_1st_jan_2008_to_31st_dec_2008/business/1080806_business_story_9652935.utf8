          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will test a payment mechanism for IPOs, in which retail investors will pay only for the shares allotted to them.        
	Hopefully by August-end, we will start the pilot project for alternative IPO payment, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Financial Planning Standards Board India.        
	At present, retail investors pay upfront the full amount for the shares they have bid for, and based on the number of shares allotted, the excess money is returned. However, large institutional investors put only 10 per cent of the money.         
	The regulators move is aimed at ensuring parity between retail and institutional investors. It also wants to do away with the refund process. The new system will co-exist with the current procedure of payment.        
	Currency futures        
	Bhave said three entities had applied for launching currency futures. He did not disclose the names of the entities.        
	In June, Sebi had approved the regulatory framework for setting up exchange-traded currency futures.         
	Under a currency futures contract, two parties agree to buy and sell currency at a future date at a pre-determined price.

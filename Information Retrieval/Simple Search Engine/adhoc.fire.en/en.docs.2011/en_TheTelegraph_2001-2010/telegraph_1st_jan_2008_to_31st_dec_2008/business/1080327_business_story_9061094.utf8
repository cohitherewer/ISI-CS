The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Debate on export target 
                                                                                                               Debate on export target 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, March 26: The government is considering a $200-billion export target for 2008-09 in the annual review of the foreign trade policy next month. However, exporters, who are already hit by the rupees appreciation, are sceptical about such a high target when the signs of a slowdown in the US economy are looming large on them.        
	There has to be a realistic approach in setting the target. This year we are unable to achieve the target, what is the point in setting such ambitious targets, said D.K. Nair, secretary general of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry.        
	However, the government is considering an increase in the export target to $200 billion as lower import costs have benefited the sector, which re-exports finished goods, officials said.        
	The textile sector is one of those hard hit by the rupee appreciation. About four million people in the labour intensive sectors such as textile, leather, marine products and handicrafts have lost their jobs till September.        
	The policy should be a trade facilitator and address the export vision in terms of both short-term and long-term goals and work in tandem with other government policies aimed to boost economic growth in the country, said K.T. Chacko, director, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.        
	The exporters demand refund of state levies, introduction of some mechanism to arrest the impact of the rupee appreciation and removal of service tax on export items.        
	Exporters were looking forward to the budget for some relief, but finance minister P. Chidambaram failed to address their concerns and now they are expecting the trade policy to provide them some direction.        
	The government has to come out with some kind of mechanism to deal with state level duties and on how to refund it as it involves a long value chain, Nair said.        
	Chacko said, Goods and not taxes should be exported. The government should act as a trade facilitator and make the cost of doing export business transparent and less cumbersome.         
	The government should come out with a policy on dealing with cyclical trade phenomena and create a fund to provide some kind of currency stability for exporters to be competitive, said Linu Mathew Philip, trade analyst with the Centre for Trade and Development.

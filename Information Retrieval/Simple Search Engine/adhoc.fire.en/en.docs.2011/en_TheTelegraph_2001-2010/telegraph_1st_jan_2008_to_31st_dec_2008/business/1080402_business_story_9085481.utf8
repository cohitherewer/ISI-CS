          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 1: The governments inflation-busting steps announced late Monday had an immediate impact on the commodities market today when edible oil and oilseeds futures hit lower limits. Many other commodities for May delivery also ruled weak.        
	Traders said it was a knee-jerk reaction as the markets were surprised by the extent of the import duty cuts on certain commodities.        
	While all edible oil in crude form can now be imported at zero duty, the duty on refined oil will be 7.5 per cent.        
	The markets were expecting some measures from the government. They were nervous on Monday but today they were surprised to see the drastic duty cuts which led to adjustment, said a trader. The lower limits were reached within an hour of trading.        
	Kishore Narne, head at Anand Rathi Commodities, told The Telegraph that May futures on soyabean refined oil, mustard seed, chana were lower by 4 per cent. Other items such as sugar, potato and turmeric also ruled weak. Narne forecast that certain items such as soyabean refined oil could see more pressure in the near term.        
	At the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX), the MCX Agri index was lower by around 3.22 per cent.         
	Narne said global trends also led to weaker prices in some commodities such as refined soyabean oil.

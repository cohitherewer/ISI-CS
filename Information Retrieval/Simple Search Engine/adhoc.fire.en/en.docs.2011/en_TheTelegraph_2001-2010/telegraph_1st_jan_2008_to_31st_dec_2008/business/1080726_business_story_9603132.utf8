          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chandrasekhar in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 25: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has urged the government to expedite reforms in the agricultural and financial sectors.        
	The industry body today submitted a 100-day agenda to the government, prescribing measures to speed up investments in not only the financial and the farm sectors but also in telecom and infrastructure, to bring about a double-digit economic growth rate.        
	Chamber president Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the 100-day agenda was aimed at restoring the confidence of investors in the economy, which has declined in the last nine months because of rising interest rates.        
	In a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today, Chandrasekhar said that the Reserve Banks tight monetary policy should not turn into a permanent solution for taming inflation. If the RBI continues with this policy for two more quarters, we (industry) may fall into the realm of stagnation.        
	Industrial growth has been falling in recent months, and industry associations blame this on high lending rates, which have stalled the expansion plans of many companies.        
	Chandrashekhar said the Prime Minister would be meeting Ficci officials in mid-August.         
	Stressing the importance of foreign investors as an important source of capital for the domestic insurance business, Ficci said, The government should take up the insurance amendment bill, including the raising of the FDI limit to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.        
	It also asked the government to pass the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill and the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill. Both these bills are pending in Parliament.        
	Calling for a second green revolution, the chamber suggested that private sector investment in farm infrastructure should be eligible for 150 per cent weighted deduction in taxation.        
	Ficci also sought policy changes that would allow the setting up of private mandis and promote contract farming.

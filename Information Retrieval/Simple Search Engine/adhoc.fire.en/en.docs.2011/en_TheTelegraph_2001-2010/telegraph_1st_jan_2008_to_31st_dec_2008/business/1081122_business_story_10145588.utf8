                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infy deal chase trips on global turmoil
                            
	Bangalore, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Infosys Technologies Ltd is pursuing five to six outsourcing deals, each worth $50-$200 million, but the global economic downturn has slowed the deals, chief financial officer V. Balakrishnan said.        
	Even now we are pursuing some of the large deals, Balakrishnan said, adding that the velocity of business is getting hurt because of the environment.        
	Nasdaq-listed Infosys designs supply chains, develops applications and offers back-office services. It gets more than half of its revenue from the US but is expanding to Europe and elsewhere.        
	Customers are more cautious now. They want to conserve cash, Balakrishnan said. He said companies that were doing 10 projects earlier were now doing only three or four, while some were postponing plans.        
	Indias large pool of English-speaking engineering workers and cheaper wages have attracted outsourcing from firms such as Citigroup, ABN Amro, Nortel, Goldman Sachs and Airbus. But the economic slowdown in the US, which accounts for more than half of the IT sectors export revenue, and turmoil in the global financial sector have halted its scorching pace of growth and battered stocks.

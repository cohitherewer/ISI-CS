The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil hunt date caught in tax tangle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil hunt date caught in tax tangle
          R.SURYAMURTHY                                          SOP OPERA		    
	New Delhi, May 5: The seventh round of bidding for oil and gas blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) could be postponed by a fortnight as the government fears poor response from exploration and production firms.        
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the government could postpone the bidding date from May 16 to May 30 because of a lack of clarity on the seven-year tax holiday to be granted to oil firms.        
	We expect that there could be some clarity on the issue by the end of this month as withdrawing the promises made during the roadshows would put the country in a bad light. The tax holiday was cleared by the Cabinet and its withdrawal in the budget would affect investor sentiment, they said.        
	The government had postponed the bidding date from April 11 to May 16 as the finance and petroleum ministries held contradictory views on the tax benefits that should be granted to oil companies.         
	The petroleum ministry had promised a seven-year income tax holiday to firms participating in Nelp auctions. However, the finance ministry withdrew the proposal in the Finance Bill 2008-09.        
	The bidding date had been postponed in the hope that the finance minister would clarify the issue in his reply to the budget before it was passed by Parliament.        
	However, much to the disappointment of the industry, Chidambaram had said that the decision by the tribunals and courts would be binding on the interpretation of section 80 IB(9) of the income tax act.        
	Under the section, companies undertaking the production and refining of mineral oil will get a 100 per cent tax relief on profits for seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial year. With the introduction of the proposed changes, the tax holiday stands withdrawn if operations begin after April 1, 2009.         
	Further, in the explanatory memorandum of this years budget, the term mineral oil does not include petroleum and natural gas, which means the tax holiday may also be withdrawn from the exploration and production sector.         
	Chidambaram had said the dispute would be resolved in a matter of six months. Though he did not mention what was under dispute, observers felt the minister was referring to mineral oil as only crude and not natural gas since production of the latter was not eligible for tax breaks.        
	Analysts said Indias oil and gas blocks were competing against those in Africa and South America where reserve potential was expected to be high. Policy amendments and frequent changes in the bidding date suggest that global majors are not showing the kind of interest the government expects.        
	The government is offering 57 oil and gas blocks under the seventh round, of which 39 are recycled blocks  those which found no bidders in previous rounds or were relinquished by companies who did not find the initial data encouraging.        
	Of the 57 oil and gas blocks, nine are in shallow water, 19 in deep-sea and 29 on land.

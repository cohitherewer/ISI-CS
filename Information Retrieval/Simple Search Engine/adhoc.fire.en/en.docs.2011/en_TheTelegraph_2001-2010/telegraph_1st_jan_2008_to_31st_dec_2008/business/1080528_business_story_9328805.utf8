	Calcutta, May 27: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) will prepare a vision document for the economic and industrial development of Bengal.        
	The chamber will prepare vision documents for each state, including Bengal, to be done in two months, the newly elected president of CII, K.V. Kamath, said here today.        
	Kamath today met the top officials of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and also called upon Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The state wing of the countrys premier industry chamber will work towards strengthening tea trade with Russia.        
	Kamath said the CII would initiate dialogues state governments to press for labour reform.        
	The CII will tie up with ITIs (industrial training institutes) for skill development to suit the needs of industry. The chamber will also have a full-fledged office for the state. Currently it works inside the premises of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	Entrepreneurs should get incentives to set up downstream steel units as steel is a promising sector in the eastern region.        
	The CII will open five offices outside India in the current financial year. Well open four offices in Africa and one in China. After China and India, Africa is going to be a growth centre in the next 15-20 years, Kamath said. The chamber will also open seven more offices in the country.        
	We have identified four major challenges before the country and industry today. These are a high global crude price, inflation, infrastructure bottlenecks and equitable growth. The prices of consumer goods and commodities are ruling high in almost every country across the world. Reining in on inflation will be a great challenge, Kamath said.         
	However, he expressed satisfaction with the 35 per cent domestic savings rate as it was sufficient to sustain a more than 8 per cent GDP growth.        
	 What we need to do is to increase the share of the manufacturing sector in total GDP to 25 per cent in another 7-8 years from 18 per cent now, he said.        
	On the interest rate situation, Kamath said, As a banker, and not on behalf of ICICI Bank, I can say that the liquidity situation in the system is pretty good while the demand for credit is lower than last year. In this situation, every bank will have to take a call on the interest rate depending on its own asset-liability position.         
	Yesterday, the countrys largest public sector bank, the State Bank of India, increased its deposit rate of above one-year maturity.

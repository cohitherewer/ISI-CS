                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A billion-dollar growth story     -  Infosys beats Street forecast
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Mumbai, April 15: Infosys Technologies, Indias second largest software exporter, today emerged as a $4 billion company  and forecast that its revenues would top $5 billion by March next year.        
	The software giant unveiled robust results in the fourth quarter of 2008 (January-March) with a 9.1 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 1,249 crore and gave a strong medium-term outlook, clearly signalling that the fear of a US recession would not crimp its performance.        
	The stock surged 6.22 per cent to close at Rs 1510.40 on the National Stock Exchange as the bellwether beat the Streets expectations and its own guidance.        
	The stock was buoyed by an increase in the dividend payout ratio to 30 per cent of net profit from 2008-09.        
	The Nasdaq-listed company forecast that revenue for the year to March 2009 would grow 19 to 21 per cent to anywhere between $4.97 billion and $5.05 billion, dipping from the 35 per cent growth it notched up last year. In rupee terms, its consolidated revenues would rise to Rs 20,214 crore, the company said.        
	We see significant growth opportunities in the medium to long term, Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan said.        
	In the first quarter of 2008-09 the company said its income would be in the range of Rs 4,570 crore to Rs 4,582 crore, a year-on-year growth rate of 21.1-21.4 per cent.        
	However, the forecast meant that growth in the first quarter of this fiscal over the previous quarter would be less than 1 per cent. It is this forecast that left the analysts very disappointed.        
	They have given a bad outlook for the first quarter. Their EPS guideline is also low. I fail to understand why first-quarter profits will go down? They say they will be able to maintain good growth from the second quarter onwards, said Sumeet Budhiraja, senior vice-president at First Global Securities Pvt Ltd.        
	The company recommended a final dividend of Rs 7.25 per share and a special dividend of Rs 20 per share for 2008-09.        
	Harit Shah, IT and telecom analyst at Angel Broking, said Infosys was assuming a lot of back-end growth this fiscal.         
	Shah said after a flat first quarter, the company would have to post a 6 per cent growth rate in its topline over the next three quarters, which could be challenging.         
	The economic conditions in the US could pose a risk to its full year guidance, he added.        
	We continue to see greater growth opportunities in Europe, chief operating officer S.D. Shibulal said in the statement. The region contributed to 29.3 per cent of sales in the fourth quarter compared with 26.6 per cent a year earlier. North America generated 60.7 per cent, the statement added.        
	Banks and finance companies, which accounted for 27 per cent of Infosys sales in the fourth quarter, are taking longer to award contracts, Gopalakrishnan said.        
	Analysts expressed concern over how the companys biggest revenue-earning segment  banks, financial services and insurance  would perform. One of the key factors behind revenue growth in 2007-08  the rise in contract prices  is expected to fade away gradually.         
	Infosyss guidance is based on a dollar-rupee exchange rate pegged at 40. This is a major risk factor since the rupee could soon resume its upward journey, said Rajiv Mehta, analyst with India Infoline.

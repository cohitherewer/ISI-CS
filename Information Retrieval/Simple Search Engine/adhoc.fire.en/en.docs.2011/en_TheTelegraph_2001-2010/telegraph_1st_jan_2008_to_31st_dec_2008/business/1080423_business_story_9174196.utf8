                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Crisil trims GDP growth forecast 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 22: Rating agency Crisil has trimmed its forecast of GDP growth to 8.1 per cent for 2008-09 from its earlier estimate of 8.5 per cent.        
	Crisils revision comes in the wake of worsening inflation, interest rates and global growth outlook.        
	Despite moderation, it said the overall growth scenario was expected to remain strong with investment being the main driver of growth.        
	Domestic private consumption is also expected to support the economy against slowing external demand.        
	Crisil estimated that growth in industry and services would also slow down to 8 per cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively.         
	Assuming normal rains this year, it expects agriculture to grow 3 per cent.        
	It feared that the moderation in Indias growth could impact tax collections.         
	The fiscal situation is also under pressure. Growth in tax collections is expected to decline as GDP growth moderates, with a further loss of revenues because of the recent duty cuts. The subsidy bill on fuel and fertilisers is set to rise because of the global food and crude price scenario, it said.        
	Crisils forecast on fiscal deficit for 2008-09 has been revised upwards to 3.9 per cent of GDP, inclusive of off-budget items.        
	According to Dharmakirti Joshi, principal economist, Crisil, Our previous GDP forecast of 8.5 per cent had assumed a cut in the policy interest rate by the central bank in response to the slowing economy. This is now ruled out since current inflation is beyond the RBIs comfort zone of 4.5 to 4 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Meltdown heat on DLF projects
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Meltdown heat on DLF projects
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: DLF has shelved some of its projects because of a liquidity crunch and a slump in the demand for homes.        
	The Delhi-based developer said it had laid off some employees. However, it did not specify the number of people who had lost jobs.        
	DLF chairman K.P. Singh told reporters on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit, that demand has gone down substantially and now a lot of projects are being shut down.        
	The demand is low because people have to take loans that have an interest rate of 12 per cent, Singh said.         
	According to Singh, the optimum interest for home loans should be 7 per cent, which could help rekindle demand.        
	Current interest rates have to be brought down at least by 3 per cent. Inflation is not a factor now. You have to flood the market with more money, he said.        
	For the past few weeks, Singh had been lobbying to get the Reserve Bank and the government to not only cut interest rates but also allocate larger bank funds to the realty sector.         
	Bankers have turned wary of the sector following the realty slump in the US and Europe.        
	Realty stocks continued their losing streak on the Bombay Stock Exchange for the fifth session today. The DLF stock was the key laggard and the realty index fell 68 points on sustained selling by foreign funds and retail investors.        
	Marketmen said the realty index came under pressure after DLF said it had deferred some residential, commercial and hotel projects because of lower demand.

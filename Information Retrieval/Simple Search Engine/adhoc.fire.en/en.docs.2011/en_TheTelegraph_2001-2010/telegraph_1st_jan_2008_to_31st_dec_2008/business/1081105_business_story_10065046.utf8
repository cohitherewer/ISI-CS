                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Banks take rate-cut pledge

	New Delhi, Nov. 4: Home and auto loans will become cheaper with state-run banks agreeing today to trim interest rates by half to three-quarters of a percentage point within the next few days.        
	Top bankers told finance minister P. Chidambaram that they would hold internal meetings over the next few days and announce the rate cuts.        
	Private banks, whose head honchos are due to meet finance secretary Arun Ramanathan tomorrow, are expected to follow suit.        
	The rate cuts have been triggered by the Reserve Bank of Indias decision last Saturday to trim the repo  the benchmark short-term lending rate  by 50 basis points to 7.5 per cent and lower the reserve ratios for banks.        
	Our asset and liability committee will be meeting tomorrow and a decision will be taken to cut the prime lending rate (PLR) by at least 50 basis points, SBI chairman . P. Bhatt told reporters after the finance ministers quarterly review meeting with the chiefs of public sector banks.        
	A cut in PLR  the benchmark lending rate charged to top-rated corporate customers  benefits all borrowers as interest rates on most loans, including home, are linked to this rate.         
	Banks currently charge PLR between 12.75 per cent and 13.25 per cent. A 75-basis-point reduction will bring PLR down to a range between 12 per cent and 12.5 per cent.        
	Most PSU banks, including the SBI, charge between 12 per cent and 13 per cent on home and personal loans. A 75-basis-point reduction will allow customers to borrow at the rate of 11.25 per cent to12.25 per cent.        
	Realty majors and auto makers have been complaining that high interest rates have depressed demand for cars and houses, and many hope that a cut in interest rates may perk up demand. The interest rate cut should help industry across the board. However, I feel it will particularly ease the problems for the realty market and for durables, including automobiles, said D. Joshi, chief economist at market rating agency Crisil.         
	Taking a cue from the countrys largest lender, other state-run banks, including Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank, Indian Bank and Uco Bank, have also decided to cut lending rates by up to 75 per cent.        
	We will consider cutting lending and deposit rates by 50 to 75 basis points this week, said M. S. Sundara Rajan, chairman and managing director of Indian Bank.        
	However, many analysts remain unconvinced that the rate cuts will buoy demand and growth.         
	Industrial growth had slipped to a low of 1.3 per cent in August, which has set alarm bells ringing in New Delhi. The crisis is too deep and has global roots; mere rate cuts may not help, warned S. P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission.         
	A study by the Institute of Economic Growth, a government-funded think tank, also predicts the current slow growth phase will continue for the next few months.        
	The SBI, which is targeting 28 per cent growth in loans and 25 per cent increase in deposits this year, also plans to reduce its deposit rates in the next few weeks.        
	Bank of India (BoI) chairman T. S. Narayanasami said, Lending rates will come down. BoI will review its rates this week.         
	Punjab National Bank, which had reduced its PLR by 50 basis points to 13.5 per cent, said it could slash rates further.        
	IDBI reduced interest rates on education and home loans on Saturday after the RBI announced the rate cuts.

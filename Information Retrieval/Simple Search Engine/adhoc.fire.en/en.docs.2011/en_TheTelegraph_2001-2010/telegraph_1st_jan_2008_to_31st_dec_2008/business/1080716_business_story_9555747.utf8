Sibal (extreme right), Stedman Illias (extreme left), deputy director-general   of department of industry and resources of western Australia, and Eric Ripper in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                       
	New Delhi, July 15: India will offer for bidding new coal blocks to detect coal bed methane (CBM), a natural gas.         
	I think we may offer less than 10 coal bed methane blocks in the fourth round of bidding by the end of the calendar year, said V. K. Sibal, the director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH).        
	India has held three rounds of international bidding for coal bed methane that attracted companies such as BP, the worlds third largest energy firm, and Santos of Australia.        
	Gas lying below coal seams is being looked as a means for bridging the huge energy deficit that India faces. The total availability of 91 million standard cubic meters per day of gas in the country barely meets half the countrys demand.        
	Sibal said he was excited at the response to the just concluded seventh round of bidding for oil and gas areas under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp).        
	We received four bids per block which is very good compared with 1.5 bids per block Libya gets or three bids per block in Nelp-VI (the earlier round of oil hunt), he said.        
	Oil database        
	The directorate general of hydrocarbons is preparing a database that will have geological information on all basins and fields in the country, Sibal said.        
	Once this national data repository is in place, the country will move towards an open acreage system. Companies will themselves identify blocks or areas they want to drill instead of the present system of the directorate asking them to bid for preassigned blocks.Open acreage and Nelp-VIII, which is the next round of oil hunt, may come simultaneously in the second half of 2009-10.         
	Work on the website of the national data repository is already on. The repository will collect data from all players in the industry. It has been done primarily to ensure transparency and integrity, said Sibal.While the east coast has given about 100 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, the west coast remains unexplored.        
	My objective is to evaluate hydrocarbon potential of the country, he said, adding the number of wells drilled even off the east coast were far less than what happened in the Gulf of Mexico.        
	Australia pact        
	India today signed a memorandum of understanding with Western Australia for co-operation in oil and gas exploration and production, coal bed methane and liquefied natural gas (LNG).        
	The agreement was signed by Sibal, and Stedman Illias, who is the deputy director- general, department of industry and resources, Western Australia. It was signed in the presence of Indias petroleum minister Murli Deora and Eric Ripper, deputy prime minister of Western Australia.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) will come out with a rights issue in the first quarter of the next financial year. 
    
	The company plans to raise $600 million to fund its expansion plans over the next three years. 
    
	According to managing director Raymond Bickson, the company is waiting for Sebi to clear the issue. 
    
	The ratio of allotment and the price of the issue remains the same as the company had decided in September last year.
    
	Over the next 36 months, IHCL plans to add 54 hotel properties with an inventory of around 10,000 rooms. The issue in the first quarter of the next financial year will help us in our expansion, said Bickson. 
    
	Last year, IHCL had raised $150 million in foreign currency convertible bonds, which the company spent on acquiring two hotels in the US. These include the Taj Boston, in January 2007 and The Campton Place, San Francisco in April 2007. 
    
	Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces has 60 hotels in 42 locations across India, 18 international hotels in the Maldives, Mauritius, Malaysia, Australia, the UK, the US, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Africa and West Asia.

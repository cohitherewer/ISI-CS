          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Srinivasan: New direction                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: The petroleum ministry is lobbying the finance ministry for statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) status to bonds issued to oil companies.        
	We have taken up the issue with the finance ministry and I hope it finds a favourable consideration, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said today.        
	If the SLR status is given, banks will be able to buy the oil bonds to meet the requirement of holding 25 per cent of their deposits in RBI-approved instruments.        
	So far, the bonds didnt get that status  That may change, Srinivasan said.        
	S.V. Narasimhan, finance director of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), said the SLR status would help the oil companies borrow from the market more easily.        
	The government is expected to issue oil bonds worth around Rs 40,000 crore to IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited this fiscal to compensate them for under-recoveries on the sale of fuel at prices below costs. Of this, bonds worth about Rs 11,000 crore have already been issued by the finance ministry.        
	The under-realisation this fiscal is estimated to be at Rs 71,808 crore, and the government will compensate 56-57 per cent of that through the bonds.

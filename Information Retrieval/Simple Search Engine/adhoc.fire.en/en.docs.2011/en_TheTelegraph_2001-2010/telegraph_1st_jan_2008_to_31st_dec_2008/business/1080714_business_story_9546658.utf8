                                I learnt from your newspaper that banks should charge Rs 20 for ATM cash withdrawals from April 1, 2008, according to notifications from the Reserve Bank of India. Axis Bank is charging five times the amount. The bank has also increased the minimum balance to be maintained in a savings account, even by senior citizen account holders, to Rs 10,000 from April 1, this year. What should I do?          C.N. Mukherjee, Salt Lake
                    The Reserve Bank has stated in its notification dated March 10 this year that the fee charged by all scheduled commercial banks should be as follows:          (a) For use of own ATMs for any purpose  free with immediate effect.          (b) For use of other bank ATMs for balance enquiries  free with immediate effect.          (c) For use of other bank ATMs for cash withdrawals  (1) no bank shall increase the charges prevailing as on December 23, 2007; (2) banks which are charging more than Rs 20 per transaction shall reduce the charges to a maximum of Rs 20 per transaction by March 31, 2008; (3) free with effect from April 1, 2009.          Axis Bank is clearly violating the RBI notification. You can write a complaint letter to the bank. Keep a copy of the letter. If the bank doesnt attend your problem, wait for a month and then approach the banking ombudsman at the regional RBI office with the copy of your original complaint letter.                                  Study time      I pay monthly interests on an education loan I had taken for my son from a nationalised bank. Can I claim deduction under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act on the total interest amount to be paid by me during 2008-09 in addition to deductions claimed under Section 80C?        Rasbehari Das, Calcutta
                    The ceiling on deduction available under Section 80E has been removed with effect from assessment year 2008-09 and one can now claim deduction for interest payment on loans taken for higher education of ones spouse and children. This deduction is available for eight assessment years beginning from the year in which the interest is paid. Higher education under Section 80E includes full time graduate/post graduate courses in engineering, medicine, management, mathematics and statistics.

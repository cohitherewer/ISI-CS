          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Pillai: Giving assurance		    
	New Delhi, June 17: The government may consider lifting the ban on the export of non-basmati rice by the end of the kharif season.        
	We could consider removing the rice export ban in October-November, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.         
	If we have a production of 94 million tonnes, we may have a surplus of 3-4 million tonnes, which will then be available for exports, he added.        
	Indias ban on rice exports was criticised by the US, which alleged that New Delhis move had fuelled the global food crisis.        
	US undersecretary of commerce for international trade Christopher A. Padilla had said Indias export restrictions would only exacerbate food shortages and inflate prices.         
	The export of non-basmati rice is very marginal and New Delhis decision to ban it for domestic reasons has not resulted in the global food price spike, minister of state for commerce Jairam Ramesh had earlier said.        
	India, the worlds biggest rice exporter after Thailand, had banned the export of non-basmati rice in March and imposed an export duty of $200 per tonne on the aromatic variety to boost domestic supply and contain inflation.        
	The ban had led to a shortage of the foodgrain in many African countries and Bangladesh.         
	Pillai said, We are comfortable with wheat and rice harvests this year.         
	The countrys rice production is projected at 95.7 million tonnes for the year ending June, which is 2.3 million tonnes more than last year.

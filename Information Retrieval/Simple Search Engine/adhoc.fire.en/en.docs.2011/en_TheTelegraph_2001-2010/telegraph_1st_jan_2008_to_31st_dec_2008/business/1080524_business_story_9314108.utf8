	Bokaro, May 23: Bokaro Steel managing director Virendra Kumar Srivastav has asked employees to step up production to keep profit levels intact.         
	The company posted a profit of Rs 2,830 crore in 2007-08 and announced a hike in salaries in spite of being scalded by spiralling raw material costs.         
	It, however, is wary of the increasingly vicious competition on a global scale.        
	The managing director said unless Bokaro Steel went for a massive reduction in expenses and a hike in production, it might start making losses as it was not allowed by the government to raise steel prices.         
	Private players recently told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that they would reconsider increasing steel prices after three months as rising costs of raw material and petroleum products had put them in a tight corner.

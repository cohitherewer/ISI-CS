          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 23: Mobile operators are offering innovative value-added services with their PCO models to revive the flagging business.         
	Tata Teleservices has decided to provide services such as booking airline tickets, making bill payments and recharging DTH connections along with its PCO model.        
	We have a market share of 40 per cent in Calcutta for PCOs. Mobile tariffs as low as Re 1 has brought about a stiff competition in the market. We have, therefore, decided to provide value-added services with our PCO models which would be convenient to the customers, said Sanjiv Sinha, regional head (east) and chief operating officer of Calcutta circle, Tata Teleservices Ltd.        
	The company has about 48,000 PCOs in Calcutta. The initial investment to set up the PCOs will be Rs 7,000.         
	Bharti Airtel has introduced PCOs in autorickshaws.        
	The autos with mobile PCOs provide connectivity in the rural areas.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: The Indian markets will be among the first to recover from the global meltdown, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave today said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.        
	We will be among the first few to recover  Every crisis is an opportunity. We have learnt a lot in October. I think we should use this opportunity to improve our system, Bhave said.        
	Bhave also put a rest to rumours of a bear cartel short selling shares on the domestic bourses.         
	We have not found anything in the market that will give us suspicion that something has seriously gone wrong with the market itself, Bhave said.        
	On the withdrawal of foreign institutional investors from the bourses, Bhave said not all foreign investors were exiting. Only leveraged investors were leaving, though long-term players such as pension funds continued to invest in the stock market.

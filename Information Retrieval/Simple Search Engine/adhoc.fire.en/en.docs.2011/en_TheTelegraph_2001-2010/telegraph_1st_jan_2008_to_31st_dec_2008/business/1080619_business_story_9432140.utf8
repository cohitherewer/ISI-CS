          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          (From left) A. P. Kurien, chairman of Association of Mutual Funds, U. K. Sinha, chairman of UTI Asset Management Company and C. B. Bhave, chairman of Sebi in Mumbai on Wednesday (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, June 18: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) plans to set up an advisory committee to take a relook at regulations governing mutual funds.        
	We are planning to set up the committee within a month, Sebi chief C.B. Bhave said at a CII-organised mutual fund summit here today.        
	This committee will be on the same lines as those already existing for primary markets, he said.        
	We have advisory committees on secondary as well as primary markets but no advisory committee on mutual funds. We will get advice from participants and investors about the issues bothering them and also about the policy framework required, Bhave said.        
	The committee will look into both short-term as well as long-term issues that need to be addressed.        
	Bhave said the idea behind this committee was that Sebi should never assume that it had the entire knowledge within itself.        
	We should have the ability to consult industry representatives, intermediaries and investors on such matters, Bhave said.        
	Bhave also indicated that Sebi might come out with amended regulations for mutual funds. We, as a regulator, are also looking at mutual fund regulations. The appointment of the advisory committee is a step in that direction, Bhave said.        
	Commenting on the review of trusteeship structure in mutual funds, Bhave said, We need to have a dialogue with the trustees of mutual funds and ask them whether they are comfortable with the responsibility that are passed onto them.        
	Bhave also advocated the concept of depositories for mutual funds.        
	The Sebi chief said in line with the depository services provided for the securities market, a similar platform should exist for mutual funds.        
	This will help mutual fund investors have investment details of various schemes with various mutual funds in a single statement, he added.         
	Speaking on the occasion, U. K. Sinha, chairman of UTI Asset Management Company, said between 2003 and 2008, the compounded annual growth rate of mutual funds stood at 47 per cent next only to Russia (97 per cent) and China (67 per cent).

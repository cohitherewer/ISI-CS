          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          MATTER OF BALANCE                                  
	New Delhi, April 16: Two parliamentary panels today put forward divergent views on who should be the beneficiaries of the Rs 60,000-crore farm loan waiver.        
	While one called for a blanket extension of the scheme to all farmers, another argued that the two-hectare ceiling to qualify for the waiver should be revised based on land quality.        
	There should not be any categorisation or segregation of farmers and the scheme should be available to all farmers uniformly, said Ananth Kumar, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on finance.        
	Kumar said, The loan waiver scheme appears to address the symptoms and not the root cause of the malady as rural indebtedness is deep rooted and requires concerted efforts and a multi-pronged approach.        
	Ram Gopal Yadav, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, did not argue for a blanket extension of the scheme. The limit of two hectares of land should be revised keeping in mind the difference in productivity of irrigated and non-irrigated land, he said.        
	He added that incentives such as interest subvention should be announced for farmers who had repaid their loans so that the scheme did not send out wrong signals to debtors, prompting them to default in payment and disincentivise prompt repayment.        
	Those who had promptly repaid their loans during the period covered by the debt waiver scheme should be allowed full interest subvention in agriculture loans for the next three years, he said.        
	The reports tabled in Parliament said the loan waiver scheme should approach the issue in a comprehensive manner and address the root cause of agrarian distress.        
	The waiver scheme announced in the budget will also cover farm loans disbursed by private scheduled commercial banks.         
	Small and marginal farmers with land holdings of up to two hectares can avail themselves of the loan waiver.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gathering pace                                  
	Mumbai, July 22: Mukesh Ambani group firm Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) today said it had completed 94 per cent of work at its Jamnagar refinery at an investment of Rs 25,515 crore.         
	RPL chairman Mukesh D. Ambani said, The team is fully geared and motivated to commission the refinery ahead of its initial schedule of December 2008. RPL is thus poised to create a new world record for project implementation in the global refining sector.         
	In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, RPL said project engineering, procurement and contracting activities were complete and construction work was progressing rapidly to meet pre-commissioning requirements.        
	The planning for the project start-up is also complete and pre-commissioning activities are proceeding at a fast pace.        
	RPL has mobilised sufficient resources to sustain pre-commissioning and commissioning activities on a fast track, the statement said.         
	Deliveries of equipment are nearing completion, while many major equipment has been installed.        
	RPL had raised Rs 8,100 crore through its initial public offering.         
	Last month, at the third annual general meeting of RPL in Jamnagar, Mukesh Ambani had given a robust outlook for the refining sector.        
	He had said that the demand for petroleum products continued to grow despite the surge in world crude oil prices.        
	 The demand for energy continues unabated because it is the most critical determinant of economic success in todays world. Therefore, the prospects for the refining sector remain encouraging. And the long term outlook for refining margins continues to be positive, especially for complex refiners like RPL. This is because of robust demand, tight product supplies and slow growth of new capacities dogging an already stretched refining system, he had said.

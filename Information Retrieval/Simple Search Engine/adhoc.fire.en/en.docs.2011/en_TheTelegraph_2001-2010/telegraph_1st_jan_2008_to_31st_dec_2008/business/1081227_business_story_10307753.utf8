          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 26: HDFC Bank has raised Rs 1,728 crore through an issue of subordinated debt.         
	In a letter to the bourses, the bank said it had issued on a private placement basis unsecured non-convertible redeemable subordinated bonds in the nature of debentures.         
	Of these, Rs 578 crore were raised via upper tier II bonds and Rs 1,150 crore from lower tier II bonds.         
	In the recent past, many banks have been raising funds through such issues because of a rise in the demand for credit.         
	Syndicate Bank today said it would raise Rs 300 crore through bonds to meet its capital requirements.

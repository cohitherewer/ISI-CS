The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks keen to fund Tatas
                                                                                                               Banks keen to fund Tatas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Loan some                                  
	Mumbai, March 27: A large number of banks have come forward to fund Tata Motors acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover.        
	The list includes Mizuho Financial group and another Japanese financial entity, which are expected to provide up to $800 million to fund the deal, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas and the State Bank of India.        
	C. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer of Tata Motors, had told newspersons at a conference call on Wednesday that the company was taking a bridge loan of $3 billion to fund the deal.         
	Though Ramakrishnan did not disclose the interest rate of this loan, it is speculated to be in the region of 6 per cent.         
	Sources added that Tata Motors was getting the finance at a competitive rate despite borrowing costs rising by over 200 basis points in recent times.        
	Credit rating        
	Credit rating agencies are yet to take a call on Tata Motors. Standard amp; Poors had earlier put it on credit watch with negative implications.         
	Its credit analyst Anshukant Taneja today said S amp;P would take a rating action once it got a clear picture of how the deal was to be funded and how the Tatas proposed to integrate the operations of JLR.        
	Tata Motors today closed at Rs 655.20, down 3.56 per cent, after opening at Rs 677 and hitting an intra-day low of Rs 630.         
	Tata Chemicals        
	Tata Chemicals today completed the acquisition of US-based General Chemicals Industrial Products for little over $1 billion, making it the worlds second largest producer of soda ash. The Tata firm had signed a definitive agreement to buy out the American company two months ago.        
	Tata Chemicals MD Homi Khusrokhan said the company had managed to arrange funding for the acquisition in a record time without taking recourse to equity.

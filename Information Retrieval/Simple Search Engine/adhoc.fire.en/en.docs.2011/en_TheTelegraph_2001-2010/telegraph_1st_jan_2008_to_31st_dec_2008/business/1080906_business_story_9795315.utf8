	Mumbai, Sept. 5: Stock exchanges, banks, clearing corporations, depositories and insurance companies may soon be permitted to hold up to 15 per cent in domestic stock exchanges.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today proposed to raise the individual cap on holdings in a stock exchange from five per cent to 15 per cent for certain investors.         
	In a discussion paper released today, the market regulator said the proposal was framed after some investors in the National Stock Exchange and Over-The-Counter Exchange of India said they were facing difficulties in trimming their holdings to less than five per cent.         
	Others told the market regulator that the five per cent cap was deterring long-term investors in the bourses.         
	Sebi said the stock exchanges were public institutions and therefore, as a matter of policy, no individual investor should be allowed to hold a predominant position in them.         
	At the same time, considering the market demands, it would be desirable to provide a high enough shareholding limit to encourage long-term strategic investors who can contribute to the development of the stock exchanges, it said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Red hot coal price hurts SAIL
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Red hot coal price hurts SAIL
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          POCKET PINCH                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) may have to pay three times more for imported coal.        
	The company is now finalising long-term contracts at a time when prices in the international markets for high grade coking coal have firmed up to about $300 a tonne against $95 a tonne a year-and-a-half ago.         
	As SAIL is a big buyer and signs long-term contracts, it can get coal at rates that are slightly lower than benchmark prices. At the benchmark international price of $300 a tonne, SAILs import price can rise by up to Rs 8,000 a tonne.         
	The PSU is currently negotiating with three global mining majors, including BHP Billiton and Glencore, to purchase 12 million tonnes (mt) of coal over the long term.        
	SAIL requires about 17 mt of coal every year, of which it will source 5 mt on its own and from other coal miners in the country.        
	It has long been trying to buy equity in global coking coal mines to secure supply at reasonable rates. This is a strategy which Japanese steel mills had adopted two to three decades earlier. Leading Indian players such as Tata Steel and the Essar group are following this approach.         
	SAIL had tried to acquire minority stakes in existing and new mine developments in Australia and New Zealand but had till now drawn a blank. Most Australian coal mines have Japanese trading houses as partners and these firms are not willing to take rival Indian steel companies on board.         
	SAIL did take part in the disinvestment of a 25 per cent stake in Austral Ltds Tahmoor coal mine, but the reserve did not have much commercial value.         
	The steel maker also tried to buy the Moatize mine in Mozambique which was finally awarded to Brazils Vale. It also explored possibilities in Russia and Poland. However, issues such as distance from ports (in the Russian case it was 2,500 km) prevented a deal.         
	To break the impasse over coal mines, SAIL has formed a special purpose vehicle with Coal India, Vizag Steel, NTPC and NMDC, which will try buy coal mines abroad. This entity is currently scouting for coal mines in Mozambique and Australia.        
	Earlier this year, SAIL joined hands with rival Tata Steel to explore and develop coal mines. This joint venture may mine four coking coal blocks in Jharkhand that have an estimated reserve of 500 million tonnes.

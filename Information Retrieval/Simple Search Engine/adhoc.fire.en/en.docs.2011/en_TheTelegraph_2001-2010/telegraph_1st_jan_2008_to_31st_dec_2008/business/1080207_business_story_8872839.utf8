The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ispat parent buys coal assets abroad
                                                                                                            Ispat parent buys coal assets abroad
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: Global Steel Holdings Ltd, the parent company of Ispat Industries, has acquired two coking coal blocks in Mozambique.         
	Tata Steel and ArcelorMittal have also recently bought coal acreages in the east African country.        
	The two blocks span an area of 30,000 hectares in the Tete region, close to the acreages of the Tatas and ArcelorMittal. Brazils Vale is also working in the area.        
	There are proven reserves of 70 million tonnes of coking coal with low to medium ash content in the blocks. The actual reserves may be higher considering the potential of the two blocks.        
	Mining is expected to start in the next three to four years. The Ispat plant at Dolvi near Mumbai could be a direct beneficiary of the Mozambique coal. The Indian operations of Global Steel  owned by Pramod and Vinod Kumar Mittal  neither have captive coal nor iron ore mines. It is saddled with high input cost, putting it at a disadvantage vis--vis integrated steel makers such as Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Limited who have coal and iron ore reserves.         
	Global Steel has already worked out plans for mining and an on-site coal preparation plant.

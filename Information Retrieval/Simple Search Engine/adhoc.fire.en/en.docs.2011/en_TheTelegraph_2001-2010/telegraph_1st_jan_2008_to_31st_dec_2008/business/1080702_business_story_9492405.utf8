          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cost concern                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: The government is likely to take steps to cool down iron ore and steel prices.        
	Inflation data prepared by the finance ministry showed that about 60 per cent of inflation in primary articles was in five items  iron ore, cotton, milk, fish and oranges. In manufacturing, 60 per cent of the inflation was in eight products, of which six were in the iron and steel category.        
	Top officials said the government was likely to consider cutting the excise duty on steel products as well as fresh steps to curb iron ore exports.        
	Steel prices have been rising in the wholesale markets and the government will use both moral persuasion as well as tax measures to bring relief, said the officials.         
	Inflation rate rose to 11.42 per cent for the week ended June 14 after the government raised petrol and diesel prices. Inflation figures to be released at the end of this week are expected to show a similar trend, the officials said.        
	Consequently, the government will be banking on a series of administrative, fiscal and monetary measures.         
	The officials said they expected the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take fresh measures which could include raising the cash reserve ratio, which is the amount of money banks have to compulsorily keep with the central bank, as well as raise the overnight lending rate. The RBI is scheduled to make its quarterly monetary policy announcement on July 29.        
	Though the price rise has been mainly on account of the availability of items, demand management is important as money supply had been increasing at the rate of 22 per cent, the officials said.         
	The officials said inflation might not ease in the next few months. Inflationary pressures will continue in the next few months because of the base effect, the officials added.

	Calcutta, May 29: Linde AG, the world leader in industrial gas and the parent of BOC India, will invest Rs 6,700 crore in the medium term.         
	The Linde board wants to pump in this money over the next seven to 10 years, but I am pretty sure that we will be able to invest this amount much earlier, Sanjiv Lamba, managing director of Linde (south and east Asia), said. Speaking after the 72nd annual general meeting of BOC India in Calcutta today, Lamba said India had emerged as an important destination for the company.         
	The India strategy has been discussed twice during a Linde board meet recently. The board would also meet in India later this year. Industrial gas for use by steel mills will be a focus area of BOC. The company expects the contribution of steel to its earning to go up from 50 per cent now. BOC also expects good demand for gas from pharmaceutical units, refineries and chip makers.        
	Finance director of the company S. K. Menon said BOC might set up a unit in the next 2-3 years to make gas for new users such as the electronic industry. The gas is imported now. It is a downstream of the petrochemical industry. So it has to be close to a refinery. It also has to be close to a port for export, Menon said.

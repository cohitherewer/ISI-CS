	New Delhi, July 9: French firm Total today will increase the capacity of its joint venture liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Hazira, Gujarat, by one million tonnes to 3.6 million tonnes a year.        
	Totals country head Christian Chammas said the capacity was being increased to meet the growing energy needs of India.         
	Total and Britains Shell are the partners in the venture, and the project is expected to be completed in September.         
	Total officials declined to divulge the cost of the project. They said regasification capacity would be enhanced and one or two pumps would be installed.        
	Vizag refinery        
	Totals senior vice-president, Asia-Pacific, Thierry Pflimlin, said the proposed joint venture refinery cum petrochemical plant in Visakhapatnam would have capacity of 14 million tonnes.        
	Total, Mittal Investments, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, GAIL (India) Limited and Oil India had signed an agreement last October to study the possibility of building a refinery in Andhra Pradesh with a capacity of 15 million tonnes a year.        
	Pflmlin said the joint venture partners would decide by the year-end on whether to proceed with the project and make the investment of about $6 billion.        
	The project is at a pre-feasibility stage, and before the end of the year we will know if we will move ahead with it, he said.        
	A pre-feasibility report is being prepared, which is looking at demand in India and Asia and project costs. It will be ready by the end of the third quarter of 2008, after which a steering committee of the five partners will meet to decide if the project will be taken up.        
	The refinery will be an export refinery, but in the long-term some products will be for the Indian market.        
	Pflimlin said the pre-feasibility report would factor in the absence of tax breaks. The government has said that the seven year income tax holiday would not be available to refineries commissioned after March 31, 2012.        
	Bitumen project        
	Total will invest Rs 100 crore with Indian firm Vinergy International in setting up four bitumen manufacturing plants in the country in the next 3-4 years.        
	The 50:50 joint venture has commissioned a plant in Jodhpur for the manufacture of bitumen, used in the construction of roads and highways, at an investment of about Rs 25 crore. It is now selecting sites for units in the east, south and west.        
	Vinergy managing director Mukul Agarwal said the four plants would have a manufacturing capacity of 300,000 tonnes a year.

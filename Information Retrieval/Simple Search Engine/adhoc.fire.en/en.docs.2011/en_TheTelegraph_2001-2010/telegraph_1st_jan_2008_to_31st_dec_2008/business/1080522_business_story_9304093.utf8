	New Delhi, May 21: Higher input costs are forcing car makers to slap a higher price tag on their models.        
	The latest to get into the act is Koreas Hyundai, which jacked up prices by two per cent effective the first week of June, just days after market leader Maruti Suzuki raised prices in the range of Rs 1,000-18,000.         
	There has been an increase in the input cost and we have been absorbing it for a while. The situation now is such that we have to pass some part of it to the consumers, said Arvind Saxena, senior vice-president, marketing and sales, Hyundai Motors India.        
	Saxena said the company would hike the prices of its various models by up to two per cent.         
	Before Hyundai and Maruti, Honda and Mahindra amp; Mahindra had raised prices, the former on the Civic, while General Motors will review prices by the month-end.         
	High costs of inputs, particularly steel, have been a big factor behind the upward revision of prices. Key suppliers have also been demanding higher prices.         
	Marutis price rise covers most of its models. While the ex-showroom prices of the Maruti 800 and the Alto have gone up by Rs 1,500, the Zen Estilo has become dearer by Rs 1,000. The Omni van and the WagonR petrol will cost Rs 2,000 more, while the WagonR Duo (petrol and LPG) will be costlier by Rs 1,000.        
	General Motors, selling the Spark at a discount, said it would review prices after this month.         
	We will hold on to the present prices and schemes (discounts) till this month-end. Revisions could be announced next month, said P. Balendran, GM India vice-president.        
	Honda had earlier this month increased the price of its luxury sedan Civic by Rs 10,000, though the company has held on to the price of its popular sedan City because of competitive pressures.

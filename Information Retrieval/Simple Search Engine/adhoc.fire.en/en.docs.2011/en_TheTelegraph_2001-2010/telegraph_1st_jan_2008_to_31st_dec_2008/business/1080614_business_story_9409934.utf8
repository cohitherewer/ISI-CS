          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, June 13: Telekom Malaysia will shell out more than $2 billion to pick up around 15 per cent in Aditya Birla Groups Idea Cellular through a preferential offer.        
	The deal gives Idea a value of over $10 billion. The preferential offer will be made at a substantial premium over Ideas current market price. Telekom Malaysia, it is learnt, will pay Rs 158 a share for the stake buy.        
	The Idea stock closed at Rs 108.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today.        
	Under the agreement, Idea will buy out B.K. Modis 40.8 per cent stake in Spice Communications and merge with it, while Telekom Malaysia will have a 20 per cent equity in the merged entity.         
	Spice will partner Idea and Telekom Malaysia for value-added services and mobile devices for three years.        
	Idea Cellular managing director Sanjeev Aga refused to comment, saying there is no development as of today. If and when something happens, we will make an announcement.        
	In a filing with the BSE, the company said it was pursing growth opportunities and if any definitive proposal got approved by the Idea board, the company would inform the exchange.        
	If Idea had not made the preferential offer, Telekom Malaysias stake in the merged entity would have remained at around 5.14 per cent, compared with 39.5 per cent in Spice after the merger.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citigroup to cut Japan exposure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citigroup to cut Japan exposure
                            
	Tokyo, June 6 (Reuters): Citigroup shut down its remaining Japanese consumer lending outlets and automated loan machines, as the subprime-hit bank continues its retreat from Japans troubled money-lending industry.        
	Citigroup, which operates as a consumer lender under the brand name Dic, today said it would close its remaining 32 outlets and 540 unmanned loan machines and suspend marketing the brand.        
	Japans once-mighty consumer finance industry has been crippled by tighter regulations lowering maximum interest rates, and legal rulings that have forced firms to repay previous charges now deemed illegally high.        
	Another US firm, General Electric Co, has been looking to sell its Japanese consumer finance unit for about a year.        
	Media reports have said mid-sized lender Shinsei Bank is likely to buy the GE unit, which is known under the brand name Lake.        
	But Citigroup, which has suffered more than $45 billion in write-downs and credit losses since last summer, does not intend to completely exit the consumer finance business in the worlds second-largest economy. The US bank said in a statement it would reduce new consumer lending. A spokesperson for Citigroup in Tokyo, Atsuko Yoshitsugu, said the business would continue to have an online presence.        
	Many consumer lenders have fallen deep into the red, forcing some to tie up with Japanese banks for funding.

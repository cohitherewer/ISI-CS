                                                                                                               RPower tops offer price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 25: For the first time since it was listed on February 11, shares of Reliance Power (RPower) Ltd today closed above its issue price of Rs 450 apiece on the stock exchanges as investors reacted positively to the bonus ratio of 3:5.        
	On the BSE, the RPower stock closed at Rs 450.40, a gain of Rs 33.55, or 8.05 per cent, over Fridays close of Rs 416.85. On the NSE, it ended at Rs 450.70, an increase of a little over 8 per cent.        
	It may be recalled that the RPower stock had only briefly crossed the issue price on February 11, the day of its listing when it hit an intra-day high of Rs 599.90.         
	Since then, the share was a victim of poor market conditions, resulting in huge losses to investors. Retail investors were allotted RPower shares at a price of Rs 430 per share while institutional investors got them at Rs 450 per share.        
	In a bid to compensate the investors for their losses, the RPower board on Sunday proposed a bonus issue in the ratio of three shares for every five shares held. Market observers say the bonus ratio was a little ahead of street expectations of one share to every three held.        
	However, it is felt that some investors may use this opportunity to book profits in the stock.        
	RPower had said the bonus offering would bring down the cost of shares to Rs 269 per share for retail investors and to Rs 281 per share for other investors. For the retail investor, the cost is, therefore, 40 per cent lower than the IPO price of Rs 430 per share and for other investors it is lower by 37 per cent        
	Following the bonus issue and the promoters decision to contribute his personal shares in RPower to Reliance Energy Ltd, Anil Ambanis stake in RPower will come down to 40 per cent from 45 per cent while that of Reliance Energy will be maintained at 45 per cent. Public shareholding in RPower will go up to 15 per cent from 10 per cent.

                          Subbarao: Make presence felt                    
	Washington, Oct. 12 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today welcomed the coordinated approach taken by developed nations to tackle the global financial crisis and said emerging and developing economies such as India must be consulted while taking decisions impacting them.        
	At a meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee in Washington, RBI governor D. Subbarao said though co-ordination among developed countries was welcomed, the emerging and developing economies should be explicitly factored in.          
	Emerging economies may not have any direct or significant exposure to stressed financial instruments, but they are experiencing the indirect impact of the financial crisis, including a decline in capital inflows. Subbarao said the impact was by no means insignificant and might intensify in the months ahead.  
	PC worry        
	Warning that developing countries will suffer for no fault of theirs from the recession visible in the US and the West, finance minister P. Chidambaram has asked the World Bank to play a bigger role to ensure financial resources for emerging economies.        
	The crisis will necessarily impact upon the global availability of the financial resources for development... a global recession will sharply contract the demand for exports of many developing countries, adversely affecting the growth prospects. The developing countries would suffer for no faults of theirs, Chidambaram said in a statement.        
	The statement of Chidambaram, who is not attending the annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in order to monitor the Indian economy in the wake of global meltdown, was read out at the meeting by the India delegation.        
	They (developing economies) did not cause the contagion. Many are not equipped to face the consequences. We need a global effort, particularly in countries with developed capital markets, to review financial oversight and regulatory mechanisms, he said.        
	The government is preparing to introduce more measures to encourage capital inflows to ensure that the liquidity crisis does not affect the countrys economy.        
	We have already done something in external commercial borrowings. We will take up more policy changes to allow more capital inflows, Ashok Chawla, secretary of the department of economic affairs, said in a television interview.        
	On the effects of the ongoing global financial crisis, Chawla said, Our banks and financial institutions are not hit by what is happening in these countries. What is impacting us is that capital from these countries will see a dip because they have to handle their own funds.

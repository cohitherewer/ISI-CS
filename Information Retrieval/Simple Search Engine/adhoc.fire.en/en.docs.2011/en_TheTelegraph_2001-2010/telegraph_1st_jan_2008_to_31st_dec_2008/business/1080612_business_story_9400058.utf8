          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: Family feuds have riven the Ranbaxy group over the past two decades ever since founder Bhai Mohan Singh divided his business empire in the early 1990s among his three sons  Parvinder, Manjit and Analjit Singh.        
	Eldest son Parvinder inherited Ranbaxy  the jewel in the crown  and continued to have acrimonious relations with his father and brothers till his death in July 1999.        
	The sale of the promoters stake of 34.82 per cent in Ranbaxy to Daiichi Sankyo of Japan doesnt quell the unresolved family disputes.        
	After the division of the empire, Manjit Singh got Montari Industries and youngest son Analjit bagged Max India. Many believe this division was the origin of a feud among the three brothers.         
	Analjit Singh, who heads Max Group, never concealed his bitterness over losing out during the division of the family assets.        
	Analjit controls approximately 24 lakh shares in Ranbaxy, amounting to a little over 0.6 per cent of the 38 crore paid-up shares in the company. These include 4.39 lakh shares in the New Delhi-based drug maker that, Bhai Mohan Singhs will claims, were jointly registered in his and Parvinder Singhs names.         
	Sources close to the family said this small stake did not form part of todays deal. The Bhai Mohan Singh Foundation had filed several cases in Delhi High Court to settle the issue over the disputed shares after Parvinders death.        
	The family has also been squabbling over a posh residential property at 15 Aurangzeb Road where Bhai Mohan Singh used to live.        
	Another family property  1, Southend lane  was leased to Ranbaxy Laboratories in 1974. In 1993, Ranbaxy stopped paying rent for the property.         
	This has also become a bone of contention with eviction suits filed by a firm controlled by Analjit Singh.        
	Theres a good chance that Daiichi Sankyo will inherit these legal suits as part of the buyout.

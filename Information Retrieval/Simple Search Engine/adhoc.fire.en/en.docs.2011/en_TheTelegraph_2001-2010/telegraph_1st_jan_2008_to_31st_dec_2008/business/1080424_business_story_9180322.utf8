The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | State Bank feels derivative pinch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       State Bank feels derivative pinch
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                O.P. Bhatt: Play with caution		    
	Mumbai, April 23: The State Bank of India  the countrys largest bank  is making a provision of Rs 40 crore ($10 million) to cover a portion of the mark-to-market losses it suffered on forex derivative contracts.        
	The value of these exotic instruments  which were used to raise funds for corporate clients  tanked after the outbreak of the sub-prime credit crisis in the US last August.        
	The SBI is the first state-owned bank to acknowledge the need for provisioning for the losses on its derivative exposures. SBI chairman . P. Bhatt today said the bank clients were expected to suffer losses worth Rs 700 crore on their foreign derivatives contracts.        
	Due to the sub-prime crisis, we will have to provision for a mark-to-market loss of $10 million, he told reporters on the sidelines of a function organised by Ficci.        
	The SBI is the third bank after ICICI Bank and Axis Bank to make such a provision.        
	Last month, the ICICI Bank acknowledged that it had recorded mark-to-market losses of $264.34 million as on January 31 because of its exposure to the sub-prime crisis.        
	On Monday, the Axis Bank disclosed that it made contingent provisions of Rs 71.97 crore, which reflected the mark-to-market loss suffered by two of its customers. The bank also provided $5.09 million towards depreciation in the value of a derivative instrument.        
	Lawsuits filed        
	Several companies that lost money on their forex derivative exposures have filed lawsuits against banks seeking compensation for their mark-to-market losses, alleging that banks had not apprised them of the risks.        
	About 10 companies have filed cases relating to derivatives contracts against their bankers so far. These include Rajshree Sugars, Nahar Industrials, Garg Acrylyte, Sundaram Brake Linings, Sabare International, Precot Meridian and Sundaram Multi-Pap. The banks involved include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.        
	The derivatives losses in the SBI are not very large and will not have any significant impact on the banks balance sheet. SBI customers can book notional losses on foreign exchange derivatives at about Rs 700 crore, but none of them has taken any legal action against the banks derivatives contracts, Bhatt said.        
	Credit growth        
	The SBI expects 22 per cent growth in its loan book during the financial year 2008-09, including a similar surge in the housing loan segment.        
	With a bullish outlook on credit growth, Bhatt said, We expect about 22 per cent credit growth for this fiscal. In the case of housing loans, the market is not homogenous, but in Tier I and Tier II cities, we believe there is still a fair amount of demand.        
	However, the state-owned banking major is not keen to raise its lending rates immediately and will wait till the Reserve Bank reviews its monetary policy on April 29.        
	The lending rates are already at their peak levels and should not go up further. So, even if the RBI raises the repo rate next week, we may not increase the lending rates immediately for the simple reason that credit growth is still good in the market. However, we may have to revise the rates in two-wheeler loans as the transaction costs are high there. But a cut in deposit rates is highly unlikely at this moment, Bhatt said.        
	Inflation jitters        
	I believe inflation will come down to about 6.5 per cent in the next two to three months, and will go down further after that. A 9 per cent GDP growth may not be sustainable indefinitely. However, if oil prices soften and come in the range $80-95 per barrel, an 8-8.5 per cent growth in GDP looks attainable. Financial reforms alone could contribute to a 1.2-1.3 per cent higher GDP, Bhatt said.        
	During a panel discussion arranged by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), industry experts were divided on the measures needed to be taken to balance the compulsions of taming inflation against the imperatives of spurring economic growth.

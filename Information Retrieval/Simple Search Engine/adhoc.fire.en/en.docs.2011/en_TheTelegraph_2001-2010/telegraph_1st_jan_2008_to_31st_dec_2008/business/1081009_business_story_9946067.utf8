          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Back in action      
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: Affluent investors have started funnelling their money into commodity futures as stock returns tumble by as much as 45 per cent this year.        
	High networth individuals (HNIs) have started to head to commodity exchanges which are now reporting a daily turnover of Rs 28,000 crore from a level of Rs 20,000 crore sometime ago.         
	I have come across many investors who are now eager to put their money in commodities, says Harish Galipelli, head of research at Karvy Comtrade. He said most of the investor interest was centred on gold and silver, traditionally considered safe havens when the going is bad for the stock markets.        
	It was in 2003 that the government allowed futures trading in over 50 commodities. Since then these markets have come a long way despite tough rules. The turnover of the commodity exchanges overtook that of the Bombay Stock Exchange sometime ago. Gold, silver, crude oil and base metals are the most actively traded commodities.        
	Rising investor interest in gold comes at a time when international and domestic prices of the yellow metal have firmed up. Gold touched an historic high on the futures market today. The price of the metal for December contract touched Rs 14,000 per 10 gram.         
	Moreover, gold exchange traded funds have been yielding the highest returns amongst various fund categories. Both gold and silver are proven alternative asset classes. When people have burnt their fingers in stock markets, they are showing interest in assets like gold and silver, Galipelli said.        
	Meanwhile, National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (NMCE), the countrys first online demutualised, multi-commodity exchange, unveiled its new corporate identity today. The new corporate identity is not a mere change in logo but a reflection of the inner change in approach and mindset to take on new challenges, said B. C. Khatua, chairman of the Forward Markets Commission.        
	The Anil Ambani-run Reliance Money has sought permission to acquire another 16 per cent in NMCE. We have acquired a 10 per cent stake and are seeking approval from the Forward Markets Commission and ministry of consumer affairs for an additional 16 per cent stake within the next three months, Reliance Moneys director and chief executive Sudip Bandyopadhyay said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mineral magic                                  
	New Delhi, April 10: Mineral-rich states will have their say in mine allocation in the new ore policy, a senior government official said today.        
	There is nothing in the policy that can reduce their (states) powers, said mines secretary J.P. Singh.        
	He hoped the issue of mineral royalty would be resolved in the next cabinet meeting as the mines ministry had already forwarded its views.        
	States have been demanding that instead of a flat rate on minerals, royalties should be based on their value.        
	The chief ministers of four non-Congress states and a minister from Jharkhand, which is ruled by a Congress-supported coalition government, had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying the states right to select the best applicant (for mining rights) should not be compromised in the name of seamless transition or security of tenure and should not be usurped by the Centre under any pretext.        
	The central governments new policy will forbid the allocation of mines to industries on the basis of promises of future investments in a state and instead, bring in open auction of mines. The Centre has been arguing that this will bring more money to the states and result in the fairer allocation of resources, while checking corruption and arbitrariness in mine allocations.        
	Mines minister Sis Ram Ola said, The new policy seeks to ensure security of tenure for concessionaires, which have made substantial investment in mining.        
	There shall be transparency and fair play in the reservation of mines for state agencies in areas where private players are not holding licences or have not applied for exploration or mining, unless some security considerations or specific public interests are involved, he added.        
	The mines secretary said the policy favoured value-addition of minerals, including iron ore, but also suggested that mining needs to be encouraged as a stand-alone activity.        
	The revenues from minerals will be rationalised to ensure that the mineral-bearing states get a fair share of the value of minerals extracted from their grounds, the policy said.

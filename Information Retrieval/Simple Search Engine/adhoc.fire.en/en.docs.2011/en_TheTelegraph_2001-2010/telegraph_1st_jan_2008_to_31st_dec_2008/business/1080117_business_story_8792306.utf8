             Agarwal: Fund hunt
                 
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: The $6.5-billion Vedanta group plans to float an initial public offering (IPO) for Sterlite Energy, which aims to establish power generation projects with capacity of 10,000MW in Orissa and Chhattisgarh. 
    
	The group will also consider a pre-IPO placement to fund the projects.
    
	Sterlite Energy is a subsidiary of Sterlite Industries, and the total cost of the coal-based power projects is estimated at Rs 40,000 crore. The company is expected to raise close to Rs 8,000 crore from the IPO.
    
	Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal told reporters here today that the group would also raise debt to finance the projects. 
    
	I cant really give you a date (for the IPO) but it will be in a few months, he said.
    
	According to Agarwal, Vedanta has planned investments worth Rs 50,000 crore in India. Besides power generation, the money will flow into its metals and mining operations. The company remains keen on setting up a steel project in Orissa and is currently scouting for a joint venture partner.
    
	Admitting that making steel was not his forte, Agarwal said the group had huge iron ore resources (through Sesa Goa), implying that Vedanta would bring in the vital raw material and the joint venture partner could take care of manufacturing the commodity.
    
	Agarwal added that global companies had evinced interest in the project. Vedanta is looking at a 5-million-tonne steel plant in Orissa at an investment of Rs 24,000 crore.
    
	Agarwal said existing capacities in its non-ferrous metals businesses, which include copper, aluminium and zinc, would be increased to 1 million tonnes each. Its present production capacities for copper and aluminium are estimated at 400,000 tonnes each annually. Iron ore output will more than double to 25 million tonnes from around 11 million tonnes at present.

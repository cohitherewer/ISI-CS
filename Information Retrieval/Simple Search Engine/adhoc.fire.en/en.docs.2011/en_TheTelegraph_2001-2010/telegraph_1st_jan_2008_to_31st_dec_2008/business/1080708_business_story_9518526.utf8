          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 7: Daimler Hero Commercial Vehicles (DHCV), the joint venture between Germanys Daimler and the Munjals-promoted Hero group, today said it would set up its manufacturing unit in Chennai as part of its 700-million-euro investment plan over the next five years.        
	The India-German joint venture will soon begin the construction of a factory in Chennai, where it will produce commercial vehicles under a new brand name for the Indian market as well as for exports, the company said in a statement today.        
	The plant will start production in 2010 and will have an initial capacity of 70,000 trucks. DHCV will also meet its export requirement from this plant.        
	The two partners will invest about Rs 4,500 crore in the venture.        
	DHCV has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Tamil Nadu government for setting up the plant.         
	DHCV aims to source 80 per cent of its requirement from the domestic market, utilising the advantage of being located in close proximity to local suppliers.         
	The plant, to be set up on a 400-acre plot, will be located at Oragadam.        
	Daimler AG and Hero group signed the contract in April this year for the joint venture. The German car maker has a 60 per cent stake in the new entity, while the Hero group holds the rest.

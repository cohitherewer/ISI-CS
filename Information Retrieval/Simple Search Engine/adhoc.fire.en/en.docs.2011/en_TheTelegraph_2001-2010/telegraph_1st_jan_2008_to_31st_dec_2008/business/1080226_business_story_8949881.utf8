	Calcutta, Feb. 25: The government will reopen the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme for micro and small-scale enterprises. The scheme will be operational for the remaining period of the Eleventh Five Year Plan.         
	Launched in 2000, the scheme provides upfront capital subsidy to micro and small enterprises.         
	Initially, the subsidy amount was 12 per cent on a maximum institutional finance of Rs 40 lakh that they could use to adapt improved technology in select sectors or products approved under the plan. In September 2005, the maximum ceiling on the loan amount and subsidy were revised to Rs 1 crore and 15 per cent, respectively.         
	In the 2004-05 budget, a deadline of March 2007 was set to close the scheme. However, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the continuation of the scheme last Thursday.         
	The scheme will be reopened in 2008 and will stay open for the Eleventh Plan period. It was closed for review since March 2007, said MSME (development wing) development commissioner Jawhar Sircar at a CII-organised seminar here today.        
	The continuation of the scheme through 2012 will encourage micro and small enterprises to undertake technology upgradation to remain competitive, he added.

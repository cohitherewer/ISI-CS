                                                                                                               Bank cash tax given a burial
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: The infamous banking cash transaction tax has finally been consigned to the scrap heap. But the tax wont go away until April 1 next year.        
	In Budget 2005, Chidambaram raised a storm when he slapped the tax on all cash transactions above Rs 50,000. He had actually proposed to levy it on all cash withdrawals above Rs 25,000 but was forced to raise the limit after a very public furore over the issue.        
	The tax was introduced by the Finance Act, 2005 and provided for a 0.1 per cent levy on taxable banking transaction. While the limit for individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUFs) was placed at Rs 50,000, it was put at Rs 1,00,000 for others in a single day from non-savings bank account maintained with any scheduled bank.         
	The levy was also applicable on single-day cash receipt exceeding Rs 50,000 for individuals and HUFs and Rs 1,00,000 for others on encashment of one or more term deposits, whether on maturity or otherwise.        
	 India Inc has been one of the biggest critics of the tax arguing that it hampered them from meeting their genuine requirement such as disbursement of salary and wages or making genuine stamp duty payments.        
	The tax was aimed at unearthing black money and assets. Industry has argued that the rationale for the tax didnt hold anymore since extensive rules had already been put in place to track banking transactions.

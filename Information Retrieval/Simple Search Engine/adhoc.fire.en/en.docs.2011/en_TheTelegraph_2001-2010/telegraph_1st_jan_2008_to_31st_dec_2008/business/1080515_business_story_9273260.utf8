          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                            
	New Delhi, May 14: The Congress-led government is planning to raise interest rates on post office savings.        
	The rates, which vary from 6.25 per cent for a one-year deposit to 7.5 per cent for a three-year deposit, are actually fetching negative real returns with year-on-year inflation ranging between 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent.         
	For the week ended April 26, inflation had been at 7.61 per cent, prompting the government to consider more administrative steps to check the price rise.        
	Top finance ministry officials said they had been in talks with the postal department. Jyotiraditya Scindia the new minister of state for communications, had written a letter to finance minister P. Chidambaram last week, stating that post office savings were losing their shine because of low returns.         
	Even former communications minister Dayanidhi Maran had raised the issue a year-and-a-half back, in a letter dated November 17, 2006. But, the finance ministry had then ruled out a rate hike.         
	Scindias letter of May 9 says unless interest rates of small saving deposit schemes are raised, post office savings will keep losing their attractiveness rapidly.        
	The officials said that small savings were largely used by state governments. Since the Centre wanted states to access loans at a reasonable rate, it had not encouraged hikes in interest rates.         
	However with higher inflation rates and the fact that banks pay 8.25-9 per cent on term deposits, there is a need for a rethink, officials said.         
	They said deposits in post office small savings schemes were showing a declining trend. Total deposits collected through different post office saving schemes stood at Rs 95,383 crore till February 2008. During 2006-07, it was Rs 1,19,587.76 crore and in 2005-06 it was Rs 1,33,179.66.        
	The small savings schemes have seen a decline of 28 per cent, with nearly Rs 38,000 crore being withdrawn in a year and a half. The post office monthly income scheme suffered after the withdrawal of the 10 per cent bonus by the government from February 13, 2006. Later the government reintroduced the bonus but at a lower rate of 5 per cent.        
	Low returns        
	Analysts attribute the negative growth to low returns compared with interest rates on deposits in banks and the returns from mutual funds and real estate.         
	In the letter to Chidambaram, Scindia had written that in my view the main cause for concern is (the) present interest rate due to which investors are facing financial loss.         
	The officials said that since much of the rural population preferred post office investments, it made sense to offer a higher rates on the schemes as this would help the government achieve its goal of financial inclusion of the poorer sections.         
	Sops such as tax concessions do not matter to this section of the population. We have to give them incentives to save by offering higher returns.         
	As part of the governments strategy of financial inclusion, the finance ministry had directed public sector banks to sanction loans to economically marginalised sections in rural areas for achieving socio-economic development.         
	The only stumbling block could be state governments which might not be happy with paying higher interest on loans from the small savings schemes. Ministry officials said that a final decision could only be taken after a consultation with states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel makers to export less
                                                                                                               Steel makers to export less
          OUR SPECIAL CORRRESPONDENT                                          Peace measures    
	New Delhi, March 25: Steel makers today volunteered to cut down on exports to rein in the price rise. They have also agreed to accept reduced benefits on such exports.        
	However, chief executives of major steel producers told senior government officials that exports which were already committed would have to continue.         
	The chairman of one of Indias largest steel companies told The Telegraph, We cannot totally stop exports as some of them are committed and we have to maintain business relations with clients ... but yes we will reduce exports if this helps in holding the price line here.         
	Last week, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan had written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, recommending removal of duties on imported steel and inputs and fiscal measures to curb exports.        
	Steel producers today met top ministry officials and said they also shared the governments concern on rising prices and inadequate availability of steel, Indian Steel Alliance president Moosa Raza said.        
	Raza, however, added that the industry expected the government to bring down the excise duty from 16 per cent to 8 per cent and reduce import duty on raw materials such as metcoke. Paswans letter came in the wake of the steel industrys refusal to bring down prices.        
	In his letter, Paswan had said in case these measures failed to yield results, a regulator should be considered to control steel prices. This proposal rattled the nerves of steel makers.         
	Soon after, Raza also shot off a letter to the Prime Minister saying appointing a regulator would be putting the producers between the two prongs of a pincer.

             Chidambaram: Moving on
                 
	Chennai, Feb. 3: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said a large taxpayer unit would be set up in Calcutta.
    
	Such a unit is to allow companies pay all their taxes  for instance, excise duties, service levies and advance income taxes  at one point.
    
	Chidambaram, who inaugurated the countrys second such unit in Chennai today, said a company such as MRF used to pay its various taxes at around 100 places and jurisdictions across the country, which led to a huge waste of time. 
    
	This will not be the case from now on.
    
	Bangalore has such a facility, while Mumbai will have one in March, to be followed by Delhi and Calcutta.
    
	A company eligible to pay taxes at such a unit must fulfil any of the three criteria: it pays at least Rs 5 crore central service tax; pays at least Rs 5 crore central excise duty; pays at least Rs 10 crore advance tax.
    
	Chidambaram said the unit would serve as a single-window facility for all matters related to central excise duties, service taxes, corporate and income taxes. 
    
	Chennai-based Indian Overseas Bank has opted to pay its taxes through the unit. We will also bring the Indian Bank and all the private sector banks in Tamil Nadu under the large taxpayer unit, the finance minister said.
    
	At such a unit, companies will deal with only one senior level officer  a client executive  for any assistance, clarification and grievance redressal. Chidambaram said the units were set up to ensure that your case doesnt go to the tribunal. It is not intended to be an adversarial relationship. 
    
	He said, At the large taxpayer unit level, there is a chief commissioner (appeals), a very experienced officer with whom the clients can sit across the table, discuss their issues, apply the law to the facts correctly and uniformly reach a conclusion within the limits of the law.
    
	The minister said he expected the units to significantly raise tax collections. Twenty-five large companies have already joined the Chennai unit.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nakanishi in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: Maruti Suzuki India today raised the prices of most of its models. Indias No. 1 car maker also reported a 36.52 per cent dip in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30.         
	Prices rose between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000. The price of the Maruti 800 is up Rs 2,000, the Omni, Rs 2,200, and the Alto, Rs 2,500. The Wagon R and the Zen Estilo have become dearer by Rs 3,000 each, while the prices of the Maruti SX4 and the Versa have been hiked by Rs 6,000 and Rs 3,500, respectively.         
	The petrol and diesel variants of the Swift Dzire and the diesel version of the Maruti Swift have not seen any price rise.        
	The company today said its net profit for the quarter ended September 30 dropped to Rs 296.1 crore from Rs 466.5 crore in the same period last year. However, net sales went up 6.1 per cent to Rs 4,806.3 crore from Rs 4,529.7 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	Macro-economic parameters such as lack of credit availability, high interest rates and depressed consumer sentiments have affected our sales, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director and chief executive officer of Maruti Suzuki.        
	A sharp increase in commodity prices, especially steel, and the companys inability to pass them on to buyers have affected profitability, Nakanishi said.        
	For the six months ended September, Marutis net profit declined 21.12 per cent to Rs 762 crore from Rs 966.1 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Net sales during this period were at Rs 9,537.3 crore, up 13 per cent over the corresponding period last year.        
	The company sold 3,82, 035 units in the six months compared with 3,60,994 units in the same period of the previous year, a growth rate of 5.8 per cent.         
	In the domestic market, Maruti sales went up 4.5 per cent to 351,799 units from 336,758 units a year ago.         
	Exports during the period stood at 30,236 units against 24,236 units in the year-ago period, a rise of 24.8 per cent.        
	On the future outlook, Nakanishi said the global economic slowdown would have an impact on India, but the country would recover faster than others.

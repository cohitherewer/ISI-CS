          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended the entry of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), who buy, or rent, spectrum and network from existing entities to offer services to subscribers under their own brand.        
	Trai has proposed to introduce an MVNO as a distinct service provider with its own licensing and regulatory framework. Accordingly, MVNOs are to be issued a licence under the Indian Telegraph Act.        
	Firms interested in operating as an MVNO will have to pay about Rs 150 crore for a nationwide entry licence. Annual licence fees as a percentage of revenues will be the same as that of mobile operators.        
	For the metros and A category cities, the entry fee for an MVNO is Rs 5 crore; for B category cities it is Rs 3 crore; and for C category cities it is Rs 1 crore.        
	Richard Branson-owned Virgin Mobile was accused of being an MVNO of Tata Teleservices by rival operators, kickstarting the process of formulating a policy for MVNOs. Virgin and the Tatas, however, successfully fought the accusation and showed that Virgin was a mere franchisee.        
	Trai has recommended a foreign holding cap of 74 per cent for MVNOs, in line with other telecom services. This means if Virgin were to now switch over to the MVNO model, it would have to shed a stake in its Indian operations.         
	However, Trai proposed that the allocation of mobile numbers, number portability, interconnection with other service providers and roaming should be provided by the parent telecom service provider. While a mobile service provider can lease spectrum to many MVNOs in a particular circle, each MVNO can enter into an agreement with only one service provider in a circle.        
	Many foreign companies such as Telekom Malaysia, Mobile ESPN and ValueFirst have said that they wanted to enter the Indian market via the MVNO route.         
	The entry of an MVNO in the mobile market could raise the level of competition by providing consumers with a wider choice of service providers, a wider range of innovative value added services and more competitive pricing plans, said Nipendra Misra, chairman, Trai.        
	The subscribers of MVNOs should be treated as those of the parent operators for the allotment of spectrum, Trai said.        
	Globally, companies such as the UKs Virgin Mobile, BT Mobile and Japans KDDI have based their telecom strategy on an MVNO model. At present, there are 360 MVNOs globally.

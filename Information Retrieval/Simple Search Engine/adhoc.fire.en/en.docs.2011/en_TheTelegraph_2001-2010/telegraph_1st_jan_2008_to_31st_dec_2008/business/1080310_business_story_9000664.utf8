	New Delhi, March 9: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is planning to join hands with mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) for better use of its infrastructure.        
	We are planning to align with companies operating on the MVNO model to utilise spare capacity to the maximum and provide better infrastructure to users, BSNL finance director S.D. Saxena told The Telegraph. The company is waiting for a formal policy from the government.        
	A mobile virtual network operator offers voice and data services without owning spectrum and network infrastructure such as telecom towers and transmission equipment.         
	The model is still not approved by Indian telecom laws. The company has around 31,000 GSM towers and around 7,500 towers supporting the CDMA technology. It has also floated a tender to set up another 6,000 towers.        
	BSNL is yet to start talks with an MVNO operator. Saxena, however, said that the company would welcome any discussion.        
	After the controversies surrounding the Tata Teleservices-Virgin deal, the government is planning to give its approval to the MVNO model and foreign participation in the segment.        
	The UK-based Virgin Mobile is a virtual network operator that has entered into an exclusive franchisee deal with Tata Teleservices. The Tatas will sell Virgin-branded value-added services to its CDMA users.        
	Telecom secretary Sidharth Behura recently said the government was in favour of allowing foreign companies as MVNOs. The department of telecom will ask the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to prepare recommendations for the entry of MVNOs .         
	The government is also in favour of allowing new players  who have licences but do not have spectrum  to buy talk time at wholesale rates from existing mobile operators and then offer services under their own brands..

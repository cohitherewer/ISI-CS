          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          SPREADING WINGS                                  
	New Delhi, July 15: Fortune Park Hotels, an ITC-Welcomgroup brand, is scouting for properties abroad to set up fully owned hotels.         
	We do want to spread our wings far and wide. We may look at signing properties in Sri Lanka, Nepal and even Dubai. We, however, have not set any deadline to fulfil this objective but have been getting queries for the last few months, Suresh Kumar, president, Fortune Park Hotels told The Telegraph.        
	With outbound tourism in India twice the size of the inbound one, owning properties abroad will only be a logical extension to the business, he said.         
	The hospitality brand is looking to open its first fully owned hotels in Calcutta, Bangalore and Coimbatore. All the three properties are expected to be operational in the next two-and-a-half to three years.         
	We are using our land banks to develop properties at these locations, each about 1.5 acres. We will invest about Rs 65-70 crore on each property these will be upscale hotels but with less frills, said Kumar.        
	He, however, refused to divulge further details about these projects.        
	The Fortune Park follows a model of management contract where the owner of a property infuses money for any kind of development.        
	In another expansion move, Fortune Park Hotels will be launching a sub-brand  Fortune Adventure. Though the hotel is yet to sign a property under this segment, talks are already on.        
	The idea is to open jungle lodges and resorts at sites where tourists go for trekking and enjoying wildlife. It is at a conception stage, but we will look at places in southern India, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, Sharma said.        
	Fortune operates under 11 categories with adventure being the newest of the lot. The other 10 categories include the Select, Park, Inn, Resort, Faith, Apartments, Stop, Spot, Lodge and Indoville.        
	In the next two years, Fortune is expected to have 50 properties operating under Fortune Lodge, Fortune Adventure, Fortune Highways and Fortune Faith brands.

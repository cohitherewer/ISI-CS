          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, July 10: Sterlite Industries has reached an agreement with the workers unions of Asarco, giving its bid to acquire the US-based copper producer a boost.        
	The terms and conditions of the new pact will come into effect after Sterlite successfully acquires the assets of the Tucson, Arizona-based bankrupt company.        
	The development is significant as Sterlite is now facing competition from Asarcos estranged parent Grupo Mexico.        
	Sterlite had won an auction to acquire the assets of Asarco for $2.6 billion on May 30, but the straight takeover was scuttled after Grupo came up with a higher bid.        
	The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case of Asarco will now decide on the merits of the two competing offers, when Grupo submits its plan.         
	Sterlite believes the backing of the workers will be more than handy when its offer is evaluated by the bankruptcy court.        
	It is a clear signal that workers want Sterlite to take over the companys assets and grow the business, sources said.        
	Industry observers say workers support will be critical for any Indian company engaging in cross-border acquisitions.        
	Today, Sterlite and the unions agreed on the new collective bargaining agreement, which fully retains all existing worker benefits.        
	It contains terms to ensure that Asarcos operations will be improved and made more competitive. There are also commitments to ensure that Sterlite invests in and operates all of Asarcos existing operations.         
	The parties have also agreed that the term of the current pact expiring in 2010 will be extended by three years.        
	We regard our employees as a vitally important part of our business and are extremely happy to have concluded a mutually satisfactory agreement with Asarcos representatives, Anil Agarwal, chairman of Sterlite Industries, said in a statement.        
	Terry Bonds, chairman of the Asarco Union Negotiating Committee and Joseph Lapinsky, chief executive officer and president of Asarco, also said that they were happy with the agreement.        
	Asarco, which owns and operates copper mines, smelters, refineries and other related assets, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005 before a Texas bankruptcy court. The proposed sale of assets to Sterlite is part of a plan to bring the bankruptcy case to a close.

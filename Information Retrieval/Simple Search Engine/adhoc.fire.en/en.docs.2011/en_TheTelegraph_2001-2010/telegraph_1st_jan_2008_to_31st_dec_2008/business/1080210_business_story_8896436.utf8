          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ramadorai: Changing trends                          
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) today restructured its organisation into five units, which will give customers a single view of the company.        
	The units will address new growth opportunities, provide sharper accountability and groom new leadership, COO and executive director N. Chandrasekaran said.        
	The new structure has been well planned and provides tremendous amount of customer ownership and accountability. The structure is aligned to the long-term strategy and allows the sales team to drive new business in a dedicated fashion, he said.        
	The five new units are: industry solution, major markets, new growth market, strategic initiative and organisation infrastructure.        
	All these units will be run by empowered group heads with access to all resources of TCS and having growth and profit responsibility.        
	TCS has 105,000 plus employees and given the market momentum we need a manageable and nimble organisation, chief executive S. Ramadorai said.        
	The industry solution group will have multiple verticals. Every industry vertical will have a person accountable to the overall unit head.         
	While the major markets unit will focus on the US, the UK and Europe, the new growth markets group will concentrate on India, the Asia Pacific and emerging markets.        
	A company statement said the structure would also provide more opportunities for leadership growth at all levels in the organisation and encourage the next generation of leaders by empowering group heads to run their units with growth and profit responsibilities.

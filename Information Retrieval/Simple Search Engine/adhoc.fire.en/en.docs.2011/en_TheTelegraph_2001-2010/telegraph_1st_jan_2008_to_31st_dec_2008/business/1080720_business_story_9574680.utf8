The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tech earnings beat estimates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tech earnings beat estimates
                              Glad tidings                            
	Boston, July 19 (Reuters): IBM and other technology companies, whose products help big corporations save money or expand data storage capacity, are faring better than those relying on consumers in the wake of the current economic slowdown.        
	International Business Machines Corp, the worlds biggest technology company, impressed investors by beating quarterly profit expectations and raising 2008 forecasts which it reported along with other big tech companies on Thursday.        
	In contrast, Microsoft missed estimates amid concerns about its online business and the economy. Google also put up a disappointing show. The web leader told investors it was operating under uncertain economic conditions after a weaker-than-expected 35 per cent quarterly profit increase.        
	Darren Bagwell, director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, reckons that IBMs results point to strong performances for companies such as EMC Corp, the biggest maker of corporate storage gear. EMC releases its results on July 23.        
	IBMs mainframe business was on fire, he said, pointing to a new line of computers that IBM introduced in February. They sold out at the end of the second quarter after the companys first major upgrade to its mainframes in almost three years. They are used in green data centres that help businesses save money on energy and maintenance costs.        
	In a teleconference with analysts and reporters on Thursday, IBM said demand from companies in developed countries looking to expand data centres contributed to its better-than-expected 22 per cent rise in quarterly profit.        
	Bagwell noted both Microsoft and Google said they planned to invest heavily in developing larger, more sophisticated data centres so that they could compete better with each other.        
	They are spending a lot of money to build the infrastructure they need, he said. Someone is going to get the benefit of that, obviously.         
	Bagwell expects such infrastructure investment will also bolster profits at VMware Inc, whose software helps companies save money by allowing them to boost the efficiency of server computers.        
	Size matters        
	Companies the size of IBM could fare better in a weakening economy than smaller rivals, analysts said, as customers pare back the number of vendors to focus on those deemed most resilient to an economic slowdown.        
	Demand for hardware appears to be trickling down to smaller manufacturers such as Sun Microsystems, whose shares have been battered, losing 48 per cent this year.        
	Sun Microsystems, a maker of high-end servers, reported on Tuesday preliminary results in line with expectations, but that sparked a rally in its shares by investors who had feared worse.        
	Jerry Dodson, a portfolio manager with Parnassus Investments, said he feared other software makers might post weak earnings after Microsofts disappointing results.        
	It (the rough economy) seems to be hitting software more than the hardware, Dodson said.

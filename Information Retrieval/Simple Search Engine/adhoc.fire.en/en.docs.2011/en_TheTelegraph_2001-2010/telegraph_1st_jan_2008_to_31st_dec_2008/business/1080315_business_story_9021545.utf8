The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI strike in Bengal called off
                                                                                                               SBI strike in Bengal called off
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 14: There will be no strike at the branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Bengal on March 28.        
	The SBI management agreed to meet the demands of a section of the bank employees in Calcutta.        
	Ashok Datta, general secretary of the SBI Staff Association, said the employees of the foreign exchange department of the SBI had called off their agitation and indefinite relay hunger strike from today.        
	Datta held a meeting with the SBI management in Mumbai today where the latter was said to have agreed to not closing down the foreign exchange operations here. As part of a tripartite agreement among the management, staff and officers associations in 2000, foreign exchange work were to be distributed equally between Mumbai and Calcutta.        
	Local employees alleged that the agreement was not fulfilled, and foreign exchange activities continued to come down in Calcutta.        
	The management had promised that inward remittance operations would be done from here. But that promise was not kept either.                                
	Datta said internal circulars effecting the closure of the foreign exchange department, where 300 people work, would not be invoked.        
	The proposal to shift the money market operations would not be implemented either.

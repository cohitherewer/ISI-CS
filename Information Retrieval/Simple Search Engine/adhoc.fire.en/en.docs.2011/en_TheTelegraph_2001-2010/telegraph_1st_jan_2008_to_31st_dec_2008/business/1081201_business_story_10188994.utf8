The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM in crisis talks with lenders
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       GM in crisis talks with lenders
                            
	London, Nov. 30 (PTI): US auto maker General Motors (GM) is in emergency talks with its lenders over a multi-billion-dollar debt-for-equity deal, which can save the company from filing for bankruptcy, The Sunday Times said in a report.        
	The report said the auto makers chief executive Rick Wagoner was scrambling to secure a deal by Tuesday when he would make a fresh attempt to secure up to $12 billion (7.8 billion) in financial aid from the US government.        
	According to the publication, Wagoner is trying to persuade some of the debt holders to swap part of GMs $43-billion debt pile for shares, in a move that will shore up the balance sheet and reduce its crippling interest costs.         
	GM has been paying nearly $2.9 billion a year as interest payments.         
	Further, the company has lost about $13 billion in the first nine months of this year because of weak demand and restructuring costs.         
	The new capital structure will form the basis of a new business plan for a much smaller, leaner business. If an agreement can be reached this weekend the company can avoid seeking bankruptcy protection, the report said.

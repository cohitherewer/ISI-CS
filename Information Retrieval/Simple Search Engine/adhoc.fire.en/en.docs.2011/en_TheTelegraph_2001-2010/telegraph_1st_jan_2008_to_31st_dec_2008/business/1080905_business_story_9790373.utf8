                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nestl man to head Unilever
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Polman: New role                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 4: Unilever has announced that Paul Polman from Nestl would succeed group chief executive Patrick Cescau, who retires at the end of the year.         
	Cescau has been with Unilever for 35 years and has led the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant for the last four years, initially as chairman and then as the companys first group CEO.         
	At present, Polman, 52, is the executive vice-president and zone director for the Americas at NestlSA.         
	He is believed to have pipped four internal candidates vying for Cescaus job.         
	Polman joined Nestl in 2006 as chief financial officer. Prior to that he had a 26-year career at Procter amp; Gamble where he rose to become group president, Europe  a position he held from 2001.         
	Polman had been tipped as a possible successor to former Nestl chief Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. However, he lost out as the Swiss food giant named former Americas head Paul Bulcke instead in September 2007.         
	Unilever began its search for a new global CEO to replace Cescau earlier this year after appointing the UK recruiting firm Egon Zehnder International to find a successor.         
	Since then, it was speculated that the company would most likely replace Cescau with an internal candidate.         
	Two Unilever executives of Indian origin  Malvinder (Vindi) Banga, president (foods, home and personal care) and Harish Manwani, president (Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe)  were seen as frontrunners.         
	The other two in the race were Unilevers chief financial officer Jim Lawrence and Americas division president, Mike Polk.         
	Polmans name will be proposed for appointment to the board at extraordinary general meetings to be convened during autumn, the company release stated.         
	We are very pleased to welcome Paul Polman. He is a great talent with significant international experience and an excellent track record, Unilever chairman Michael Treschow said.

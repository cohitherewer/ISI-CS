The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hot on MTN tracks, Anil reaches Africa
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hot on MTN tracks, Anil reaches Africa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ambani: Looking forward                                  
	Mumbai, May 27: With his eyes set on a potential alliance with South African telecom major MTN, Anil Ambani has gone to Johannesburg to initiate further discussions with the largest telecom player in sub-Saharan Africa.        
	According to sources, Ambani left for Johannesburg on Sunday morning along with his family and close advisers.        
	During the course of his stay there, he is expected to hold discussions with MTN chairman Phuthuma Nhleko and senior management and explore ways to structure a business combination with Reliance Communications (R-Com).        
	One of the options is to set up a special purpose vehicle in which the two companies could pick up substantial stakes. The alternative is to swap shares in the operating entities owned by Ambani and MTN.        
	Investment bank Lazard Capital is advising R-Com on the deal, sources said.        
	MTN has a market capitalisation of around $35 billion, while R-Coms is around $30 billion.        
	Earlier, MTNs talks with Bharti for a potential merger failed as Bharti refused to become a subsidiary of the African operator.        
	Officials said no matter how the deal was structured, Ambani would eventually want to take control of the combined entity.         
	Its very hard to see how Anil Ambani would agree to R-Com becoming a mere subsidiary when Bharti, Indias top operator, refused to become one, said a market watcher.         
	The two companies have entered into exclusive negotiations over a period of 45 days.        
	On Saturday, both sides had preliminary discussions on the outskirts of London after R-Com first expressed its interest in the African company on May 22 through its bankers.

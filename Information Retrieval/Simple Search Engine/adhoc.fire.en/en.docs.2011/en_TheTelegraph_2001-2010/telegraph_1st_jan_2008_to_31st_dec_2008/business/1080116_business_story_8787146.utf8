	Calcutta, Jan. 15: Tata AIG Life Insurance Company today launched a unit-linked plan, InvestAssure Flexi, that offers seven fund options, including a capital protection fund. 
    
	A unique feature of the plan is that a policyholder can switch between funds, except for the capital protection fund, 12 times a year without paying any additional fee. This makes InvestAssure Flexi perhaps the most flexible unit-linked life insurance plan in the market. 
    
	The minimum annual premium of the plan is Rs 15,000, and one can choose among policy terms ranging from five to 40 years. However, the plan doesnt allow withdrawals before five years. 
    
	We are giving policyholders the flexibility to choose the premium paying term, said Trevor Bull, managing director and chief executive officer of Tata AIG Life Insurance Company. 
    
	For instance, one can choose a policy term of 20 years and a premium paying term of five years, he added. 
    
	The premium paying term could be three years, five years or in multiples of five years. The age limit for the plan is 70 years.
    
	Tata AIG Life, which started its operations in 2001, manages assets worth Rs 4,000 crore across all its traditional, unit-linked and corporate pension plans. During the first nine months of the last calendar year, our business grew at a slower pace of 25 to 30 per cent. Only in the last three months we registered a triple-digit growth, Bull said. 
    
	The company recorded a premium income of Rs 1,367 crore in 2006-07. In the current fiscal, the growth rate can come down to between 40 and 50 per cent compared with more than 100 per cent in the last few years. 
    
	There was a slowdown in premium income growth across companies during most part of the last calendar year, Bull added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Cautious                                   
	New Delhi, March 15: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the Reserve Bank of India might not support an interest rate cut to boost industrial production because of an increase in prices of food articles and fuel.        
	Government data released yesterday showed inflation had risen to 5.11 per cent.        
	The hope of cheaper credit to push consumer demand, suggested by the 2007-08 economic survey and supported by the finance minister in earlier months, seems to be weakening.        
	As long as there is a threat of inflation, you have to trust the RBI to use policy rates in order to contain inflation and dampen inflationary expectations, Chidambaram said.        
	The central bank might not have much cushion to cut interest rates as crude prices, which have crossed the psychological $100-a-barrel mark, are expected to remain high and scale new heights.        
	An analysis released by the investment firm Goldman Sachs suggested that oil prices might soar to $200 per barrel.         
	In its earlier forecast for 2008, Goldman had warned that oil prices could reach $105 a barrel and average $95 a barrel during the year.        
	In 2005, Goldman was the first major market player to predict that oil prices could rise up to $100 a barrel in 2007.        
	The Indian basket of crude has touched a record $102 per barrel.        
	Chidambaram said the determination of policy interest rates was under the domain of the RBI. The very purpose of fixing policy interest rates was to contain inflation.         
	He attributed high inflation rates to rising prices of food and commodity prices in the world, adding that India was not entirely insulated from global trends.        
	We have recognised that there is a slowdown, thanks to the impending US recession. We have applied text book economic approach to boost consumer demand by putting more money in the hands of tax payers, cutting excise and customs duties and enlarging public expenditure, he said.        
	However, Sonal Varma, economist with Lehman Brothers, said, Monetary policy for the RBI is set to get more complicated as inflation continues to rise and growth continues to slow.        
	The analyst said fiscal and trade policies would be used to tackle supply-side inflation and that the RBI would increasingly focus on the downside risks to growth, adding that the central bank would not change the interest rate.        
	Varma said, We do not expect any change in benchmark rate in April. In July or October, the RBI may cut the repo rate, the rate at which the RBI lends short-term money to banks, by 25 basis points.        
	The economy is expected to grow 8.7 per cent in the year, the slowest pace since 2005. Industrial production increased 5.3 per cent in January, less than half the 11.3 per cent gain in the same month a year ago.        
	Complicating the issue further would be the updated inflation index, expected later this year. It is likely to mirror the volatility in fuel prices and its effect on other products more accurately.

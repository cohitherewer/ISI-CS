          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 23: Azim Premjis Wipro Technologies has bought Citi Technology Services Ltd of Citigroup for $127 million. Citi Technology provides IT services to Citi entities worldwide.        
	As part of the deal, Citi has guaranteed IT orders to Wipro of $500 million for six years. A Citi official said this was a minimum commitment and it could double in 6-7 years.        
	Wipro joint chief executive officer (IT business and member of the board) Girish S. Paranjpe said Citi had played a pioneering role in leveraging technology for banking.         
	He said Wipro was pleased that its domain expertise and infrastructure management capabilities had positioned it as Citis partner of choice. The transaction is expected to close by March.        
	Citigroup chief administrative officer Don Callahan said, This sale was the result of a thorough process to ensure we were partnering with the right company for our businesses and our clients. Wipro, with its wide range of services, extensive experience and broad global presence can play a significant role in meeting Citis objectives of productivity improvement.        
	He said Citi Technology Services employees would join a larger IT organisation and have greater career opportunities.         
	This is the second time Citigroup, under pressure because of mounting credit-related losses in the US, is selling a part of its back-office operations in India.

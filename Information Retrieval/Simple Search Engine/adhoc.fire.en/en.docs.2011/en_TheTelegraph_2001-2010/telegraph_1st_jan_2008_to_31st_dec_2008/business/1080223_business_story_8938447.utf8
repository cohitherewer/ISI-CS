	Calcutta, Feb. 22: Deloitte amp; Touche Consulting plans to focus on the Indian market to reap the benefits of a stronger rupee.        
	About half of Deloittes workforce of 12,000 would be working on Indian projects by 2010.        
	Of the big four consulting firms, Deloitte is the only firm which has an Indian on its global consulting board.        
	It just goes to show the kind of importance ascribed to India as a market and the operations here. Just like our clients, we too would have to reorient ourselves to the need of the times. If the economy is growing at such a pace and the rupee is doing well, we should try and leverage it, putting it to our advantage, said Roopen Roy, managing director of Deloitte amp; Touche Consulting.        
	Roy was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on challenges for the ITeS industry at Infocom 2007-08, which is being jointly organised by Businessworld, an ABP Group publication, and CeBIT.        
	Of the current workforce of 8,750 employees, 3,000 are working on India-centric projects.        
	Last week, Deloittes global board of consulting met in Hyderabad and one of the key decisions to have come out was the importance of India in its scheme.         
	Deloittes offshore centres are located in Hyderabad and Mumbai. Deloitte, which is a $23.5-billion company, earns $9 billion from its global consulting business.

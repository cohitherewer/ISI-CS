          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Voicing concern                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today made a strong plea to reduce jet fuel prices to bail out airline companies. However, the petroleum ministry refused to play ball.        
	ATF (aviation turbine fuel or jet fuel) price in the country is 70 per cent higher than the international market and sales tax makes it more costly, Patel said.        
	We must try to rationalise taxes. Oil companies must also co-operate, he said.        
	The petroleum ministry said it had no role in the pricing of jet fuel.        
	According to Patel, high fuel prices are the main reason for the current crisis in aviation. He urged the states to come to the rescue of the industry as high sales tax levied by them added to the misery of the airline companies. Patel said he would wait for the report of a committee set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in July to look into the problems of airlines.        
	I hope in a week or two the committee will give its recommendations so that the ministry can take steps, he said.        
	Jet fuel prices sold by domestic oil companies are linked to international crude prices. The prices are revised every month based on the average price of the Indian basket of crude oil.         
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the high price of jet fuel was because of the taxes imposed on it, which fell under the purview of the finance ministry and state governments.        
	The price of jet fuel was deregulated from April 1, 2001, exposing it to the vagaries of the global market.         
	Moreover, airlines pay an eight per cent excise duty in the country, besides a sales tax which varies from 20 per cent to 35 per cent. Jet fuel accounts for 35 per cent of an airlines expense. State taxes and excise duty amount to about a third of the price of the fuel.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Singh: No relief                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The government today ruled out any cut in petrol and diesel prices till oil companies stopped making losses on fuel sales and the price of global crude stabilised.        
	There are limits to what the government can do on subsidising. When we see that Indian oil companies are able to sustain a reduction, that will be the right time for such a decision, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told reporters.        
	If (international) prices keep on going down, we can explore these possibilities (of reducing prices), he said.        
	Opposition parties have been demanding a cut in fuel prices, arguing that international crude prices have come down to around $60 a barrel now from a high of $147 a barrel in July.        
	Oil producing countries have been increasingly demanding a cut in output to stem a further fall in global crude prices.         
	The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) will be meeting in Algeria next month, the second time in a quarter, to consider a production cut.        
	In October, Opec had agreed to cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day, or around 5 per cent, to halt the price slide, but the move had little effect.        
	India, however, has not been able to benefit much from the fall in global crude prices.         
	According to petroleum ministry officials, the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar prevented the crude import bill from coming down.        
	Officials said the oil companies would have achieved break-even on fuel sales by now had it not been for the falling Indian currency.         
	Every time the rupee depreciates against the dollar by 100 paise, the revenue loss goes up by Rs 8,000 crore on an annualised basis. Similarly, every dollar increase or decrease in crude prices has an impact of Rs 3,000 crore a year.        
	Indias oil import bill in April-September had risen two-fold to $53.5 billion compared with the same period last year.

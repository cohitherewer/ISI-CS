          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Smooth ride ahead                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: Truckers today ended their three-day strike after the government agreed to roll back a hike in the toll tax.        
	Besides the rollback, the truckers also wanted the government to honour the service tax agreement of 2004, make available non-branded diesel and remove speed governors on highways.        
	All our issues on service tax have been resolved and the provisions of agreement reached in 2004 will be honoured, the All India Motor Transport Congress president Charan Singh Lohara told the media here after a meeting with government officials.        
	Toll rates applicable prior to December 2007 will be applied henceforth and there will be no increase in toll for a period of one year on government-funded 770 km national highway stretches, transport secretary Brahm Dutt said. Revenue secretary P.V. Bhide said the service tax agreement of 2004 would be followed.        
	The truckers had protested the governments move to levy full tax at the rate of 12.36 per cent on services such as cargo handling, storage and warehousing services provided by transport agencies. They said this was against the agreement that they had reached with the government in 2004, when they were given an abatement of 75 per cent on the service tax payment for these services.        
	Dutt said the government would also set up a permanent mechanism by constituting a committee under the chairmanship of the National Highway Authority of India for the monitoring, reviewing and overseeing of toll systems.        
	The committee will have the powers to examine the standard and service levels provided by the toll system operators and recommend suitable corrective measures, he said.        
	On the demand for the availability of non-branded diesel, the petroleum ministry had earlier sent a directive to all oil marketing companies to make the fuel available in adequate quantities in all their outlets across the country.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil, said, The strike would have had some impact on the perishable commodities. Had it been prolonged, it would affect industrial production and economic growth.

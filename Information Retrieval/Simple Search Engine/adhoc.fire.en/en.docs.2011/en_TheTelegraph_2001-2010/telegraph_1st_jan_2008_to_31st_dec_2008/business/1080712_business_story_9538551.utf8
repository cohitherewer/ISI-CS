	Mumbai, July 11: The Securities and Exchange Board of India is planning to extend the deadline for companies to present their consolidated financial statements to two months after the end of a quarter from one month at present.        
	This proposal comes as part of the market regulators efforts to introduce changes in Clause 41 of the listing agreement.        
	Under Clause 41 (I) c, a company has an option either to submit audited or unaudited quarterly and year-to-date standalone financial results to the stock exchange within one month after the end of each quarter. Moreover, under Clause 41 (I) (e), a company having subsidiaries has the option to submit consolidated financial results in addition to standalone results within one month after the end of each quarter. However, it was found that companies having global operations faced practical difficulties in preparing such consolidated results as they had many subsidiaries.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Welcome move                                        
	Mumbai, Dec. 22: Three public sector banks  the Bank of India (BoI), the Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Canara Bank  today cut their benchmark prime lending rates (BPLR) by 75 basis points to 12.50 per cent. This follows the State Bank of Indias (SBI) move to cut the benchmark rate by the same margin last Saturday.         
	The reduction in the benchmark rate, which will be effective from January 1, will benefit both existing and new borrowers. Home, auto and corporate loans will get cheaper, the banks said.         
	On Saturday, the SBI announced a 75-basis-point cut in its BPLR to 12.25 per cent. In the case of the SBI, the effective interest on an existing floating rate home loan will come down to as low as 9 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh and a tenure of five years.         
	Last week, nationalised banks had announced that home loans up to Rs 5 lakh would be given at a maximum interest rate of 8.5 per cent, while the interest rates for those seeking loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh would be capped at 9.25 per cent.         
	In line with lower lending rates, the BoI also brought down its deposit rates for all maturities. These changes will come into effect from January 1. The BoI said deposits of 46 days to 90 days would offer 7 per cent and that from 91 days to 179 days would fetch 7.25 per cent. Similarly, the interest rate on deposits between 180 days and 269 days will be 7.75 per cent and that between 270 days and 364 days will be 8.25 per cent.         
	The interest rate on deposits of one year to less than two years will stand at 8.50 per cent and those above two years will fetch 8.75 per cent.         
	The BoB has also brought down the interest rate on deposits by 50-100 basis points.              
	For loans above five years and up to 15 years, the revised interest rate is 9.25 per cent and for those above 15 years and up to 25 years, the new rate will be at 9.50 per cent

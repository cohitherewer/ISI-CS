	New York, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc has won a court order on Saturday blocking Wells Fargo from buying US bank Wachovia Corp until the court rules otherwise.        
	Citigroup, which planned to buy Wachovias banking assets for $2.2 billion, said New York State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos has granted an injunction extending Wachovias agreement to negotiate exclusively with Citigroup. The two banks are slated to appear before the judge on October 10.        
	Citigroup and Wells Fargo are battling for control of the sixth-largest US bank, Wachovia, which has been hit hard by bad mortgages but has a large network of branches.         
	Citigroup had preliminarily agreed to buy Wachovias banking operations in a government-backed deal.         
	The deal did not include a signed merger agreement, but Wachovia did sign an agreement to only negotiate with Citigroup through October 6.        
	On October 3, Wells Fargo announced that it had signed an agreement to buy the whole of Wachovia, including its asset management unit and retail brokerage, for about $15 billion.        
	Citigroup could have a real case, noting the exclusivity agreement and the fact that it had provided financial support to Wachovia last week.         
	Wells Fargo chairman Dick Kovacevich had earlier said, Were confident that this deal will go through.         
	He said that the companys lawyers were still reviewing the relevant documents.         
	Wells Fargo and Wachovia spokespersons could not be reached for comments.        
	Government aid        
	Citigroup, which has sustained about $60 billion of writedowns and losses during the credit crunch, planned to buy Wachovias banking assets with the help of the US government, including partial state guarantees on a $312-billion Wachovia loan book.        
	The deal is important for Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit, who is looking to turn around the ailing bank in part by focusing on stable businesses such as consumer banking.        
	Wells Fargo, the seventh largest US bank by assets, has managed to remain consistently profitable during the credit crunch. Its bid would not require government backing.        
	Regulators said they had not looked at the Wells Fargo bid. Under that bid, for each share of Wachovia, investors will receive 0.1991 of a Wells Fargo share, which is equal to $6.88 a share based on Wells Fargos closing price on October 5 of $34.56.

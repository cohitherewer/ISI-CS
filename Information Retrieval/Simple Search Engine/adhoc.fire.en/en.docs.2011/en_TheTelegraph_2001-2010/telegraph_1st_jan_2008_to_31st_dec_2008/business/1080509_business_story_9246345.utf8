          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 8: The governments decision to ban futures trade in four more commodities is unlikely to tame inflation, analysts said.        
	It is quite unfortunate that the government banned four items despite there being a strong evidence against futures trading driving up prices, Forward Markets Commission chairman B.C. Khatua said.         
	The government last night banned futures trading in rubber, soya oil, potato and chana amidst pressure from political parties, including the Left, who said speculative trading was resulting in the higher prices of food articles.         
	Analysts said that the move was taken probably with elections in mind.        
	According to Anand Raj, director, HEC International,Banning of rice and wheat in the futures market has not helped in restraining prices. The prices of these two essential commodities have climbed up even after the ban.        
	He emphasised that the government was doing this to save its face and the motive was purely political.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          H. A. Daruwalla in Calcutta on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, June 30: The Central Bank of India will raise Rs 500 crore to Rs 600 crore during the current financial year.        
	Though the bank has not yet decided on the particular instrument to raise funds, a second public issue of equity shares is very much on the agenda.         
	The bank needs cash to raise its capital adequacy above 11 per cent before implementing Basel II norms from April next year.         
	A second public issue is definitely what we are look into, Central Bank chairperson and managing director H. A. Daruwalla said.        
	But we cannot come out with a follow-on offer before August as our initial public offering was launched in August last year. Besides, we need the finance ministrys approval for this, she added.         
	According to Daruwalla, the fund-raising has to be cost-effective and the bank may use a basket of instruments, including perpetual bonds and equities, in cash chase.        
	The Central Bank chairperson said, Scheduled commercial banks, particularly public sector entities, are now facing twin challenges of implementing the debt waiver scheme and complying with Basel II norms.        
	To meet the Basel II norms, public sector banks need cash to maintain their risk-adjusted capital adequacy above 10 per cent.        
	Daruwalla was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) here today.        
	In contrast to Basel I accord, Basel II separates operational and credit risks. So banks will need more capital to cover both forms of risk. Besides, they will have to provide for market risks.        
	For the financial year ended March 31, 2008, the Central Bank clocked a 35.5 per cent growth in total business at Rs 1,84,607 crore and a 10.47 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 550.16 crore.        
	The bank is aiming a 20 per cent growth in advances and 23 per cent increase in deposits in the current financial year. While total deposits stood at Rs 1,10,320 crore as on March 31 this year, the banks gross advances were Rs 74,287 crore.

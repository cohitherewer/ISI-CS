The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Investors lose appetite for IPOs
                                                                                                            Investors lose appetite for IPOs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: The euphoria that had engulfed the primary capital market at the start of the year has started to dissipate  rapidly.        
	Wockhardt Hospitals today sought a two-day extension of its initial public offering (IPO) after attracting bids for just over 9.5 per cent of the 2.5 crore shares it had offered to the public.         
	The Rs 6,000-crore Emaar MGF issue also appeared to be struggling with the realty firm receiving bids for 40 per cent of the 10.25 crore shares on offer. The issue closes tomorrow and, although book runners say Emaar wont press for an extension, the situation looks pretty dicey.        
	The sudden loss of investor interest in IPOs comes barely two weeks after Kishore Biyanis Future Capital Holdings and Anil Ambanis Reliance Power were massively oversubscribed.        
	After the secondary market went into a freefall on fears of a looming recession in the US, the new issue market has been looking more and more like a game of Russian roulette.        
	Wockhardt had no choice but to extend the closing date of the issue by two days to February 7 with no sign of investor interest in the issue.        
	Wockhardt Hospitals, which floated its IPO on January 31, is offering its shares in the price band of Rs 225260.        
	We could not start our bidding process on the first day because of some technical setbacks. We had to extend the issue period by two days since the issue was not adequately subscribed. We hope that it will get a satisfactory response. If it still fails to evoke interest, we may have to cut the issue price, an official told The Telegraph.         
	At present, there are five companies that are seeking to raise money through bookbuilt issues. Besides Emaar MGF and Wockhardt Hospitals, IRB Infrastructure Developers, Tulsi Extrusions, and SVEC Constructions are hoping to stoke investor interest in their maiden issues.        
	Emaar MGF is offering shares in a price band of Rs 540-630. Experts say that the issue will meet the minimum subscription level of 80 per cent by the time it closes.        
	The turnaround has been sharp: less than two weeks ago, Reliance Power raised over Rs 11,760 crore when its issue of 22.8 crore shares was oversubscribed 70 times despite a high issue price of Rs 450 per share. Similarly, Future Capital Holdings IPO raised about Rs 490 crore through an issue of about 64.23 lakh equity shares at a price of Rs 765.         
	Market experts say investors have been spooked by the sudden slump in stock prices in the past two weeks and are scared that the new issues will not command a premium on listing. Others maintain that the IPOs receive a flood of subscriptions on the last day  and the phenomenon will continue.        
	It is surprising that Emaar MGF is struggling. It is a globally reputed company with fair valuations. The IPO is likely to be fully subscribed on the final day. If the IPO gets 80 per cent subscription, the underwriters will step in and stump up the rest, said a leading analyst.        
	Under the rules, if a company does not receive the minimum subscription of 90 per cent of the issue (including the sum that devolves on the syndicate of book runners and lead managers) within 60 days from the bid or issue closing date, the company will have to refund the entire amount it has collected.        
	Wockhardt does not look very attractive at this point in time. Moreover, the stipulated price band also looks to be a little too high for investors, considering the valuations of the company. The company may have to offer a 20 to 25 per cent discount if it fails to raise the minimum subscription, an analyst said.

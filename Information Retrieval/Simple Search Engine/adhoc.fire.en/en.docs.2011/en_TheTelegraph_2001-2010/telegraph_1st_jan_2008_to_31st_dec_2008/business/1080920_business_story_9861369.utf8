	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told the government to remain alert to the global financial crisis and ensure that it did not impact Indias growth.        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs met twice in the last 24 hours to discuss the crisis. The Prime Minister said we must stay alert to the global financial situation, rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said after the meeting.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram told his ministerial colleagues at the meeting that the crisis would not affect India. Most PSU banks had no exposure to Lehman Brothers, which went bust last Sunday, precipitating the crisis.         
	Following Chidambarams presentation, the Prime Minister said policy-makers must not let their guard down.        
	Inflation trend        
	Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, today said inflation might be coming under control after a reasonably comfortable harvest.         
	The panel has forecast inflation at 8-9 per cent by the end of March 2009, higher than the Reserve Bank of Indias estimate of 7 per cent.        
	Tendulkar said the government might be forced to spend more money in a pre-election year.         
	There are pressures on expenditure in the pre-election year. It is difficult to resist, he said.

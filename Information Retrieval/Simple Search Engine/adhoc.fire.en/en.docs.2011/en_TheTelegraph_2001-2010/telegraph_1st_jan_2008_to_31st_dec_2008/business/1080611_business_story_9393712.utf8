	Calcutta, June 10: Hindustan Motors Ltd (HM) will roll out its new model from the Uttarpara plant during the Durga Puja, which is in October.        
	The flagship company of the CK Birla group did not give further details but said the model was not likely to be part of its Mitsubishi alliance under which it produced the Ambassador and passenger cars from its Chennai unit for the Japanese conglomerate .        
	We hope to launch the vehicle during the Durga Puja. It will be rolled out from our Uttarpara plant. We expect it to significantly increase our market share, said Ravi Santhanam, managing director of HM. Santhanam declined to comment on the model or platform of the vehicle, saying the project could involve technology collaborations.        
	The auto major is working on an auto gas or LPG version of the Ambassador before the Pujas. HM, which currently sells around 12,000 cars a year, is also looking to introduce the Mitsubishi SUV Outlander by September from the Chennai facility. HM is keen on supplying components for the Nano project in Singur from its Uttarpara plant.        
	We supply through our castings, forgings and stamping brand to almost all national and a few global original equipment manufacturers said Moloy Chowdhury, executive vice-president of HM.

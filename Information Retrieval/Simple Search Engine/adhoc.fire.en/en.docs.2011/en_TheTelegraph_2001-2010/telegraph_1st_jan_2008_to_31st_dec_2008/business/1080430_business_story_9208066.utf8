The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Marginal pressure on lending rates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Marginal pressure on lending rates
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY AND VIVEK NAIR                          Little change                                  
	Calcutta/Mumbai, April 29: Banks may marginally raise their lending rates for car and personal loans, while home loans between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 30 lakh may get slightly cheaper.         
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced a hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  the percentage of net deposits that banks are required to keep in reserve with the Reserve Bank  by 25 basis points to 8.25 per cent with effect from May 24.         
	The increase in CRR from 7.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent in less than a fortnight means banks will have to keep an additional Rs 28,000 crore with the RBI and this money will not earn any interest, said Ashok Roy, general manager (treasury), United Bank of India.         
	This will reduce the return on capital for banks, which may put pressure on banks to selectively increase their lending rates. However, the rate increase, if any, will be marginal, he added.        
	According to Roy, any increase in lending rates may come in the retail sector because credit demand from the corporate sector has already slowed down.         
	Among retail loans, consumer durables, cars and personal loans are the most likely areas where lending rates may be increased.         
	ICICI Bank has increased its car and two-wheeler loans between 50 bps and 75 bps with effect from April 15. Kotak Mahindra Bank has increased its car loan rates by 50 basis points in two tranches during the last one month. HDFC Bank has also been contemplating raising its interest rates for car loans after the CRR hike on April 17.        
	Some institutional lending rates may also see a marginal increase, said a senior official at a private bank.         
	Our asset liability committee will meet during the second week of May and a decision on whether to increase our lending rates or not will be considered, said A.C. Mahajan, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank.         
	Canara Bank will also review its position next week when a decision on whether to increase lending rates will be taken, according to the banks chairman and managing director, M.B.N. Rao.        
	However, home loans above Rs 20 lakh and below Rs 30 lakh may become cheaper. The RBI has lowered the risk-weight for home loans between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 30 lakh to 50 per cent from 75 per cent earlier. This means that banks will have to keep aside less capital for giving loans in that bracket.         
	This is a very welcome step and banks may pass on the benefits to borrowers. However, the savings in the cost of capital wont be significant and hence the reduction, if any, in the interest rate for home loans above Rs 20 lakh and up to Rs 30 lakh wont be much, Mahajan said.        
	We are yet to take a call on this subject. However, the relief could be passed on, a senior official from a nationalised bank said.        
	We will continue to monitor the evolving market liquidity conditions and our cost of funds before taking any decision on interest rates, Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director of ICICI Bank, said.         
	The policy is a well-balanced one, curbing demand pressures to go along with the various supply side measures that have been initiated by the government over the past few weeks, said Gautam Vir, managing director of Development Credit Bank.

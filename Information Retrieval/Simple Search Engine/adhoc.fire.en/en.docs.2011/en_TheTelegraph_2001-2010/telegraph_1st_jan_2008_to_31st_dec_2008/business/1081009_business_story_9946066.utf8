          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The cabinet today approved amendments to the Indian Trust Act of 1882, paving the way for a fund injection from trusts into shares.        
	A bill to amend section 20 of the act will be introduced in the next session of Parliament as investment options provided in the act are no longer relevant. The investment options mentioned in the act mostly refer to securities prior to Independence and issued by British governor-generals.        
	The Law Commission had asked the government not to enumerate particular securities but to give a general definition of all categories of securities which are in vogue in the market.        
	The amendment will open up a new investment gateway for trusts, thereby helping in capital appreciation, mobilisation of funds in the economy and the optimum utilisation of resources. The investment options could include shares, scrips, bonds and debentures.         
	The cabinet also decided to extend the time limit to implement the Rs 16,978-crore rehabilitation package for suicide-prone districts of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh till September 2011.        
	The package, which was announced on September 29, 2006, involving an outlay of Rs 16,978 crore, comprising Rs 10,579 crore as subsidy and Rs 6,399 crore as loan, was to be implemented within a period of three years, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A money exchanger in Patna on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 29: After the capital market regulators slew of measures to develop the countrys corporate bond market, now the finance ministry itself has stepped in with its action plans for ameliorating the condition of bond market by simplifying investments in such financial instruments.         
	To expand the market for corporate bonds, the finance minister has proposed to enhance the tradability of domestic convertible bonds by putting in place a mechanism that will enable investors to separate the embedded equity option from the convertible bond and trade it separately.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram in his budget said that the government would also take appropriate measures to develop the bond, currency and derivatives markets, which would include the launching of exchange-traded currency and interest rate futures and developing a transparent credit derivatives market with necessary safeguards.         
	The bond market in India is relatively very small when compared to the global standards. Exchange traded currency and interest rate futures will boost the financial market. Stripping the equity portion off the convertible bond will enhance the liquidity in the equity market, and will attract the investors to put money into debt instruments because they will have an option of participating in the equity market at a later date. There is also not enough transparency in the corporate bond market. So, I believe it will be important for the regulator to set up adequate monitoring systems for maintaining transparency Mr R.Venkatanathan, vice-president and head of debt market, Karvy Stock Broking Ltd, told The Telegraph.         
	The steps taken in the budget will allow the corporates to raise money through debt papers instead of term loans. This will particularly be easier because the secondary market will then decide the yield and risks in the respective debt instruments, Venkatanathan said.         
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India has recently taken a number of steps to develop the corporate debt market through simplifying the issue processes and bringing in more transparency.         
	Despite these initiatives, the corporate bond market has not witnessed any significant improvement till now. The market capitalisation of corporate bonds has risen by 38 per cent to Rs 68,074 crore this year.         
	In the case of government bonds, market capitalisation increased only 11.6 per cent to Rs 13,18,419 crore.         
	Although government bonds still account for over 95 per cent of the bond market, the share of corporate bonds is expected to increase as corporate issuances are expected to grow at a much faster rate.                           
	We have enough talents in India to make the proposed plans of the finance minister successful in the Indian capital market scenario. Separating the equity portion from convertible bonds will eventually increase the liquidity in the system, and will improve price discovery mechanism, V.K. Sharma, head of research, Anagram Stock Broking said.        
	Market experts believe that investor education can play a crucial role in developing the corporate bond market. Most of the investors stay away from the bond market due to the fact that they do not fully understand the risks of investing in debt markets, unlike in the case of equity market. Although the proposals made by the finance minister, if implemented with diligence could help improving the bond market, it would be essential for the regulator to set up adequate surveillance systems to maintain the transparency in corporate debt system.

	Mumbai, April 28: The spectre of inflation isnt going to disappear in a hurry.        
	A day ahead of announcing its monetary policy for 2008-09, the Reserve Bank of India today said the risks to inflation came from high oil and global food prices.        
	In a report titled macroeconomic and monetary developments in 2007-08, it said there was a slight ray of hope: consumer price inflation is expected to moderate in 2009 to 4 per cent from a provisional figure of 5.2 per cent in 2008.        
	This may be good news, but the central bank warned that global food prices could spark high inflation.         
	The supply side pressures on global food prices do not appear to be abating, especially with the global stock of major crops at historical lows, the report said.        
	Quoting the US Department of Agriculture, it added that global wheat stocks were expected to decline further by almost 10 per cent during 2007-08  the lowest level since 1981-82. Global oilseed stocks are also expected to come down.        
	The situation on the crude oil front is also not comforting. Despite prospects for slower consumption growth in advanced economies, international crude prices are expected to remain at elevated levels in view of the relatively tight demand supply-balance.        
	High and volatile international crude oil prices, thus, pose a major risk to the global inflation outlook, the RBI said.         
	Pointing out that firm crude oil prices have not been fully passed on here, the central bank said inflation risks on account of oil prices remained incipient.        
	Analysts feel that the central banks outlook indicates that it can continue to take monetary measures to control inflation.         
	Bankers are, however, divided on whether RBI will raise the repo rate tomorrow. It has already raised the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points on April 17 to suck out excess liquidity.        
	The report said that during 2007-08, there was some moderation in the growth momentum of the Indian economy though it continued to expand at a robust pace for the fifth consecutive year.         
	Real GDP growth rate moderated to 8.7 per cent in 2007-08 from 9.6 per cent in 2006-07. The moderation in growth occurred in agriculture, industry and services.        
	Despite the moderation, growth performance was in tune with the average real GDP growth of 8.7 per cent per annum during the five-year period, 2003-04 to 2007-08.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Satyam volte-face on Maytas deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 17: Satyam Computer Services today called off its $1.6-billion acquisition of two promoter-owned companies  Maytas Properties and Maytas Infrastructure  in a flip-flop that was as sudden as its audacious announcement yesterday which had sparked howls of protest from minority shareholders.        
	The company appeared to have buckled under a groundswell of shareholder activism that was evident at a late night conference call on Tuesday.        
	In deference to the views expressed by many investors, we have decided to call off the acquisition, the company informed the bourses.        
	However, the decision was also prompted by the fact that the companys stock was clobbered today after investors mauled its American Depositary Receipts yesterday.        
	The announcement calling off the deal was made before markets opened for trading but that didnt help the Satyam stock, which was hammered in hectic trading.        
	On the BSE, the stock slumped 30 per cent to close at Rs 158.05 today after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 153.80. This marked a fall of Rs 68.45 from its previous close. The market capitalisation of company plunged to Rs 10,650 crore from almost Rs 15,250 crore.        
	Brokers said the steep fall in its share price was because of wide ranging concerns, including corporate governance issues.         
	They said the proposed diversification into construction was an indication that the management was no longer confident about the future prospects of Satyams core IT business. There was also fear that Satyam Computer might not win big outsourcing contracts because of the development.        
	We have been surprised by the market reaction to this decision even though we were quite positive about the merits of the acquisition, Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said. He added that the company would look at ways to share cash in its books, which analysts estimate to be $1.3 billion.        
	Brokerages and analysts piled pressure on the Satyam stock by asking investors to dump the shares even after the managements climbdown.        
	Many of them said the damage had been done and that any future shareholder friendly actions by the Satyam management could do little to restore investor confidence. It is now being speculated that Satyam could come forward with an attractive buyback proposal or a special dividend to win back the confidence of minority shareholders.        
	Questions around Satyams corporate governance policies are ill-timed, coming amid continuing downslide in sector-wide business fundamentals, Bhavtosh Vajpayee of CLSA said in a report titled Damage Done. CLSA now has a sell rating on the stock from under-perform earlier.        
	Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president at Karvy, said the cancellation of the Maytas acquisition could be attributed to shareholder activism.        
	The Maytas Infra scrip tumbled 20 per cent to Rs 388.25 on worries that all was not hunky dory with the firm.         
	Questions are now being raised on the Rs 11,814-crore Hyderabad metro rail project in which Maytas-Navabharat-Ital Thai (Thailand) and IL amp;FS emerged as the lowest bidder. It is speculated that Maytas was under pressure to raise funds before March-June 2009 for financial closure.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Feb. 1: ICICI Bank has shelved plans to divest a stake in a holding company that was to be created for its insurance and mutual fund businesses, after it failed to get approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the same.
    
	Last year, the bank had decided to transfer its shareholding in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and ICICI Prudential Trust to a new subsidiary called ICICI Financial Services.
    
	The arrangement was subject to regulatory and other approvals from the RBI, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. The plan was to terminate failing the receipt of all approvals within a mutually agreed date. 
    
	As the agreed date has elapsed and this requirement has not been satisfied, the arrangement stands terminated, the bank said.
    
	Sources close to the bank said barring the central bank, other authorities had given their approval. They added that ICICI Banks plan to form a holding company remained intact and it would look out for investors after obtaining all necessary approvals.
    
	In June last year, ICICI Bank had announced that five investors would be picking up a 5.9 per cent stake in the holding company for Rs 2,650 crore. The stake purchase valued the company at Rs 44,600 crore on a post-issue basis. Though ICICI Bank did not divulge the identity of these investors, unconfirmed reports put them as Temasek, Government of Singapore Investment Corp, Crown Capital, Capital International and Legatum Capital.
    
	ICICI Bank had decided to establish the holding company as RBI regulations stipulated that a bank could only invest 20 per cent of its net worth in subsidiary companies.

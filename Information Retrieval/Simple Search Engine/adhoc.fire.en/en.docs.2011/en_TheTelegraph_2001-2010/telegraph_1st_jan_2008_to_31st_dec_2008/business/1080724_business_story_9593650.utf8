          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mehta in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 23: Mahindra Renault, the joint venture between Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) and French car maker Renault, plans to export its mid-sized sedan Logan by the end of this year.        
	The company also plans to launch the CNG version of the Logan in the next 2-3 months, which is expected to sport a price tag of Rs 5 lakh.        
	There are opportunities for exporting the Logan to the neighbouring countries and South Africa. By this year, we will start exporting the entire range of Logan, said Nalin Mehta, chief operating officer, Mahindra Renault.        
	He said the company would export the vehicle to countries where M amp;M and Renault have a strong presence and would utilise the existing dealership networks of the two manufacturers.        
	On the label of the sedan in the overseas market, Mehta said it would depend on the markets it was sold.         
	In India, it is sold as Mahindra Renault Logan.        
	It can be under the Renault badge in markets where the French firm had a strong presence or it can be Mahindra-Renault in the new markets, he said.        
	On the companys product launch plans, Mehta said, In the next two to three months, we plan to launch the CNG version of the Logan.        
	The CNG car will be costlier by Rs 45,000 than the normal Logan, he said.         
	Mahindra Renault today launched the limited edition of the Logan in the country, priced between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.15 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi).        
	The new car, Logan Edge, will be available in both the petrol and diesel variants with engine capacities in the range of 1.4-1.6 litres.         
	Mehta said the company was also widening its dealer network with plans to add 54 dealers across the country and an equal number of cities within a span of a little over one year.        
	At present, the company has 94 dealers in 72 cities.

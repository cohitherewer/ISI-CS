          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 30: Two-wheeler maker Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) today launched its 125cc sports bike, the CBF Stunner, in the country.        
	HMSI aims to increase its two-wheeler sales to about 10 lakh units in the current financial year. The company also plans to launch high-end bikes (above 800cc) in fiscal 2009-10.        
	There will be one or two more launches in this financial year. We also expect our bikes above the 800cc category to be launched in 2009-10, which will be priced above Rs 10 lakh, said N.K Rattan, divisional head (sales and marketing) of HMSI.         
	The company will import these high-performance bikes as completely built units, he added.        
	Priced between Rs 47,070 and Rs 51,655 (ex-showroom, Delhi), the CBF Stunner will be available in three variants and four colours and will be launched across the country next month.        
	Honda aims to sell about 80,000 units of this new bike in the current financial year.         
	The company sold 9.07 lakh units in the previous fiscal. In the current fiscal, the company has set a target of selling three lakh motorcycles and seven lakh scooters.         
	Honda, however, has decided to go slow on its plans to set up a new manufacturing facility.         
	Currently, our production capacity is 1.2 million units, but it can be stretched to 1.35 million units. So, we can use this facility for the next two to three years. As of now, we do not have any plans to set up a new facility, he said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vodafone ready to ring in iPhone
          OUR BUREAU                                                Music to the ear      
	New Delhi/Mumbai, May 6: Gizmo lovers no longer need to plough the grey market for the much desired Apple iPhone. Vodafone will launch the device in India in the first week of September.        
	We have signed an agreement with Apple to sell the iPhone in ten of its markets around the globe, Vodafone said in a statement.        
	Later this year, Vodafone customers in India, Australia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa and Turkey will be able to buy the smartphone and use it on the Vodafone network, the statement added.        
	Although Vodafone will initially be the exclusive iPhone service provider in India, industry analysts do not rule out the possibility of Apple extending universal access to all major telecom service providers in the country.         
	According to sources, the 8GB version of the device will be priced at around Rs 28,000.         
	The multimedia smartphone is available in the local grey market at a price of Rs 20,000-22,000. However, if illegally bought, the phone has to be unlocked, which costs around Rs 1,500.         
	Moreover, no battery replacement is available here. If the battery has to be replaced, the iPhone must be sent back to the manufacturer in the US, which is not possible if it is bought from the grey market.        
	The iPhone is now legally available in the US, Britain, France, Germany, Ireland and Austria.        
	The phone, dubbed the invention of the year 2007 by the Time magazine, has a multi-touch display and a 2-megapixel digital camera. It has a virtual keypad and buttons. The phone also offers TV feeds, e-mail, internet surfing, Wi-Fi connectivity, iTunes music store and a map-based location guide. According to sources, Apple will first launch the 8GB version of the iPhone. The 16GB model will be launched in the summer of 2009 depending on buyers response.        
	Vodafone will share a percentage of sales with Apple. However, the company did not disclose any details on the revenue-share model.         
	Apple claims to have shipped four million phones until this January since their US launch in June 2007. Apple chief Steve Jobs aims to sell 10 million units by December 2008.         
	Apple plan        
	Apple India plans to open a second branch of its exclusive product station, the iStore, in Bangalore to meet the growing demand for iPods and the Mac Book Air workstation launched earlier this year. The company plans to launch a third iStore in Chennai this August.         
	STD tariff         
	Vodafone today slashed the tariffs for STD to Rs 1.30 a minute across the country while roaming charges have been dropped to Re 1 for all incoming and local outgoing calls. Last week Bharti had dropped STD tariffs to Rs 1.50 a minute. The new tariffs took effect today, a company statement said.

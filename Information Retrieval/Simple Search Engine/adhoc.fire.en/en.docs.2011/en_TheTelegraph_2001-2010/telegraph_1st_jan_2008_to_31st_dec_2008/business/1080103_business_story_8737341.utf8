The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of softer rates to boost credit offtake
                                                                                                            Hint of softer rates to boost credit offtake
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Recheck                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The finance ministry is considering steps to check the slowdown in bank credit offtake and may favour softer interest rates for the coming fiscal.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram has called a meeting of state-run bank chiefs later this week to discuss the slowdown in credit offtake.        
	Priority sector lending and the rise in bad loans of public sector banks will also be discussed.        
	Bank credit growth has slowed down to 22 per cent from 30 per cent in the previous fiscal. Home loan growth has also come down from 38.3 per cent to 24.6 per cent in the first nine months of this fiscal.         
	Many expect this meeting to signal a softening in lending rates during the next fiscal.         
	According to officials, many farm loans had turned sticky and this was a cause for concern, especially as the government was planning a big farm credit package for the coming budget.        
	Officials said the government did not feel that the recent bull run on bourses was fuelled by any undesirable investment flows.         
	Chidambaram has said buoyancy in the stock markets reflected the performance of corporate houses and small and medium enterprises. He feels the markets are extremely well regulated and reflect the good corporate performance of the last 2-3 years.         
	In the current year also, corporate performance is very good. If you want one indicator of good corporate performance, look at the corporate income taxes. If you have a good corporate performance, why will you like the stock market to be sluggish, he said.         
	Top North Block officials said since apprehensions were voiced about the possibility of terror funds invading stock markets, the market regulator as well as revenue intelligence slueths have been active in scrutinising flows.         
	Till date, only a single suspicious case has been detected, they said.

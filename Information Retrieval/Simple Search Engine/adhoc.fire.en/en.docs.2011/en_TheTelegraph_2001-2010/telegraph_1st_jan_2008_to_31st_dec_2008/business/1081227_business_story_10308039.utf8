          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Green signal                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The government today cleared an integrated energy policy that emphasises the optimum use of resources, acquisition of assets abroad and three-stage development of nuclear energy.        
	It has been decided to set up a monitoring committee headed by the cabinet secretary to review the progress of the policys implementation, home minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after a meeting of the cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	The policy seeks to make energy markets more competitive and subsidy disbursal transparent.         
	It will also try to ensure that pricing and resource allocation are determined by market forces.        
	India needs to sustain an economic growth of at least 9 per cent over the next 25 years ... It is necessary to evolve an integrated energy policy that provides a coherent framework covering different energy sources in a consistent manner, he said.        
	In August 2006, an expert committee headed by Kirit S. Parikh, a member of the Planning Commission, had submitted a report on the proposed integrated energy policy.         
	Based on that report, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had directed the Planning Commission to address various issues, including consistency in different energy forms, energy security, research and development, environmental concerns and conservation.        
	As India is likely to be import-dependent for its energy needs, making it vulnerable to international price changes, the policy emphasises the acquisition of energy assets abroad to help the country achieve the target of 9 per cent economic growth.        
	The report said, While the government must aggressively support acquisition of energy assets overseas, companies active in this field must be forced to securitise the assets with international funding.        
	Cover drive        
	The government today approved Rs 350 crore for increasing the insurance cover to small and medium exporters, besides those engaged in industries facing a slowdown amid threats of defaults by overseas buyers.        
	The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved an allocation of Rs 350 crore to the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India, which will increase the risk cover to medium and small enterprises from 85 per cent to 95 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 3: The government today decided to withdraw tax refunds on cement exports, which it had allowed yesterday, leaving the industry puzzled.        
	We are surprised and confused by the government action, H. M. Bangur, president of the Cement Manufacturers Association, told The Telegraph. The directorate general of foreign trade revoked yesterdays notification which had restored the duty entitlement passbook scheme on cement exports. The amendments stand withdrawn with effect from June 2 itself, the notification said. Officials said the government, fighting inflation at 8.1 per cent, withdrew the tax refund scheme to increase the domestic availability of cement.        
	The passbook scheme enables cement exporters to get a refund on local taxes, which is about 4 per cent of the product export cost. The government recently eased the ban on cement by allowing it through Gujarat ports.

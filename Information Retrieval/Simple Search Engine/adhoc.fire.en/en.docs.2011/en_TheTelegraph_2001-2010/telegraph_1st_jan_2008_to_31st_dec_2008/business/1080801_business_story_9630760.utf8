          OUR BUREAU                          Faring well                                  
	July 31: Tata Steel today posted a better-than-expected first-quarter result with net profit up 21.8 per cent to Rs 1,488.40 crore compared with Rs 1,222.11 crore a year ago.         
	Total income of the worlds sixth largest steel company has increased to Rs 6,177.25 crore for the three months ended June 30 from Rs 4,305.33 crore a year ago. Before this announcement, Tata Steel shares closed 3.95 per cent higher at Rs 654.95.         
	The companys net profit margin went down substantially to 24.14 per cent compared with 29.11 per cent in the same period last year. Tata Steels diluted earning per share stood at Rs 18.11 in the first quarter.         
	The results were not impacted by the restriction imposed on the company against increasing steel prices, though raw material costs went up substantially.        
	R-Com show        
	Reliance Communications (R-Com) has posted a 23.9 per cent increase in net profit for the quarter ended June 2008.        
	The companys net profit was up from Rs 1,220 crore from the June quarter last year to Rs 1,512 crore.        
	It recorded a jump of 23.7 per cent in revenues, up from Rs 4,304 crore to Rs 5,322 crore.        
	R-Com chairman Anil Ambani announced his company had earmarked capital expenditure of Rs 40,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore for 2008-09.        
	Of this, around $1 billion would be spent on the GSM rollout alone, said company officials.        
	R-Com would begin the GSM rollout in the remaining 14 circles by the end of 2008, and the exercise would be completed by the middle of 2009.        
	Despite the breakdown in takeover talks with MTN, R-Com is committed to organic and inorganic growth, Ambani said.        
	The company was looking for an appropriate time to float the Reliance Globalcom and the Reliance Infratel IPOs, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 22: HDFC Bank and Centurion Bank of Punjab today said their boards would meet tomorrow to consider a possible merger between them.        
	The merger is likely to be an all-stock deal, and the size will be the biggest till date in domestic banking.         
	The combined entity could have a market capitalisation of about Rs 63,000 crore, based on their current market values.        
	Centurion Bank of Punjab (CBoP) is currently the tenth most valued bank in the country with a market capitalisation of about Rs 10,500 crore, while HDFC Bank is the third most valued at over Rs 52,000 crore.        
	HDFC Bank is the countrys second largest private sector lender, while CBoP is the fourth largest. HDFC Bank has about 746 branches across the country, while CBoP has 394 branches.        
	CBoPs major shareholders include Bank of Muscat, HSBC Finance and Sabre Capital. Bank of Muscat holds the maximum equity of 14 per cent in the bank.        
	Rana Talwar-promoted Sabre Capital holds about 3.4 per cent stake in the bank.        
	Following the inorganic route of growth, CBoP had in the past acquired the Bank of Punjab and Lord Krishna Bank. HDFC Bank had earlier acquired Times Bank.        
	Sources said that both the banks would appoint valuers, who would suggest the share swap ratio. Though many synergies exist between the two entities, bankers feel the merger will be more beneficial to HDFC Bank.        
	To begin with, the merger will consolidate its ranking as the countrys third-largest bank even as its position will be strengthened in the northern and southern regions of the country.        
	Shares of HDFC Bank today closed down 4.4 per cent at Rs 1,474.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while the CBoP scrip closed at Rs 56.40, a fall of 1.14 per cent from the previous close.        
	Yesterday, shares of CBoP gained 14.44 per cent to close at Rs 57.05. At the same time, shares of HDFC Bank settled up 0.55 per cent at Rs 1,542.90 on the BSE.        
	HDFC Bank has a promoter holding of 23.28 per cent, held jointly by HDFC Ltd, HDFC Investments and HDFC Holdings. The bank has a 26.57 per cent FII holding, while local mutual funds and insurance firms own 3.39 per cent and 2.81 per cent, respectively.        
	The possible merger will create a bank with a branch network of over 1,154 branches and 2,300 ATMs. It will also have a balancesheet size in excess of Rs 1,71,000 crore.

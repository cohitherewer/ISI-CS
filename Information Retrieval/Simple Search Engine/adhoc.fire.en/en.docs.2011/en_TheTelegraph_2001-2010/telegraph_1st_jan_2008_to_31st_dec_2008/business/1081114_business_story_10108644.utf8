          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Global auto component major AB SKF has postponed the building of a plant at Hardwar because of a slowdown in demand.        
	SKF plans to set up two plants, at Hardwar and in Ahmedabad, at an investment of Rs 450 crore.         
	According to Rakesh Makhija, managing director, SKF India, Our plant in Ahmedabad will entail an investment of Rs 300 crore and is expected to start production in the second quarter of the next calendar year.         
	However, work at our Hardwar facility will start in early 2010. The work on this plant was initially supposed to start this year, but since there is a slowdown in demand, we want to wait and watch the situation, Makhija said.        
	The company has earmarked Rs 150 crore for the Hardwar facility, which will make automotive bearings.         
	At present, SKF has three plants in India  one in Pune and two in Bangalore.         
	Tom Johnstone, president and CEO, AB SKF, said, We feel the current market demand can be met by our facilities in Bangalore and Pune.        
	He said the global slowdown had impacted the company, which had to shut down one of its North American plants. The impact was also felt in India. In the third quarter of this year, we had parted ways with 100 temporary workers, he said.        
	SKF had reported an after-tax profit of Rs 37 crore in the third quarter.

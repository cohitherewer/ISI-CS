The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt works on airline bailout plan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt works on airline bailout plan
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                           Signs of relief                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: A high-powered government panel is considering proposals to bail out the ailing aviation sector.         
	Under discussion are changes in the norms for flying to foreign destinations and investment policy, along with the possibility of sales tax relief.        
	One of the proposals being considered is to relax the five-year-experience criterion for budget airlines to fly abroad. Government rules specify that airlines must operate in the domestic market for five years before getting permission to fly abroad.        
	Flying to viable international routes will help the airlines recover their losses and enable them to refuel at cheaper rates. Airlines in India pay an eight per cent excise duty on jet fuel, which is much higher than other Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka, and a sales tax that is as high as 30 per cent in some states.         
	Top civil aviation ministry officials said that a proposal to relax the experience norm on a case-by-case basis had been thought of.        
	However, while the finance ministry and the Planning Commission are in favour of the proposal, the move was likely to be opposed by existing players flying abroad as they did not want competition to eat into their earnings.         
	Another proposal is to raise the limit of foreign investment in the airlines, which is expected to report combined losses of over Rs 8,000 crore this year on top of Rs 4,000-crore losses in the last fiscal.         
	Current rules allow up to 49 per cent foreign equity participation and bar foreign airlines from investing directly or indirectly in Indian airlines.         
	The officials would like this rule to be relaxed to help the airlines gain access to funds which they needed not only to stay afloat but also to fund their fleet expansion plans.         
	In a tight money market, the airlines are trying to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore to fund their ongoing fleet expansion plans and for working capital requirements.        
	Air India, alone, wants the government to pump in over Rs 2,000 crore in equity, soft loans and bridge loans to fund its aircraft purchase and as working capital.         
	Sales tax move        
	In sales tax on jet fuel, the Prime Ministers Office has backed the attempts of the civil aviation ministry to persuade the state governments to cut the tax to a uniform four per cent.         
	The tax is the highest in Gujarat, at 30 per cent, followed by Tamil Nadu, at 29 per cent, and Madhya Pradesh, at 28.5 per cent.        
	The officials feel the states can agree to cut taxes provided the airlines were willing to pass on the waiver to passengers in the form of lower fares and agree to retain schedules in various cities.        
	The airlines did not reduce fares when state-owned oil marketing companies had cut jet fuel prices by 16 per cent on August 31.         
	Analysts had said the airlines were unlikely to reduce fares because of the heavy losses they were incurring on account of increases in jet fuel prices in the past. Airlines officials had said they wanted the price to stabilise before taking a decision on a fare cut.

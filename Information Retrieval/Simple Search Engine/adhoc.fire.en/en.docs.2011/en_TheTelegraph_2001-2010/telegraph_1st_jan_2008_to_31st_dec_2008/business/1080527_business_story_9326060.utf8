          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Bajaj in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, May 26: The demerger process at Bajaj Auto was completed today when the two-wheeler major was re-listed on the stock exchanges. Bajaj Finserv, which comprises the insurance and finance businesses, also made its debut on the bourses.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Bajaj Auto Ltd, which includes the automobile business, opened at Rs 945. However, the scrip could not hold on to these levels and ended the day at Rs 604.50, a fall of 36 per cent from its opening.        
	According to market observers, the stock was weighed down by worries over the two-wheeler industry.         
	In its old form, Bajaj Auto had last traded on March 13 at a little over Rs 2,101.        
	New firm Bajaj Finserv was listed at Rs 999, but soon came under pressure. After hitting an intra-day low of Rs 503.15 on the BSE, it finished at Rs 514.65.        
	Bajaj Holdings amp; Investment, which owns a little over 30 per cent each in Bajaj Auto and Bajaj FinServ, is already listed on the exchanges. It also closed lower at Rs 598.25.         
	Speaking to journalists at the listing ceremony of Bajaj Finserv, managing director Sanjiv Bajaj said the company would take a final decision on setting up an asset management firm by October. We are studying the business right now and are in talks with a few parties for a joint venture. By October, we will decide whether or not to get into the AMC business, he said. Bajaj added that the company would pick a partner in the next few months if it went ahead with this venture.        
	Group chairman Rahul Bajaj, who rang the opening bell to mark the re-listing of Bajaj Auto on the BSE, echoed his son Rajivs views when he said this year would be challenging. He however, added that the company would seek to grow its exports.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, June 23: The government has asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review termination charges  a move that could dent the profits of mobile companies while reducing tariffs for customers.         
	Termination charges are paid by an operator from whose network a call originates to an operator on whose network the call terminates. For instance, if a Reliance Communications (R-Com) customer calls a Bharti Airtel customer, R-Com will have to pay Bharti for the call. At present, the charges have been fixed at 30 paise per minute.        
	Given the central aim of the telecom policy to provide services at affordable rates, it is suggested that a review of the mobile termination charges, based on present and projected cost and traffic, is undertaken by Trai on a priority basis in a time-bound manner, the department of telecom (DoT) said in a letter to Trai.        
	The DoT said since the charges were fixed in 2003 and the cost of network and services had come down by more than 50 per cent since then, there could be some scope for reducing the fee.        
	The termination charge depends on traffic, and the high increase in traffic must translate into the reduction of charges, DoT officials said.        
	The charges are meant to compensate a service provider for the cost of receiving a call as in India no charges are levied on customers receiving a call.        
	Analysts said the DoTs move had been triggered by a tariff scheme announced by Virgin Mobile which pays customers 10 paise per minute for each incoming call. The Virgin service was launched in partnership with Tata Teleservices Limited.        
	The DoTs logic is that if Virgin Mobile is paying customers for incoming calls, then the call termination charges it receives may be adequate to cover its costs.        
	One of the major components of tariff is the termination charge, which is not decided by market forces. High termination charges have the potential to stifle competition and may disturb the level-playing field, said DoT officials.        
	A cut in the termination fee will lead to a reduction in payouts of operators, making the tariffs more viable in a competitive environment, the DoT added.        
	Some operators feel the DoTs cost-based charges will be less than Rs 0.10 a minute. If implemented, existing operators will have to forego a substantial portion of their revenues, while new operators will find it easy to gain a foothold in the market.        
	Mobile phone companies are estimated to mop up around Rs 1,200 crore every quarter through call termination charges alone.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Fall season                          
	Mumbai, June 30: The countrys current account deficit fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 from the preceding quarter as continued growth in invisibles offset the rising trade gap, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.        
	Revealing the countrys balance of payments picture for the last quarter of 2007-08 and the year as a whole, the RBI said Indias current account deficit fell to $1.04 billion in the January-March quarter from a deficit of over $5.11 billion in the October-December period. A current account deficit occurs when imports of goods and services are more than exports.        
	Merchandise exports grew 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 compared with 16.7 per cent in the same period of 2006-07.         
	Import payments, however, rose 37.2 per cent in the January-March period against 14.7 per cent last year.        
	While there was significant growth in oil imports at 88.9 per cent compared with 5.3 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, non-oil imports rose 30.6 per cent from 21.4 per cent during the period.        
	The RBI said the key drivers of growth in non-oil imports were capital goods, coal, coke, chemicals and fertilisers. The sharp increase in oil imports reflected the impact of the rising price of the Indian basket of international crude, comprising a mix of Oman, Dubai and Brent varieties.         
	The price of the Indian basket of crude rose to $93.9 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 compared with $56.4 per barrel in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	However, invisible receipts increased to 26.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 from 25.6 per cent, while payments recorded growth of 20 per cent against 52.7 per cent in the year-ago period.         
	The rise in invisible surplus to $22.8 billion in the fourth quarter from $17.1 billion reflected growth in export of software services and travel receipts, and inward remittances from overseas Indians. According to the RBI, net capital inflows rose substantially to $25.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $15.6 billion in the same period last year.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: The stock meltdown had a spillover effect on the foreign exchange and the bullion markets as well. 
    
	The rupee today fell 26 paise to 39.55/56 against the dollar, its lowest in almost a month. 
    
	We have already seen the spillover effect on the rupee today, said U. Venkat Raman, head of treasury at IDBI Bank.
    
	Continued FII pullout kept the rupee under pressure, a dealer with a foreign bank said.
    
	Foreign institutional investors, mainly those who suffered mortgage-related losses in the US, reportedly made large withdrawals from the equity market today, the dealer added.
    
	Earlier last week, the rupee resisted the pressure following heavy capital inflows through the IPO route. The rupee is expected to remain under pressure because of continued outflows.
    
	The Indian currency had surged by more than 12 per cent last year on the back of sustained portfolio inflows in Asias fastest growing economy.
    
	Indian gold futures are also seen extending losses, possibly falling below Rs 11,000 per 10 grams this week, as investors lock profits and tumbling global stock markets trigger all-around nervousness, analysts said.

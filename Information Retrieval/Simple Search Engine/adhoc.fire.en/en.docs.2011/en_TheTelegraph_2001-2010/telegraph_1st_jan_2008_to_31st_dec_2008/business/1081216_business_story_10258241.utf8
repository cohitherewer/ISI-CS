	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Encouraged by robust sales in mid-income housing, real estate giant DLF today said it would invest Rs 15,000 crore over the next three years to develop residential projects in the Rs 15-40 lakh range.        
	DLF had last year announced its plan to enter mid-income housing. We will be investing Rs 5,000 crore a year over the next three years on mid-income housing projects, DLF Home Developers vice-president A. Harikesh said.        
	Mid-income homes will see significant growth in the coming quarters, he said.        
	Internal accruals, advances against sales and capital raised through private equity will take care of the planned investment, he said.

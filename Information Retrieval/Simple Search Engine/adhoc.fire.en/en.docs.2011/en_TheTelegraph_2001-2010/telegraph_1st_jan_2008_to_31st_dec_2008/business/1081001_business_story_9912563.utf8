	New York, Sept. 30 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush eased pressure on financial markets on Tuesday with assurances that a $700-billion bailout for the financial sector can be revived, but the crisis spread further through European banks.        
	The dollar rallied and US stocks recovered 3 per cent after suffering their blackest day in 20 years on Monday as the US House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan.        
	The White House, treasury secretary Henry Paulson, Congressional leaders and the two candidates hoping to succeed Bush as President, John McCain and Barack Obama, kept up a steady drumbeat of support for the plan, and around the world markets stabilised.        
	Theres an overarching belief that at some point this week, whether its Wednesday or Thursday, well get something passed by the House, said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies amp; Co in Boston.        
	But global money markets remained frozen, and London interbank offered rates shot to record levels, indicating banks were not lending to each other. The rate for overnight dollar loans rose to nearly 6.9 per cent from just over 2.5 per cent on Monday.        
	I assure our citizens and citizens around the world that this is not the end of the legislative process, Bush said.        
	From Dublin to Moscow, the financial crisis was an ominous presence. Ireland unveiled a blanket guarantee for savings held by its banks, and for the second time in a month Russia briefly shut down its stock markets.        
	France, Belgium and Luxembourg poured 6.4 billion euros into Franco-Belgian bank Dexia to avoid defaults on its loans, and France promised new bank measures to help savers.        
	Shares of British bank HBOS Plc fell on fears that Lloyds TSB Group Plc could renegotiate a deal to buy HBOS.        
	Wall Street stocks rose as investors bet the bailout package would be approved by the US Congress this week. The dollar rose against the yen and oil rebounded.

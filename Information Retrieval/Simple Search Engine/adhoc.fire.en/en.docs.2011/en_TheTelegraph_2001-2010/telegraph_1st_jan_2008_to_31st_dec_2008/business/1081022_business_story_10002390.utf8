          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The government may exceed its borrowing target for 2008-09 as it prepares to stimulate the economy by spending more.         
	Though officials could not put a number, they said the extra amount would not be more than Rs 25,000 crore, meaning the government would certainly exceed the fiscal deficit target of 2.5 per cent set in the budget. The government today won a vote for a supplementary demand for grants.         
	For 2008-09, the targeted borrowing is Rs 1,45,000 crore. The government has already raised Rs 1,06,000 crore through bond sales in the first six months.        
	Listing the items for the supplementary demand, the government said it would spend Rs 38,863 crore on fertiliser subsidies, Rs 25,500 crore on the farm debt waiver scheme, Rs 4,064 crore for selling grains at cheaper prices and Rs 1,000 crore on subsidies for imported edible oils.        
	Another Rs 65,944 crore is for oil bonds, which the government issues to state-run oil companies to compensate them for selling fuel below costs. The companies can sell the bonds to banks and raise money.         
	Analysts feel the extra spending will help to ease the pain of the current credit crunch and revive industry which reported a growth rate of just 1.3 per cent in August.        
	This is the right time to stimulate the economy, finance minister P. Chidambaram said in the Lok Sabha today.         
	The minister said the government would focus on financial stability along with growth and checking inflation. Interest rate and monetary policy are all intended to maintain a balance between inflation and growth . Now we got a new chapter  financial stability, he said. Monetary policy will have to take into account not only inflation, not only growth, but also financial stability.        
	The government has commissioned a report on ways to address the liquidity crisis, which is expected to be presented by the finance secretary later this week. The report may propose fresh measures to release more cash in the market. Among other things, the finance ministry may consider relaxing pricing rules for American depository receipts and global depository receipts .        
	Though Parliament passed a demand for grant of Rs 2,37,285 crore, the actual extra outgo will be Rs 1,05,613 crore, with the rest funded by internal savings.

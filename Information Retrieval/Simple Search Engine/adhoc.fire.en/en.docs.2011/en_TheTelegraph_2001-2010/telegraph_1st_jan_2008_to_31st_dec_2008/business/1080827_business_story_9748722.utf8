          SAMBIT SAHA                          Jindal in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 26: JSW Group plans to replicate the successful Salboni model of land acquisition for all its future projects in India.        
	We want to give shares to all who give up land for our projects, irrespective of the number of people, JSW Group vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal said here today.        
	For the steel plant at Salboni in Bengal, JSW has offered free shares worth the value of the land over and above full upfront cash compensation.        
	The package sent ripples across the country as many hailed it as the best model of compensation for land acquisition which has become a political hot potato in India.        
	Over 700 land owners has received cash as well as free shares of the new company, promoted by JSW Steel, which will build a 10-million-tonne plant over the next 10 years involving an investment of Rs 35,000 crore.        
	It has often been said that JSW could offer shares because there was only a small parcel of private land at Salboni. But Jindal said a larger number would not deter him in future.        
	To acquire land for an aluminium project in Visakhapatnam, Jindal has given shares.         
	He is also willing to share part of his profit among land owners apart from giving shares for his Jharkhand steel project.        
	In Rajasthans Barmer, Jindal has acquired 20,000 acres. He has promised the owners to give back the land after properly redeveloping it once mining is completed.

	Rudrapur (Uttarakhand), Sept. 8: Delta Electronics (India) is planning to invest around Rs 280 crore over the next two years to set up facilities in Gurgaon and Pondicherry.        
	The company recently inaugurated a manufacturing unit at Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. We have invested about Rs 48 crore in the Rudrapur factory with a working capital of Rs 120 crore. We are preparing to allocate Rs 280 crore in the next few years to set up plants in Gurgaon and Pondicherry, said Yancey Hai, vice-chairman and CEO of Delta Electronics.         
	Dalip Sharma, managing director of Delta Electronics (India), said the Rudrapur unit would manufacture power management and industrial automation products.         
	The company, which exports 10-12 per cent of its products to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, plans to export around Rs 200 crore of electronic equipment in the next one year. Delta Electronics (India), which had a turnover of around Rs 400 crore last year, targets a revenue of Rs 600 crore in 2008.         
	Sharma said the Rudrapur factory had been set up on a 100-acre plot, while for the Gurgaon facility, the company was looking to acquire 30 acres. On the choice of the location, Sharma said, Tax incentives are very attractive for companies setting up shop in Rudrapur. Our investments are granted a tax holiday for five years and a 30 per cent tax cut for the next five years.        
	We have the necessary approvals from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for our investments, Sharma said. The Rudrapur unit is Deltas first green factory that incorporates eco-friendly systems. We save around 30-40 per cent in electricity and water consumption in the daily operation of the factory, said Hai.        
	Though going green is expensive, clean energy is our corporate mission. We are committed to providing energy efficient solutions as well as being environmentally conscious by reducing wastes and carbon emissions, Hai said.

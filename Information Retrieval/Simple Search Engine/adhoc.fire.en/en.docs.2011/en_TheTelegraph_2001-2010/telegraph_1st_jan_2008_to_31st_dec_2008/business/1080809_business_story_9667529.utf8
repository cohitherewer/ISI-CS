The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Raja hauls up BSNL for sluggish growth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Raja hauls up BSNL for sluggish growth
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Telecom minister A. Raja has expressed concern over the slow growth of BSNLs value-added services business.        
	A large number of proposals for value-added services on a revenue-sharing basis, in which no investment is required from BSNL, are pending. BSNL may be directed to look into such proposals on priority and in a time-bound manner, the minister said.         
	Rajas concern is on the backdrop of private telecom operators drawing significant revenues from value-added services such as SMS, games, music downloads and news updates.        
	Moreover, BSNL, could lose its first-mover advantage in third-generation (3G) services if it fails to roll out value-added services quickly. The company recently received 5 megahertz of 3G spectrum on a preferential basis, at a time when the government is yet to finalise the auction dates for others.        
	According to industry experts, value-added services are expected to mop up over Rs 20,000 crore from subscribers by 2015. Currently, income from value-added services constitutes around 14 per cent of the total revenue of mobile operators.        
	Consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that the Indian value-added services industry is being primarily driven by SMS  comprising about 44 per cent of the market  followed by new applications such as ringtones and internet surfing.        
	Raja has asked the department of telecom to work out a mechanism so that important decisions could be expedited to earn more revenue for the telecom PSU.

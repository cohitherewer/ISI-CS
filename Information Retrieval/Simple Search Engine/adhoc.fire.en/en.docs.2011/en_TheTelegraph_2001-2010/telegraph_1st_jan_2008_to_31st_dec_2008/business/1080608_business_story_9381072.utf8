          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 7: Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) will target multiple markets of Europe, Africa, the US, Asia and West Asia to distribute products generated from its 29-million-tonne refinery.         
	The worlds sixth largest refinery  which is expected to start operations later this year  will increase global production capacity of both gasoline and diesel by 1 per cent.        
	When completed, supply from the refinery will represent around 50 per cent of the increased global oil demand in 2009.        
	RPL chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the third annual general meeting held in Jamnagar today that the refinery would target Europe for diesel. For diesel, which is in high demand at the moment, Europe appears to be the most attractive export market, he said. The most important markets for gasoline will be the US, Africa and West Asia, he added.        
	Ambani added that while Asia and West Asia would contribute around 60 to 70 per cent of the incremental demand, the RPL refinery would be well positioned to supply to these markets as well.        
	The refinery is expected to start production long before the scheduled date of December. Although many greenfield export refineries have also been announced in West Asia and Asia at the time of the RPL refinery project announcement, the Mukesh Ambani company is expected to enjoy an advantage as it will be the first to get off the mark with a multi-year lead over other such greenfield ventures.        
	Ambani said the refinery would be completed in less than 36 months, establishing a new record for project implementation for large refineries across the world. He added that the refinery would also start generating revenues from this year itself.         
	Along with Reliance Industries Ltds existing refinery at Jamnagar, the group will have total processing capacity of 1.24 million barrels per day.        
	Giving a robust outlook for the refining sector, Ambani said the demand for petroleum products continued to grow despite the surge in world crude oil prices.        
	The demand for energy continues unabated because it is the most critical determinant of economic success in todays world, he said.

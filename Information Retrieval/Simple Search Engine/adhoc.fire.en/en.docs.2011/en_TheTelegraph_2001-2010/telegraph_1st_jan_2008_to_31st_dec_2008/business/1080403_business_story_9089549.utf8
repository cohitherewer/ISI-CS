                              Ambani: New direction                            
	New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group has reportedly decided to enter the commodity trading business by setting up an exchange in the country.        
	The Kotak group is also planning to set up a commodity bourse by acquiring some regional exchanges to get the platform and other technical supports, sources said.        
	The Anil Ambani group declined to comment on any specific plans. Kotak officials were also not available for comment.        
	When asked whether the group might look at entering this business, Reliance Money CEO Sudeep Bandyopadhyay said, We are always open to any opportunity that comes our way. Reliance Money is Reliance Capitals brokerage and financial products distribution arm.         
	However, he did not comment on any specific plan regarding this new business. The group is already present in the commodity brokerage business through Reliance Money.        
	Sources said the new business could have some existing bourses as well as a strategic associate as partners to gain technical, business and infrastructure support.        
	According to experts, the market could be in for a major overhaul with some large companies waiting to start their own bourses.         
	Another emerging conglomerate Indiabulls, which is present in businesses such as brokerage, financial services, real estate, retail and power, has already tied up with state-run trading firm MMTC to start a commodity exchange, for which it is awaiting necessary approvals.         
	Companies are getting lured by the huge growth potential of the Indian commodity markets, which is already worth around $1 trillion and is set to grow larger considering a bull run across the world in this segment for over five years now, the experts said.        
	The Kotak group has a presence in financial markets through banking, brokerage and other businesses.         
	The Anil Ambani group is present across diversified businesses such as telecom, power, financial services, energy, infrastructure and media.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 7: Power generation firm NTPC plans to form joint ventures with states for its future projects.         
	This is expected to overcome the resistance of states to thermal projects as it will give them greater control over their natural resources.        
	Sources said the company was in talks with the governments of Assam, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Haryana.         
	The government is also considering a review of the Gadgil formula of power allocation.         
	An official said that in the allocation of power generated by a central agency such as NTPC, a greater priority needed to be given to states where the plant is located.        
	NTPC, which has a generation capacity of 29,144 megawatt (MW), plans to add 22,430MW by 2012 and take the total to 75,000MW by 2017. The company, which generates power mostly by using coal, will double coal imports to 5 million tonnes in 2008-09 from 2.5 million tonnes a year earlier.

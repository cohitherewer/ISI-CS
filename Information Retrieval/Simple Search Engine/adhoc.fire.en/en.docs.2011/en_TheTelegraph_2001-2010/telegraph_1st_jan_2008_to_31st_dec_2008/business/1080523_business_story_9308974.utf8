	Calcutta, May 22: Bafna Pharmaceuticals Ltd plans to register 25 new products in six African countries as part of its expansion plan.        
	The company is also looking to explore the European market beginning with the UK. Bafna has tied up with the UKs Somex Pharma for the sale of cholesterol lowering drugs. It already sells medicines in Sri Lanka, Ghana and Laos.        
	In 2006-07 our revenues comprised 70 per cent exports with the balance from the domestic market. We reversed our focus on the domestic market last fiscal because of the rupee appreciation. This year we plan to venture into the international markets with a renewed focus and expect the ratio between domestic and foreign revenues to be 50:50, said Mahaveer Chand, chairman and managing director of Bafna Pharmaceuticals.        
	Bafna will market lifestyle medicines such as cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes and anti-cholesterol. The segment is estimated to be a $236-billion market by 2015.        
	Chennai-based Bafna is among the few players in the regulated drug market from the small and medium enterprises segment.

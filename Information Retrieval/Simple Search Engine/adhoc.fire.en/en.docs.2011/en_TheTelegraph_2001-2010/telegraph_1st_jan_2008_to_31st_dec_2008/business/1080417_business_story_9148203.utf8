          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 16: The State Bank of India (SBI) and Macquarie Capital Group (Macquarie) will jointly raise a $2-billion fund that will invest in infrastructure projects or companies in India.        
	A memorandum of understanding was today signed between the SBI and Macquarie to manage the fund.         
	The International Finance Corporation (IFC), one of the funds major investors, will also have a stake in the fund management company.        
	Macquarie, the SBI and the IFC together plan to contribute $450 million to start the fund. The fund will then raise more capital from domestic and international institutional investors. It will be launched by the end of the second quarter of 2008.        
	The fund will invest in traditional infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports and power. It will also look at investment opportunities in infrastructure-related assets and businesses.        
	As the primary sponsors of the fund, the SBI and Macquarie will create a partnership that will source and execute direct equity investments in Indias infrastructure market.        
	Macquarie manages 31 funds in the infrastructure sector with an equity under management in excess of $41 billion.        
	Teaming Macquarie and its global experience with the SBI in its home market, where its reputation and credentials are beyond compare, will create a powerful partnership in India, Nick van Gelder, head of Macquarie Capital Funds in Asia, said.        
	He added that Macquarie and the SBI had already identified some investment opportunities which were being assessed.        
	The SBI and Macquaries move came on a day when 3i Group raised $1.2 billion for its India Infrastructure Fund. The funds raised were 20 per cent more than targeted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air France seals Alitalia deal 
                                                                                                               Air France seals Alitalia deal 
                              New Heights                            
	Rome, March 16 (Reuters): Alitalia has agreed to be bought by Air France-KLM, the worlds biggest airline in terms of revenues, in a deal valuing the near-bankrupt airlines equity at just 138 million euros  far less than expected.        
	The sale of the loss-making airline is a hot issue ahead of Italys general election from April 13-14 and Air France-KLM has stipulated it wants approval from the next government as well as from Alitalias labour unions.        
	Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi criticised the sale to Alitalias long-time partner and European neighbour, saying he favoured an Italian solution.        
	The takeover would end the 60-year independence of a global Italian brand but would also avoid the flagship airline going broke as its cash reserves are quickly drying up and the European Union has banned any more state aid.        
	The airlines said Air France-KLM had offered one share for every 160 shares of Alitalia as part of its binding offer, valuing Alitalias stock at 0.10 euros apiece  an 81 per cent discount to the record low price seen at Fridays close.        
	That price is well short of the 0.35 euros per share value which Air France-KLM was reported to have initially bid and comes closer to the 1 cent per share offer from domestic player Air One, which lacked the deep pockets of its rival and was snubbed by Rome.        
	Air France-KLM also offered to pay 608 million euros to buy back Alitalia bonds and pledged to underwrite a 1-billion-euro cash call to shareholders as part of a commercial overhaul.        
	It set a deadline of March 31 for several conditions on its offer, including an agreement with airports operator SEA over a 1.25-billion-euro claim for damages for cutting slots at Milans Malpensa airport in half to 170. The 138-million-euro price for Alitalia stock is equivalent to roughly two days of revenues at Franco-Dutch airline group, Air France-KLM.        
	This will give Alitalia the means to restart its development, and in consequence, consolidate its position as the national leader, Air France-KLM, itself founded from a merger of French and Dutch flag carriers, said on Sunday.        
	Its membership of the Air France-KLM group together with the implementation of the (industrial) plan should enable Alitalia to return to operating profit as early as 2009, and to rapidly move to operating margin levels in line with those of other major European airline companies, it added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          BUMPY TRACK                                  
	New Delhi, June 4: The hike in petrol and diesel prices could dampen auto sales.        
	The industry expects consumers to shift to diesel models and smaller cars that are fuel-efficient.        
	Tata Motors today said the price hike would impact the entire industry. It, however, added that the peoples car Nano, to be launched later this year, might not be affected as it was fuel-efficient.        
	Car companies have been struggling to recover from sluggish sales for the past few months. They now believe that the hike in petrol and diesel prices will curb demand.        
	This is a phase where I see the shift will be towards compact cars and more fuel- efficient models. Use of alternative fuel will also increase, said Arvind Saxena, senior vice-president (marketing and sales) of Hyundai Motors India.        
	A Maruti Suzuki India dealer said, Our inventories are at an all-time high, but customers are still staying away. Fuel plays an important role as customers are wary of spiralling crude prices. Actual deliveries have reduced and only fuel-efficient cars such as the Alto, Swift and the Dzire are in demand.        
	While car sales increased 22 per cent in April, it remained sluggish at around 13-15 per cent in May despite huge discounts from car makers and impressive sales of new models in the past few weeks.         
	According to Maruti Suzuki, though car sales may dip initially, they will eventually be back on track.        
	Mayank Pareek, general manager (marketing) of Maruti Suzuki India, said, It is true that nearly 75-80 per cent of the market comprises the price-sensitive small car segment. But historic behaviour tells us that it is the sale of big cars which are impacted more.        
	Japanese auto giant Honda Siel also feels that sales will be affected, but the company is confident of pulling through because of its fuel-efficient range of cars.        
	The industry says the hike in fuel price will generate a demand for alternative fuels such as CNG and LPG.         
	Customers are inquisitive and have been making constant enquiries for vehicles offering lower running costs. Diesel vehicles, which are more fuel efficient than petrol cars, are becoming popular. For us the sales of the Tavera and the Optra Magnum remain consistent, said Ankush Arora, vice-president (sales and marketing), General Motors India.         
	With no launches scheduled in the next quarter, the slow pace of car sales is expected to continue for some time. The onset of the monsoon and the price hike are likely to keep buyers away for the next three months, said an analyst.

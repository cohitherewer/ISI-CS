	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the government was working on a package to boost exports, education and agriculture, while asserting that the economy could sustain 9 per cent growth, despite a possible global slowdown, and keep inflation under control.        
	The competitiveness of our exports remains our priority concern and whatever is necessary to enhance the efficiency of our exports will find a ready listener in our government, he said.        
	Exports in the April-December period stood at $111 billion, a growth rate of 21.76 per cent. Exports in December grew 16.04 per cent in dollar terms but in rupee terms the growth was a meagre 2.54 per cent.        
	On growth        
	We will be able to sustain 9 per cent growth and hold the price line at acceptable levels. There are global concerns about a slowdown  we will take steps to limit the impact on us, he said at a conference organised by industry chamber Ficci.        
	Stating that the economy would touch almost 9 per cent growth this year, against 9.6 last year, he said, We have taken an important policy decision to ensure that growth is more inclusive so that inflation is under control.        
	Price check        
	RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan had warned that the rate of inflation was high compared with global levels and should be reduced further. The wholesale price index stood at 4.07 per cent for the week ended February 2, marginally lower than the previous weeks figure of 4.11 per cent.

	The Prime Ministers reassuring remarks boosted sentiments in the stock markets, which came alive in a late rally with the sensex gaining over 340 points to regain the 18000 level at close. The index ended the day at 18115.25, a rise of 348.62 points over its previous close of 17766.63.        
	Agriculture boost        
	We are looking at ways to increase investments in irrigation. The allocation for agriculture and irrigation has been tripled in the Eleventh Plan, Singh said.        
	Right to education         
	On education, Singh said, We will soon be introducing a bill providing the right to education to every child.

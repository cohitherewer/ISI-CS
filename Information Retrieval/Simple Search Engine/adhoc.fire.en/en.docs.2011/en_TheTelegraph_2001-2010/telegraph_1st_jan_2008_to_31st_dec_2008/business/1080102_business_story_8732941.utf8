	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) says it is not feasible for telecom operators to return excess spectrum as this will inconvenience customers. 
    
	Officials of Trai were reacting to recent media reports on the possibility of the government demanding the return of spectrum over the limit specified by the regulator.
    
	The department of telecom (DoT) has, however, said that it has not taken any decision on this issue. 
    
	Trai felt its recommendations on spectrum allocation norms should not be applied on a retrospective basis.
    
	It would not be feasible for telecom operators to return spectrum as networks are planned and rolled out to work based on current spectrum allotments, the officials said.
    
	They said it would take over an year for an operator to migrate subscribers to another frequency before it can surrender spectrum.
    
	Mobile operators cannot return spectrum without changing the network configuration completely, which could affect the quality of service.
    
	The officials also said that the recent recommendations on subscriber-based spectrum allocation criteria cannot be applied on a retrospective basis as it will not be fair to existing operators. 
    
	Last week, the DoT decided to allot additional spectrum based on Trais subscriber-linked criteria. 
    
	The regulator had recommended an increase in the subscriber base of operators by two to six times before they are given additional spectrum.
    
	On the basis of these norms, many telecom operators may be holding excess spectrum that is sufficient to accommodate 4-5 new players. 
    
	However, the regulator contends that these recommendations are for the allocation of spectrum in the future. They should not be used to take away spectrum that has already been granted based on the current allocation policy.
    
	Earlier, in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Reliance Communications chairman Anil Ambani had alleged that the three GSM operators  Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular  together held around 54.2 MHz of spectrum in excess of norms. 
    
	Ambani had proposed that the government should make it mandatory for telecom service providers to surrender additional spectrum. 
    
	He had also conveyed his willingness to the government on surrendering 1.8 MHz of spectrum. This spectrum is for the Bihar circle and in excess of its requirements.
    
	In response to Ambani, Bharti in a release had stated that GSM operators combined have less than 25 MHz of total spectrum.
    
	Under the current telecom licence agreement, operators of GSM services are entitled to spectrum up to 6.2 Mhz, while CDMA operators have been permitted spectrum up to 5 Mhz.

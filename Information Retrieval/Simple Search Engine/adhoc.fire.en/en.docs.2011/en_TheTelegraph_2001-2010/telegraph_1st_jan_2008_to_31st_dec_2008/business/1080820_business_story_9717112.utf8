	Mumbai, Aug. 19 (PTI): Orissa Manganese and Minerals, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Adhunik Metaliks, plans to raise Rs 250-300 crore through a public issue later this year to fund its mining plans, a company official said.        
	We plan to raise Rs 250-300 crore through an IPO later this year for our 100 per cent subsidiary, Orissa Manganese and Minerals Ltd, through a 15 per cent stake dilution, Adhunik Metaliks managing director Manoj Agarwal told reporters here today.        
	We are working on and will file the draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in the next 50-60-day period, Agarwal said.        
	Orissa Manganese and Minerals, which was acquired by Adhunik Metaliks for Rs 70 crore last year, is now planning to set up a pelletisation plant and an iron ore beneficiation plant at Nuamundi in Jharkhand.        
	The company also plans to set up a manganese ore beneficiation plant at Dhenkanal in Orissa.         
	The company has received state government clearances for both the plants.         
	The plants would convert iron ore fines into pellets and process low-grade manganese ore waste for use in ferro alloy units. The total estimated cost for setting up the plants is Rs 1,100 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New entrants find 3G rules unfair
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New entrants find 3G rules unfair
          JAYATI GHOSE                                Pitted against odds            Spectrum insufficient to  offer full-fledged service
      Additional Rs 1,650cr  needs to be paid for  extra licence      No spectrum with the  extra licence      Foreign firms must divest  some stake to local entity      Annual spectrum fee  higher for new players        
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Telecom players keen to debut through 3G may find the going tough under current rules.         
	Sensing difficulties, foreign operators have already started a lobbying war to ease the norms.        
	According to the policy, winners of the 3G auction will be initially allotted 5 megahertz spectrum, which even the department of telecommunications (DoT) considers as insufficient.         
	Besides, no additional spectrum will be given for a year after the initial allotment.        
	The government has made it mandatory for the new entrants to get a universal access service licence for an additional fee of Rs 1,650 crore. There will be no start-up spectrum with the licence.         
	Previously, the government has given some 2G spectrum with the licence, which could have been used for basic voice and data services.        
	It does not seem likely that any firm will want to lock in billions of dollars without the certainty of being able to operationalise its 3G services, said telecom analyst Sudipto Basu.        
	The US telecom sub- committee has sent a letter to Indias parliamentary standing committee on IT and telecom asking whether India would change its rules to address this imbalance.         
	Multinational firms have cited other discrepancies in the 3G policy.         
	Policy-makers have allowed foreign firms to bid for spectrum as 100 per cent entities but by the time of rollouts, they must divest some stakes to local firms. In following international practices, India should allow for a full and complete opportunity for new international investors in the auction process, the US body said in the letter.         
	Global players such as Americas AT amp;T, Germanys Deutsche Telekom, Frances Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo are keen on 3G.        
	Worldwide, 3G has revolutionised the cellular experience with value-added offerings such as high-speed Internet and mobile TV.        
	The new players are also facing a disparity in the fee for spectrum use vis--vis existing 2G operators.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recently proposed that standalone 3G operators should pay an annual fee of 3 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue.         
	This is over and above an annual administrative charge which will be 2 per cent of the highest bid amount in the 3G auction. The DoT, however, has not yet incorporated Trais recommendations in its bid document.         
	The telecom commission, the highest decision-making body in the DoT, will take a call on Trais recommendation on December 19.        
	There is a pre-bid conference scheduled for December 23 and bidding starts on January 16. When will all the rules be clear? The auctions seem a farce, said an operator.         
	Analysts said the financials of telecom companies would also come under pressure because of the exorbitant initial charges and the high cost of rolling out a network.        
	Moreover, it will take time for operators to make profit because of the low revenue per user in the country.        
	Auctions for 3G are scheduled to start on January 16, and the bidding will be a four-step process  invitation, pre-qualification, auction and final approval.         
	Targeting a sum of Rs 40,000 crore, the government has fixed the reserve price for an all-India licence at Rs 2,020 crore.         
	A pre-bid conference has been slated for December 23, and the last date for filing an application to participate in the auction is January 5.        
	A mock auction is pencilled in for January 12-13, preceded by a prior-qualification exercise on January 9.

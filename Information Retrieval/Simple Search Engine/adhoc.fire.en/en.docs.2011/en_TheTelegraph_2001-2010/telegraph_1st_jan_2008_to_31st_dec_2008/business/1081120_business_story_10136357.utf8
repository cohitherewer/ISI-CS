          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ahluwalia in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Planning Commission is preparing a list of infrastructure projects in which the government will shovel extra funds as part of its huge spending programme.         
	We are reviewing the existing programmes and will bring out a list in 10 days. Wherever the programmes are moving rapidly and will exhaust the money they have, we will ask the finance ministry to provide additional resources, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, told reporters.         
	Ahluwalia said the government was trying to increase the fiscal stimulus in the current financial year as the recessionary trends were expected to continue even in the next financial year.         
	It is very important that we start planning now, so that next year we are ready to provide a major thrust to infrastructure, he said.         
	The government is following in the footsteps of a number of countries which have chosen to spend money to create infrastructure and jobs, besides infusing cash into the economy through central banks to help grow demand and stimulate industry.        
	India needs an investment of $500 billion to upgrade its creaky infrastructure over the five-year period ending March 2012 to sustain a 9 per cent average annual growth rate.        
	However, its difficult for the cash-strapped government to speed up work on large projects as inflows from private and foreign sources have started drying up after the global credit crisis.        
	Ahluwalia said the gap in infrastructure funding had increased following the crisis. Prior to the crisis, the country needed $500 billion till 2012, of which the planners had expected to garner $350 billion.

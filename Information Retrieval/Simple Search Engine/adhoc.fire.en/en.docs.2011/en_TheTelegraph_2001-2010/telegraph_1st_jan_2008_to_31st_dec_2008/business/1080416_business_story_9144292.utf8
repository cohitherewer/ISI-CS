          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                NEW PARTNER    
	New Delhi, April 15: GAIL (India) will enter into a joint venture agreement with China Gas to distribute city gas in Delhi.        
	The joint venture will also explore similar opportunities in China. Industry sources said the two companies were in talks for a partnership to set up gas-based petrochemical plants in a third country.        
	GAIL (India) and China Gas are close to signing an agreement on coal bed methane (CBM) exploration in inner Mongolia.        
	GAIL is one of our important shareholders and Australias Arrow Energy has experience in CBM, so we would like to join with them, China Gas managing director Liu Ming Hui told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.        
	Liu said China Gas had some CBM blocks, the data for which was being evaluated. If the partners agree, there could be a three-way partnership.        
	Sources said GAIL (India) was also in talks with Arrow Energy to enter into a partnership for CBM exploration in Australia.         
	According to industry analysts, the GAIL-China Gas joint venture will provide the necessary impetus to city gas distribution in the country that will soon be opened up for bidding.        
	China Gas has exclusive operating rights for gas distribution in 50 cities and 11 provinces in China.        
	Earlier this month, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board had laid down the criteria for distribution of gas to households, vehicles and industries in cities across the country and the bidding procedure, but did not specify the price at which consumers would get the gas.        
	The regulator had said the projects would be awarded on the basis of network tariff, gas compression charges, the length of pipeline proposed to be laid and the number of households to be covered in a city.        
	The government has set a target of rolling out the network in about 200 cities over the next five years. This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore, which is about Rs 300 crore per city.        
	At present, only about half a million people in the country get natural gas in their kitchens, which is about 30 per cent cheaper than liquefied petroleum gas. The government plans to reach city gas to 20 million households over the next few years.

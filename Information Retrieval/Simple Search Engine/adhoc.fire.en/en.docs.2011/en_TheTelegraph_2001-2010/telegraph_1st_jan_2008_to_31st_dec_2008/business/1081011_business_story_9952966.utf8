          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 10: Speculation about an interest rate cut increased today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 150 basis points to 7.5 per cent.        
	CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be compulsorily kept with the central bank.        
	On October 6, the RBI had announced a 50-basis-point cut in CRR to 8.5 per cent.        
	The central bank today said it had been decided to reduce CRR by 150 basis points to 7.50 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning October 11 instead of the half-a-percentage point announced earlier.        
	We expect continued moves by the RBI to ease liquidity, and the probability of a rate cut at the October 24 policy meeting has increased, Tushar Poddar, vice-president-Asia Economics Research Team at Goldman Sachs, said in a report.        
	However, not everyone seemed to agree with this view. Many felt that the RBI could be wary of bringing down interest rates at a time when inflation continued to remain high.         
	There may be a status quo on interest rates, but a cut is unlikely in the near term, a banker said.        
	The cash crunch has worsened after huge capital outflows arising from advance tax payments and dollar repatriation by foreign institutional investors who have been selling shares on the bourses.        
	The RBI intervened in the forex markets by selling dollars in a bid to prop up the value of the Indian unit. However, the regulators intervention through aggressive dollar sales sucked out rupees from the system  and created even more liquidity problems.        
	The RBI today said that despite abrupt changes in the international financial environment, the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy were strong and resilient and Indias financial system was sound, well-capitalised and well-regulated.        
	Rohini Malkani, economist at Citi India, said industrial growth figures for August were worrying and the RBI had a tough task ahead given that broad money growth was at 21 per cent, loan growth at 26 per cent and inflation at 11.8 per cent.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: The Bengal government has okayed Dunlops proposal to transform part of its Sahagunj unit in Hooghly into an IT special economic zone (SEZ) and recommended the proposal to the Centre for final approval.
    
	Dunlop plans to carve out a 50-acre plot out of the 239 acres it has in Sahagunj. 
    
	Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of the company, said Dunlop would start work on the project after the Centre gave its approval. This is a very positive development for the company. It will help in boosting Dunlops financials to a large extent, he said.
    
	The company plans to bring in a strategic partner to develop the SEZ. 
    
	Ruia has also approached the Bengal government to turn some of Jessops land in Burdwan into another IT special economic zone.
    
	In Tamil Nadu, too, Dunlop has sought permission of the state government to convert 50 acres of its Ambattur unit into an IT special economic zone.

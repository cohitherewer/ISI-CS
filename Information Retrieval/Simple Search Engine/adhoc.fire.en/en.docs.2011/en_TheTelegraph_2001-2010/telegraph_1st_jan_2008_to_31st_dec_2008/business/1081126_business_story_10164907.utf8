          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          On guard                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The government today curbed the import of seamless steel tubes and steel pipes to protect local firms from cheaper Chinese products.        
	With the shift in seamless tubes and pipes to the restricted from the free list, user industries will need a licence from the government for import. Car, oil and construction companies use these items.        
	Already, the government has put curbs on the import of hot-rolled coils and imposed a customs duty of 5 per cent on specific steel items.         
	A notification of the directorate-general of foreign trade says that along with seamless tubes and pipes, wood and wood products would also come under the restricted list.         
	According to Jindal Steel managing director Indresh Batra, Had the imports been allowed without restrictions, the Indian market would have been flooded with cheap Chinese products.        
	As global prices fell because of the financial crisis, the domestic steel industry is apprehending dumping by companies from China, Ukraine and Thailand.        
	Global steel prices have corrected sharply from $1,250 a tonne to around $500 a tonne.         
	In addition to cheap imports, the domestic industry has faced a decline in demand of 30 per cent because of the crisis. The industry has capacity of 55 million tonnes.        
	Faced with demand erosion, several steel producers such as Essar, JSW and Ispat have resorted to a cut in production.        
	SAIL demand        
	Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today sought the imposition of a 14 per cent countervailing duty on imported TMT bars and structurals used in construction.        
	World steel prices were going through the roof when the countervailing duty was removed. But such circumstances no more exist and so the duty should be imposed, said S.K. Roongta, chairman of SAIL.         
	The imposition of the countervailing duty is expected to benefit leading steel producers by making imports of the commodity dearer.         
	Domestic steel makers pay an excise duty of 14 per cent on TMT bars and structurals, and companies importing them pay a customs duty of 5 per cent.         
	There is no justification for the steel industry paying a 14 per cent excise duty when only a minimal import tax is levied on steel items being dumped in India, said Roongta.         
	The government had scrapped the countervailing duty earlier this year to tame rising prices. The tax is in place for other steel items.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Aug. 31: Indian steel companies are leaving no stone unturned in their quest for coal. Apart from forging alliances, they are also keen on acquiring domestic blocks that are not being mined by government entities such as Central Coalfields Ltd.         
	Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) have stepped up efforts to secure coal supply for their expansion and new projects.         
	Tata Steel is self-sufficient in iron ore but not in coal. The company is able to meet only 60 per cent of its coal requirement for Indian operations from its own mines. Its dependence on other sources is set to increase on account of various projects planned over the next few years.         
	The company has gone overseas to countries such as Australia, Oman, Mozambique and Ivory Coast in its hunt for raw material assets.        
	It acquired a 35 per cent stake in a coal project in Mozambique for $85 million to get an assured supply of coke for the Corus plants in the UK and Europe.         
	The company is now scouting for domestic sources.        
	Sources said Tata Steel had expressed interest in taking over certain portions of Central Coalfields Pundi block in Jharkhand.         
	These portions were not used by Central Coalfields because they were not suitable for mining.        
	The Tatas are willing to acquire the block after paying exploration costs to the coal mining company.         
	SAIL, which is planning to raise its hot metal production to 26 million tonnes by 2010, will need over 22 million tonnes of coking coal against its present requirement of over 14 million tonnes.         
	However, lower supplies from Coal India have forced the company to meet more than 70 per cent of its raw material requirement through imports.         
	SAIL is now planning to develop the Kapuria block in Jharkhand in a joint venture with Bharat Coking Coal Ltd.         
	The steel producer has also shown interest in developing the Jharia coal mines, in Jharkhand, which are estimated to have over eight billion tonnes of high-grade coking coal reserves.        
	Last week, jsw Steel vice-chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal had said that steel producers could rehabilitate those living near the Jharia mines and develop the mines on a public-private-partnership model.        
	India has an estimated 2,55,246 million tonnes of coal reserves. Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are some of the states rich in coal. During 2006-07, around 431 million tonnes of coal were mined in the country.

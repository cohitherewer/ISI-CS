        Give staid tax-saving instruments a miss and invest in mutual fund ELSS. Nilanjan Dey tells you why                                            
	Babies, deaths and taxes  they rarely come at the right time! Never was this ancient saying more relevant for individual tax payers than now, its significance underscored even more by Budget 2008.         
	The budget, given its emphasis on personal savings and investments, may well have a positive impact on equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), a category of mutual funds the countrys investing populace has studiedly ignored so far.         
	By increasing the threshold limit of exemption to Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 1.10 lakh for tax payers, the finance minister has, in a way, tried to expand the scope of Section 80C. However, the additions to the basket  the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme 2004 and the Post Office Time Deposit Account  may not be quite practical in a market that respects concepts such as returns, post-tax income and yield.         
	Dynamic choice         
	The discerning investor should rather consider ELSS, which is undoubtedly among the most dynamic instruments qualifying for the Section 80C benefit.         
	To understand why ELSS is such a compelling option for mutual fund investors, we need to quickly refer to one of its key characteristics. A tax-saving fund (thats the universal name) requires you to stay invested for at least three years. A three-year period is a fairly decent span of time for an equity fund, allowing it to perform reasonably.         
	And, yes, tax-saving funds are in almost all cases diversified equity products, capable of taking a sustained call on the stock market just like other broad-based equity funds.         
	The returns from these funds are determined by the performance of the equity market and how well the fund managers invest their funds. Assuming that the market is buoyant and the managers skillful, there is no reason why the funds should not do well.         
	The possibility of overcoming the damage done by taxes and inflation  two of the nastiest banes of investors  is arguably the highest here. In other words, an ELSS is truly in a position to make use of the three-year lock-in period and create enough wealth for the investor. And that period can actually be stretched because investors need not necessarily redeem their units at the end of the minimum lock-in.         
	Boring alternatives         
	You may be inclined to view ELSS against some of the other eligible options, including the PPF (public provident fund) and ULIP (unit-linked insurance plan). While this is not the right forum to relive the MF-vs-ULIP debate, we can safely say that the budget will have no particular impact on such staid alternatives as the PPF.         
	In fact, options such as the PPF (as well as the post office schemes and senior citizensschemes) appear tame and unexciting when compared to ELSS.         
	Not too many takers         
	Tax-saving funds, for all the positive vibes they generate, have been an ignored lot as there is very little awareness about the products.         
	Just look at the abysmally low AUMs (asset under management) that many of them command. The chart we have drawn up explains this phenomenon. It is not that tax-savers are a new-fangled concept. A few of them  including funds managed by the SBI, Canbank Robeco and Birla Sun Life  have a neat 10-year record or more.         
	Then why do some of the largest ELSS products pale (in terms of AUM) before little-known diversified funds managed by asset management companies? Obviously, investors have historically overlooked this genre. Fund houses did not do much to spread awareness either.         
	It is possible to make regular, systematic investments in tax-savers; such regular investments can be even spread over the whole year.         
	And the good news is that the category has logged remarkable growth in AUM in recent times. Remember, we are referring to the category as a whole. Single out the few largest funds and you will not be left with much to consider.         
	The question on the investment communitys mind is whether ELSS will ever come of age, both in terms of performance and product differentiation. One or two asset management companies have introduced special variants of the traditional tax-saving product. The idea is to ward off such newer options as ULIP and generally increase awareness. A relatively new player, for instance, has proposed a quant-based concept.         
	A fund manager may not be able to do much if the ELSS being managed is constricted by a low asset base. The fund manager cannot buy enough of the best stocks if the fund sees no real inflows. For instance, a well-known private-sector asset management companys tax-saver, with its 12-year record, has just Rs 170 crore under management.         
	There seems to be a clear disconnect here  history does not necessarily lead to a respectable asset base!

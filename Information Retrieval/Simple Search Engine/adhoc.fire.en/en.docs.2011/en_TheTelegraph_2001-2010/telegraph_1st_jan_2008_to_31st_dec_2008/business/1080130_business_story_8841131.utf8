     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI) 
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Reserve Bank, which chose to leave benchmark rates unchanged today, could tweak them later to respond to foreign capital flows.
    
	We dont know how the cat will jump. We will act accordingly, said finance minister P. Chidambaram. The government feels the Reserve Banks decision to leave interest rates unchanged today gives the central bank the flexibility to reduce or raise them later to better manage foreign capital flows.
    
	India could either reduce rates to stem the flow of foreign capital into India as a result of the cut in interest rate by the US Federal Reserve or raise them to attract foreign capital, if banks and financial institutions in the US start pulling out of developing countries to make good losses run up back home in the mortgage crisis.
    
	There could be increased capital inflows but then there are payment obligations in those countries too. There could be an outflow also. So we have to wait and see, Chidambaram said.
    
	The finance minister, who had been pressing bankers for a reduction in interest rates, said personal views did not matter and that he fully endorsed the decision taken by RBI governor Y.V. Reddy. 
    
	Its a standstill policy. I can understand the governors compulsion ... it gives us the flexibility to move either way, the minister told reporters after a meeting with state finance ministers on a rescue package for ailing rural credit organisations. 
    
	Chidambaram added that the RBI had promised to improve the quality and quantity of credit growth to employment-oriented sectors. 
    
	Several sectors, including textiles, which depended on exports and were labour intensive, had been hit by the current global economic downturn and were clamouring for a cheaper credit window.
    
	The RBI will be monitoring global uncertainties and will move accordingly, he said. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut borrowing costs tomorrow. 
    
	But analysts remain uncertain whether rate cuts and a $145-billion economic stimulus package will stave off a recession in the US. Chidambaram said he would discuss further policy actions when he meets Reddy. There is no reason to believe there is a slowdown. I see a robust and a performing economy, he said.

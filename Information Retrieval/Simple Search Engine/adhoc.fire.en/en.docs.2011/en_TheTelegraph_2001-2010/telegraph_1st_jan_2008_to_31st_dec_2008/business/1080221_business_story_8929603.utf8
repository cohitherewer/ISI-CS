The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex slides on Asian cues
                                                                                                               Sensex slides on Asian cues
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: The sensex swooned over 450 points after picking up a string of negative signals from the weak Asian markets and amid mounting concerns about inflation, with the crude oil price closing for the first time above $100 at $100.01 yesterday.        
	The bellwether index plunged from the very start of trading as selling pressure built up across all the counters. At the end of a volatile day of trading, the sensex settled at 17617.60 points.        
	All the BSE indices closed in the red, but the realty and the bank indices were the worst hit. The 50-share broader market index at the NSE tumbled 126.35 points to close at 5154.45.         
	The market suffered losses due to weak Asian cues. It is a vicious circle now: whenever the market goes up, the buyers drive up stocks as far as they can possibly go. When the negative cues come in, the investors stop building positions. So, the market isnt going down because of selling but because of the lack of buying, said Phani Shekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking Ltd.        
	The rupee today tumbled 29 paise against the dollar to breach the 40-mark for the first time in five months, with the shortage of dollar getting accentuated by global crude prices which hit fresh records.

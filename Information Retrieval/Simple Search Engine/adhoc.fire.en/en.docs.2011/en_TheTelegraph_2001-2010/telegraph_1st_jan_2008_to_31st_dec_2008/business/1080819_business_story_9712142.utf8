	New Delhi, Aug. 18 (PTI): Global mining leader Rio Tinto and state-run NMDC Ltd today signed an agreement to explore global and domestic mineral reserves, primarily iron ore.        
	According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU), a joint venture company will be formed soon for the acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation of mines in India and abroad. A joint working group will be set up to identify the reserves.        
	We will be jointly scouting for mining resources in different parts of the world and India, NMDC chairman and managing director Rana Som said.        
	Exploitation of iron ore reserves will be the primary target, but both the parties are open to other metals, he said.        
	Rio Tinto has long been a believer in India as both a major market for iron ore and as a potential world-class source of production, Rio Tinto managing director and chief financial officer (iron ore) Alan Davies said.        
	The collaborative strengths of Rio Tinto and NMDC complement each other and the company looks forward to working in tandem to identify such opportunities, he said.        
	On the proposed investment in the venture, Davies said, At present, we do not have a specified capital plan for the venture. Our teams are conducting feasibility studies and will come up with some reasonable capital estimate.         
	According to the MoU, the scouting of mining reserves will begin in Orissa and move on to Karnataka.        
	India has around 23 billion tonnes of available mining resource, of which mining is allowed for around 12 billion tonnes, Som said.        
	We have explored a little over one billion tonnes of reserves of the available 12 billion tonnes. There is a huge space still available, why should we think to go alone, Som added.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infosys looks inward
                                        Shibulal in Bangalore on Wednesday. (AP)    
	Bangalore, Oct. 15 (PTI): Indias No. 2 software firm Infosys Technologies today said it would explore opportunities within the country, at a time when its overseas clients are taking cover from the global financial crisis. On October 10, Infosys had revised revenue guidance in dollar terms downwards following the appreciation of the dollar against major global currencies and financial crisis.        
	North America accounts for over 60 per cent of Infosyss revenues, while Europe and the rest of the world (including India) account for around 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. India accounts for just 1.3 per cent of its total revenues.        
	In India, technology expenditure is on the upswing and we think its the right time to enter the country, S.D. Shibulal, the chief executive officer of the Bangalore-based firm, said. We have entered the domestic market in the last six months (apart from Infosyss core banking solution, Finacle), he said.         
	Infosys is now exploring opportunities in the private sector, government and banks to drive growth in the domestic market, he said. We believe in entering a country when it is right for us. We are focusing on emerging markets, including India, he said. He said Infosys was not laying off people and that the company planned to hire 25,000 people in 2008-09.         
	Infosys has entered into an agreement with Bharti Airtel, under which the software firm will provide interactive applications to Bhartis DTH customers.

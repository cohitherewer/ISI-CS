          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                          GOOD TIMES AHEAD                                  
	Calcutta, July 4: The Bengal government will soon announce the much awaited revival package for closed tea gardens.        
	This follows a central government package of Rs 60 crore to restructure the loans of closed gardens in Bengal, Assam and Kerala.        
	According to the latest conversation I had with the state commerce and industry secretary, the announcement for the package is due anytime. Any such step is welcome as only two out of the 13 closed gardens have reopened in the state. The package will be multi-pronged and address all areas of concern for a prospective buyer, said Basudeb Banerjee, chairman, the Tea Board of India.        
	The package will have a 75 per cent waiver on the stamp duty and the registration fee for the purchase of the assets of a closed garden.         
	A 400-hectare garden producing eight lakh kg with a productivity of 2,000 kg per hectare will fetch around Rs 16 crore in Assam, while in Bengal this will be between Rs 10 crore and Rs 12 crore as productivity is lower.        
	In addition, there will be a waiver of electricity duty for three years and the payment of electricity dues in easy instalments. The Bengal government has already waived the cess and agricultural tax.        
	The package is also expected to include norms on the alternative use of surplus land. Currently, only 24 acres in an estate can be utilised for such activities, a miniscule percentage.        
	An industry analyst said the government should link employment with productivity. When productivity improves, the gardens will employ more labour. If this approach is followed, the closed gardens will find many takers, the analyst said.        
	The state government had earlier announced that the allowance of Rs 700 per month to workers would continue up till a year after a garden has been taken over.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Congress-led government will continue to use moral suasion and soft pressure tactics to force steel makers rein in prices even as the three-month moratorium on price increase ends this week.         
	Top officials said the government had passed on a message to major steel manufacturers not to raise prices and held out the threat of coercive action such as a ban on export and even price control measures.        
	However, the government would consider sympathetically the demands of steel makers for duty cuts on inputs to ease cost pressure. A moratorium on increase in coal prices will also continue to ensure steel and cement manufacturers are unaffected.         
	The officials said the government would retain the option of banning export to force steel makers to fall in line. In case they do not (check prices), steps will be taken to ban exports.        
	They said that price control is an antiquated measure and we do not favour it. But even that can be looked at if the need arises.         
	Steel and iron ore prices have contributed to a large extent to inflation rising to double digits over the last few months.         
	In May, steel makers had agreed to roll back prices by Rs 4,000 a tonne and hold them for three months.        
	However, at the retail level, prices were allowed to rise, as many steel makers had cut back on retail margins allowed to dealers.         
	The government had, in April, placed a hefty 15 per cent export duty on semi-finished steel products and a 5 per cent duty on galvanised sheets. Import of pig iron, mild steel products such as hot-rolled and cold- rolled coil, sponge iron and semi finished products were also made duty free.        
	JSW move        
	JSW Steel vice-chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal today said in Mumbai that his company would not raise prices this month.

                                                                                                               Anil wins bridge project
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          GREAT GOING                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: Anil Ambani has beaten elder brother Mukesh in bagging the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link project which will be built at a cost of over Rs 4,500 crore.        
	The sudden turnaround came after the bids for the project were opened today at the board meeting of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, the nodal agency for the project.        
	A couple of months ago, it had appeared that the Mukesh-led consortium would bag the project as it was the only one left in the fray after Anils group was disqualified on technical grounds.        
	Anil entered the frame once again after winning a legal battle.        
	Sources said Anil-owned Reliance Energy Ltd emerged as the top bidder, beating Mukeshs team led by Sea King Infrastructure Ltd. Reliance Industries Ltd has a controlling stake in Sea King Infrastructure.        
	A spokesperson for the Anil team refused to comment, saying the group had not received any confirmation. Two other consortia  L amp;T-Gamon Industries and Iffco  had earlier opted out of the race.        
	Reliance Energy challenged its disqualification in Bombay High Court but its plea was rejected.         
	However, it won a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court in September last year. Setting aside the Bombay High Court order, an apex court bench comprising Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice S. H. Kapadia directed Reliance Energy to submit its bid for the project within three months.        
	The harbour plan involves the building of Indias longest sea link expressway  a stretch of 25km  between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai on design, build, own, operate and transfer basis.         
	The private sector developer will be required to design, finance, construct, operate and maintain the project and will be entitled to toll collections.

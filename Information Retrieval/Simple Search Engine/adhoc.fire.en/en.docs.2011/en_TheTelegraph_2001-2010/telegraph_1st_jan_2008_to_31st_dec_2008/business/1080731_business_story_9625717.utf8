                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Input cost hurts Tata Motors
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ramakrishnan: Hard times                                  
	Mumbai, July 30: Rising input prices and intensifying competition have taken a toll on Tata Motors, which reported a 30.13 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 326.11 crore in the first quarter ended June 30.        
	The automobile maker had earned a net profit of Rs 466.76 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit decline at Tata Motors is a little sharper than rival Maruti Suzuki, which saw its first-quarter profit dip by 6.8 per cent.        
	However, revenues of Tata Motors rose 14.4 per cent to Rs 6,928.44 crore from Rs 6,056.82 crore in the same quarter last year.        
	The company also suffered a loss of Rs 199.88 crore (compared with a gain of Rs 205.89 crore in the year-ago quarter) in foreign exchange transactions.         
	Margins were further impacted in a challenging environment due to abnormal input material cost increases and general inflationary trends, the company said.        
	Tata Motors, which is due to launch the Nano later this year, is expecting margins to remain under pressure because of higher costs of inputs such as steel, chief financial officer C. Ramakrishnan told reporters today.        
	The auto major plans to raise $1.7 billion through a rights issue to fund its recently completed $2.3-billion purchase of Jaguar and Land Rover. Sales in the quarter (including exports) at 1,33,079 vehicles grew by a mere 3.9 per cent compared with 1,28,095 units in the corresponding period last year.         
	Exports, however, took a hit by 33.6 per cent, with the company exporting only 9,220 vehicles this quarter against 13,889 units in the corresponding quarter last year.        
	The company has sold a 24 per cent stake in its auto parts unit, Tata AutoComp Systems Ltd, and booked a profit of Rs 114 crore ($27 million) in the quarter ended June 30, Ramakrishnan said. While high interest rates and reduction in overall vehicle financing continue to affect sales, the company said it was posting good growth and improving market shares in segments where it had launched products.         
	The company will continue to accord a special thrust on vehicle financing to facilitate better retail sales. New initiatives for cost reduction, now under development, will continue to be implemented vigorously.

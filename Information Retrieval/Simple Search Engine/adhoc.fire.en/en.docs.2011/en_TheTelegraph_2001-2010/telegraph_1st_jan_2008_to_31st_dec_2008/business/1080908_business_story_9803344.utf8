                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Branded fuel strategy bears fruit for oil firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          PROFIT WATCH                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: State-owned oil marketing companies have reported strong sales of branded fuels, implying their strategy to sell more of these fuels at the expense of unbranded petrol and diesel has paid off.         
	Promoting branded fuels had become necessary because the companies were selling the unbranded varieties at prices below costs.        
	Branded petrol and diesel reported a growth rate of 83.8 per cent and 67.2 per cent, respectively, in the first quarter of this fiscal compared with the year-ago period, according to petroleum ministry data.        
	The oil companies were able to mop up Rs 1,000 crore during the period. However, this is insignificant compared with the revenue loss suffered by them for selling unbranded fuels at a loss.        
	The consumption of petrol during April-July this year stood at 3,711 thousand tonnes, a growth rate of 7.6 per cent compared with the same period last year. Diesel consumption was at 17,445 thousand tonnes, an increase of 11 per cent.        
	The share of branded petrol and diesel in total sales was around 24 per cent and 10.9 per cent, respectively. Analysts said sales rose because motorists were becoming aware of the advantages of using branded petrol and diesel, in terms of fuel efficiency.        
	Branded petrol costs Rs 3-4 a litre more than unbranded petrol, while branded diesel is priced Rs 1.25-2 per litre higher. There is an excellent response from the users of premium fuel because of the advantages offered in terms of mileage and vehicle performance, industry sources said.        
	The oil marketing companies had pushed for the sale of branded fuels because unbranded petrol and diesel were becoming unviable following the spike in the global price of crude oil, which at one time had touched $145 per barrel.        
	However, the heads of the oil companies were recently criticised by petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey for pushing branded fuel and, thereby, creating an artificial scarcity in the market. They were told to ensure the availability of unbranded fuel.        
	Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) chairman Sarthak Behuria had said the companies were forced to sell branded fuels at select petrol pumps because the government did not raise petrol and diesel prices in line with global trends.         
	Oil companies had left no choice for consumers. They will be forced to buy expensive fuel, said Ajay Bansal, general secretary of the Federation of All India Petroleum Traders, a body representing 37,000 petrol pumps in India.        
	Though the price of crude oil had fallen below $110 a barrel, the oil marketing companies were still registering a loss of Rs 400 crore a day. Revenue loss for the three companies  IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited  in this fiscal is projected at Rs 1,65,300 crore.        
	Based on the average price in the second fortnight of August, retailers are losing Rs 6.31 per litre on petrol, Rs 13.69 on diesel, Rs 31.39 on kerosene and Rs 312.58 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, March 3: India has decided to reduce tariff on around 500 products imported from least developed countries (LDCs) such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives in the Saarc region to boost intra-regional trade.
    
	India has unilaterally decided to reduce the negative list. We will be in a position to notify the revised negative list in a few months, commerce minister Kamal Nath said at a ministerial council meeting of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta) held here today.
    
	The negative list will be pruned to 244 items from 500 products. The items on the list attract no reduction in duty and have higher tariff rates.
    
	The minister said, Other non-LDCs should also consider reviewing their negative lists with respect to least developed nations.
    
	He said India had already slashed import duties on all items except those on the negative list for LDCs with effect from January 1, 2008. 
    
	He said the regional study on trade in services in the Saarc region had been completed and would pave the way for a service agreement among the Saarc countries.
    
	Nath said he was confident that the new government in Islamabad would take immediate steps to implement Safta with New Delhi and take necessary measures, including duty changes, to facilitate trade.
    
	We expect the new government in Pakistan to take positive steps in fulfilling the agreement in Safta, which it has acceded to but not implemented. We hope the new administration in Pakistan will look at this positively, because it is an advantageous situation for them, he said.
    
	Pakistan, a signatory to Safta, has maintained that it will implement the agreement with India only in line with its existing bilateral trade policy. 
    
	India wants Pakistan to implement Safta in true letter and spirit.
    
	Pakistani commerce secretary Syed Asif Shah said his country had been looking at ways to expand trade within the region.

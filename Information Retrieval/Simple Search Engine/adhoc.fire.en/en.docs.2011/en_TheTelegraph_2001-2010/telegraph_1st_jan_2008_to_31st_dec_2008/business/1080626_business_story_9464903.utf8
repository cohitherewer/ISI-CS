	New Delhi, June 25 (pti): ge Money India, which has been scouting for an equity partner for its personal loan and mortgage business for the last six months, has decided to go solo.        
	The company is the domestic consumer finance arm of the US-based General Electric Co and is also present in segments such as home loans and credit cards in partnership with Wizard and the State Bank of India, respectively.        
	The partnership model in other businesses had prompted it to look for a partner for its wholly owned portfolio for personal loan and mortgage business.        
	After careful consideration, we have concluded that the best alternative for the company at this time is to retain the portfolio as it is, ge Money India president and ceo Iqbal Singh said.        
	The operational changes that have been effected have led to significant improvements in the overall cost structure and performance, and the company believes that there is an opportunity to drive growth organically, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance acquires US plant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reliance acquires US plant
                            
	New York, June 21 (PTI): Reliance Industries USA, part of the Mukesh Ambani group, will invest $215 million (about Rs 900 crore) and create over 200 new jobs at a newly acquired polyester plant in the US.        
	According to a regulatory filing here, Reliance Industries USA has acquired a polyester manufacturing facility in North Carolina for about $12.2 million from Unifi Kinston, where it plans to invest $215 million. The investment will also generate over 200 jobs at the plant in the next five years.        
	In a separate statement, North Carolina governor Michael F. Easley said Reliance Industries USA would open its first north American manufacturing facility near Kinston.        
	From the sale proceeds, Unifi Kinston will pay $3.6 million to DuPont as part of demolition and removal of obligations created by the asset sale. US-listed DuPont had a manufacturing alliance with Unifi. Unifi Kinston expects to record a gain of about $6.9 million upon completion of the sale.         
	According to the nine-year agreement with North Carolina department of commerce, Reliance Industries USA could get about $2.22 million in maximum benefits if it could generate jobs called for under the pact. Should the company create the jobs called for under the agreement and sustain them for nine years, the agreement could yield as much as $2.22 million in maximum benefits for Reliance Industries USA, the statement noted.        
	Further, Unifi Kinston, a wholly owned subsidiary of Unifi Inc, said it anticipated the acquisition to close by the first half of its fiscal 2009.        
	However the closing is subject to customary due diligence and closing procedures and ....Registrant (Unifi Kinston) makes no assurance that the sale will close during this time period or at all, the filing added. Reliance Industries USA plans to lease part of the Lenoir county DuPont facility formerly operated by Unifi and plans to manufacture polyethylene terephthalate resin and speciality polyester yarns.        
	The average annual wage will be about $46,500 without including benefits.        
	Reliance chose Lenoir county over other locations because of the availability of an existing, adaptable facility, the areas long history in the polyester industry, the available skilled workforce and training capabilities, proximity to customers, and state and local incentives which will help offset the high cost of establishing a major manufacturing facility, Reliance Industries USA president Thakur Sharma said.

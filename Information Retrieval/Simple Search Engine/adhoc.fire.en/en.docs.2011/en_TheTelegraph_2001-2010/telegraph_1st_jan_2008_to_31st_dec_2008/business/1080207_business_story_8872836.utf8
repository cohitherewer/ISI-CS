          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: Real estate giant Emaar MGF was forced to slash the price of its shares and extend the closure date of its initial public offering (IPO) till February 11 after failing to attract enough bids.        
	The company cut the price of its share to Rs 530 at the lower end of its price band from Rs 540 earlier.        
	The writing was on the wall yesterday itself but its bookrunners were confident that they would be able to raise the required subscription by close on Wednesday.        
	It wasnt to be: the company raised bids for just 74.69 per cent of the 10.25 crore shares on offer.         
	Under the rules, an IPO must raise 90 per cent subscription (including a 10 per cent devolvement on the lead managers) to qualify for listing on the bourses.        
	The company decided to play safe and keep the issue open till Monday to head off any devolvement on the lead managers  an ignominy that issuers always want to avoid.        
	Emaar MGF Land, which floated its offering on February 1, had originally fixed its IPO in the price band of Rs 610 to Rs 690, but later scaled it down to Rs 540 to Rs 630 citing poor demand from investors.        
	Emaar MGF Land is a joint venture between Emaar Properties PJSC of Dubai and MGF Development of India. Emaar is a globally reputed real estate company with operations in 16 countries. MGF is involved in real estate development in northern India.         
	Emaar MGF started its operations in India in February 2005. The companys primary business is the development of properties in the residential, commercial, retail and hospitality sectors.

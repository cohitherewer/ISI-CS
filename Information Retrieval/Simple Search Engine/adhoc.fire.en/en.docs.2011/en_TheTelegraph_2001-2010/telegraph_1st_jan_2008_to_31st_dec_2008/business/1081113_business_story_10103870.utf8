                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Industrial growth at 4.8%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Industrial output rose 4.8 per cent in September after growing just 1.4 per cent in August.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram considers the September figures encouraging, while analysts feel the numbers indicate a persisting slowdown which should prompt the government to come out with measures that are specific to industries. In September 2007, industrial growth was much higher at 7 per cent.         
	The index of industrial production (IIP) for September is down because of declining output in manufacturing, which recorded a growth of 4.8 per cent against 7.4 per cent during the same period a year ago. Manufacturing accounts for 80 per cent of the index.        
	After the poor results in August 2008, the quick estimates of IIP for September 2008 are more encouraging. However, I maintain that data collection must be improved and made more relevant or more contemporary and universal, Chidambaram said in a statement here.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil, said, The numbers are a clear indication of a slowdown in the economy. The Reserve Bank of India could cut interest rates further and the government could come out with sector-specific measures to boost industrial growth.        
	Revenue collections by the excise and customs authorities, which are an indicator of a nations manufacturing capabilities, dipped 5 per cent in October. Exports, too, are expected to fall 15 per cent in October, increasing the fears of an economic slowdown, analysts said.        
	A liquidity crunch and a lower demand have affected manufacturing. Cumulative growth during the first six months of this fiscal was 4.9 per cent against 9.5 per cent in the corresponding period of the last fiscal.        
	Chidambaram said growth in the capital goods industry at 18.8 per cent was impressive, while that in the consumer goods, mining and power industries was satisfactory.        
	Analysts said growth in consumer goods was because of the festive season. Cotton textiles, wood and wood products, furniture and fixtures and leather and leather products registered negative growth.

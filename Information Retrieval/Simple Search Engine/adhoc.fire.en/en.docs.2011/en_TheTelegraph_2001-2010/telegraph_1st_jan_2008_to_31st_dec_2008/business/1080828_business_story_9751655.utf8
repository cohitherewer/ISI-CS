          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella association of nine trade unions of bank employees in the country, has called for a two-day nationwide bank strike on September 24 and 25.         
	Ashok Datta, general secretary of the State Bank of India Staff Association (Bengal Circle) said, The strike has been called against the governments renewed thrust on banking sector reforms through privatisation, introduction of outsourcing in a larger scale, deletion of Section 12(2) of Banking Regulation Act relating to voting rights by shareholders in banks, merger of public sector banks, allowing foreign banks unrestricted entry and the implementation of Raghuram Rajan Committee recommendation. Datta is also the convenor of the state forum of the UFBU.        
	According to Datta, after winning the no-trust motion in Parliament following the withdrawal of support by the Left allies, the UPA government has embarked on its reform agenda, particularly in the financial sector, with a new vigour.         
	The Centre wants to carry through its unfinished reforms in the financial sector before the end of its term next year. We have seen it in the case of Employees Provident Fund Organisation where four private fund management companies were awarded the management of Rs 30,000-crore incremental contributions in the pension fund, he said.        
	As regards to the deletion or amendment of Section 12(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, we believe that it is not only against the interest of bank employees but also against the interest of the nation because it will shift control of bank management to foreign entities in case of private sector banks and to private shareholders in the case of public sector banks, Datta said.         
	Bank consumers are already facing the ill effects of outsourcing of banking activities, particularly in the credit card business, he said. The UFBU has also put forward a charter of demands.         
	The forum had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Indian Banks Association, the representative body of the bankers in the country, on various commitments pertaining to the pension option for bank employees. wage revision, and compassionate appointments.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Frown factor                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: Tourism is likely to suffer from rising fuel prices and global recession this year.         
	Both the tourism industry and the government fear a slide in the number of tourists visiting the country.        
	Tourism minister Ambika Soni said the government expected tourist inflow to rise 11 per cent to 5.57 million this year from 5 million a year ago.        
	However, the industry believes growth will be in the range of 7-8 per cent under current conditions.         
	The growth in tourist inflow, which has been steadily declining since 2004, may witness a sharper drop this year, said industry sources.        
	Spiralling fuel prices, global recession and rising interest rates will wreak havoc this year. It is a bad year for global tourism and there will be a ripple effect in India as well. Tourism is a feel-good industry. When economic factors dont look strong, it affects sentiments of travellers, said C.V Prasad, president of Travel Agents Association of India.         
	The tourism industry accounts for about 6 per cent of the gross domestic product and employs nearly 50 million people.         
	The government said it was working towards attracting more tourists and mitigating the effect of global slowdown. The government is making efforts to encourage tourist inflow. This includes developing tourist infrastructure, particularly budget hotels, augmenting air capacity and focusing on emerging markets such as southeast Asia, Soni said        
	Travel agents and tour operators say lack of accommodation and rising hotel tariffs are also adding to the problem.        
	There is a huge shortage of rooms and tariffs are going through the roof. Hoteliers are charging exorbitant rates in Indian currency because of the devaluation of dollar. This is discouraging tourists, said P.K. Sarkar, secretary of the Indian Association of Tour Operators.        
	The rise in fuel prices is causing more uncertainty. It will have a tremendous impact on travel expenses and will discourage travellers, Prasad said.         
	The cost of aviation fuel has risen because of the rise in crude prices to around $130-135 a barrel.         
	The current target is to increase the number of foreign tourist arrivals in India to 10 million by 2010.

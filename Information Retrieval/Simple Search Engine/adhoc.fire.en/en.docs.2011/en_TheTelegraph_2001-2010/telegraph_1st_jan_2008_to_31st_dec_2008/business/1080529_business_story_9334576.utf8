                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Defence foray high on Bose agenda
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 28: Acoustics firm Bose Corporation India Pvt Ltd is exploring opportunities in the Indian defence sector.        
	In the US, the companys products are extensively used by the airforce and commercial pilots.        
	We are exploring opportunities in the Indian defence sector. Bose has traditionally been very strong in the US defence segment. However, for the Indian market we have to figure out what is required and where can our products come in, a Bose official said.        
	The company plans to showcase technology that can be used by the defence sector by participating in defence exhibitions around the country.        
	Bose had begun work on its noise reduction technology during the Voyager mission. The technology is incorporated into products used by private and commercial pilots and the US military.         
	The companys Indian operations do not provide noise reduction technology.        
	However, with the current boom in commercial airlines in the country, Bose aims to launch products such as Aviator Headset X for pilots.        
	The Indian defence sector plans to spend $30 billion on imported equipment over the next four years.         
	The country will buy fighter jets and multirole transport aircrafts, which can provide Bose with one of the largest markets for its products in defence outside the US.         
	Automotive systems        
	Bose is planning to tap the luxury car market in the country.         
	The company works with 16 original equipment manufacturers for car stereo systems.         
	Only Audi products have Bose stereo systems in India.        
	However, a slew of luxury car manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes have set up a manufacturing base in India and Bose plans to join hands with them.

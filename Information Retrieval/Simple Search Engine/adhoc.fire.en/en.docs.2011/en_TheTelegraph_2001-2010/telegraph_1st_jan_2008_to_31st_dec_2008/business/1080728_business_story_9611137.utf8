                                I am 85-years-old and have invested Rs 5 lakh in a fixed deposit with a foreign bank. I had submitted Form 15H to the bank on May 12 this year. I have no PAN card. In financial year 2007-08, my total interest income was Rs 34,000. I have no other income besides the interest income. The bank is insisting me to apply for PAN and has deducted tax at source despite filing Form 15H. Can the bank deduct tax at source?          K. Devi, Calcutta
                    k is bound to deduct tax on interest income at source if the total interest income from all deposits in the name of one person exceeds Rs 10,000 in a financial year and if Form 15H is not submitted before April 10. In your case, you have submitted Form 15H on May 12. So, the bank was right in deducting tax on the interest income for April and May. However, it will not and cannot deduct tax on interest from June onwards. Youll have to submit Form 15H for every financial year and it has to be given before April 10. Anyone can apply for PAN, irrespective of whether one pays income tax or not.                                     No attachments      I would like to know whether it is mandatory for a salaried person to submit Form 16 along with income tax return?        Sekher Nath Niyogi, Chinsurah
                    come tax return forms have been made annexure less. This means you dont have to attach any document, including Form 16, with your IT return.                         Share worry      I bought 600 shares for Rs 18,000 in my wifes name in 1995. Now I want to sell these shares. The market value of these shares would be around Rs 3 lakh. Will she have to pay any income tax?        Niloy Krishna Biswas, Dum Dum
                    Your wife wont have to pay any income tax on the capital gains from the sale of those shares, provided these are sold through a recognised stock exchange and the security transaction tax is paid. Youll have to sell these shares through a broker who is registered with either the Bombay Stock Exchange or the National Stock Exchange.

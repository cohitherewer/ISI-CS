The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Global cues stay strong
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Global cues stay strong
                                          
	New York/London, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Global stocks roared back from five-year lows on Tuesday as investors cheered a thaw in credit markets while Iceland hiked interest rates massively in a desperate attempt to save its currency from the global financial turmoil.        
	Investors expect major economies to cut rates, starting with the United States on Wednesday and Europe and Britain to follow next week, in an effort to head off a deep recession.        
	The Dow jumped 4 per cent in early trading, coming on the heels of a worldwide rally that started in Japan, where stocks closed 6.4 per cent higher  but only after hitting a 26-year low. European shares were up nearly 4 per cent.        
	Japan restricted investor bets on falling share prices to try to end its stock market slide, and its Prime Minister delayed calling a parliamentary election to concentrate on protecting the worlds second biggest economy from recession.        
	The question for many, however, was how long this stock market recovery could last.        
	Theres nothing to suggest that anything has changed radically, said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist, at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. Its not significant. The fundamental weakness is still there. We saw a recovery in an oversold market in Asia.        
	Closely watched rates on loans between banks eased, showing efforts by central banks to lower borrowing costs were making progress although a further reduction was needed to restore the financial system to normal functioning.

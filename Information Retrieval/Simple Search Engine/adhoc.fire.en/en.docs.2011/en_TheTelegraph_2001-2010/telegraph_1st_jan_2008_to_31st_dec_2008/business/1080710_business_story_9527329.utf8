          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 9: Core industries grew at a sluggish pace of 3.5 per cent in May compared with 7.8 per cent in the corresponding period last year, hit by rising borrowing costs and lower demand.        
	In April, the core sector growth was at 3.6 per cent. The six core industries  power, cement, coal, steel, crude oil and petroleum products  account for 26.68 per cent of the countrys industrial output.        
	The slowdown in the infrastructure sector will have an adverse impact on industrial growth, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with the credit rating agency Crisil.        
	Analysts said growth in the infrastructure sector had slowed down partly because of the rise in the cost of raw materials and borrowings, along with lower demand from the construction and other sectors.         
	Joshi said the new political formation could lead to the divestment of some public sector companies to mop up resources as the government faces fiscal pressure because of the mounting subsidy bill of fertiliser and oil.        
	On other reform measures, the analysts said, The countrys macro-economic scenario is not that good and the government will be fighting inflation and taking political measures to fight the polls.        
	According to data released today, growth in these sectors declined to 3.5 per cent during first two months of the current fiscal from 6.9 per cent in the same period last year.        
	Power generation growth, which has a weightage of 10.17 per cent in the index of industrial production, declined to 2 per cent in May this year from 9.3 per cent in the year-ago period. In April-May, the power sector grew just 1.7 per cent compared with 9 per cent in the first two months of the last fiscal.        
	However, coal, finished steel and cement registered a growth rate of 8.3 per cent, 5.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent in May, respectively, against 0.5 per cent, 8.4 per cent and 9.9 per cent, a year ago. Crude oil production grew 3.2 per cent in May compared with a negative growth rate of 1.6 per cent a year ago. In April-May, crude oil grew 2.1 per cent against a negative growth rate of 0.1 per cent during corresponding period last year.

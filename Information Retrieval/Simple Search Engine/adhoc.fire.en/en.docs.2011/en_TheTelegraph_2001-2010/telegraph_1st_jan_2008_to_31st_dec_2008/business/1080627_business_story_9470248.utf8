          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, June 26: Surging inflation, fuelled by energy and commodity prices coupled with interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), could pull down Indias economic growth to 7.8 per cent from the projected eight per cent this fiscal, Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) said today.        
	The global rating agency expects inflation to average 8.5-9.0 per cent this year.        
	The RBI, on Tuesday, hiked the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by half a percentage point each.         
	S amp;P feels the central bank may increase the repo rate again, despite raising it twice during June to battle inflation. Higher interest rates are expected to moderate growth even further.        
	According to Subir Gokarn, chief economist, S amp;P Asia Pacific, We expect the inflation rate to average 8.5 to 9.0 per cent during 2008-09. Food price scenarios have improved somewhat, given the comfortable levels of wheat stocks and expectations of a normal monsoon this year.        
	Gokarn said soaring oil prices, high input costs and the depreciating rupee continued to exacerbate inflationary pressures. High interest rates along with a slowing global economy would trim GDP growth to 7.8 per cent in 2008-09.        
	S amp;P added that rising inflation, a slowdown forecast and turmoil in the global financial markets had dampened investor confidence and led to a foreign capital outflow.        
	 This has caused the rupee, which was already under pressure from a rising oil import bill, to depreciate sharply.

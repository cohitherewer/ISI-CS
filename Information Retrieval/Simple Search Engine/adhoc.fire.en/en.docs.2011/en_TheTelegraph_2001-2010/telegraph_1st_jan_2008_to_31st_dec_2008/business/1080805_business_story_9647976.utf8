                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       R-Com to offer 3G via GSM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Glad tidings                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) is likely to take the GSM route to roll out 3G services.         
	Company sources said the telecom major was planning to invest around Rs 2,000 crore to acquire 3G electronic equipment. Plagued by an 11 per cent fall in average revenue per user (ARPU) and a 4 per cent drop in EBITDA in the June quarter, the CDMA major is hoping to raise its ARPU through its GSM ambitions.        
	R-Com is aiming to set up a world class 3G network with data speed of up to 100 Mbps, which is high-speed connectivity that will help in instant downloads, including video traffic images, said sources.        
	The company has been the first player to make an announcement on its 3G plans after the department of telecom unveiled its policy last Friday. R-Com is planning to lay a 3G network over and above its existing GSM network.         
	In the first phase of the 3G launch, the company is looking to deploy a 3G network that can support high-speed downlink packet access technology for data speeds of up to 40 Mbps.         
	The company is learnt to be giving the final touch to its 3G blueprint, which would provide high-quality voice and data services with indoor and outdoor coverage in 1,000 cities of India.         
	The 3G network would provide a seamless experience on 2G networks, too, if the subscriber moves beyond the 1,000 cities, officials said.        
	However, the company spokesperson refused to say whether R-Com would bid for 3G spectrum for its CDMA services also.        
	For its 3G plans, the company will be riding on the passive infrastructure of its subsidiary Reliance Infratel, which will lease out around 25,000 towers to load third-generation GSM electronics.         
	Trai move        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked gsm mobile service providers, including Bharti and Vodafone, to provide inter-connectivity to R-Com for starting its services in dual technology. The telecom watchdog also cautioned that action would be taken against operators for non-compliance.

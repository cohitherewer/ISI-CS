          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pascal Lamy with Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Tuesday. (A Telegraph picture)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: India and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) today called for the resumption of global trade talks that broke down last month, without fixing a time frame.        
	At an industry meet, attended by WTO director-general Pascal Lamy, commerce minister Kamal Nath said, India is committed to the multilateral system, but when we resume (WTO talks), I urge you (developed countries) to come to the table looking not for what you can get, but what you can give.         
	Its a question of attitude  I cant negotiate attitude, I cant negotiate mindset, the minister said. Lamy said that after the trade talks reached a dead end last month, WTO member states had urged him to push ahead and not to throw in the towel.         
	The good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward, and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the WTO members had agreed since last year, that is end-2008, Lamy said        
	He said the talks on eliminating tariffs in industry and agriculture could succeed if all the parties reached suitable political understanding on the issues.        
	Nath said the focus of the talks should be to reduce poverty in the world and not just to increase the prosperity of the wealthy nations.        
	He called upon the developed countries to cut huge subsidies on agriculture to provide a level-playing field to the developing nations         
	Nath said the revival of the weakest and not survival of the fittest should form the core of the negotiations.

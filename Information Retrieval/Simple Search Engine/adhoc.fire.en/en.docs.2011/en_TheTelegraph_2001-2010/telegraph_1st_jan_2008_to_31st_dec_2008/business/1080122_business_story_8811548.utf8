     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: It is the death of euphoria, but the show will go on. 
    
	Last week, Anil Ambanis Reliance Power received bids worth Rs 7.5 trillion, turning it into India Incs biggest IPO.
    
	Manic Monday had a sobering effect: the pundits said the long line of new issuers could still hope to raise money but they shouldnt count on unrealistic subscription levels.
    
	The experts believe that the mayhem on the secondary market will definitely have a slight rub off on the primary market. The subscription levels will come down to a more realistic level. Valuations of some of the IPOs will start becoming realistic. Even the merchant bankers will look at better valuations for their IPOs. But I see the markets settling down in a day or two. By Wednesday, the market should be more settled, said Harjit Singh Sethi, chief executive of Almondz Securities Ltd.
    
	When it comes to the listing gains, marketmen believe that its a function of sentiments at the time of listing. There are two big events that are due at the end of the month  the RBI credit policy and the US Fed meeting to decide on rate cuts. The market can just pick up positive cues from there and bounce back. Listing gains are purely a matter of sentiment at the time the shares are listed, added Sethi. 
    
	The primary and secondary markets are quite interlinked. In that sense, I do see some impact, but there wont be a long-term impact. The market will settle down in a day or two. The valuations were realistic and they will continue to be so, said Vallabh Bhansali, chairman of Enam Securities Ltd, which was one of the book-running lead managers to the Reliance Power issue.

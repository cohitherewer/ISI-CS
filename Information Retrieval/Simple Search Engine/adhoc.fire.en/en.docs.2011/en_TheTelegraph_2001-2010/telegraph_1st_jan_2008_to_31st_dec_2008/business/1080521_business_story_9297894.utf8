          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Raja: Awaiting development                           
	New Delhi, May 20: Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM) will soon demonstrate to the government ways to monitor emails sent through BlackBerry devices. The meeting is likely to take place in the middle of June.        
	Several meetings were held between the government and RIM. They (RIM) will now come and demonstrate what solutions they have for the questions mooted from the security point of view, telecom minister A. Raja said on the sidelines of a telecom conference in Malaysia.        
	Department of telecom (DoT) officials said RIM might provide translation codes, which would enable security agencies to monitor emails.        
	BlackBerry mobile phones send data at 256 bits in a coded form using high-level encryption technology. The messages are scrambled before being sent and are unscrambled on the receiving device.         
	The governments software can decode encrypted messages of only up to 40 bits. Security agencies contend that since they cannot monitor emails sent from a BlackBerry, it poses a threat to the countrys safety. Terrorists can use the device to exchange information, without the agencies being aware. The government has therefore asked RIM to either disclose the decrypting keys or reduce encryption to 40 bits.         
	Reducing encryption, however, is not a viable solution as it can lead to hackers accessing sensitive information, such as credit card details.        
	If RIM hands over decrypting keys, it will be the first time the company will allow any government to take a peek into BlackBerrys email architecture, which it bills as its key selling feature.         
	RIM operates in more than 135 countries around the world and respects the regulatory requirements of governments. RIM does not comment on confidential regulatory matters or speculation on such matters in any given country, a RIM spokesperson said.        
	The BlackBerry issue came into the open earlier this year when the DoT refused permission to Tata Teleservices to launch the service on the grounds of security agencies not having a system in place to monitor data and email sent between BlackBerrys devices.

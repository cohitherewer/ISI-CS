	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Reliance Power plans to raise the capacity of its two mega power projects to beyond the government-stipulated 4000MW.
    
	This is because the company believes there are no tariff restrictions on an additional generation of power.
    
	The company has won the pit head-based Sasan power project in Madhya Pradesh and imported coal-based Krishnapatnam project in Andhra Pradesh. 
    
	We are free to create additional capacity and sell it to anybody of our choice. I do not think there are any restrictions on that, Reliance Power chairman Anil Ambani said here today.
    
	The company had quoted a tariff of Rs 1.19 per unit for Sasan and Rs 2.33 for Krishnapatnam. Ambani, here to sell Reliance Powers Rs 11,000-crore initial public offering (IPO), said the company was in talks with entities for coal mining rights abroad. 
    
	Annual requirements of coal for the two projects are around 14-17 million tonnes.
    
	Reliance Power has also bid for the Tilaiya mega power project in Jharkhand. In power equipment, which it wants to make, Reliance Power is in talks with two to three multinationals for a co-operation agreement. This could be in the form of a joint venture or the sourcing of equipment such as turbines and boilers, Ambani said.
    
	In the next few months, you will hear some news on this, he added
    
	Gas thaw
    
	Ambani said he saw an end to the dispute with Reliance Industries, promoted by brother Mukesh, over gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin
    
	 I am confident we will have a win-win solution from this, in Reliance Industries as a gas producer and Reliance Power as a gas consumer.
    
	He said the company might consider investing in the Dabhol power plant when the government allowed private sector participation. 
    
	The company was also interested in investing in other state-owned power generating units.
    
	Ambani said Reliance Power would soon write to the Securities and Exchange Board of India over the removal of quotas on different categories of investors in an IPO.

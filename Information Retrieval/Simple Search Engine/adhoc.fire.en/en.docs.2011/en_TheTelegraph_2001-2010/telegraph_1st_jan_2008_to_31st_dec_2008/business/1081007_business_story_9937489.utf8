The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Europe rushes to protect investors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Europe rushes to protect investors
                                          
	London/Berlin, Oct. 6 (Reuters): More European governments followed Germanys lead on Monday offering guarantees to savers in a frantic effort to calm fears among investors over the worst financial crisis in 80 years.        
	However, the moves failed to comfort financial markets as investors from Tokyo to London slashed risk from portfolios and positioned for a further tightening of credit and bank lending and the rising risk of a serious global economic recession.        
	Despite concerted efforts to stem the crisis, investors were clearly seeking more concrete steps from authorities, perhaps in the form of coordinated action from next weekends meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations.        
	Governments across the globe battled to restore confidence. South Korea said it wanted crisis talks with Japan and China.         
	Sweden became the latest European Union country to act, with the government saying it would expand bank deposit guarantees and the central bank raising the amount of loans offered to banks.        
	It followed Germanys pledge on Sunday to guarantee private deposit accounts, a move that spurred similar action by Austria and Denmark. Ireland issued the first such guarantee last week, prompting criticism of a fragmented European Union response.        
	In Spain, economy minister Pedro Solbes said the government was prepared to guarantee deposits unilaterally if the European Union did not act.        
	The various deposit guarantee moves were putting intense pressure on countries such as Britain, which face the prospect of a drain in deposits from their banks.        
	Britains government promised on Monday it would not leave ordinary savers unprotected but said it had no plans to respond immediately to the surprise move by Germany.        
	German finance minister Peer Steinbrueck said Berlin was working on a new plan to protect the entire German banking sector, not just individual institutions that came under stress.

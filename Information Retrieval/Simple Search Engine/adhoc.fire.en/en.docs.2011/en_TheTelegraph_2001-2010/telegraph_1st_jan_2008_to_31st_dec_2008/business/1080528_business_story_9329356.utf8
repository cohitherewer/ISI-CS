          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Paswan: Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: The governments fertiliser subsidy bill will rise to Rs 95,013 crore in 2008-09 against Rs 40,340 crore in the previous year because of rising international prices, said chemical and fertiliser secretary J.S. Sarma.        
	There has been a significant increase in international prices, he said.        
	Fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan said a new investment policy for the fertiliser sector was likely to be finalised in the next two to three weeks to encourage the setting up of new plants and the expansion of existing units.        
	Indian fertiliser manufacturers are subsidised to compensate for a shortfall in revenue as they have to sell some products at government-mandated prices.         
	Paswan said urea prices had risen to $600 per tonne from $200 per tonne in the international market, while diammonium phosphate (DAP) has witnessed a staggering surge to $1,270 a tonne from $207.        
	Despite the rise in international prices, we have ensured adequate supplies of fertilisers. DAP imports are likely to touch 6.5 million tonnes this year against 2.9 million tonnes a year ago, Paswan said.         
	Paswan said his ministry was considering converting naphtha-based fertiliser units into gas-based ones, as the petroleum ministry had promised sufficient gas supplies.         
	He said 30 per cent of the fertiliser units in India ran on naphtha, which was more expensive than gas. We are getting 29 mms cubic metres of gas against a requirement of 41 mms cubic metres, Paswan said.         
	The government may allow companies building fertiliser plants or adding capacities to link prices to global rates, said Sarma. About the fertiliser investment policy, he said, the policy may be ready in the next two to three weeks.        
	units planned under the new policy will get price parity with international rates to attract investment in the sector.        
	Earlier, Paswan had said the new fertiliser pricing policy would be benchmarked with international prices. However, the price may be 5 per cent less than international prices when the costs of domestic fertilisers are calculated, Sarma said.

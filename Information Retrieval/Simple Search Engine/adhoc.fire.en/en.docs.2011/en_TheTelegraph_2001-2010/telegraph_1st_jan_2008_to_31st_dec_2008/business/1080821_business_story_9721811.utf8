	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government has decided to sell around 40 lakh tonnes of wheat in the open market and stop all incentives to sugar exporters to rein in inflation which is expected to cross 12.5 per cent in the coming weeks.         
	At its meeting tomorrow, the cabinet will take a call on the release of wheat.         
	The government had bought 225 lakh tonnes of the foodgrain from farmers this year.         
	Wheat price now stands at Rs 11,000 a tonne and rice at Rs 15,000 a tonne, which are about 20-30 per cent higher than last year.         
	Officials said the plan to sell wheat should have a cooling effect on prices ahead of the festive season when commodities usually turn costlier.         
	The sale is not expected to dent the governments stocks because it has made record procurement this year at almost double of last years purchases.         
	Finance ministry officials said, Inflation has largely been commodity-centric and that is why besides curbing money supply by raising interest rates, we have been concentrating on steps aimed at increasing the availability of commodities in the market.         
	To keep prices stable, the government is planning to end all incentives to sugar exporters. Sugar prices have shot up by Rs 2 a kilo in the last month. Prices in the futures markets are steadily going up, raising fears that the commodity will turn costlier during the festive season.         
	Officials said the monthly release of levy sugar had also been raised to 1.2 million tonnes.        
	The sugar trade is normally tightly controlled by the government, which sets monthly and quarterly quotas, which mills can sell freely in the market.        
	However, officials said, the price of the sensitive commodity had risen from around Rs 14,000 a tonne in the wholesale market last year to nearly Rs 18,000 a tonne now.        
	The government not only sells sugar to poor families through ration shops but also controls the buffer stock which it releases in the open market at times to keep prices in check.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram (centre) with Sikkim chief minster Pawan Chamling (left) and Union minister for development of North East Mani Shankar Aiyar in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The government wants banks to strictly follow prudential norms to avoid being drawn into the financial crisis that has swept through the US and Europe.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram said banks should function as banks and not try to take over the role of the state or civil society organisations to bring about development.        
	A banker can only be a banker. If he tries to be something else, we will face the same crisis as the US and Europe are facing today, he said at a special banking summit on northeastern states held here today.        
	According to finance ministry officials, North Block has been closely monitoring the banks books and their projections for non-performing assets since the US financial crisis. Rural, real estate, home loans as well as some categories of industrial loans were under special scrutiny.         
	The minister said the crux of the US sub-prime crisis lay in the failure of borrowers to repay loans to banks.        
	Look at the consequence. The entire banking system in the West stands frozen today. Nobody is lending to anyone despite the US Fed pumping in billions of dollars. Nobody lends a pie to anyone. The chairman of one of the largest banks in the world told me that his bank has stopped lending since January 2008, he said.        
	On demands that the scope of the governments Rs 71,000-crore farm loan waiver be expanded, Chidambaram said, A bank has to be a bank. And the bank can only be a bank if the money that is lent comes back to the bank.        
	According to the original scheme announced by Chidambaram earlier this year, the government will completely write off loans given to all small and marginal farmers having up to five acres of land and waive 25 per cent of loans to bigger farmers who are willing pay back outstanding dues.        
	Later, the government modified the scheme to include all farmers, including those with large holdings in 237 identified dry and arid districts.         
	After this, there have been demands that the relief extended to drought-prone districts be extended to other places, including the Northeast.

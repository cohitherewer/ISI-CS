	Mumbai, June 4: India is placed second to Vietnam in a Grant Thornton listing of private sector employment growth across countries.         
	In a study on employment growth, Grant Thornton said growth in India was 12 per cent in 2007 compared with 11 per cent a year ago. Growth in Vietnam for 2007 was 14 per cent.        
	Indias growth in percentage terms is very good. But we still remain at number two because of the large base. Countries such as Vietnam, with 14 per cent growth, and Armenia, with 13 per cent growth, have topped because of smaller bases. We are a huge country with a very large base, said Vinamra Shastri, national staff partner, Grant Thornton India, to The Telegraph.        
	Among the cities in India, Bangalore topped the list with 16 per cent growth in employment, followed by Chennai, Pune and Ahmedabad at 14 per cent. Mumbai and Delhi showed a growth rate of only 9 per cent this year.        
	Globally, the high fuel price, inflation and slowdown in the global economy have not impacted employment in privately held businesses. Employment in privately held businesses across the globe is up four per cent in 2007 against three per cent a year ago.

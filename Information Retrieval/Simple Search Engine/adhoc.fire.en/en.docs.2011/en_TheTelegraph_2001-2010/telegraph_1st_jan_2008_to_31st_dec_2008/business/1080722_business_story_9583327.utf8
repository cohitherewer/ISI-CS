          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           BITTER DOSE                                  
	Mumbai, July 21: Dr Reddys Laboratories (DRL) will buy out the stakes of Citigroup Venture Capital and ICICI Venture Funds Management Company in research and development firm Perlecan Pharma.        
	DRL will be buying 85 per cent from these venture capital firms for $18.50 million.        
	Perlecan was formed in 2005 with equity capital from Citigroup Venture, ICICI Venture and DRL.         
	Though the reasons for the exit of the two firms are not known, it is understood that they were not happy with the new chemical entities with Perlecan.         
	When it was formed, Citigroup Venture and ICICI Venture contributed $22.5 million each and DRL $7.5 million towards Perlecan Pharmas initial equity capital. DRL then transferred four of its new chemical entities to Perlecan.         
	However, Perlecan did not see much success in developing the chemical entities.        
	Net profit dips        
	DRL has reported its first-quarter results for the period ended June 30. The net profit of the company has dipped 26 per cent to Rs 134.6 crore compared with Rs 182.5 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	The Hyderabad-based companys total revenue rose to Rs 1,503.8 crore.         
	DRL said that revenue from the global generic business increased 25 per cent to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 830 crore. It said that growth was driven by sales in the key markets of North America, Russia and Germany.

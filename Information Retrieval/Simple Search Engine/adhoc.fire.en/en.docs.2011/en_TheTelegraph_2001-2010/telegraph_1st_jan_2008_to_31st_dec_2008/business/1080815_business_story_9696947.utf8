          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Inflation galloped to a 16-year high of 12.44 per cent for the week ended August 2, on the back of higher fruit and fuel prices. In the previous week, inflation was at 12.01 per cent.        
	After being nearly stable for four weeks, this rise has come as a major disappointment, finance minister P. Chidambaram said.         
	However, Chidambaram took comfort from the inflation rate of 30 essential commodities, which fell to 6.54 per cent from 6.66 per cent in the previous week. Inflation was 4.39 per cent a year ago.        
	We expect inflation to remain elevated and reach 13.5 per cent by December, said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.         
	Analysts said inflation might accelerate because of the cabinet approval to the pay panel recommendations.        
	The government today announced an average increase of 21 per cent in the salaries of over 50 lakh government employees.        
	Chidambaram said the impact of increased salaries on inflation was taken into account by the cabinet. The higher wages will cost the government around Rs 22,000 crore this year.         
	The analysts said with the Reserve Bank of India targeting inflation of 7 per cent in the year to March, another round of interest rate hike might be on the horizon.         
	While fruit prices went up by 8.9 per cent, pulses became dearer by 1.4 per cent during the week.        
	In fuel, the price of light diesel oil rose 16 per cent, bitumen and furnace oil went up 8 per cent and aviation turbine fuel, 3 per cent.        
	In the food basket, cereals became costlier by 0.5 per cent and condiments turned expensive by 2.6 per cent. Prices of vegetables, however, declined by 3.7 per cent.        
	Inflation for the week ended June 7, which witnessed an increase in the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, was revised to 11.66 per cent from 11.05 per cent.

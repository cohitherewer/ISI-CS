The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ore export battle intensifies
                                                                                                               Ore export battle intensifies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Iron ore exporters and steel makers are now at loggerheads over a steel ministry proposal to impose 25 per cent duty on ore exports.         
	While steel firms are in favour of the duty, the mining industry is fighting tooth and nail to either scrap the duty or get it reduced.        
	The steel industry, which wants to keep the ore at home for its internal consumption, has found a friend in Left parties which favour the duty.         
	Backing the steel bigwigs  SAIL, Tata Steel, Jindals and the Ruias of Essar  is the Calcutta-based Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which represents the interests of smaller steel makers.        
	According to Vishambhar Saran, vice-president of the ICC, Export of iron ore with ferrous content below 62 per cent should be regulated and canalised by the government and subsequently phased out in a progressive manner.        
	He said exports should be reduced by 15 per cent every year till they reached zero by 2013. Industry chamber Assocham went one step further  it urged the government to impose 35 per cent ad valorem duty on exports.        
	Among political parties, the Left has shown an inclination to support the steel industry by opposing unrestricted exports, which has been advocated by the Hoda committee.        
	However, local units of the BJP and the Congress in Karnataka and Jharkhand have been supportive of the needs of iron ore exporters.        
	If the (steel ministrys) proposals are implemented, India will be the highest taxed country among major iron ore producing regions, Rahul N. Baldota, president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries said.         
	He said Indias iron ore reserves were sufficiently large to accommodate the needs of both the steel industry and iron ore exporters. Some 75 per cent of ore mined here is for exports. What will happen to all this if we dont export?         
	Officials said the commerce ministry was also against the duty as it could affect export obligations.        
	Steel makers, however, want the phasing out of high-grade iron ore export. They argue that high-grade ore should be used to meet domestic demand.         
	Iron ore exporters are taking a dim view of this. They say that about 83 memorandums of understanding have been signed in Jharkhand and Orissa in the past four years for setting up steel plants.         
	However, none of the mills have come up till date. In the meantime, China has proposed a long-term agreement with India for the import of iron ore.

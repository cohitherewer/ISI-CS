The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Tele IPO buzz gets louder
                                                                                                               Tata Tele IPO buzz gets louder
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CASH CHASE                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: Tata Teleservices Limited is reportedly gearing up for a listing on the bourses.        
	Though Tata Tele has denied any plans for an IPO, market sources say the Tata arm has undertaken various brand-building exercises to improve its valuation and increase market share.        
	Siddharth Khemka, a senior telecom analyst at icicidirect.com, said the recent alliance with UK-based Virgin Mobile, launch of a slew of value-added services and expansion into the GSM mobile services segment indicated that Tata Tele was looking at a public flotation.         
	A recent report by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has identified Tata Tele as the fastest growing service provider, with an increase in market share to 9.7 per cent in March 2007 from 3.5 per cent in March 2004.        
	According to Tata Tele CEO and managing director Anil Sardana, Being the fastest growing company in the sector, Tata Teles average revenue per user has been increasing steadily.        
	The high rate of growth along with new business opportunities in the telecom space require significant funding, analysts feel. While raising funds may not be a reason for Tata Tele to go public, the company may opt for an IPO as a value unlocking proposition, said Khemka. Most Tata firms are listed and analysts argue the group will like to add Tata Tele to the list.        
	Tata Tele has offloaded a 17 per cent stake through private placement to Singapores Temasek Holdings and Chennai-based entrepreneur C. Sivasankaran for around Rs 2,800 crore. The deal puts the valuation of Tata Tele at around Rs 16,500 crore.        
	However, Tata Tele may be looking for greater market participation to get a realistic value of its stock, which could be much higher considering it forms part of the Rs 1,20,000-crore Tata group, Khemka said.        
	Tata Tele has one listed arm, Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Limited, which operates in the Mumbai and Maharashtra circles.

	New Delhi, Sept. 3: India may explore the possibility of offering export and investment incentives to make the country a hub for small cars in the face of competition from rivals such as China and Thailand.        
	It has already reduced the excise duty on smaller, fuel- efficient vehicles to make the country an attractive destination.        
	In addition, the government is keen on giving tax breaks to eco-friendly cars such as electric vehicles and hybrids, if made in India. However, it is unwilling to give tax sops to imported green vehicles, top officials said.         
	The government had cut the excise duty on small cars to 12 per cent in this years budget  a move of use to the Tatas Nano and the cars that have been lined up by Americas GM, Italys Fiat and Germanys Volkswagen, besides the existing models.        
	Some 75 per cent of Indias cars are small hatchbacks whose sales have been growing about 20-25 per cent annually and are expected to rise further after the launch of the Nano.         
	Officials are banking on the sales surge to make the country a hub for small cars. However, much needs to be done because of competition from rival countries.        
	Besides, the government has removed almost all tax sops for exports, except duty drawback on imported components. Car makers, who have been lobbying hard to get reliefs, are resenting this as several countries such as Thailand provide such incentives.        
	Industry leaders are lobbying for fresh sops, hinting at a rethink on plans for new investments as the domestic market has been facing a slowdown.        
	Auto firms and the government, however, are one in demanding that the western nations should not impose non-trade barriers on export at the ongoing WTO talks.

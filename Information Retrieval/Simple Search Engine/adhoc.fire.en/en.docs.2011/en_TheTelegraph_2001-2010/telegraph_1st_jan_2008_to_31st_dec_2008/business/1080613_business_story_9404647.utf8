          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 12: Plastic product manufactures today hit out at primary polymer producers, including Bengals Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL), for erratic supply and cartelisation.        
	K. K. Seksaria, president of the Indian Plastic Federation (IPF) said the prices of various grades of plastic granules had gone up 30- 50 per cent after the Union budget. Moreover, the plastic processors are facing erratic supply from the producers, including HPL.        
	It is the duty of HPL and the Bengal government to see that state units get smooth supply and prices should not be abruptly increased, he said at a press meet in Calcutta today.        
	Responding to the IPF statement, HPL management acknowledged that there were problems in the supply side but said the company was helpless on the price front.        
	According to a company statement, The naphtha price is at an all-time high. Moreover, there is an additional 5 per cent duty on naphtha import.

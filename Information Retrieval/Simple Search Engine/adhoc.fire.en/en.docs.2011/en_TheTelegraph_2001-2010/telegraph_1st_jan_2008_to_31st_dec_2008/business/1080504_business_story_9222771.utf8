	The banks earnings for 2007-08 rose 29.94 per cent to Rs 974.75 crore from Rs 750.14 crore a year ago on a standalone basis.         
	Consolidated net profit, considering that of its subsidiary AllBank Finance and three regional rural banks, was Rs 993.98 crore.        
	The banks board has proposed a dividend of Rs 3 per share for shareholders for 2007-08.

	Well require an additional capital of Rs 1,200 crore to grow our business at the targeted rate. We aim to maintain the profitability, if not improve it, in 2008-09.

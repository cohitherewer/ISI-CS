          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 23: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today came out with both good and bad news.         
	The central bank said there were clear signs of moderation in inflationary pressures but warned that a full resolution of the current financial crisis that was spreading across markets would not happen quickly.        
	There are signs of moderation in inflationary pressures reflecting marked decline in food and fuel prices as well as augmentation of downward risks to growth from the intensification of global financial market crisis, the RBI said in its Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments Mid-Term Review 2008-09  a report that precedes its monetary and credit policy.        
	The RBI said the financial crisis was spreading across markets, institutions and countries like a contagion. There has been a breakdown of trust in inter-bank and inter-institutional lending. The reversal of such an extreme risk perception and a full resolution of the crisis will inevitably take time, it said.        
	Observers feel the comments indicate that the RBI will not hesitate to take more measures to tackle the financial crisis that has impacted Indian markets as well. Few bankers expect the central bank to again cut the repo rate tomorrow after its recent reduction of 100 basis points.        
	The RBI said it was closely monitoring the developments in the global as well as domestic financial markets and was ready to take such pre-emptive action as might be necessary to contain excess volatility in the domestic financial markets.        
	It pegged the countrys economic growth at 7.7 per cent for this fiscal and said the monetary policy would continue to focus on price control and stability in financial markets.        
	However, there was not too encouraging news on the agricultural front. The report said that as on October 10, area sown under all kharif crops at an all-India level was lower at 100.9 million hectares compared with 103.6 million hectares during the corresponding period of the previous year  a fall of 2.6 per cent.        
	While area sown under rice and oilseeds increased, that sown under coarse cereals, pulses, sugarcane and cotton declined because of floods in some parts of the country and a weak spell of rainfall during June-July, particularly in Maharashtra and Karnataka.        
	The ministry of agriculture has set the foodgrain production target for 2008-09 at 233 million tonnes. According to the first advance estimates, the kharif foodgrain production during 2008-09 at 115.3 million tonnes is likely to be lower than that of the previous year by 4.7 per cent. The decline in foodgrain production could be attributed to a fall in the production of both pulses (27.7 per cent) and coarse cereals (13.6 per cent), the report said.

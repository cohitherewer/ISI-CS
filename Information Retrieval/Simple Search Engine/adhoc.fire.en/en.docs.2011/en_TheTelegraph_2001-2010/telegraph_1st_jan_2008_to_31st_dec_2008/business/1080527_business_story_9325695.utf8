                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Adidas warms up for growth sprint
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Racing ahead                                  
	Calcutta, May 26: Adidas India will ramp up exports to one million pairs of footwear in the next few months.        
	The company also plans to expand its retail footprint in the country.        
	We globally operate on a third party contract manufacturing model. We have two footwear contract manufacturers in the country. One of them, Taiwan-based Apache in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, will soon be able to churn out one million pairs a month, said Andreas Gellner, managing director of Adidas India.         
	This will significantly increase our exports from India. Each pair being exported will cost between $14 and $15, he added.        
	The company started export operations from India two years ago.        
	Adidas has 15 apparel contract manufacturers in the country.        
	The company is also planning to increase the number of retail stores to 450 from 325 by the end of 2008.        
	Adidas India has been growing at an average rate of 30 per cent year-on-year.         
	India is one of the highest growth markets for the company.        
	Gellner said an average annual growth of 30 per cent would translate into a 20 per cent increase in production capacity.        
	However, he added that Indian prices were more competitive before the rupee appreciation set in.        
	On whether the company was looking for a third party manufacturer in Bengal, he said although the company was not actively looking for one, it was not averse to the idea.        
	We have to know more about the production climate in the state, he added.        
	Adidas has a 25 to 30 per cent share of the branded sports footwear market in the country.         
	Reebok leads the market with a 45-50 per cent share and Nike ranks third.

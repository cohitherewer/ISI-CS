                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Delay in equipment delivery hits CIL
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 17 (PTI): Coal India Ltd (CIL) might miss the production target set by the government because of delay in the procurement of large-sized foreign equipment and addressing of issues related to social sustainability and mining, a top official said.         
	Among the possible roadblocks are delays in the procurement of large-sized equipment, environmental impact of mining and social sustainability issues, CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said.        
	He, however, said the company was taking measures to ensure that the roadblocks do not hinder growth.        
	The government has fixed a production target of 520.5 million tonnes of coal for CIL by the terminal year of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2011-12).        
	To achieve it, the PSU needs large-sized equipment, mainly heavy earth-moving tools from abroad.        
	Suppliers for the requisite equipment are limited, and their hands are already full with work orders from coal companies across the globe. CIL fears a likely delay in procuring equipment.        
	To ensure that there is not much delay in seeking supply of future contracts, including equipment, CIL has introduced an Integrity Pact a tool used worldwide to fight corruption in public contracting for its vendor community.        
	With the introduction of the pact, it is expected that large-scale global procurement for all future contracts of CIL will be speedier, a senior CIL official said. The official said that the company had also appointed independent external monitors to look into the tender evaluation process.         
	NHPC backlog        
	As many as three of the seven hydro-electric projects, which are proposed to be funded from the proceeds of the initial public issue by the state-owned NHPC Ltd, are running behind schedule.        
	The power projects, which will miss the deadline include the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Project in Arunachal Pradesh, the 240MW Uri-II project in Jammu and Kashmir and the 160MW Teesta Low Dam-IV in Bengal, a draft offer document filed with market regulator Sebi said.

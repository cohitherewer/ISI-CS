	New Delhi, May 23: Spice Communications is planning to invest around Rs 1,200 crore this year to expand operations in Punjab and Karnataka.         
	The telecom service provider is also in talks with mobile firms to share network infrastructure.        
	Spice group, which owns Spice Communications, is also confident of getting spectrum in Andhra Pradesh soon, Dilip Modi, group president, global operations, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference.        
	In Punjab and Karnataka, we will invest $200 million to $300 million. As we get start-up spectrum for the additional four circles we have licence for, we will invest more, he said.        
	Spice has earlier applied for a pan-India telecom licence, but the department of telecommunications granted it only four circles  Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Maharashtra.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Commerce minister Kamal Nath (left) with his Egyptian counterpart Rachid Mohamed Rachid in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 15: The Centre today tried to shift the blame for high prices on state governments, citing their failure to prevent the hoarding of foodgrain.        
	According to commerce minister Kamal Nath, The state governments must ensure that there is no food hoarding and no profiteering.         
	He said the output of foodgrains and oilseeds had not dropped, and the shortage indicated that hoarding was taking place.         
	States must shoulder a larger part of the responsibility in improving supplies and preventing hoarding.        
	We have to ensure that the steps taken are in effect benefiting the consumers, so its just not one set of steps. There are a series of steps that need to be taken, he said.        
	Recent steps of the Centre to check inflation will take hold and cool prices, he said.        
	The Centre today asked individuals and companies to inform it the details of large wheat purchases on a weekly basis.        
	Buyers must submit details every Friday until June 30 and on a monthly basis until March 31, 2009, the food and consumer affairs ministry said.         
	They must tell the reasons for the purchase and the location of their warehouses where the grain is kept.        
	The government has over the past few weeks cut import duties on edible oils, banned the export of cement and non-basmati rice and withdrew export incentives on cement and steel to increase local supplies and control inflation.        
	The price of food is one of the key drivers in the consumer price index. The policy response has been aggressive with the rise in inflation. More policy measures to contain inflation are in store and will come at the cost of GDP (gross domestic product) growth, said Sonal Varma, economist with Lehman Brothers.

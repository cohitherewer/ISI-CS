	Calcutta, Jan. 5: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Ltd plans to be an aggressive bidder in the seventh round of auctions under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (Nelp). The company is keen on going solo for the nine small blocks offered this time. So far, IOC had participated in the bidding in partnerships with ONGC and Oil India.         
	This time we hope to be much more aggressive. The government has brought in changes for Nelp VII, which will enable us to examine options such as being the sole operator for the smaller blocks. Many foreign companies will also be allowed to participate. We have an open mind, IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said today on the sidelines of an interactive session at Intaglio, the business school meet of IIM Calcutta.        
	For the large blocks, the company is in talks with ONGC, Oil India, GAIL and Reliance. It has also approached a couple of foreign companies for a partnership. However, a clear idea will emerge only after the roadshows are held by the Union government.         
	IOC is sending its representatives to the overseas roadshows, which will be held in London, Houston, Calgary and Dubai to attract global players.        
	The government has put 57 oil and gas exploration blocks for bidding in the seventh round. Of these, nine are in shallow water, 19 in deep sea and 29 onshore. IOC is interested in all three. Initially, a large investment is not required and the company is open to recycled blocks, Behuria added.        
	Oil bonds        
	On raising money to compensate for under-recoveries, Behuria said the company was waiting for the decision to be taken at the upcoming meeting of the group of ministers.         
	The release of oil bonds in the last quarter will also depend on the measures taken by the Union government.

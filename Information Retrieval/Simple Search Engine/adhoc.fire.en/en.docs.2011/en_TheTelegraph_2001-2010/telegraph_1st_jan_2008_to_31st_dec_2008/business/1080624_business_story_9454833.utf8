	New Delhi, June 23: India, Pakistan and Iran have agreed to discuss the $7.6-billion gas pipeline project in Tehran next month.         
	India is also exploring a long-term contract with Nigeria for crude and LNG supply.        
	Most of the bilateral issues have been resolved. And now a trilateral meeting of oil ministers of the three countries is most likely to take place in Tehran next month, petroleum secretary M.S. Srinivasan said.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora met his Iranian counterpart Gholam Hosein Nozari at the powwow of leading oil producers and consumers in Jeddah on Sunday, where they agreed to the meeting.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee is also scheduled to visit Iran at the end of the month and is expected to discuss the pipeline.        
	At the Jeddah meet, Deora told Nigerias energy minister Odein Ajumogobia that India was interested in a long-term arrangement for crude and liquid natural gas.        
	Besides Deora, finance minister P. Chidambaram was also in Jeddah, and the Indian team used the meeting to pursue its oil security options.        
	The oil minister pushed Indias case for an exploration block in Nigeria. He also discussed energy co-operation with Venezuelas oil minister Rafael Ramirez and urged Ramirez to award an oilfield at San Cristobal to an Indian entity.        
	On the gas pipeline, officials said there were some issues that still remained to be resolved between India and Iran.        
	India wants Iran to hand over custody of the gas at the India-Pakistan border and not at Iran-Pakistan border, as has been suggested by Tehran, to cut transit risk through Pakistan. It has also opposed a a price revision clause that Iran is seeking to insert in the gas sales agreement.        
	Exploration deadline        
	The government today said the bidding date for oil and gas blocks under the seventh round of the new exploration licensing Policy will not be extended beyond June 30.

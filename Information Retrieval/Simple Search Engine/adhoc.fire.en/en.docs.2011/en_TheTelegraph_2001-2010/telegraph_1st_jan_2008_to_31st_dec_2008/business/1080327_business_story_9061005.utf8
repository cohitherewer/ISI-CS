          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Maruti Suzuki managing director Shinzo Nakanishi in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 26: Maruti Suzuki India today launched its entry-level sedan Swift Dzire to replace the Esteem.        
	The car was launched at an introductory price range of Rs 4.49 lakh to Rs 6.7 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	Dzire is Maruti Suzukis seventh model in three years. The car has both diesel and petrol variants, powered by 1.3-litre engines.        
	The petrol variant will cost between Rs 4.49 lakh and Rs 5.9 lakh, while the diesel version will carry a price tag of Rs 5.39-6.7 lakh.        
	It has a special place in our product strategy. Millions of Indians own compact cars. With growing incomes and better lifestyle, many of them want to upgrade to a sedan. However, an entry-level sedan offering style, features and performance is rare. The Dzire offers all this at an attractive price, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki.        
	The sedan offers an integrated stereo, steering-mounted audio controls, automatic climate control, power windows and dual airbags.        
	On how long the introductory price would last, Nakanishi refused to comment.         
	He, however, said the rising input costs, especially that of steel and petroleum products, were putting pressure on the margins.        
	He said Maruti Suzuki was taking measures to counter the pressure and absorb it as long as possible without passing it on to customers.        
	The company sold nearly 41,800 units of mid-size sedans in the April-February period of this fiscal.        
	According to the recent industry results published by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), this is the highest number of cars for any manufacturer in the mid-size sedan segment.

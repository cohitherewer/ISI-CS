           Anil Ambani: Big plans
             
	Mumbai, Jan. 31: After hiving off his telecom tower business into a separate company, Anil Ambani is planning to list the tower company, Reliance Infratel. 
    
	We are evaluating a number of options, Ambani said when asked about his plans to list the tower company.
    
	According to industry sources, Reliance Communications (R-Com), the parent company, has two options: it can either come out with a flotation or offload a small stake to a strategic investor.
    
	The company is considering a flotation for Flag Telecom, which manages the groups undersea communication links. 
    
	For Flag Telecom, we will take up these issues only after we integrate Yipes Holdings, which we acquired last year, with Flag and complete the acquisition, Ambani said while unveiling R-Coms results for the third quarter. In December last year, R-Com completed the acquisition of Yipes Holdings, the largest ethernet services company in the US, after receiving approvals from the US Federal Communications Commission. 
    
	Flag Telecom owns and operates a private undersea cable system spanning 65,000 route kilometres and four continents.
    
	The telecom service provider has posted a 48.5 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, at Rs 1,373 crore compared with Rs 924 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The companys total income increased to Rs 3,410.82 crore during the period from Rs 3,044.49 crore in the year-ago period.

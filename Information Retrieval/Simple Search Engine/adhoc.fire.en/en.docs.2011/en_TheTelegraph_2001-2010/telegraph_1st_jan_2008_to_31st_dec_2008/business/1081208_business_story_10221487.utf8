          JAYATI GHOSE                                              NETWORK JAM      
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: Almost a year after getting licences, new mobile phone players are yet to start operations.         
	Analysts say they may be waiting for the government to remove rollout obligations.        
	The department of telecommunications (DoT) is planning to scrap a norm that requires the players to cover 10 per cent of districts in a telecom circle in the first year.         
	Mobile firms such as Videocon-promoted Datacom Solutions, Loop Telecom, STel, Unitech Wireless, Shyam Telelink and Swan Telecom, who received licences in January this year, are required to start operations by next month.        
	None of the six players has set up a telecom tower, though most have received spectrum.         
	Two of them  Unitech and Swan  have even sold stakes to foreign investors and earned around Rs 10,000 crore, cumulatively. The players have paid Rs 1,650 crore for a 2G licence and 4.4 megahertz of start-up spectrum.        
	A new operator needs to invest about Rs 22,000 crore to roll out services across the country in the first year. The fine for not meeting the rollout obligation is Rs 7 crore per circle for an operator.        
	However, the players are in no hurry to set up towers. The DoT, too, has not been strict in implementing the deadline.        
	Telecom secretary Siddhartha Behura said, Rollout conditions are irritating. Globally, they have been removed.         
	The DoT, which has referred the issue to the Telecom Commission, has proposed the government monitor the obligation after three years. The three-year time period is fair and realistic, said Behura.         
	Within three years, the operators need to cover 50 per cent of districts in a circle. In the metros, they have to cover 90 per cent of a service area within a year.        
	3G allocation        
	The allocation of spectrum for 3G and broadband wireless access will be completed before February 2009, telecom secretary Siddhartha Behura has said.        
	The bid document has been finalised and we expect to keep the timeline, he said.        
	Behura promised that the allocation and auction of 3G would be industry-friendly. He said that there would be a pre-bid conference between the industry and the government.        
	The industry thinks we are doing a good job. We are doing our best. All circumstances cannot be foreseen. There were differences within the industry and government and they have been sorted out more or less, he said.        
	The 3G will become the predominant platform on which we will build and deliver upon Indias broadband objectives, he said.

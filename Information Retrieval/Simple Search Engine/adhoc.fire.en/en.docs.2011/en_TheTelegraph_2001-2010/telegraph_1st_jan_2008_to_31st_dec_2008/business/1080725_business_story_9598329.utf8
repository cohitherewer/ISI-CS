          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The department of telecom (DoT) has decided to waive the licence fee on rural landline telephones to boost rural telephony.         
	Taken at a recent meeting of the Telecom Commission, the decision will result in waiving of around Rs 200 crore per year.         
	In addition, the Telecom Commission has decided to reduce the levy towards the universal service obligation fund to 3 per cent of the adjusted gross revenue from 5 per cent. This is for service providers who have a presence in over 95 per cent of the rural areas, officials said.        
	The service obligation fund has been set up to provide infrastructural support for offering telecom service to remote areas at affordable prices.         
	These decisions are in line with the governments policy to promote rural telephony and accessibility in remote areas.         
	The aim is to achieve 25 per cent rural teledensity by having 200-million rural connections by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12). Rural teledensity in the country stands at around at 8 per cent as on December 31, 2007. Teledensity is the number of users per 100 people.        
	BSNL plans        
	While private players are planning to increase their rural initiative, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has already announced an investment of Rs 530 crore over the next one year to strengthen its rural infrastructure in Bengal.         
	BSNL is also looking at increasing its broadband penetration in rural Bengal through educational institutions.        
	The company has tied-up with HCL Technologies for computers with an in-built BSNL broadband facility, to popularise broadband in Bengal. The company is also offering a monthly discount on telephone bills if one avails oneself of the bundled offer.         
	BSNL is also banking on 3G for providing more value-added-services in the state.

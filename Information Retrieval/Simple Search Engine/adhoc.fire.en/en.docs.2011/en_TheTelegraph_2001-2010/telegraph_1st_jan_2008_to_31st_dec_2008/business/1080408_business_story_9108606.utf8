	New Delhi, April 7 (PTI): The new minister of state for power, Jairam Ramesh, today said he would reverse policies that put state-owned undertakings at a disadvantage and would not help the import lobby.        
	Regretting that public sector units had been put to a disadvantage in the past, Ramesh said that he had already told power ministry officials and the top brass of firms such as Bhel, NTPC and NHPC that the government would no more follow policies against their interest.        
	I am not here to help the private sector, nor I am here to help the import lobby working against the Bhel, Ramesh said.

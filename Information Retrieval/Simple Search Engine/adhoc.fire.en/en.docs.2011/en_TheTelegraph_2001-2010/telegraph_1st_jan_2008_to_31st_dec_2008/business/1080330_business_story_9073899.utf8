The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ore-rich states up the ante
                                                                                                               Ore-rich states up the ante
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          IN LINE OF FIRE                                  
	New Delhi, March 29: Five mineral-rich states have protested the mineral policy which calls for open auction of mines.        
	The chief ministers of four BJP-ruled states and a minister from Jharkhand, which is ruled by a Congress supported coalition government, has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the states right to select the best applicant (for mining rights) should not be compromised in the name of seamless transition or security of tenure and should not be usurped by the central government under any pretext.        
	The policy that the cabinet cleared recently will forbid allocation of mines to industries on the basis of promises of future investments in the state and instead bring in open auctioning of mines.         
	The Centre has been arguing that this would bring more money to the states and result in fairer allocation of resources and at the same time check corruption and arbitrariness in mine allocations.         
	Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and Jharkhand water resources minister K.K. Singh, who represented chief minister Madhu Koda, signed the memorandum after a meeting.         
	The letter demanded that a task force be set up on the issue before the mineral act was amended.        
	The government is anxious to promote free export of minerals to satisfy multinational mining companies... If the policy is accepted as it is, it may result in a situation where a few MNC mining companies acquire control over the vast mineral resources, the chief ministers said in their letter.         
	The states oppose the policy of auctioning mines which could see upstream industry deserting their states for other locations which are better endowed with ports, infrastructure or ready markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stress on fuel duty recast
                                                                                                               Stress on fuel duty recast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The government appears to have shelved its decision to hike fuel prices and is likely to recast duties on fuel in the budget.        
	Officials said members of the ruling UPA as well as the Left, which supports the government from the outside, were not convinced of the necessity of a marginal hike in prices.        
	This has led to the government seeking alternatives to reduce the losses of state-owned oil marketing companies, which are expected to incur a revenue shortfall of Rs 71,808 crore this fiscal.        
	If cuts in excise and customs duties on fuel do not bring much relief to the companies, the government was open to a hike, the officials said.        
	Any decision on prices will be a political one as there will be assembly polls in many states this year and a general election next year.        
	Another option is to issue more bonds to the companies, the officials said.        
	The companies  the Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation  get compensated for 42.7 per cent of their revenue losses through the bonds.         
	Another 35 per cent of the losses may be compensated through assistance from upstream firms.               
	However, even this leaves uncovered a gap of 22.3 per cent.

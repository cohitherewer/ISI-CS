          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kumar: Hopeful                                  
	New Delhi, May 8: After forcing steel makers to roll back prices, the government is now aiming the gun at cement in its fight against inflation.        
	It is planning a slew of steps, if the cement industry fails to hold prices.         
	We have talked to cement producers and they have assured us that in the course of the next 2-3 days they would reduce prices after consultations among themselves. They will come forward with proposals on how best cement prices can be brought down further, Ashwani Kumar, minister of state for industry, said here today.        
	Later in the night, leading cement manufacturer ACC Ltd said it was freezing prices for the next 2-3 months. We have frozen the price for the next two to three months, a senior ACC official said.        
	The official said that the company had taken the decision in response to the governments concern about the cement price situation.        
	The assurance from cement manufacturers came after the government warned of tough action against them. It has already banned exports and allowed duty-free import.        
	Yesterday, steel makers cut prices by Rs 4,000 per tonne, under government pressure.        
	Cement firms have cited certain constraints, including the tax structure. We have taken them up with the finance ministry and hope to resolve them soon, Kumar said.        
	He said there were other fiscal and administrative steps in the offing which could result in inflation coming down by one percentage point in the next six to eight weeks.         
	The government is not helpless and has means to ensure prices are brought down. More measures are in the offing, the minister said.        
	The governments hope is buoyed by projections of record harvest, resulting in adequate procurement, and good monsoon.        
	H.M. Bangur, president of the Cement Manufacturers Association, said excise duty on cement was calculated on retail price unlike other commodities where ad valorem rates (based on manufacturing cost) were used. If the 20 per cent ad valorem rate is fixed for cement, prices of cement can come down by Rs 15 per bag, he said.        
	Hours after steel makers cut prices yesterday, the government suspended futures trading in gram, refined soya, potato and rubber for four months.

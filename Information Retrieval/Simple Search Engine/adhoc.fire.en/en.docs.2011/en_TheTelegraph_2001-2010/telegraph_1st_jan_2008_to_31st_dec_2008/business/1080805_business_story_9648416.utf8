          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pillai: Firm measure                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: The government plans to continue with the curbs on wheat and rice exports, and the ban on soya oil, rubber, chickpea and potato trading in the futures markets.        
	Until the new crop comes, whatever restrictions are there will stay in place. Possibly till the end of November or so. After the rice crop we will know the position, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.        
	The export of non-basmati rice is now banned to ensure its availability in the domestic market and keep a check on inflation, which is dangerously close to 12 per cent.        
	Even if the ban is not fully lifted, we may export two to three million tonnes after November to some African countries, Pillai said.        
	A bumper crop of 94 million tonnes of non-basmati rice is expected in November, of which six million tonnes would be surplus.        
	Pillai said the prices of commodities were a matter of concern, and it was unlikely that the government would relax the ban on futures trading in the four commodities.        
	The ban on the trade in soya oil, rubber, chickpea and potato expires next month.        
	Pillais comment come a day before a meeting of the empowered group of ministers, which will review the foodgrains situation.        
	Forward Markets Commission chairman B.C. Khatua, however, expressed his opposition to the move.

  -   Govt cuts petrol, diesel prices
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The government today cut petrol and diesel prices, ending speculation on the timing of such a move. This is the first reduction in fuel prices in two years.        
	While petrol will be cheaper by Rs 5 a litre, diesel prices will come down by Rs 2.        
	Prices will be effective from midnight tonight, Union petroleum minister Murli Deora said.        
	According to officials, the cut in fuel prices is part of a larger stimulus package of the government.        
	The move comes on the back of a fall in global crude oil prices, which had climbed to a record high of $147 a barrel in July but since dropped to around $43.5 per barrel.        
	In Calcutta, petrol will now be about 10 per cent cheaper at Rs 47.16 a litre, and diesel will cost around 5 per cent less at Rs 33.92 per litre. Prices of cooking gas and kerosene are unchanged.         
	In June, the government had raised petrol and diesel prices by Rs 5 and Rs 3 a litre, respectively, while an LPG cylinder became dearer by Rs 50.         
	The hike was aimed at protecting state-owned oil marketing firms, which suffered from selling fuel below cost when crude was hardening.         
	Todays price cut will trim the profits of the firms  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The trio had just crawled back into the black.         
	However, lower fuel prices mean people will have more money, which is expected to spur demand in a slowing economy.         
	According to D.K. Joshi, chief economist with credit rating agency Crisil, It will impact inflation. Prices should start coming down faster.         
	The price cuts will bring down the costs for truckers and the railways, which use diesel as fuel. This will reduce the prices of fruits, vegetables, foodgrain and industrial products.         
	With crude going into a free fall, the UPA government was facing pressure to reduce fuel prices both from the Opposition parties and its coalition partners.        
	However, the governments move to review fuel rates was criticised by the BJP, which accused the Congress of violating the election code of conduct.        
	Earlier in the week, the Election Commission gave a clean chit to Deora, saying the minister did not violate its model code of conduct when he said fuel prices would be reviewed after the polls in six states. This gave the Union cabinet the strength to go for a price cut.

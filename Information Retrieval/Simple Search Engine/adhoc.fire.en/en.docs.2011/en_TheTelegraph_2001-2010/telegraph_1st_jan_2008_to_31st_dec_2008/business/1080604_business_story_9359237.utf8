The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lehman needs cash
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lehman needs cash
                            
	Bangalore, June 3 (Reuters): Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc may raise billions of dollars of fresh capital, suggesting the investment bank will post its first quarterly loss since going public, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.        
	Analysts and Wall Street executives estimate it might total $3 billion to $4 billion, the newspaper said. Lehman may issue common stock, diluting current shareholdings, and will probably reveal its capital plans when it reports quarterly results week after next, the journal said.        
	Lehmans market value is about $18.7 billion, based on Mondays closing stock price of $33.83, Reuters data shows. The report sparked selling in the US dollar and weighed on Asian stocks, while boosting demand for safe-haven government bonds such as the US treasuries.        
	The developments are a reminder to markets that the effects of the credit crisis continue to reverberate, said Zurich-based UBS currency strategist Geoffrey Yu in a note to clients.According to recent analysts research notes, Lehman has been hurt by hedges used to offset losses in various securities.        
	Second-quarter losses from asset write-downs and ineffective hedges are likely to top $2 billion, the newspaper said. The bank will also realise losses tied to job cuts, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter.         
	Lehman in May decided to cut around 1,300 jobs, or nearly 5 per cent of its workforce, a person briefed on the matter said. It had laid off more than 5,000 people since the middle of 2007.        
	The bank did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Lehman is the smallest of Wall Streets four major investment banks, following JPMorgan Chase amp; Cos purchase this weekend of Bear Stearns Cos. Several analysts expect Lehman to post a second-quarter loss, according to Reuters Estimates.        
	Shares in Lehman closed down 8.1 per cent on Monday, and have nearly halved this year.        
	The market is very cautious about developments with troubled financial firms, said Hideaki Inoue, chief manager of forex trading at Mitsubishi UFJTrust Bank in Tokyo.

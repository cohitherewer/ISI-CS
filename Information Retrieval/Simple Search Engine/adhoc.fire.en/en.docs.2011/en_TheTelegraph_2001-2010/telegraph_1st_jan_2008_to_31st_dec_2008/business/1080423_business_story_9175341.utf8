          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 22: Reliance Retail Limited (RRL) and Office Depot, a global provider of office products and services, today formed a joint venture to provide office products and services to business customers in India. This marks Office Depots entry into the country.        
	Office Depot will hold 51 per cent and Reliance Retail the rest, Bijou Kurien, president and CEO, lifestyle, Reliance Retail, told The Telegraph. We are in partnership to enter the business-to-business segment in India and our main focus is on providing office supplies to small and large companies in the country.        
	Reliance Retail and Office Depot have also acquired eOfficePlanet, a dealer of office products and services.        
	eOfficePlanet will provide us the necessary filler with their existing business in the same area, Kurien said. He refused to say how much the buyout cost.        
	eOfficePlanet already has a network of sales office and branch offices all over the country, which will help the joint venture make their physical presence. The acquired company offers business consumables including office stationery and supplies, corporate gifting and promotional products, break room, canteen, pantry and janitorial supplies.        
	The joint venture with Reliance and the strategic acquisition of eOfficePlanet will put Office Depot in a leadership position in India, said Charles Brown, president of Office Depots international division in a statement.        
	eOfficePlanet is the market leader in the fast growing Indian office supplies industry, with high brand recognition among the procurement decision makers in large corporate organisations. Our new relationship will provide Office Depot with a platform to both serve our existing global customers who have operations in India and to expand our offering to all business customers in India, he added.        
	Sreenivas Nagappa, country manager for Office Depot India will be based in eOfficePlanets Mumbai headquarters and Shyam Barilits Gupta, the current CEO of eOfficePlanet, will continue as part of the management team of the company.

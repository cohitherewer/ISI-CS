The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil to boil, metals to shine
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Oil to boil, metals to shine
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 26: Metals will be the sector to watch this year, while oil and gas will see blowout growth in profits in 2009.        
	That is the long-term prediction from Motilal Oswal Securities, which came out with a forecast on second-quarter earnings before the season opens next month.        
	While metals are driving 25 per cent of the earnings growth in financial year 2009, the growth in fiscal 2010 will be led by oil and gas, primarily by Reliance Industries, the firm said.        
	In its assessment of the quarter ended September 2008, the firm noted that oil, gas and metals would be the biggest contributors to earnings, accounting for 41 per cent of total earnings and 58 per cent of contribution to earnings growth.        
	The sectors in the dog house are cement, autos and real estate, which will see a de-growth in profits.        
	The firm says the slump in the value of the rupee against the dollar will benefit the information technology sector.        
	However, it reckons that the full benefit will not be reflected in this quarter since the companies have hedged themselves.        
	Engineering and fast-moving consumer goods will see consistent earnings growth over the next two years.        
	Moreover, as interest rates peak in 2009 and the commodity cycle trends downward, we expect earnings growth from banks and autos to rebound in financial year 2010, said Rajat Rajgarhia, director (research) at Motilal Oswal.        
	The decline in crude oil prices is expected to trim the fiscal deficit, improve the trade balances and benefit oil marketing companies and ONGC.        
	The firm also believes domestic investors will more than compensate for the exit of foreign institutional investors. The domestic players, including insurance companies, have invested $21 billion this year while foreign institutional investors have been net sellers to the extent of $6.1 billion.

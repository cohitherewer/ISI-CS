	Calcutta, July 8: McLeod Russel India Ltd, the worlds largest producer of tea, is set to increase its area under jatropha cultivation three-fold.        
	The company has 24,000 hectares (60,000 acre) in its fold, the largest land owned by any single entity in the country.        
	We expect a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore from the jatropha business in the next three years. That is the scale of operations we are looking at for any kind of diversification, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel India Ltd.        
	D1 Williamson Magor Bio-Fuels Ltd, a 50-50 joint venture between D1 Oil Plc of the UK and McLeod Russel, is in the second year of its operations. It plans to bring another 70,000 hectares under jatropha cultivation in the Northeast and Jharkhand.        
	We will receive some grains this year but the grains for commercial purposes will start coming from the third year of operations, said Kamal Baheti, chief finance officer and director of McLeod Russel Ltd. The joint venture company had planted 62,000 hectares in Jharkhand and the Northeast last year.        
	In tea, we are happy being a bulk player. We expect the demand for the international market to go up substantially, said Khaitan.        
	Mc Leod Russel India Ltd had planned to invest Rs 50 crore in D1 Williamson Magor Bio-Fuel over the next two years. The joint venture was formed in July last year to produce bio-diesel in the eastern and northeastern regions of the country.        
	The total investment required for the development of manufacturing facilities till 2009-10, the year of commencement of commercial production, is approximately Rs 300 crore, Khaitan said.        
	D1 Williamson Magor Bio-Fuel has been promoting jatropha plantation among the farmers on their privately owned waste land under contract farming arrangements.

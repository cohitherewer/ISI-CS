The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Credit fillip for farmers 
                                                                                                            Credit fillip for farmers 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                          Rangarajan: Rural reach                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The government wants state-run banks to increase their rural reach and persuade farmers to trade expensive loans from moneylenders for cheaper credit from them.        
	This follows a report that says nearly 73 per cent of Indian farmers have no access to banks and co-operatives and some 51 per cent dont get credit at all.         
	State-run banks are being asked to improve their city-to-village branch ratio in favour of villages.         
	Banks who are leaders in certain districts should work towards the goal of 100 per cent coverage of farmers.         
	The report, presented some time back to finance minister P. Chidambaram and released today in Mumbai, reveals that 45.9 million farmer households in the country out of a total of 89.3 million, or 51.3 per cent, do not access any credit.         
	These figures are much higher for the Northeast (96 per cent) and the eastern region (81 per cent).        
	Just about 27 per cent of the farmers are able to access banks and rural co-operatives.         
	This report is important for the government as it is trying to win farmers votes by preparing a big credit package for them. Finance ministry sources said a series of alternative packages were being worked out for a loan write-off that could cost anywhere between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 60,000 crore.         
	But the political leadership has realised that a write-off alone cannot solve the problem of indebtedness as large sections of farmers, especially the smaller ones, do not have access to bank or co-operative credit.        
	Besides new branches, banking department officials said each rural branch must ensure at least 250 new accounts every year.         
	On moves against moneylenders, senior officials said, Norms are being changed to ensure more farmers become eligible for loans without compromising on prudence.         
	Banks need to experiment with biometric cards. Illiterate farmers will then get loans from extension kiosks that may be set up in villages without bank branches.         
	The government also plans to create two funds  a promotion and development fund and a financial inclusion technology fund  of Rs 500 crore each.        
	Contributions to the fund will be made by the government, the Reserve Bank of India and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.        
	The report has been prepared by a high-powered committee under C. Rangarajan who is the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and a former Reserve Bank governor.        
	It suggested a national mission on financial inclusion and a rural financial inclusion plan.

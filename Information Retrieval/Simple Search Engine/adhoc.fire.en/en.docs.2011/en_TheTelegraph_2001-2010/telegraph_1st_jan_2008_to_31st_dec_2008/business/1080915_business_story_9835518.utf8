Our socially responsible approach is our differentiator ndash; bringing smiles to more faces, and winning us a few accolades along the way. We translate our ideology into action in many ways: we advocate web accessibility in the virtual world; while working towards up-lifting the disabled in the real world through our non-profit arm, Cause an Effect foundation. rdquo;  Accepting the Udyog Rattan award, Mr. Bharatam said that both the awards rightfully belong to management, staff and well wishers of Iridium Interactive who have contributed towards making the company a success story.   Mr. Bharatam is also the founder of the not-for-profit Cause an Effect Foundation (CnE). The Cause an Effect project was first launched to help the victims of the super cyclone that devastated Orissa in the year 1999. The same team then moved on to generate funds for the victims of the Gujarat Earthquake and Andhra Floods, as well as the Tsunami-affected victims across Tamil Nadu amp; Andhra. In all Cause an effect projects, Iridium Interactive (ii) functions as the commercial interactive agency, and has been highly successful in generating awareness and publicity. The ii management and employees are actively involved in all the initiatives of Cause an effect, giving generously of their time and expertise.   Mr. Bharatam himself made an abrupt departure from a very promising consultancy career to establish Cause an Effect. An avid believer in the World Wide Web, he used the power of internet to raise significant funds for the cyclone victims amp; to build a global community of 18 million in just 45 days. This effort led him to win the world rsquo;s prestigious Kauffman Community Award for lsquo;Social Entrepreneurship rsquo; in the year 2004.

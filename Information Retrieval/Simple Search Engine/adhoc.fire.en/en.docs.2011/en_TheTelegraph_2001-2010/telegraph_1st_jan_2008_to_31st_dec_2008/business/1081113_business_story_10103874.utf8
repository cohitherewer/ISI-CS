          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 12: After a brief lull, share buyback is again in vogue.        
	Three companies today announced plans of buying back their own shares to boost valuations.        
	Mangalam Cement, part of the BK Birla group, Selan Exploration and Eicher Motors told the stock exchanges today that their boards would meet next week to consider buybacks.        
	The board of Mangalam Cement is meeting on November 22, while the Selan and Eicher boards are meeting on November 20.        
	The shares of Mangalam and Eicher gained on the announcement, while the Selan scrip made losses.        
	Capital market circles expect more companies to announce buybacks, given the low prices of shares. However, those with only excess cash could go for buybacks, an analyst said.        
	As many as 11 companies are now buying back shares  DLF, Gateway Distiparks, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, HEG Ltd, Rain Commodities, Reliance Infrastructure, SRF, R Systems, Surana Telecom, ANG Auto and Valiant Communications.        
	DLF has so far bought more than 16 lakh shares, while the Anil D Ambani firm, Reliance Infrastructure, has bought over 78 lakh shares. DLFs buyback commenced last month and the realty major would buy shares up to a maximum price of Rs 1,100 for an aggregate amount of Rs 600 crore. The share today ended lower by 8 per cent at Rs 244.60.        
	Companies have been using buybacks to boost the valuations of their shares. They extinguish their equity capital, leading to higher book values and earnings per share.         
	Buybacks are often seen as a reflection of the managements confidence in the growth prospect of a company.        
	Analysts, however, said that though shares might stabilise in the short-term, their values over a longer period would depend on the companys fundamentals.        
	Last year, Hindustan Unilever Ltd had announced a buyback programme at a price of up to Rs 230 per share.        
	The company bought shares worth a little more than Rs 626 crore. Its share price is now ruling at Rs 234.        
	Sensex loss        
	In seesaw trade, sensex today extended losses for the second day, losing over 300 points on heavy selling across counters.        
	The 30-share index moved in a wide range before concluding the day at 9536.33, a fall of 303.36 points, or 3.08 per cent, over the previous close.         
	In two days, the sensex has shed nearly 1000 points.

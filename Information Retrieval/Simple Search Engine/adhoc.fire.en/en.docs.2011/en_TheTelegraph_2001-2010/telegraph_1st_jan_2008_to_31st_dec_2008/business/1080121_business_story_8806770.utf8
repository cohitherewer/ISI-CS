   Gift dilemma

                I am a 43-year old housewife. I got Rs 1 lakh in cash as gift from my parents and in-laws and other relatives at the time of my marriage (June 1985) and the birth of my son (1987) and daughter (1989). This amount was invested in banks, post offices and the Unit Trust of India for the higher education of my children. At present, my total income from interest is higher than Rs 10,000. As my total income is below the taxable limit, can I submit Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source on interest income? Should I have a PAN?
     S. Chakraborty, Belgharia

          Yes, you can submit Form 15G to claim non-deduction of tax at source on your interest income. You may not file income tax return as your annual income is less than the basic exemption limit for women. However, if you have got money as gift from your husband, interest income on that portion will have to be clubbed with your husbands annual income and he will have to pay tax on that.
                 Skirting tax
   I am a senior citizen and a pensioner. I want to gift Rs 2,88,000 to my married daughter by issuing a cheque. Will it attract any tax? If so, what will be the tax liability? If I gift the same amount in instalments of less than Rs 50,000, shall I be exempted from gift tax?
    A.C. Banerjee, Hooghly

          Gifts to certain specific relatives, including children who are married, are exempt from gift tax under the current provisions of the law. However, when you gift some money to your daughter who is married, any income earned on the gifted amount by keeping it in a bank or post office or investing the same in mutual funds or equities will be taxed. Theres no need to pay the money in instalments as you can gift any amount to your daughter without attracting any tax. You should also have enough proof that the gifted amount has not come from illegal sources. 
                 Pension scheme
   Is the income from Employees Pension Scheme introduced by the central government in 1995 as part of the Employees Provident Fund taxable?
    Ajit Kumar De, Hooghly

           Pension is a deferred income and hence it is taxable. However, you can claim a deduction on the contributions made towards the provident fund that includes the pension scheme.

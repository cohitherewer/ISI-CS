          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Prasad: Fund raiser		    
	Calcutta, March 5: ING Vysya Life Insurance will infuse another Rs 125 crore as capital in the current financial year.        
	We now have a paid-up capital base of Rs 790 crore and always look at highly capitalising the company for greater security, said Y.V.D.V. Prasad, director of ING Vysya Life.        
	The company is targeting new premium income of Rs 1,100 crore by the end of this year. During the last year, the new premium income stood at Rs 584.63 crore. In the last two-and-a-half years, eight life insurance companies had injected fresh capital.        
	Highlighting the importance of the infusion, Prasad said the extra capital was necessary to meet the solvency requirements set by the insurance regulator.        
	ING Life recently launched a unit-linked retirement solution plan, a long-term plan with the option to invest in debt, equity and liquid instruments. The company will be focusing more on annuity options and other innovative products to cater to the varying financial requirements of customers.

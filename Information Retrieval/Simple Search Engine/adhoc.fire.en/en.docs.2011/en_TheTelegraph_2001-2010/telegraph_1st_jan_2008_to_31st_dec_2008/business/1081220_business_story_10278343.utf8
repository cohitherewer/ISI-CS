                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Satyam fiasco puts Sebi on alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhave in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: The market regulator has decided to examine corporate governance issues arising from the aborted Satyam Computer-Maytas deal that was scuppered by angry minority shareholders.         
	We do not want to react immediately to the incident.We will study the issues involved and then come to a conclusion, C.B. Bhave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on the securities market here today.        
	The Sebi chief said that it was too premature to comment on the issue and that the study would take whatever time it required.        
	Investors raised serious questions about corporate governance standards of the Satyam group after the countrys fourth largest information technology firm said it would acquire Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties  two companies floated by the Raju family  for $1.6 billion. Satyam called off the deal after shareholders expressed outrage.        
	Bhave also said the market regulator was looking at ways to relax restrictions on currency futures trade and the possibility of including more market participants.         
	At present, foreign institutional investors and non-resident Indians are not allowed to trade in currency futures.        
	Asked whether more currency futures would be introduced, Bhave said there was a joint Reserve Bank of India-Sebi committee in place that was examining the possibility of expanding this market.        
	He also said Sebi would soon take a decision on whether to allow the National Stock Exchange to start trading in Nifty futures early. The exchange wants to start trading in Nifty futures at 8 am  about two hours before the rest of the market opens.

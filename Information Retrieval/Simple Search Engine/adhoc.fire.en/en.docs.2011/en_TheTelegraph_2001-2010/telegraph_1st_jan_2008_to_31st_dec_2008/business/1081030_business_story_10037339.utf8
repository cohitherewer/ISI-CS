The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toyota sets 2010 date for small car 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Toyota sets 2010 date for small car 
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Nakagawa: New move                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Toyota Motor today said it would roll out its small car in India by 2010.         
	The car will, however, not compete with the Tata Motor small car Nano, said Hiroshi Nakagawa, who is the managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, the Indian entity of the Japanese car manufacturer.        
	We are going to launch a small (family) car near 2010. At this point, we cannot talk about the price but the Nano belongs to a totally different segment, Nakagawa told The Telegraph over phone from Japan.        
	Nakagawa denied media reports about Toyota and its mini-vehicle unit Daihatsu jointly developing a car for the Indian market, priced at around $5,000.        
	It is not correct at all (news of the small car with Daihatsu), said Nakagawa.         
	Toyota had in the past denied any interest in developing a very low-cost car, arguing that such a car could hurt its image.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of Indias passenger vehicles are small cars.        
	Tata Motors is scheduled to launch its Rs 1-lakh-car, the Nano, soon. Others, including Hyundai Motors, General Motors and Bajaj Auto, are also looking at launching a low-cost vehicle in the fourth largest market in Asia.        
	Toyota feels the launch of its small car will help to shore up its share in the fiercely competitive Indian market to 10 per cent.         
	About seven lakh cars are sold every year in India. The Japanese companys market share currently stands at just 3 per cent in India.         
	The company had already announced an investment of Rs 1,400 crore to set up its second manufacturing facility in Bangalore from where the small car for the Indian market will roll out.        
	According to sources, the car may come with both petrol and diesel powertrains. Being designed in Japan, the car will be built on a new platform in Bangalore. It is likely to sport a 1.2-litre engine to cater to the mass segment.        
	When the second manufacturing facility in Bangalore is ready by mid-2010, Toyota Kirloskar Motors will have a combined annual capacity of 160,000 units.        
	Toyotas first plant in India was built in 1998 with a capacity to produce 60,000 units per annum.         
	It manufactures the Innova, a multi utility vehicle, and the Corolla, a sedan. The Camry and the sports utility vehicle Prado are imported as completely built units.

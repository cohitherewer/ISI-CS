          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, July 17: The government is likely to ban the export of flat steel products as they continued to spur inflation, which touched 11.91 per cent for the week ended July 5.        
	Though inflation rose marginally by 0.02 per cent during the week, prices of some steel items rose at a fast clip.         
	Leading the pack was steel ingot, whose price rose as much as 21 per cent.        
	If the prices of flat steel products are not being kept in check, either the export duty can be increased or a ban on exports can be considered to increase domestic availability, the committee of secretaries said.        
	Officials said this view was likely to get translated into action, especially as steel makers have been aggressively advocating another round of price hike.         
	Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman had yesterday said that the current prices were not sustainable because of spiralling raw material prices. On the governments part, steel secretary R.S. Pandey had said that the government would consider steps to cool down prices if they contribute to high inflation.         
	Since January, steel prices have shot up by around 50 per cent. In May, companies such as Steel Authority of India Limited, Tata Steel and JSW Steel had pledged to hold prices for three months.         
	The deadline ends on August 7, and the steel producers and the government could meet again to discuss prices.        
	PC comment        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram hinted at administrative and fiscal measures to tame prices, adding that he felt the monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) were yielding results.         
	I met RBI governor Y.V. Reddy, who said there is still pressure on prices. I am in broad agreement with him, Chidambaram said.        
	Reddy has informed the finance minister that it would take some time before the monetary measures start having an impact.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New connection                                  
	Mumbai, March 17: Tech Mahindra today announced a $350-million five-year deal with British Telecom (BT) to provide application maintenance and support services.         
	The realisation from the deal will be equally distributed over the five-year period. We will get around $70 million each year for the next five years from the deal, said Rajesh Chandiramani, general manager (sales and marketing) of Tech Mahindra.        
	The services will be delivered from the companys facilities in India and a unit being set up in the UK to monitor BTs core business processes.        
	We already have between 1,500 and 2,000 people working at our UK centre. We plan to ramp up our head count for this particular deal significantly, he said.        
	Asked about billing rates, Chandiramani said, We have been working with BT for 21 years. All our deals come under the master service agreement (MSA) with BT. The billing rates for this deal will be part of the MSA.         
	BT was outsourcing to a number of vendors in India and abroad. Now they have consolidated that and are outsourcing to two vendors. One of them is Tech Mahindra, he added.        
	This deal showcases Tech Mahindras strengths in delivering business critical services that have so far been hidden under business-as-usual application support. We are delighted at the confidence BT has shown in us and this contract will further strengthen trust and partnership between the two companies, Tech Mahindra president Sanjay Kalra said in a company statement.        
	The Tech Mahindra stock fell 3.39 per cent to close at Rs 622.80 on the BSE.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Glaxo takes big Strides in generics
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, July 23: GlaxoSmithKline has entered into an alliance with Onco Therapies Ltd, a joint venture of Strides Arcolab, in branded generics.        
	Onco Therapies will license intellectual property and supply finished pharmaceutical products to GlaxoSmithKline, which will market the drugs in 95 emerging markets excluding sub-Saharan Africa and India.         
	The joint venture partner of Strides in Onco Therapies is South Africas Aspen Pharmacare Holdings.         
	The deal is significant because it marks the entry of GlaxoSmithKline, which mainly makes patented medicines, in branded generics.         
	Branded generics are generic drugs which are marketed under brand names.         
	The branded generics will first be registered by GlaxoSmithKline, and marketing will be done once the registration has been obtained.         
	Onco Therapies will recover intellectual property development costs from GlaxoSmithkline and share profits with GlaxoSmithKline from the commercialisation of the products.         
	The first drug commercialised under this arrangement is expected to be launched in 2010.         
	Further details pertaining to the agreement, including payments that will be made to Onco Therapies, were not disclosed. GlaxoSmithKline is the worlds second largest pharmaceutical company.        
	Analysts also see the tie-up as a move by GlaxoSmithKline to gain a greater presence in emerging markets.        
	The announcement led to the Strides Arcolab share surging at the stock exchanges today. It ended the day at the Bombay Stock Exchange with a hefty gain of nearly 17 per cent at Rs 172.        
	Arun Kumar, vice-chairman and chief executive of Strides Arcolab, said, This deal with GlaxoSmithKline reflects the value which has been created out of the joint venture between Strides and Aspen. Aspen is an important partner of Strides with collaborations on a global basis. Onco Therapies has a robust product pipeline which augurs well for the future growth of this business.        
	According to Aspen Group CEO Stephen Saad, the move is an opportunity to extend the global reach of Onco Therapies, which will benefit by GSKs strength in branding and marketing.        
	He said GlaxoSmithKline would achieve the effective distribution of products in many countries, which Onco Therapies is presently unable to reach.        
	Strides Arcolab is one of the worlds top five manufacturers of softgel capsules. It is present in various developed markets that include the US, Canada and parts of Europe as well as in various developing countries such as Africa, Latin America and Asia.        
	The company has 16 manufacturing plants across Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Poland, Singapore and India.        
	On the other hand, South Africa-based Aspen is Africas largest pharmaceutical firm. It is a major supplier of branded and generic drugs, healthcare and nutritional products to South Africa and selected international markets.        
	Last year Strides and Aspen had struck a joint venture for oncology products, which they were to develop and commercialise.

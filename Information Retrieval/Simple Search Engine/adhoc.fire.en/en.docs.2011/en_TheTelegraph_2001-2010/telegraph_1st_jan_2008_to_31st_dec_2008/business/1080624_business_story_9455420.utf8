The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Discount fuel to keep car sales running
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Discount fuel to keep car sales running
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          IN SLOW LANE                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: With another bout of rate hikes in the offing, the countrys automobile industry is expecting a slump in sales.         
	Car makers say they are left with little option but to continue offering discounts to offset the slowdown in sales.        
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to raise key lending rates to shrink money supply and thwart inflation.         
	This will mean a higher cost of funds for banks affecting the rate at which banks lend to customers.        
	Undoubtedly, such high inflation will affect the growth of the industry. It is bad news for everybody, across sectors. But even as we (industry) face immense pressure, the only way to generate volumes is by continuing to offer discounts, said a spokesperson for Hyundai Motor India Limited.        
	Companies will now have to come up with more innovative marketing and promotion schemes to keep their sales going, he added.        
	Analysts, too, see a squeeze in demand with the inevitable rise in interest rates.         
	The rise in inflation will have an adverse impact on the industry that will not only see interest rates being further hardened but also a drop in demand because of the squeeze in purchasing power, said Abdul Majeed, partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers.        
	Majeed said with the expected drop in demand, bottomlines of companies would also get affected.        
	A few banks have already increased their interest rates earlier this month and others have made it clear they intend to follow suit whenever the RBI hikes lending rates.         
	Sources say banks may increase the lending rates by 25-50 basis points.         
	Analysts believe higher lending rates can bring down the growth rate of car sales to 8-10 per cent this fiscal against 12 per cent in 2007-08.         
	At present, the average interest rate charged by banks on car loans hovers around 12-12.75 per cent, while in the case of two-wheelers, its as high as 22-23 per cent.         
	Interest rates have been moving up over the last two years.         
	Even though bankers say the impact on monthly instalments will not be too high, particularly in the compact car segment, which comprises nearly 70 per cent of the market, companies think otherwise.         
	The issue cannot be looked at in isolation. Interest rates have been continuously going up for the last one-and-a-half years and the cumulative increase certainly makes a very big impact, said Jnaneswar Sen, vice-president (marketing) of Honda Siel Cars India.         
	Auto analyst Murad Ali Baig said, Any increase in interest rates by banks will lead to postponement in car purchase plans. From the customers point of view, even though the disposable income has increased, his expenditure, too, has increased on all fronts. Therefore, undoubtedly the industry will see slow growth.        
	The industry has been struggling to remain afloat in unfavourable economic conditions. Car makers are facing higher fuel prices, a hike in input costs and vehicle financing problems.         
	This has prompted many manufacturers to revise the prices of vehicles and even launch CNG and LPG variants.

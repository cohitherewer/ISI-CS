	New Delhi, July 28: FMCG major Dabur India today reported a 25.31 per cent rise in net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, at Rs 70.14 crore compared with Rs 55.97 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Strong growth in key segments such as hair care and health supplements led to higher profit.        
	The turnover during the quarter stood at Rs 532.29 crore, up 12.2 per cent from Rs 474.24 crore a year ago. We continued to sustain the growth momentum in key categories such as hair care and health supplements, despite growing cost pressures. While high inflation is a cause for concern, we have not yet seen any significant impact on consumer spending, said Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur India.        
	Our renewed focus on over-the-counter ayurvedic products reaped rich dividend with the consumer health division reporting a near 25 per cent growth rate in the first quarter of 2008-09, said Duggal.         
	The companys international business surged 39.5 per cent with strong performances in Egypt, Africa and countries under the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stake twist to Orient-Express tussle
                                                                                                               Stake twist to Orient-Express tussle
          SAUMITRA DASGUPTA                                           FRESH DEVELOPMENT      
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: The acrimonious battle between Indian Hotels and Bermuda-based Orient-Express Hotels has taken an interesting turn with two US-based investment funds  BlackRock and DE Shaw Valence  picking up stakes in the luxury hotel chain.         
	DE Shaw Valence sent a letter today to James Hurlock, chairman of the board of Orient-Express, asking the company to publicly clarify the rights of the companys super voting class B shares and (explain) how it intends to use these shares in the event (that) a fair and equitable offer for the company as a whole is received.         
	DE Shaw Valence is an eponymous firm created by computer science genius David Shaw  a PhD from Stanford University  who used quantitative trading models to make a fortune on Wall Street and earned the sobriquet King Quant.         
	In early January, DE Shaw picked up a 5.7 per cent stake in Orient-Express.         
	A week before that, BlackRock, which is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, picked up a 5.2 per cent stake in Orient-Express.         
	As shareholders of OEH we have become increasingly concerned by the public communications between the company and Indian Hotels. The continuation of this unproductive dialogue threatens to impose substantial costs on all shareholders, the letter said.         
	The battle between Orient-Express and the Tatas-owned Indian Hotels came to a head last December.         
	Paul White, Orient-Express Hotels CEO, rebuffed the Tatas overture for a strategic alliance and spoke disparagingly about their hotel brand, the Taj. It prompted Indian Hotels vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar to demand a public apology.         
	DE Shaw said the Orient-Express board should indicate whether or not owners of the companys class A shares will have the opportunity to hold a definitive and binding vote regarding a merger or sale of the company should such a proposal be made.         
	It added that the lack of clarity on this point may be hindering interested parties from submitting proposals and is creating an unnecessary and significant valuation discount.         
	The letter closed with a threat. Should the company fail to respond adequately to our concerns, we reserve our rights as shareholders to take any actions we may deem appropriate, DE Shaw said.         
	Orient-Express had activated a poison pill in December that virtually slammed the door on any predator by effectively restricting anyone from picking up more than 15 per cent of the Class A shares which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.         
	The Tatas hold an 11.5 per cent stake in Orient-Express.         
	The developments create a piquant situation before Orient-Express announces its fourth-quarter results on February 26.

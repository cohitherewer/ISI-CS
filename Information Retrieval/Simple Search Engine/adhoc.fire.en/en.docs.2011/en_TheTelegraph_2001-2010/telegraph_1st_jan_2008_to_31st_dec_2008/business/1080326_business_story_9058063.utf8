The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ford duo set to enter Tata garage
                                                                                                               Ford duo set to enter Tata garage
          AMIT ROY                       THE FINAL LAP                          
	London, March 25: The sale of Land Rover and Jaguar to Tata Motors is due to be announced formally tomorrow at noon London time, sources told The Telegraph today.         
	The Ford Motor Company had announced on January 3 that Tata, rather than Mahindra or an American equity group, was the preferred bidder.         
	But it has taken until now for Ford, the American parent company which acquired Land Rover and Jaguar in 2000 and 1989, respectively, to agree to the terms of the sale.        
	The deal will be worth about 1 billion, it was reported today, though a figure of 1.5 billion was doing the rounds earlier.        
	The unions are in favour of the sale to Tata Motors because there is now apparently an agreement in place to safeguard between 16,000 and 18,000 British jobs.         
	The Tatas will be picking up two prestige British brands but the going will be tough for the new Indian owner during a period of economic slowdown when car sales have started plummeting.         
	On the other hand, the Tatas now have the chance to be taken as a serious player in the European and American automobile market.         
	Land Rover, whose models include the Range Rover, Freelander and Defender, is based at Solihull in the West Midlands. Jaguar, which makes the X-type, the XJ and the XF series, has plants at Castle Bromwich in the Midlands and at Halewood on Merseyside.         
	The Tatas have made a good impression with the way they have handled the management of the Anglo-Dutch Corus, which incorporates the old British Steel.         
	The British unions, which can be more demanding than their counterparts in Bengal when it comes to protecting the interests of their members, liked the fact that Ratan Tata had spoken of his groups commitment to the two marques and to UK motoring.         
	At this years Geneva Motor Show, he said he planned to retain the image, touch and feel of both Land Rover and Jaguar.         
	He went on, There is no need to tinker with the brands. Our challenge is to make them thrive and grow. The Tatas are taking over the two companies at a time when Land Rover is profitable but Jaguar is suffering financial losses.         
	UK motoring experts believe that while Jaguar and Land Rover were only a small part of the vast Ford empire, the two British-based companies will be a major part of the Tatas business.         
	Land Rover started business in 1948. It is estimated that many of the original Land Rovers are still in working order.         
	Originally the name of a particular model, Jaguar has been the companys name since 1945. Iconic models have included the E-type and the S-type.        
	Many Britons will be unhappy that such evocative names are now passing into foreign hands. The Tata takeover means that some of the most famous British motoring names are now in foreign hands: BMW of Germany owns Rolls-Royce, while Volkswagen is in charge of Bentley.

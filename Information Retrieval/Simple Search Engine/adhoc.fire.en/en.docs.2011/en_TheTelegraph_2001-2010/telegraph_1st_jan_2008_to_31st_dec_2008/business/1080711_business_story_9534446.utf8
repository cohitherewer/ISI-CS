          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 10: The board of realty giant DLF Ltd today approved a Rs 1,100-crore share buyback programme.        
	The company will buy the shares at a maximum of Rs 600 per share, DLF informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today. The company is planning to buy a maximum of 22 million equity shares, which constitutes 1.1 per cent to 1.29 per cent of the total equity base of the company.        
	After the buyback, the promoters shareholding in the company will go up to 89.3 per cent from 88.1 per cent. The maximum price fixed for the buyback is at a premium of 33.24 per cent over the last average closing price of the companys equity shares on the BSE and the NSE as of July 9.         
	The DLF stock ended today at Rs 458.35, which was 1.79 per cent higher than yesterdays close of Rs 450.30.         
	DLF came out with a public issue in June 2007. It had offered its shares at Rs 525.        
	The companys aim has always been to maximise shareholder value and we see the share buyback decision as a highly attractive opportunity for our shareholders. This decision will be value accretive for the shareholders. While we respect the market, we believe that our current share prices do not reflect the intrinsic strength and the future growth potential of DLF, Rajiv Singh, vice-chairman of DLF Ltd, said in a statement.        
	With a clear development pipeline visibility of over 10 years, we do not see the need to substantially add to our current land resources given our strong land bank across various cities in India. At present, we would like to concentrate our resources towards effective execution of ongoing projects in the best interest of the company and our shareholders, he said.        
	With the buyback, the company wants to convey that despite a liquidity crunch in the market, DLF still has enough money to buy back from the shareholders. To know whether the company is actually facing a liquidity crunch or not, we will have to wait till their first quarter results, said a market analyst.

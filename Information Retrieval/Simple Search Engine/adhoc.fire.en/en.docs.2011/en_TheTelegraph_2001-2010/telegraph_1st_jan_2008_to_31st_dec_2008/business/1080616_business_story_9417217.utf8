	New Delhi, June 15: Petroleum minister Murli Deora has sought the intervention of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to restore tax benefits to the prospective bidders of oil and gas blocks under the seventh round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp).        
	In a letter to Singh, Deora said if the tax benefits were not restored, it would be a huge embarrassment for the government.         
	He said the quality of bids would be affected and the governments revenue would also be hit as the bidders would discount this uncertainty u pfront and offer less advantageous profit share to the government.         
	The petroleum ministry had promised an income tax holiday for seven years to firms bidding for the Nelp blocks. However, the finance ministry withdrew the tax waiver in Union Budget 2008-09.         
	According to Section 80 IB (9) of Income Tax Act, a company undertaking the commercial production or refining of mineral oil will be eligible for a 100 per cent tax break for a period of seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial assessment year.         
	Under the new norms, the tax holiday will be withdrawn if the refining of mineral oil begins after April 1, 2009.         
	Further, in the explanatory memorandum of the finance bill, the term mineral oil has been so defined that it possibly denies the tax holiday to even the exploration and production sector.        
	Deora said many tax assessing authorities have concluded that mineral oil also included natural gas, which was in line with the petroleum ministrys understanding of the terminology.        
	The government has postponed the bidding dates twice because of the contradictory views held by the finance and petroleum ministries.         
	The date has last been deferred from May 16 to June 30. The deadline could again get postponed as uncertainty looms large.         
	Analysts said domestic companies hit hard by rising global crude prices would not be keen to bid for the blocks. Even global players have not shown much interest because of a lack of clarity over the tax benefits.         
	India is competing with African and Latin American countries in oil and gas exploration. The two regions have better potential and the countries are offering good financial incentives.        
	Of the 57 blocks on offer under the new Nelp, 39 have been recycled from the previous rounds.         
	These blocks were given up by companies as they did not find oil and gas, while in some instances they were unable to complete their minimum work programme.         
	India expects to draw between $3 billion and $3.5 billion for the blocks.

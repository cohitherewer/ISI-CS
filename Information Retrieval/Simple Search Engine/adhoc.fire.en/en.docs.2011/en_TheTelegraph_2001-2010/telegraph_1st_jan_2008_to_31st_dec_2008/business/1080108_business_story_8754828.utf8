	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Bengal will become the first Indian state to set up a trade and investment office in Munich.
    
	Munich, part of the German state of Bavaria, is home to companies such as Audi, BMW, Siemens, Adidas and Puma.
    
	Officials from the Invest in Bavaria initiative, a joint venture between the Bavarian ministry of economic affairs and Bayern International, met state industry minister Nirupam Sen and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen today.
    
	Bayern International is an organisation which provides information on Bavarian companies, research institutes, technology transfer and network management.
    
	The Bengal centre will be a welcome step as Munich and Bavaria plan to focus on the state in 2008 as was done with Karnataka in 2007. We have also invited Nirupam Sen to come and inaugurate the centre on his trip to the European Union. There are great areas of synergy between Bengal and Bavaria in segments such as auto component engineering and IT. Munich and Bavaria can also become the gateway to eastern Europe for Bengal, said Mirjam Eisele, project manager (India), automotive industries, Invest in Bavaria.
    
	With the Bengal centre, the number of Bavarian companies looking to set up trade ties with the state is expected to increase by another 50 by the end of 2009.
    
	At present, Indo-Bavarian trade stands at 1 billion euros.
    
	There are more than 100 German auto and auto component companies participating in the Auto Expo in New Delhi. Of these, around 25 to 30 are from Bavaria. At a time when the Rs 1 lakh car will be manufactured from Bengal, many companies will be interested in the state, said John Kottayil, executive director of the Invest in Bavaria programme (India office, Bangalore).

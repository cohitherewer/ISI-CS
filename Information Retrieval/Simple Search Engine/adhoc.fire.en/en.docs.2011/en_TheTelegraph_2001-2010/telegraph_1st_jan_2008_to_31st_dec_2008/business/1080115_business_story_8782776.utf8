	Mumbai, Jan. 14: Theres bad news for companies that send their executives zipping around to sew up deals: hotels across the Asia Pacific region plan to raise the room tariffs they negotiate with corporate clients.
 
	The rate revision is a function of demand which outstrips supply in most cities, says American Express in a study of the hotel business in the region.
 
	The study, titled American Express 2008 Asia Pacific Corporate Hotel Rate Projections and Market Forecast, says the rise in corporate-negotiated rates in India will be the steepest in Mumbai, where rates are likely to go up by 40 per cent.
 
	Normal hotel occupancy rates in Mumbai vary between 75 to 80 per cent and the city will see a rise of 30 per cent in its room inventory by the end of 2008. 
 
	The survey carried out by American Express Consulting, a division within the Global Commercial Card, found that hotels were increasingly opting for dynamic pricing models because it increased their competitiveness and flexibility. The pricing is based on demand forecasts, market intelligence and available room supply. 
 
	Occupancy rates in Delhi were found to be higher, averaging 80 per cent with access being improved by low-cost carrier networks. Though the city is expected to raise its room inventory by 44 per cent, the survey predicts corporate -negotiated rates in the capital to go up by 36 per cent. 
 
	In Bangalore, the occupancy rates are stable at around 70 per cent while the supply is set to increase by 225 per cent mdash; the highest in the Asia Pacific region. 
 
	Corporate-negotiated rates in Indias infotech capital are set to go up by 25.07 per cent. 
 
	The study has found that a new generation of travellers are stimulating the supply of new types of rooms and new styles of hotels. 
 
	The wider range of innovative accommodation include boutique guest houses, service apartments, cabin style (approximately 10 square metre cabins with convertible sofa beds and free internet access) and Express style (lodging only at a highly competitive rate) accommodation. 
 
	The Indian room inventory is, however, dwarfed by Beijing, Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok.
 
	Beijing has nearly 600 hotels with an inventory of 1,12,000 rooms and is going to add 14,000 rooms by the end of 2008. 
 
	However, demand is likely to remain robust and the corporate negotiated rates are likely to go up by 21 per cent. 
 
	Cities like Bangkok, Shanghai , Hong Kong and Singapore have significant inventories of 58,718, 67,700, 47,128 and 36,891 rooms respectively, but they will continue to add to their inventory.

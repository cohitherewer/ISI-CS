	New Delhi, June 2: Real estate giant Unitech Limited is likely to finalise by the end of June the entity which will pick up a 25-30 per cent stake in its new telecom venture.         
	The countrys second largest real estate developer by market capitalisation, which has been awarded start up spectrum in five telecom circles, will open next week the first round of financial bids from international mobile operators.        
	Sources said Unitech had held talks with firms such as AT amp;T, South Africas MTN, Telecom Italia, Norways Telenor and Spains Telefonica.         
	These global telecom firms are interested in establishing a presence in the worlds fastest growing telecom market where at least 8 million mobile subscribers are added every month. However, it could not be confirmed whether these foreign telecom players had placed a bid for a stake.        
	Unitech, which has no experience in running a telecom business, is looking to partner foreign telecom firms to utilise their technical expertise and financial strength, said analysts. They estimate total investment for the venture to be around Rs 20,000 crore over the next three years.

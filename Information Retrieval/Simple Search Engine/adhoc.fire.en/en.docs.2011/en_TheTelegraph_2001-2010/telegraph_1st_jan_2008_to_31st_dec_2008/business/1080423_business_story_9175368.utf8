          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, April 22: The government today announced a three-year lock-in clause for telecom licensees before they can embark on mergers and acquisitions.         
	After a merger, there will be a stocktaking of the new entitys spectrum. Officials said spectrum with a firm depended on its subscriber base, adding that merged entities would have to return excess spectrum. The officials fear that many who are applying for new licences as well as some old but small telecom firms may sell out.        
	The move was basically to cut out new non-serious players and to see that the big fish do not eat the smaller ones in a manner that created competition problems, they said.        
	T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, said, I do not see any major aspect in the rules that will facilitate consolidation.        
	India has 12 telecom firms providing wireless and fixed-line services in some or all of the countrys 23 telecom circles.         
	There are over 29 crore users, and the government has issued 120 new licences this year. More than 80 lakh new subscribers are joining each month.        
	The norms rule out merger if it leads to the number of service providers in a circle falling below four.         
	No single firm or person will be allowed to hold in excess of 10 per cent in two or more firms, a long-standing policy of the government.        
	Broadly following the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the rules say that the market share of a merged entity in a circle shall not be greater than 40 per cent, either in terms of subscribers or in terms of adjusted gross revenue.         
	Trai had, however, proposed a higher market share of 67 per cent. The cellular phone market in the country is dominated by Bharti Airtel which had nearly 6.2 crore users by the end of March.        
	Bharti is followed by Reliance Communications with 4.5 crore subscribers and Vodafone Essar with 4.4 crore users.         
	The governments focus is on expanding the coverage in rural areas. It will soon invite tenders from telecom service providers to set up rural networks, for which subsidy will be provided from the universal service obligation fund.        
	Nearly Rs 9,900 crore of the fund is lying with the Centre. We have plans to install 8,000 towers in rural areas, for which subsidy will be given from the fund, communication and IT minister A Raja had said in the Lok Sabha.

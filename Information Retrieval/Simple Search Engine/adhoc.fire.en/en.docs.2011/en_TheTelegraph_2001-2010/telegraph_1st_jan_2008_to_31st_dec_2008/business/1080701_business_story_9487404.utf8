          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 30: The seventh round of bidding for oil and gas blocks received a lukewarm response, with leading global firms not participating after the government withdrew tax incentives. A shortage of drilling equipment was also a factor.        
	Among the bidders, the worlds largest mining company, BHP Billiton, in partnership with GVK Power amp; Infrastructure, won drilling rights for seven deep-water blocks.         
	Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the countrys biggest energy explorer, emerged as the top bidder, winning four onshore blocks on its own.         
	It also won three deep-water blocks, five shallow-water blocks and eight onshore blocks in partnership with others, including Oil India Limited, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Tata Petrodyne.        
	Reliance-BP and Cairn won a bid for a deep-water block each. GAIL (India) Limited, in partnership, won a onshore block, while IOC, too, bagged an onshore area.        
	ONGC placed a maximum number of bids for 27 blocks, followed by Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPC) for 23 blocks.         
	Essar Exploration and Production bid for four shallow water blocks along with US-based Nobel Energy. It also bid for a deep-water block with GSPC.         
	Reliance Industries, which had hit upon a gigantic gas find in the Krishna-Godavari basin, had bid for seven blocks.        
	BHP Billiton, BP, Essar, Reliance and ONGC were among the 99 companies that had bid for the 45 of the 57 blocks put up for bidding.        
	Director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal said the government had received 181 bids for the 45 blocks.         
	Twelve blocks, including seven deep- water blocks, two shallow-water blocks and three on-land blocks did not receive any bids.         
	Sibal said he was satisfied with the bids as India was competing with Malaysia and some countries of Africa and South America to attract giants such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron.        
	Going by the number of bids, what it shows is India is still a good destination. There are new players. Eight to nine first-time bidders are there including BHP Billiton, he said.        
	The bidding, under the new exploration and licensing policy, is expected to bring in investments to the tune of $4.5 billion and is part of the governments efforts to boost domestic crude production and cut dependence on imports, which meets 70 per cent of the countrys oil needs.        
	Of the bidders, 21 foreign companies and 75 Indian companies have bid either on their own or as consortia, Sibal said. The contract to the winning bidders would be awarded by September 30.        
	Sibal said the 12 blocks that failed to receive any bids were recycled blocks. The other blocks received multiple bids, with two small blocks receiving 17 bids and 19 blocks receiving single bids.

	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: Japan is keen to invest in mineral-rich Orissa. A team of 18 , representing 13 companies from the industrial city of Kitakyushu, is on a visit to the state to explore the prospects of teaming up with steel firms in the Kalinga Nagar industrial hub in Orissas Jajpur district. 
    
	Led by Naoyoshi Noguchi, director-general of the Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), the delegation today met senior officials of steel companies in Orissa.
    
	Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited (Ipicol), the trade promotion wing of the Orissa government, and Jetro also signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly support Japanese missions for exploring investment opportunities. 
    
	The Japanese delegation includes Hiroshi Matsushima, chairman of Matsushima Machinery Laboratory, and Shunsuke Yamato, executive vice-president of Nittetsu Yawata Engineering.
    
	The former makes solid and liquid level meters for steel companies such as Nippon Steel, while the latter is into engineering work for steel manufacturers. 
    
	Other prominent industrialists in the group are Michio Irie, president of Astec Irie, which is also into engineering work related to steel, and Takuji Yoshikawa, president of Yoshikawa Kogyo, a partner of Nippon Steel. 
    
	This is the first time a large Japanese delegation has come to any Indian state. We hope during the next one year, investments will start flowing into Orissa from Japan, said Orissa industry secretary Ashok Dalwai. 
    
	Japan is the fourth largest investor in India. 
    
	Kitakyushu could emerge as one of the best partners for Orissa. It is known for its automobile firms and semiconductor-related businesses. Companies such as Toto Limited and Yasakawa Electric Corporation are based in Kitakyushu.
    
	We need more downstream industries for the steel plants that are coming up in Kalinga Nagar and elsewhere. The MoU with Jetro will be a boon for us, said a senior Orissa steel industry official. 
    
	The MoU has provision for developing industrial estates tailored to the needs of Japanese investors.

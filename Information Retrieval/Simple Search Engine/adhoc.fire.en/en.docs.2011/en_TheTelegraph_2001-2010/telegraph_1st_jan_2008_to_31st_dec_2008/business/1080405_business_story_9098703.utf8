The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks get price jitters 
                                                                                                               Stocks get price jitters 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 4: Soaring prices mauled stocks on Dalal Street today amid fears of an imminent slowdown in economic growth.        
	Now that inflation has touched a three-year high, traders are pretty much convinced that the Reserve Bank of India is not going to cut interest rates at the credit policy review on April 29.        
	They instead expect the RBI to hike the cash reserve ratio  the amount of money that commercial banks have to keep with the central bank which, according to brokers, will further affect market sentiment as it sucks out liquidity.        
	Inflation is the main culprit. Market sentiments are badly hit, especially the rate sensitive counters, D.D. Sharma of Anand Rathi Securities told The Telegraph.        
	Earlier, investors were hoping for a rate cut. But now we are expecting a hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), unless inflation comes down to comfortable levels, he added.        
	The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensex, which opened on a weak note, plunged 489.43 points before settling at 15343.12.         
	The broader 50-share S amp;P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also dropped 124.60 points, or 2.61 per cent, to close at 4647.00 from its previous close of 4771.60.        
	Rate-sensitive counters such as housing, banking, infrastructure and auto were all scalded as investors sniffed an inevitable hike in CRR to tame inflation. HDFC, the leader in housing finance, swooned about 7 per cent, while auto maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra lost 6 per cent.        
	Heavyweights such as ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries lost about 3 per cent each.        
	Inflation has gone up due to rising commodity prices, which are primarily governed by international factors. Oil and steel prices cannot be fully controlled by fiscal measures, an analyst with a foreign financial services firm said.

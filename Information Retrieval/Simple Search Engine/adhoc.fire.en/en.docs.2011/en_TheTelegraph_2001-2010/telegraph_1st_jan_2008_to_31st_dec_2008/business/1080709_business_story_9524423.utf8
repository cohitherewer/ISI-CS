The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Weak rupee to boost Infy margins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Weak rupee to boost Infy margins
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Glad tidings                                  
	Mumbai, July 8: Infosys  which will kickstart India Incs first quarter earnings season this Friday  is widely expected to report better sequential growth in the April-June period because of the depreciating rupee and lower hedging losses.         
	With the rupee depreciating by around 7 per cent this quarter against the dollar, various brokerages expect the Bangalore-based IT services major to post 14-21 per cent growth in year-on-year net profit. On the other hand, its sequential profit numbers are estimated to jump 2.1-7 per cent.         
	Although the margins of IT companies generally tend to rise when the domestic currency depreciates against the dollar, analysts apprehend that the extent of the rise could be capped this quarter because of the cost push emanating from wage increases and the increase in visa costs.         
	However, Infosys is likely to report slightly higher quarter numbers compared with the June 2008 revenue guidance of $1,145 million.         
	We expect Infosys to show a 7.5 per cent improvement in sequential revenue but a flattish EBITDA and a 2 percentage point down margin owing to wage inflation and visa costs, said Anurag Purohit, research analyst with Religare Securities Limited .         
	The rupee depreciation, though operationally beneficial, is likely to turn out to be a big spoilsport, at least in this quarter. It is expected to cause a quarter-on-quarter decline in net profit for many companies because of higher forex-related losses. Infosys, with the smallest hedge of about 18 per cent of its 2007-08 fiscal revenues at the last quarter of 2007-08, will be the biggest beneficiary of currency depreciation, says Rajiv Mehta of India Infoline in his report.         
	Mehta believes that net profits of the company will hover around Rs 1,207 crore this quarter. At the end of the financial year 2008, most IT companies had given a guidance based on an exchange rate of Rs 40 to a dollar.         
	It should be noted that at the end of 2008-09, Infosys had pegged its 2008-09 guidance based on a rupee rate of 40 to a dollar. With the average rate in 2008-09 very likely to be much above this, it remains to be seen if these companies translate it into higher guidance, says an Angel Broking report.         
	Most analysts believe that there can be a slight upgrade in the guidance provided volume growth remains on track. Growth trends in the key banking, financial services and insurance vertical will also be tracked, given that it is the largest contributor to the revenues of top-tier software companies like Infosys and TCS, said the report.         
	During the full year ended March 31, Infosys had hedged the lowest amount among the IT biggies at $760 million. TCS had a hedging cover of $2.9 billion and Wipro $3.5 billion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: Fitch Ratings today warned that the credit rating of ICICI Bank might be downgraded if there is a sharp deterioration in the banks asset quality.        
	However, the international credit rating agency reaffirmed the private sector banks long-term foreign currency rating at BBB- and short-term foreign currency rating at F3.        
	The agency also affirmed its long-term senior debt rating at BBB- and long-term rating of its perpetual hybrid debt and Upper Tier 2 subordinated debt at BB. The outlook is stable.        
	BBB-, which is an investment grade rating, indicates relatively low to moderate credit risk.        
	Fitch said ICICI Banks asset quality was showing some signs of weakness.        
	It warned that a further deterioration in its asset quality might put further pressure on the banks funding, particularly for its growing international business, where market borrowings have a relatively large share and refinancing risk has already increased steeply, possibly leading to a liquidity problem.        
	However, it said the risks appeared to have been contained for present.

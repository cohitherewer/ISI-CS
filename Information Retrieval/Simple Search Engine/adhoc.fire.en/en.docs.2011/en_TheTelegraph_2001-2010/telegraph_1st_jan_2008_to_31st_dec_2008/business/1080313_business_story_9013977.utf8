	Calcutta, March 12: Anil Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta Resources Plc, today came home to Bengal and pledged $5 billion to the state where he grew up.        
	I have spent my childhood here. For me, its like coming back home, Agarwal said. His company signed Bengals second-largest private investment deal in the presence of Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Vedanta Aluminium plans to set up a 6.5-lakh-tonne aluminum smelter and a 3,000- megawatt power plant at Bidhanbag in Burdwan.        
	Agarwal, who started his career as a trader of metal scrap and went on to build one of the largest mining companies in India, spent his childhood in Calcutta in the sixties and did his schooling from Jain Bharti in Burrabazar.        
	I really miss my jhalmuri and here I am back, he said. However, its not only love for the state that is bringing the $6.5-billion diversified group here.        
	There are good coal blocks around Bidhanbag where the plants will come up. We hope to get preferential allotment for it, he said. Power is the biggest raw material for smelting operations, he added.        
	The group already has 270 acres and will not have to acquire more than 730 acres for the plants.        
	Agarwal sees no problems in sourcing alumina from Orissa where Vedanta has a bauxite mine and an alumina refinery.        
	Globally, alumina and aluminium are two different products and are manufactured by different entities. An alumina plant will come up where the mine is, smelter where power is cheaper, he said.        
	Vedanta plans to set up these plants within three years. The Bengal government also wants the group to set up a metal park near the smelter.        
	Vedanta is also a big producer of zinc and copper. We want them to set up a park where small downstream units of aluminium and other metals will come up, Bhattacharjee said.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and WBIDC managing director M.V. Rao were present when the deal was signed.

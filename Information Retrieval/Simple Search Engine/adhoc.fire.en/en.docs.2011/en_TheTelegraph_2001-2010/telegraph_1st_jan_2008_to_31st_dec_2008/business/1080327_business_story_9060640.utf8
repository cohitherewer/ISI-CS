          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 26: The Tata group is planning to ramp up its presence in Nigeria, the conglomerates second largest market by volume in Africa.        
	According to the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, the Tatas are looking for a larger office space in Lagos, the commercial centre of Nigeria. It is also keen to invest in a hotel in the city.        
	We had discussions with the Tata office in South Africa. The Tatas already had an office in Ghana and are now looking for property in Lagos. They are willing to invest around $5 million. It will initially be a small office. The group wants to make its presence felt in Nigeria with its trucks, said Mustafa Bello, executive secretary and CEO of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission.        
	Bello was part of a Nigerian delegation that came to Calcutta.        
	Nigeria has a shortage of hotel rooms and therefore it welcomed the Tata groups decision to build a hotel there, he said.        
	The Tata group is present in more than ten African countries through Tata Africa Holdings.         
	The group entered the continent in 1977.

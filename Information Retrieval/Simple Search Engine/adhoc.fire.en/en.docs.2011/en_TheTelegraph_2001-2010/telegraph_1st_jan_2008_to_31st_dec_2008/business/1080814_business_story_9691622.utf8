	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Indias economic growth is slowing down and can be expected to be as low as 7.7 per cent this year, while inflation could keep rising before moderating in December, a report released today by the Prime Ministers economic advisory council said.        
	Inflation can continue to rise for some time (over the current 12 per cent), but by December it will (certainly) start moderating, C. Rangarajan, the outgoing chairman of the council said. Slower growth and high inflation are usually a governments nightmare as they mean fewer new jobs and costlier living for voters.         
	However, finance minister P. Chidambaram continued to be optimistic, saying the economy will grow 8 per cent. If the Prime Ministers economic advisory council pegs it at 7.7 per cent, I can say it will be close to 8 per cent.        
	The growth forecast comes a day after industrial growth for the first quarter fell to 5.2 per cent from 10.3 per cent a year ago.         
	Suresh Tendulkar, the new chairman of the council, said 7.7 per cent growth was not unrespectable and would still be second highest growth rate by any country.         
	Rangarajan said, There is a slowdown in agriculture, industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth. This will affect the Indian economy.         
	Farm production is likely to grow at a slower pace of 2 per cent in the current year against 4.5 per cent in the last fiscal. Industrial output growth is expected to decelerate to 7.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent and services growth to 9 per cent. Services sector growth has been in double digits in the last five years.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arun Sarin in race for Yahoo top post
                          Sarin: Chosen one?                    
	New York, Dec. 9 (Agencies): Arun Sarin, former chief executive of Vodafone, is among those being considered by the board members of Yahoo to take the post of chief executive at the Internet firm, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.        
	After heading the worlds largest mobile firm Vodafone for five years, Arun Sarin retired in July this year.        
	Yahoos directors are moving closer to a recommendation and have authorised checking references on a few key candidates, the paper said.        
	The names of several executives of leading technology and media companies have been floating around as possible replacement for Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.        
	Last month, Yahoo Inc had said Jerry Yang would step down as the chief executive of the Internet giant, ending a 17-month long turbulent tenure which saw him rejecting a takeover bid from Microsoft.        
	Yangs decision to step down followed months of criticism from various quarters on a range of issues, including his move to shun Microsofts $47.5-billion buyout offer.         
	The company said at the time that it was hiring executive search firm Heidrick amp; Struggles.        
	Yahoo could not be immediately reached for comment.

                                                                                                               Mittal to get Jharkhand mine lease
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Mittal: All smiles                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Jharkhand government has decided to grant ArcelorMittal an iron ore mining lease at Meghataburu.        
	It has asked the central government to approve its decision.        
	This will be ArcelorMittals first iron ore mining lease in the country. The company was trying to acquire part of the Chiria iron ore reserve, which the Jharkhand government wants to take away from Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) for reallocation among private steel makers.         
	However, Jharkhands move against SAIL has been mired in controversy and legal challenges.         
	Attempts by ArcelorMittal to get iron ore mining leases in neighbouring Orissa have drawn a blank till now.         
	Jharkhands Chaibasa district mining officer has written to SAIL and NMDC Limited, which are also vying for leases at Meghataburu, on whether they have any objections to the grant of the lease to ArcelorMittal.        
	The letter, dated February 8, 2008, states, The state government has decided to seek prior approval of the central government for granting iron-manganese ore mining lease overlapping your application/adjoining your mining lease in favour of ArcelorMittal India.         
	SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said, This lease area is beyond the boundaries of our lease at Meghataburu and consequently we wont object to it. We are right now concentrating on seeing that Chiria, which is ours legitimately, remains with us and is not parcelled away.        
	SAIL holds a lease at Meghataburu and has applied for another one in May last year in the same region.         
	NMDC has filed for two leases of 466 hectares each in the same area.         
	However, the state government has decided to favour ArcelorMittal.        
	Analysts see this as a major win for the company in its race with other steel makers to acquire strategic mines at what is considered as one of the richest iron ore belts in Asia, stretching from Karampada forests to Sardinda forests in Chaibasa district.         
	In a related development, the central government has appointed a joint committee with the Jharkhand government to assess the reserves at the Chiria mines as well as the extent of SAILs requirements of the ore at Chiria.

          OUR BUREAU                          Money Matters                                  
	Mumbai, June 5: Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd, the residuary non-banking company, today obtained a stay on the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) ban on it accepting fresh deposits.         
	A Lucknow vacation bench of Allahabad High Court granted the stay on a petition filed by Sahara India Financials executive director . P. Srivastava and posted the matter for further hearing in the last week of July.         
	The bench comprising Justice U. K. Dhawan and Justice Shabihul Hasnain granted the stay on the RBI order.        
	The apex bank on Wednesday prohibited Sahara from accepting public deposits or renewing them with immediate effect.        
	It said it had to take this action as Sahara continuously violated its directions on various fronts. These included the maintainence of directed investments, the payment of a minimum rate of interest and adherence to asset-liability guidelines.         
	Sahara also violated know-your-customer norms stipulated for the opening of deposits, the RBI said.        
	Reacting to the RBIs decision, the company said that the central bank did not give due consideration to its demand regarding a proposed time limit.         
	Sahara had approached the central bank and requested for a time limit to comply with the changes in regulations.        
	Sahara maintained that the RBI passed the order stopping the acceptance of deposits in a most vindictive and arbitrary manner and not in conformity with the provisions contained in the RBI Act.        
	The company also said that the order was legally unsound and is wanting in prudence and application of mind. It also asked depositors not to panic.

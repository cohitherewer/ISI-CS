	Calcutta, April 25: The United Bank of India (UBI) has decided to review its capital restructuring plan.         
	We shall take a hard look at the capital restructuring proposal that was mooted in 2006. Since then were continuously on a profit trail. The earlier proposal has little significance in relation to the current capital position, UBI chairman P. K. Gupta said.        
	Well soon initiate a review and consider other capital raising options. The process will be completed by June and we may then put forward a new proposal with the approval of the board of directors of the bank, he added.        
	In 2006, the Calcutta-based bank had proposed to reduce its Rs 1,532-crore equity capital, entirely owned by the Union government, to Rs 332 crore.         
	The banks decision came after the Union cabinet wrote off Rs 275 crore accumulated loss of the bank against its equity capital.        
	The UBI proposed to reduce its equity capital partly by paying back the governments investment in the bank and partly by converting the governments equity holding into preference shares. However, both the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India had turned down the proposal, asking the bank to improve its financial health further.         
	The UBI today reported a net profit of Rs 318.95 crore for the financial year 2007-08, up 19.5 per cent from Rs 267.28 crore in 2006-07.         
	As on March 2005, the bank had an accumulated loss of Rs 275 crore and a total business of Rs 37,187 crore. Since then our financials have improved significantly. Over the last three financial years, our total business has more than doubled to Rs 75,123 crore, said Gupta, whose term as a chairman expires in September.         
	The banks gross non-performing assets during 2007-08 came down to 2.7 per cent from 6.14 per cent in March 2005. Net NPAs during the period dropped to 1.1 per cent.        
	A large part of the banks business growth came on the back of credit expansion which rose from Rs 11,839 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 28,152 crore as on March 31, 2008. Deposits during the same period grew to Rs 46,971 crore from Rs 25,348 crore.

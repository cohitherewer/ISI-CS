	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a New York-based private equity firm, will invest $250 million in Bharti Infratel, the tower subsidiary of Bharti Airtel.        
	This investment reinforces the confidence of leading global investors in the Indian telecom sector, which is now the fastest growing in the world, Bharti Airtel said in a statement.        
	It is also an endorsement of the governments visionary policy of sharing passive infrastructure, it added.        
	The investment will be made by KKRs Asia dedicated private equity fund and its global private equity fund. It will translate into about 2 per cent stake in Bharti Infratel.        
	In December last year, Bharti had sold a 9 per cent stake in the tower unit to seven international investors  Temasek Holdings, Investment Corporation of Dubai, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie, AIF Capital, Citigroup and India Equity Partners  for $1 billion.        
	The enterprise value of Bharti Infratel is $10-12.5 billion and the final valuation will be determined on the basis of Bharti Infratels actual operating performance in 2008-09.         
	Bharti Infratel owns 20,000 sites and holds a 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers, the joint venture among Bharti, Vodafone and Idea, which has over 70,000 sites.         
	Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers will provide passive infrastructure services to all wireless telecom operators in India on a non-discriminatory basis.         
	Sharing of passive infrastructure results in substantial saving of capital and operational expenditures and higher capital efficiency for all wireless operators, enabling quicker rollout of services, especially in rural areas, said the statement.        
	Reliance Communications, another leading telecom player, has also announced plans to sell a 10 per cent stake in its tower unit, which, analysts feel, may fetch the company $1 billion.        
	Undersea cable        
	Bharti Airtel will set up another high-capacity undersea cable, which will connect India to France through West Asia, in association with eight global telecom players by the end of next year.        
	A formal construction and maintenance agreement to build the fibre-optic submarine cable was signed today in Rome by all the firms.

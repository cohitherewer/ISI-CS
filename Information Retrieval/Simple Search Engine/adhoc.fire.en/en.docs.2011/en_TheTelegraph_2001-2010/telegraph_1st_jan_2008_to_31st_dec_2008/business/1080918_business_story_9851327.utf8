                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fed comes to AIGs rescue     Bailout package costs $85bn
                                                
	Hong Kong, Sept. 17 (Agencies): US authorities engineered an $85-billion rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG), staving off bankruptcy and bringing a measure of calm to shell-shocked global markets.        
	The bailout, made amid a cataclysmic week for the financial sector, marks a reversal of Washingtons vow not to step in and calls for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lend up to $85 billion to AIG for two years in exchange for a 79.9 per cent equity stake.         
	It came just two days after the US authorities refused to rescue investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, forcing it into bankruptcy.        
	AIGs lifeline bought time for investors to digest an unprecedented run of events that has altered the shape of Wall Street.        
	Thank God, exclaimed Daniel Fuss, an influential bond manager who oversees more than $100 billion at Loomis, Sayles amp; Co in Boston. AIG is interwoven with so many people and touches many companies around the world.        
	US stocks, however, slid on Wednesday as a spike in inter-bank lending rates added to fears of credit constraints in the global financial system.        
	Additionally, investors worried that the US government rescue of AIG wouldnt be enough to stem turmoil that has rocked markets. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 139.72 points, or 1.26 per cent, to 10919.30 in early afternoon trading in the US.        
	The Fed had stepped in amid worries that a collapse of AIG could cause far-reaching damage to the global financial system, although some market players argued that the governments move brought just a short-term respite and could do long-term harm.        
	What the US government is doing is basically delaying the recovery of the economy really by keeping AIG alive and by going back to the printing press to issue more US dollars, which should be negative to the dollar in the long term, said Ronald Chan of Fortis Investments.        
	AIG will pay interest at a steep 8.5 percentage points above the three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), equal to about 11.4 per cent.        
	Harried customers        
	AIG, which has partnered the Tatas in India, today said it was capable of meeting its liabilities, but customers across markets continued to make distress calls over the fate of their investment.        
	Tata AIG Life Insurance call centres received intermittent queries from customers about their policy status, while customers in Singapore made a beeline to surrender their policies.        
	While general insurance customers hardly have the option of exiting, unit linked insurance plan (Ulip) holders can exercise this option in certain cases.        
	A customer care executive of Tata AIG said the company had adequate capital to meet the liabilities.         
	Customers holding Ulips should not be worried, as the money is invested in the Indian markets.        
	AIG continues to pursue alternatives to increase short-term liquidity in the parent company. Those plans do not include any effort to reduce the capital of any of its subsidiaries or to tap into Asian operations for liquidity, AIG said in a statement from New York.

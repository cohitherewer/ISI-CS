          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 14: A consensus is eluding the commerce, steel and finance ministries on higher duties on iron ore exports, ahead of a crucial meeting of the cabinet committee on prices.        
	The meeting, slated to be held this week, is expected to take a decision on slashing the customs duty on steel and zinc to zero, imposing a higher duty on iron ore exports and reducing the countervailing duty on construction-grade steel.         
	If the duty on iron ore exports is raised, it could be 15 per cent of the value of exports, instead of Rs 50 a tonne on low-grade ore and Rs 300 a tonne on high-grade ore.         
	The commerce ministry is opposing the move to slap higher duties on iron ore exports, arguing it will kill exports. Besides, the mining industry has already made long-term commitments to overseas buyers.         
	However, the finance ministry is unwilling to reduce taxes on steel items, unless there is a commensurate rise in the iron ore levy.        
	The steel ministry is pressing for a higher tax on ore export as it will keep ore at home and reduce its prices, which will benefit steel makers.

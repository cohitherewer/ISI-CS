     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today proposed to reduce the number of tariff plans that operators could provide in a licensed area to below 25. 
    
	At present, mobile operators are allowed to offer up to 25 tariff plans in each circle. However, increased competition among service providers has resulted in a large number of tariff offers being made by mobile operators to attract and retain subscribers, Trai said in a consultation paper today.
    
	Consumer bodies have also complained that there are too many plans on offer leading to confusion. 
    
	Trai has invited comments from stakeholders by February 28.
    
	In the Delhi circle, Vodafone has 22 post-paid and seven pre-paid plans. In Mumbai, it has 12 post-paid plans. 
    
	Airtel has 13 schemes for post-paid subscribers in Delhi, while it has 10 in Mumbai. In the pre-paid segment, however, it has only two plans. Idea has 10 tariff plans each for pre-paid and post-paid subscribers in Delhi.
    
	Trai has also suggested that whenever there are any changes in tariff in a given package, the operator should intimate, in writing, the changes to the concerned subscribers.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                     
	Mumbai, Jan. 11: Infosys today delivered a mixed performance with a better-than-expected third-quarter net profit, higher full-year guidance but a topline growth that fell below estimates. 
    
	The company reported a 25 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,231 crore against Rs 983 crore in the same period last year. Analysts had expected a profit of Rs 1,175 crore. 
    
	Infosys also raised the full- year guidance. The earnings per share for the whole year is now put at Rs 81.07, up from an earlier forecast of Rs 79.44-79.88. In the fourth quarter, the income is expected to be between Rs 4,477 crore and Rs 4,501 crore, a year-on-year growth of 18.7-19.3 per cent. For the entire year, income is expected to be in the range of Rs 16,627-16,651 crore, an increase of 19.7-19.9 per cent.
    
	However, Infosyss consolidated income of Rs 4,271 crore for the quarter, nearly a 17 per cent gain over Rs 3,655 crore in the same period last year, disappointed many. 
    
	Analysts feel the ability of the Infosys scrip to provide direction to the stock market is on the wane. The markets today overlooked its tepid results and gained 245.37 points because of a rally in other heavyweights. 
    
	The infotech sector is no longer the markets favourite as rupee appreciation has badly hit margins, they feel. 
    
	Earlier, if Infosys had announced disappointing numbers, the markets would have crashed by 300 points. But this is no longer the case. Investors are looking for new stocks, says Arun Kejriwal of KRIS.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 25: The petroleum regulator for downstream businesses plans to kick-start the bidding process for city gas distribution projects in the first week of October.        
	The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) will invite bids for supplying gas to homes through underground pipelines in Kakinada, Bhopal, Mathura, Sonipat, Sesdol, Gaziabad and Kota  seven cities that are connected to existing gas pipelines.        
	The evaluation of the bids will take about five months.        
	The bid winner will get a 25-year exclusivity on the use of infrastructure and five years marketing exclusivity for the particular geography the entity operates in, said B.S. Negi, member of the regulatory board.        
	The board plans to take city gas distribution to 100 towns by 2012.        
	Once awarded, project implementation in each city or town will take between 18 and 36 months and will involve a capital expenditure of around Rs 400 crore in the first five years.        
	The bidders would have to quote their tariff for five years in their applications. However, the tariff can be given on a year-to-year basis and inflation can be factored into the equation, an official said.        
	Existing players such as GAIL India Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Gujarat Gas and Great Eastern Energy Corporation, which were issued licences by the Centre earlier, have already communicated their interest to the regulator.        
	According to officials, the four entities, including RIL through its subsidiary Reliance Gas Corporation, have expressed interest in supplying gas to 69 cities.        
	The board is trying to make the playing field more competitive by formally inviting bids.        
	The empowered group of ministers on gas utilisation has set aside an allocation of 5 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) for city gas distribution networks.

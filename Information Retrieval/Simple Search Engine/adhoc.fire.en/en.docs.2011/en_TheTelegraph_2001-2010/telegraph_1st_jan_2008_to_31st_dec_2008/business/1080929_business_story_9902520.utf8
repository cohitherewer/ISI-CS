        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay argues why one should take out money from a PPF account and invest it elsewhere                                        
	Introduced in 1968, public provident fund or the PPF, is very popular with salaried and non-salaried tax payers.         
	Under section 80C of the income tax act, a subscriber can invest up to Rs 70,000 a year in a PPF account and get the entire amount deducted from his taxable income.         
	The money deposited in a PPF account earns an interest of 8 per cent per annum.         
	Though the scheme has an initial lock-in of 15 years, the assured return makes it a very effective tax-saving investment.        
	However, theres another reason that makes PPF attractive. In 1986, rules were amended to allow premature withdrawal from a PPF account. As the withdrawal of money is tax-free, PPF subscribers can utilise this benefit to their advantage and earn a better return than the annual 8 per cent interest that the scheme fetches.        
	Before discussing how PPF account holders can maximise their return by utilising the withdrawal facility, let us first understand the amendments relating to partial withdrawal from PPF.        
	The amendments to the rules allow a PPF subscriber to withdraw a certain portion from the account on completion of six years.         
	This means partial withdrawal is possible from the seventh year of the scheme and money can be taken out every year thereafter. However, theres a rider: the withdrawal is capped at 50 per cent of the balance that was in the account four years ago or one year back, whichever is less.        
	Why withdraw?        
	In PPF, one gets tax-free 8 per cent interest per annum. However, depending on ones income bracket, a tax-free 8 per cent return will correspond to different pre-tax interest rates.         
	For example, if ones annual income is between Rs 1.50 lakh (for women, Rs 1.80 lakh and Rs 2.25 lakh for people above 65 years age) and Rs 3 lakh, one will have to pay income tax at the rate of 10.3 per cent, inclusive of educational cess. In this case, a tax-free 8 per cent interest rate is equivalent to 8.92 per cent interest before tax.         
	Similarly, for people who have annual income between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh and are paying income tax at the rate of 20.6 per cent, a PPF investment will be equivalent to keeping the money in a deposit account that gives a pre-tax interest of 10.07 per cent.        
	For income tax payers at the highest rate of 30.9 per cent, an 8 per cent tax-free interest is equivalent to a taxable interest rate of 11.58 per cent.        
	Rate rack        
	Now, lets take a look at the interest rates that banks are offering on fixed deposits of different tenures.         
	Banks are offering a 10 per cent interest rate (10.50 per cent for people above 60 years) for fixed deposits between 300 days and 400 days, while deposits above one year fetch between 9.5 per cent and 9.75 per cent per annum.         
	Besides, interests on bank fixed deposits are compounded quarterly against annually in the case of PPF. Thus, 10 per cent annual interest yields a 10.38 per cent return when compounded quarterly (senior citizens can get 10.92 per cent) and a 9.5 per cent interest rate amounts to 9.84 per cent.         
	From this, one can conclude that people whose annual income is Rs 5 lakh or less, and are paying income tax at the rate of 20 per cent, will earn more by partially withdrawing money from PPF accounts and investing the same in bank deposits.         
	People paying income tax at the rate of 30 per cent can put the withdrawn amount in one-year fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of mutual funds. While the dividend income from FMPs is tax-free, the long-term capital gains tax payable on the sale of FMPs is lower at 10 per cent. One-year FMPs are now giving a more than 12 per cent return, including capital gains.        
	However, if one wants to maximise returns on the money withdrawn from a PPF account, then one can invest it in equity-linked savings schemes that have generated an annual return of 27.26 per cent over the last five years. Besides, there is no long-term capital gains tax on investment in equity-linked mutual fund schemes.        
	Best strategy        
	The best strategy will be to withdraw (dont take a loan) as much as possible from the PPF account. One should pay ones annual contributions to PPF from this and invest the remaining in other high-yielding assets that give either tax-free income, such as equity or equity-linked mutual funds, or involve lower tax liability  debt schemes of mutual funds.         
	Let us now analyse the cost-benefit of withdrawing money from PPF accounts.         
	If one contributes Rs 70,000 every year in a PPF account, one will get Rs 22,92,515.80 on maturity and ones total contribution to the account will be Rs 11,20,000. In other words, if one doesnt withdraw any money, ones investment in PPF will just double on maturity.        
	But if one starts withdrawing from the seventh year, the total contribution will be Rs 4,20,000  because hereafter one doesnt make any fresh investment and starts contributing to the PPF account from the withdrawn amount  and one gets back Rs 1,66,851.02 on maturity of the scheme.         
	However, over the years one has withdrawn Rs 5,90,511.07 net of the annual contributions to the PPF.         
	These withdrawals, if invested in assets yielding a conservative 10 per cent return, will fetch Rs 11,81,010.25 by the time the PPF account matures. Thus, the investment of Rs 4,20,000 will grow to around Rs 13,50,000 (Rs 11,81,010.25 + Rs 1,66,851.02), or approximately 3.25 times.         
	So dont suffer from withdrawal symptoms. Start withdrawing from your PPF account and invest the amount judiciously to build your nest egg.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RBI governor D. Subbarao (right) in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, Oct. 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today left key rates unchanged, but lowered the countrys GDP forecast to a range of 7.5 to 8 per cent in view of a snowballing global crisis.        
	Earlier, it had forecast GDP growth at 8 per cent.        
	In his maiden mid-term review of the annual policy statement for the year 2008-09, RBI governor D. Subbarao said there had been significant global and domestic developments which made the outlook of 8 per cent GDP growth uncertain and increased the downside risks associated with this projection.        
	According to the RBI, the adverse impact of the current financial crisis for emerging economies has amplified and the global downturn may be deeper and more protracted.        
	The central bank warned that if the global recession was deeper and the recovery a long drawn out process, emerging economies would face the heat in the form of erosion of export competitiveness and restricted external financing.        
	The central bank did not alter the cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the repo rate.         
	While CRR now stands at 6.5 per cent, the repo is at 8 per cent.        
	Subbarao said that the objective of the RBI was to strike a balance among price stability, financial stability and growth momentum.

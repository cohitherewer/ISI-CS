          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money matters                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: State-run oil marketing companies have approached the government to review fuel prices, hit by the hardening of global oil prices that have led to their costs far outstripping prices, which are fixed by the government.        
	Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited have asked the petroleum ministry to raise the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG as not only their financial health is getting hurt but also their long-term investment plans are suffering.        
	Sources said the companies wanted the government to hike the fuel prices at the earliest and not to wait till October, when the government had earlier said that it would review prices. Officials, however, said the government would be reluctant to increase prices and might prefer to issue more oil bonds and tweak duties.        
	Inflation is already at a 13-year high of 11.91 per cent. Any further hike in fuel prices could trigger more price pressures and cause widespread discontent. The government had increased the price of fuel prices in June. It raised the price of petrol by Rs 5 per litre, diesel by Rs 3 per litre and domestic LPG cylinder by Rs 50.        
	Along with the hike, the government had announced an across-the-board cut in customs duty of 5 per cent. It brought down the rate on crude to zero, on petrol and diesel to 2.5 per cent from 7.5 per cent and on other products such as aviation turbine fuel to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. Besides, the excise duty on petrol and diesel has been cut by Re 1 a litre to Rs 13.45 and Rs 3.60, respectively.        
	Keeping fuel prices fixed will mean higher losses for the oil marketing companies. They are expecting a loss of Rs 2,45,305 crore in 2008-09, on the basis of an average price of $125 per barrel for the Indian basket of crude. The government will issue oil bonds of Rs 1,35,000 crore and has already made a provision of Rs 95,000 crore.         
	Officials said to bring down the losses of the companies to zero, the price of petrol needs to be raised by Rs 14.92 per litre, diesel by Rs 24.90 per litre, kerosene by Rs 38.09 per litre and LPG by Rs 338.53 per cylinder.         
	Oil price dip        
	Oil fell $5 a barrel to a six-week low on Tuesday as a tropical storm moving over the Gulf of Mexico was expected to miss most major oil and gas installations. The losses come after the biggest weekly price decline in oils history last week.

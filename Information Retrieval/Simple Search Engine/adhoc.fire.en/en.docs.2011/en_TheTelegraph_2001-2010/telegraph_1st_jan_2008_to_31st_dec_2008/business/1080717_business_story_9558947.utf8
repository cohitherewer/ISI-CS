          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                H.M. Nerurkar in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture    
	Calcutta, July 16: Tata Metaliks Ltd (TML), the largest pig iron manufacturer in the country, has decided to diversify into castings.        
	The company, a subsidiary of Tata Steel, is drawing up a plan to foray into this sector.         
	TML chairman H.M. Nerurkar said the plants were expected to come up at Kharagpur in Bengal and Redi in Maharashtra.        
	The size of the foundries and the possible investment in the venture will be known after the plan is conceived.        
	We hope to sell to auto components and engineering sectors, Harsh K. Jha, managing director of TML, said.         
	Jha and Nerurkar were speaking on the sidelines of companys 18th annual general meeting here today.        
	Tata Steel had a large foundry operation but it was subsequently closed down. The people employed there could be brought in for their experience.        
	Steel plans        
	Tata Metaliks is also exploring possibilities to set up integrated steel plants in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.        
	It has progressed substantially in Karnataka. Tata Metaliks proposal for the 800,000-million-tonne steel plant has been approved by the state government. It has sought captive iron ore mines there without which the plant would not be built.        
	It is also pursuing similar opportunities in Madhya Pradesh. Incidentally, the Calcutta-headquartered company had wished to begin its steel making initiative in Bengal, but the state failed to provide 350 acres it had sought.         
	Net sales        
	TML has reported sales of Rs 311 crore in the first quarter of 2008-09 compared with Rs 208 crore in the same period last year.         
	The profit after tax rose to Rs 20.23 crore in the reporting period from Rs 15.36 crore in the year-ago period.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Finance ministry for higher spectrum fee 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finance ministry for higher spectrum fee 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 9: The finance ministry has proposed a higher price for spectrum being given now to telecom operators. It wants a price of Rs 1,300 crore per MHz against the present price of Rs 250-300 crore.        
	In a letter to the department of telecommunications (DoT), the ministry has proposed a new price formula for spectrum, for existing as well as new players with retrospective effect.        
	Operators unwilling to pay the extra price should surrender spectrum, the ministry said. The DoT is studying the proposal and is yet to comment. Officials who have seen the report, however, said the proposals seemed unrealistic and the DoT had been taken by surprise.         
	Telecom firms have expressed shock at the prospect of paying more, that too with retrospective effect, and said any move by the DoT to consider the proposal would lead to serious litigation.        
	Under the proposed norms, new players such as Unitech, Videocons Datacom and Shyam Telelink will have to pay around Rs 5,700 crore for 4.4MHz of start-up spectrum against Rs 1,650 crore now.        
	Moreover, existing players such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications, who are using around 10MHz in various circles will have to pay more than Rs 13,000 crore extra.        
	The finance ministry had always favoured the auction of spectrum to generate more revenues for the government.         
	The DoT has resisted attempts to change the existing subscriber-based allocation norms, arguing that the auction mechanism will put entrants at a disadvantage.

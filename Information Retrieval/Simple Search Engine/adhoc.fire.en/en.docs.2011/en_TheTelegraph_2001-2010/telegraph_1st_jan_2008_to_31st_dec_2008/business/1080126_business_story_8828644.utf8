             Jindal: Looking ahead
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 25: The JSW group of Sajjan Jindal is in talks with overseas partners for its port, shipyard and plate mill projects at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.
    
	Requiring investments of $1.15 billion over the next few years, the three projects are exercises in forward integration vis--vis the groups proposed steel mill at Salboni, Bengal.
    
	JSW Infrastructure, a group company, will build the port and the shipyard. Jindal said he was holding discussions with a global leader on these two projects.
    
	For the port project, the group needs $250 million, while for the shipyard it needs $400 million.
    
	The plate mill will call for $500 million of investment. I am in talks with a Japanese company for this project, Jindal said in Calcutta today.
    
	He said the group would hold majority stakes in all the projects.
    
	Chile ore
    
	For the Salboni plant, Jindal may import iron ore from mines in Chile, which he acquired earlier this month.
    
	However, the first priority is ore from India. 
    
	But in case a linkage does not work out, we will import ore from Latin America, Jindal said.
    
	The Bengal project will be funded by global financiers, for which the Jindals need to have a raw material source.
    
	The other option involves balancing high costs of one transaction with revenues from another.
    
	Jindal may buy local ore at an international parity price that is high, to be balanced by the sale of the Chile ore at high global prices in the US market.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: Investors are beginning to show a voracious appetite for initial public offerings.
    
	Kishore Biyanis Future Capital Holdings (FCH) today reported that its flotation was oversubscribed 131 times.
    
	The strong response came only a day after Reliance Power created a record by garnering over Rs 1.08 trillion on the day the issue opened.
    
	Although the FCH issue is much smaller than Reliance Powers offer, the response indicated that investors were ready to shovel cash into IPOs in the hope of making a quick buck when the stocks list.
    
	FCH had offered 64.22 lakh shares to the public and it received bids for over 84.14 crore shares. 
    
	The biggest response was from qualified institutional investors with this segment oversubscribed 107 times followed by 33 times in the category earmarked for high net worth individuals. The retail segment was oversubscribed 27 times.
    
	FCH had wanted to raise up to Rs 490 crore. 
    
	The proceeds will be deployed in the companys consumer credit business  Future Money, which was launched in June last year. The price band for the IPO was between Rs 700 and Rs 765 per share.
    
	The issue constitutes 10.16 per cent of the post-issue paid-up capital of the company.
    
	Observers tracking the primary markets said it was not unusual for companies to receive subscriptions of over 100 times. Some of the issues that have seen massive oversubscriptions include the Religare IPO which was subscribed by over 160 times.

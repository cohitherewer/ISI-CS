The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Identity crisis confounds MTN deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Identity crisis confounds MTN deal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; JAYATI GHOSE                             Ramaphosa (top), Ambani: Tough negotiations                                 
	New Delhi , June 1: Reliance Communications (R-Com) may have to pay a hefty premium to MTN, similar to rival Bharti Airtels proposal, though the Anil Ambani-firm may hope to get either less than full control or, at best, indirect control of the South African telecom giant. Bharti had called off its talks with MTN on May 24 after failing to reach an agreement on the structure of a combined entity.        
	Bharti was reportedly willing to give up to a 25 per cent premium on MTNs share value for a buyout.         
	For R-Com, the deal may not be any cheaper.         
	The negotiations between R-Com and MTN could either be for a share-cum-cash deal or a share swap offer, involving a reverse merger, but in either case MTN will retain its South African identity.         
	Merchant bankers close to the deal say Cyril Ramaphosa, who heads MTN and is also a prominent African National Congress leader, wants to retain a South African identity for the $35-billion MTN, Africas largest telecom company.         
	Ramaphosa, who has long been seen as a possible candidate for the post of South Africas president, is also likely to insist on the chief executives post in the new entity going to MTN.         
	R-Com had been holding secret talks with MTN even as the latter was finalising a deal with its rival Bharti Airtel. While Bharti is the No. 1 operator in India, R-Com is second.        
	Ramaphosa had always insisted on retaining a South African identity for MTN with preferably no foreign buyer having majority control.         
	As a politician and one who has been in the limelight for a long time in South Africa, Ramaphosa will find it difficult to agree to a total sellout of MTN to a non-South African company. He recently played a big role in defusing the anti-foreigner riots in South Africa         
	According to analysts, Ramaphosa needs to show that his credentials as a South African are intact to his countrys electorate. This will be useful if he runs for the South African presidency.         
	Named in 2007 as one of the Time magazines 100 most influential people worldwide, Ramaphosa, had chaired South Africas black economic empowerment commission in the past. Analysts said a proposed combination of R-Com and MTN could catapult the merged entity into the top league of telecom players, which includes China Mobile, the worlds largest operator by market capitalisation, and Vodafone, the largest by revenue.         
	Merchant bankers said an option for R-Com chairman Anil Ambani was to swap most or all of his 66 per cent stake in the company for the shares of MTN. Ambani could end up with a 34 per cent stake in MTN. Bharti Airtel was considering an offer for MTN at Rand 165-175 a share before the talks collapsed.         
	Phuthuma Nhleko, MTNs chief executive, could retain his position following any merger with R-Com. Ambani may become the co-chairman of the enlarged entity along with Ramaphosa, analysts said.         
	If there is a reverse merger, MTN would be required under Indian rules to make an open offer to R-Coms minority shareholders for up to 20 per cent of the companys stock. This would, however, take MTNs holding in R-Com to beyond 74 per cent. Indian rules do not allow foreign holding in a telecom company in excess of 74 per cent.        
	This is why the other alternative of a cash-cum-share swap is being evaluated. This will mean MTN will get less than the 66 per cent stake that Ambani has in his company, yet be in majority control of Reliance Communications. But such a move may also involve an open offer for the public holding in the Indian telecom firm.        
	The South African telecom giant has been courted by many in the past few years, including China Mobile and Etilsalat. But, it seems, the company has the habit of dumping its suitors.         
	It had promised to exchange marriage vows, only to ditch the suitors for some reason or other, said analysts.         
	And each time MTN said it was in talks for a deal, the price of its stock soared.        
	In October last year, China Mobile, was learnt to be close to striking a deal with MTN. Nothing materialised.         
	In November 2006, China Telecom was reported to be in talks to buy MTN. We wish to deny the news report of China Telecom buying MTN, the Chinese company said then. But MTN shares rose 6 per cent.

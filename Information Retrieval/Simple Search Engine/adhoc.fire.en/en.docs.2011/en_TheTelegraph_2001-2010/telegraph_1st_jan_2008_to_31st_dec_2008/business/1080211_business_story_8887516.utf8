	Sivaganga, Feb. 10 (PTI): Education and agriculture sectors will get top priority in the coming Union budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram has said.        
	The education sector is important as literacy can make India a superpower, Chidambaram told a public meeting after distributing the Congress membership cards to 2,000 people in his Lok Sabha constituency.        
	In the past three years, the UPA government has allocated Rs 28,600 crore for education, of which Rs 17,636 crore has been distributed, he said. The amount is four times the amount allocated during the BJP-led NDA regime, the minister added.        
	Last week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said the Centre would soon announce a loan relief package for farmers. Singh had said that the finance minister would take a decision shortly on relief to farmers.

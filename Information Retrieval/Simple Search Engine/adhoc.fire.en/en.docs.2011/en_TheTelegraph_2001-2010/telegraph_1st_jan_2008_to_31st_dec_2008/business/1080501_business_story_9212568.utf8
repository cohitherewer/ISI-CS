	Mumbai, April 30: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today affirmed its BBB- long-term and A-3 short-term sovereign credit ratings for India. The outlook on the long-term rating remains stable.         
	The global rating agency said this reflected the countrys strong economic prospects, external balance sheet and its deep capital market, which supported a weak but improving fiscal position.        
	According to S amp;P, Indias economic prospects remain strong, underpinned by the dynamic services sector, gradual deregulation of the industrial sector, continued trade liberalisation and modest improvements in infrastructure.         
	It pointed out that economic growth also benefitted from higher consumption because of a growing middle class.        
	Commitment to fiscal consolidation across all levels of the government looks to be entrenched, aided by strong revenue collection and expenditure controls, said Takahira Ogawa, credit analyst at S amp;P.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks baulk at bailout bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Banks baulk at bailout bid
  - Response to repo auction lukewarm          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: Banks failed to rise to the bait and nibble at the Rs 20,000-crore bailout package that the Reserve Bank of India threw as a lifeline to the cash-strapped mutual fund industry.        
	The results of the special repo auction that came out in the evening showed that only four banks had put in bids for Rs 3,500 crore.        
	It was not immediately clear why the banks had shown tepid interest in the bailout package.        
	One theory was that with a growing clamour for a repo rate cut  supported by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia  it might be prudent for banks to wait for the monetary policy review on October 24 and see whether the central bank obliges.        
	Other bankers felt that there was a need for greater clarity on the way the bailout funds would be doled out to mutual funds.        
	This is the first time that the RBI is coming out with such a scheme targeted at mutual funds. Therefore, banks are naturally hesitant. The RBI could come out with one more auction under this facility later this month, said a treasury head with a private sector bank who did not wish to be named.        
	Under the terms of the plan, the banks will borrow money from the RBI under a 14-day repo facility at 9 per cent and pass it on to the stressed mutual funds at a slightly higher rate.        
	The mutual funds have been swamped by redemption claims in the past month. However, there are no official figures available yet to indicate whether these claims will top the Rs 13.6 lakh crore redemptions in the first quarter ended June 30.        
	The central bank also relaxed rules relating to certificates of deposits (CDs), permitting banks and financial institutions to lend money to the mutual funds against these securities.        
	Under the rules, banks can issue short-term CDs with a maturity of seven to 365 days.         
	Financial institutions are permitted to issue CDs with tenors ranging between one and three years.        
	The RBI has now allowed banks and financial institutions to buy back their CDs before maturity. Under current regulations, banks cannot lend against these CDs nor can they redeem them before maturity.        
	According to RBI data, around Rs 1.72 lakh crore worth of CDs are outstanding with banks as of August 29. The interest on these instruments ranges between 10 and 11.75 per cent.        
	But there were some doubts about the size of the bailout package and whether it would meet the needs of the industry.        
	A.P. Kurian, chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), said the bailout would provide a line of credit to the market but might not be sufficient.        
	Industry experts say that liquid and liquid plus schemes have been hit hardest by redemption claims. Liquid funds have faced claims of over Rs 1,000 crore in the past few days, over and above the Rs 19,000-crore outflow last month.

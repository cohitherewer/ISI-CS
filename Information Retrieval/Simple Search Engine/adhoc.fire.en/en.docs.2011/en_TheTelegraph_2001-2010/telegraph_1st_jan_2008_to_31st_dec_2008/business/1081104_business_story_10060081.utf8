          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: Real estate leader DLF today said it had put on hold the projects with Hilton Hotels Corporation because of a lack of funds.        
	We have pushed back our hotel project by 12-18 months as our joint venture partner (Hilton) is facing problems in arranging for funds on account of the global liquidity crisis. But the project is very much on track, said sources in DLF.        
	They said DLF was also finding it difficult to organise funds since a tight monetary policy and the rise in home loan rates have severely affected realty.        
	According to DLF vice-president Rajiv Singh, there has been a 20-22 per cent drop in the sale of housing units in the second quarter of the current fiscal. DLF expects prices and volumes to stabilise in the next eight months.        
	The DLF-Hilton combine is setting up 17 hotels. The first is at Saket in New Delhi. It will be a Garden Inn brand with 180 rooms, said a source. Hilton has a 26 per cent stake in the joint entity, named DLF-Hilton Hotels.         
	The Hilton group had tied up with DLF after it ended its four-year relationship with the Oberoi group. Industry grapevine says it was Hiltons negotiations with DLF that soured its relations with the Oberois. The alliance between the Oberoi group and Hilton came to an end on April 1, 2008.        
	Through the joint venture with DLF, Hilton plans to bring its brands such as Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites to India.        
	Other brands of Hilton include Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hampton Inn Hotels amp; Suites and Hilton HHonors.         
	Under the terms of the joint venture between DLF and Hilton, hotels are slated to come up in Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Trivandrum and Chandigarh. In the next five to seven years, there are plans for 75 hotels.         
	DLF will build the hotels to be managed by an affiliate of Hilton Hotels Corporation in India.

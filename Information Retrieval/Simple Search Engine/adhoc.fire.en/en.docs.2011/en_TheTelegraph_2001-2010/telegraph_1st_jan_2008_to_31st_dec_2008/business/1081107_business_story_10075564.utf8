	Washington, Nov. 6 (PTI): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today lowered Indias growth forecast for the next year to 6.3 per cent  0.6 per cent less than what it had projected last month  as the financial crisis engulfs the world.        
	Growth in world economic output for the next year is also likely to suffer, with the multilateral funding agency projecting it to fall 0.8 per cent to 2.2 per cent.        
	The forecast was part of World Economic Outlook Update that the IMF released today.        
	The IMF projection suggests that the global growth in the volume of trade in goods and services will slide to 4.6 per cent from 7.2 per cent in 2008 and dip to 2.1 per cent next year.        
	World economic growth is likely to slow down to 3.37 per cent this year, while Indias economic growth is expected to dip just 0.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent than what was forecast last month.

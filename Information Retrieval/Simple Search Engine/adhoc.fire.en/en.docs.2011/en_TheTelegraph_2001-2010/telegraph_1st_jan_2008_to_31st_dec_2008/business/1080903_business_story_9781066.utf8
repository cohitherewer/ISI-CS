The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil slips as Gustav worry recedes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil slips as Gustav worry recedes
                              Welcome slide                            
	London, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Oil slid to around $107 a barrel today after initial reports showed Hurricane Gustav had spared major oil facilities in the US Gulf region. US crude was $107.16 a barrel by 1321 GMT, down $8.30 from Fridays close. It touched a session low of $105.46, its lowest since April 2.        
	A US public holiday on Monday meant the New York Mercantile Exchange did not issue an official settlement price for US crude on Monday.        
	London Brent crude was down $3.59 at $105.82. As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, the market refocused on bearish factors, including a softer global economy, weaker demand for oil and a stronger US dollar.        
	These had already begun to drive down prices, which have dropped about $40 from a peak of $147.27 a barrel hit on July 11.        
	Hurricane Gustav, combined with Russias conflict with Georgia, which disrupted flows of oil and gas, had halted the slide. If it were not for these threats, we would have been testing $100 already, said Mike Wittner of Societe Generale.         
	An upturn in the dollar along with decline in oil demand in the US and China, the worlds top two energy consumers, looks set to exert further pressure on the market.        
	No immediate relief        
	The fall in the global crude price is unlikely to bring cheer to Indian vehicle owners as the government has ruled out any immediate reduction in fuel prices, adds our Delhi Bureau.        
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said there had not been enough reduction in global prices to warrant a price cut.         
	Energy analysts Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG, said, From the policy perspective, if the government continues with the present prices of oil, it will have to pay less quantum bonds.        
	Jason Schwarz, energy strategist for Lone Peak Asset Management, has projected that global crude prices will plummet to $30-50 a barrel in the long term. His projection is contrary to earlier estimates of Goldman Sachs that crude can touch $200 a barrel by the end of the year.

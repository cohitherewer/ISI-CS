	New Delhi, Aug. 14 (PTI): Reliance Industries Ltd has submitted a development plan for eight more gas discoveries in its prolific eastern offshore KG-D6 block.        
	The discoveries are adjacent to the Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3 gas fields that are under development, said Canadas Niko Resources, Reliances junior partner in KG-D6.         
	Production from Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3 fields is expected to commence by September-end. The plans are for the eight satellite discoveries to be tied back to the Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3 facilities.        
	Numerous other prospects have been identified in the deep-water areas of the block where further upside potential will be evaluated, Niko said.         
	Reliance will invest $5.2 billion to bring to production the Dhirubhai 1 and Dhirubhai 3 fields. The initial output is estimated at 40 million standard cubic meters per day, and the output will double in one year.         
	The company has already invested $3.28 billion by June 30. Fourteen of the planned 18 phase-I wells will be tied in after start-up, Niko said.        
	Oil production        
	Generation of oil from the MA oilfield in the same block will start in a month. The field is estimated to have a peak oil production rate of 40,000 barrels per day. An investment of $2.2 billion has been earmarked for developing the oilfield.        
	Niko has a 10 per cent stake in the 7,645 sq km KG-D6 block. Reliance is the operator with a 90 per cent interest. The block was awarded to Reliance-Niko in Indias first international bid round in 1999.

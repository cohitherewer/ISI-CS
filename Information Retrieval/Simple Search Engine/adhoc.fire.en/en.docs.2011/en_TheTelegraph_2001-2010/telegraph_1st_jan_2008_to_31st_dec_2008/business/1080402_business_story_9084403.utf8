          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 1: Reliance Industries (RIL) today announced a second gas discovery of 38.1 million cubic feet a day in a Krishna Godavari basin block, off the Andhra Pradesh coast, which is commercially viable.        
	Company officials said the gas flow was commercially viable and would submit an appraisal plan within 60 days.        
	The well KGVD3-B1 (second well on the block) was drilled at a water depth of 711 metres, to a total depth of 2730 metres. Excellent qualities of reservoirs were encountered with gross hydrocarbon columns of around 111 meters, they said.        
	The second discovery has been named Dhirubhai-41 and been notified to the government and the directorate general of hydrocarbons.         
	Reliance Industries holds a 90 per cent interest in the block with Hardy Exploration and Production India Inc owning the remaining 10 per cent.        
	Block KGDWN-2003/1, which lies about 50 km off Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh, is in the same region as the prolific KG-D6 block, from where Reliance plans to start producing 40 million standard cubic meters per day of gas later this year.

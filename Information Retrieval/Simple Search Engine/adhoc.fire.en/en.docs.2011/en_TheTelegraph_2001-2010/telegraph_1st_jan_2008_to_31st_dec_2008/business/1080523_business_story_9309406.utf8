          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Aga: Standing tall                                        
	Mumbai, May 22: US private equity firm Providence Equity Partners will acquire a 20 per cent stake in Aditya Birla Telecom Ltd (ABTL), the subsidiary of Idea Cellular, for $640 million.        
	The investment will be in the form of compulsory convertible preference shares.        
	ABTL holds the GSM licence for the Bihar circle, including Jharkhand.         
	Idea Cellular will also transfer its 16 per cent stake in tower joint venture Indus Towers to ABTL. The other partners in Indus include Vodafone, Essar Ltd and Bharti Airtel.        
	The money from the deal will be used to roll out ABTLs GSM network in Bihar and set up more towers in the region.         
	The money will also be invested in the tower firms expansion.        
	The transaction, subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, is expected to be completed in August.        
	In the coming years, we are also thinking of listing ABTL. The money will be used to fund the companys growth plans and any other telecom business it might venture into, for instance, a 3G licence in Bihar, said Sanjeev Aga, managing director of Idea Cellular.        
	ABTL is expected to launch GSM services in Bihar and Jharkhand by the end of August. Tower infrastructure is currently being set up in the two states.        
	Aga said his company had been studying the market in Bihar, where Bharti was the leader. The region has the second highest population among all service areas in India but has the lowest mobile penetration, providing huge potential for growth.        
	Providence Equity also holds a 12.5 per cent stake in Idea Cellular and has invested around $400 million in the company. Idea operates in 11 circles, with a subscriber base of 25 million.        
	It has licences to operate in all the 22 service areas in the country.        
	The company plans to launch services in Mumbai in the third quarter of the current fiscal.        
	The Idea Cellular stock shed 3.94 per cent to close at Rs 107.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

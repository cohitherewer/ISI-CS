The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bond analysts urge caution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bond analysts urge caution
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 17: The bond market ought to have been chuffed by the surprisingly modest increase in inflation but the mavens have given only a cautious sign of approval.        
	This could just be an aberration, said Namrata Padhye, fixed income research analyst at IDBI Gilts. The market had expected inflation to top 12 per cent for the week ended July 5.        
	Although inflation is below 12 per cent, it is still at double digit levels, Padhye said. She reckoned that bond yields would remain high in the days ahead.        
	With inflation coming at 11.91 per cent and the markets having ample time to digest the information, it is felt that the equities could stage a rally tomorrow.         
	The BSE sensex today gained over 536 points on lower crude oil prices that saw most of the overseas markets remaining firm.        
	However, lower crude prices  coupled with optimism that inflation stays below 12 per cent  saw government security prices rallying handsomely on the markets today. Yields on the benchmark 10-year security, which had ended at 9.38 per cent on Wednesday, finished today at 9.22 per cent.        
	Although many in the bond market believe that the Reserve Bank of India could raise rates in its quarterly review on July 29, they are divided over whether it will be a 25 basis point or half a percentage point rise in the repo rate.        
	Harihar Krishnamurthy, country treasurer with Development Credit Bank, said todays rally on the bond markets would be short-lived if crude oil prices headed north.

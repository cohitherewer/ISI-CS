The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pressure on airlines to cut fares
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pressure on airlines to cut fares
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Talking tough                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The government today asked airlines to slash fares following the 11 per cent cut in jet fuel price announced yesterday by state-run oil companies.        
	It is imperative that the aviation industry reduces fares as fuel prices are down, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel. We supported the aviation industry when the ATF (aviation turbine fuel or jet fuel) prices were high. Now when the prices are down, the industry should take the cue and reduce prices and thus boost demand. Jet fuel comprises 45 per cent of an airlines operating cost.        
	Airlines, which had raised fares when fuel prices started climbing earlier this year, have refused to roll back the hike. They want to recoup losses suffered when fuel prices were high. Seat occupancy for most airlines has dipped to about 50 per cent from 70 per cent in 2007.        
	Sources said the ministers directive would force state-owned Air India to cut fares. Budget airlines such as SpiceJet may follow suit.         
	The bigger airlines will wait before taking a decision.         
	Fuel price has dropped more than 50 per cent since August, when it peaked at Rs 73,673.56 a kilolitre.         
	Earlier in the day, Patel asked states to lower the sales tax on jet fuel. He told the Rajya Sabha that the sales tax varied from 4 per cent to 32 per cent across states.         
	VAT panel chief and Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta said he was opposed to the Centre declaring jet fuel a declared good, which would reduce the tax to 4 per cent.         
	Analysts said higher fares had kept away passengers. Airlines have increased fares five times this year, citing soaring fuel prices.        
	Jet fuel prices are linked to the global price of crude. From the middle of this year, crude started moderating, and so did jet fuel.        
	Petrol relief        
	The government could cut the excise duty on petrol and diesel again, possibly a few weeks before the Lok Sabha polls next year.        
	We will watch (crude oil) prices (to see) if a further reduction is possible, home minister P. Chidambaram said in the Rajya Sabha.         
	On December 4, petrol became cheaper by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 2, and sources said another round of cuts might happen before the polls.

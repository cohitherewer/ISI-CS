               Murthy: New role
              
	London, March 3 (Agencies): N.R. Narayana Murthy, chief mentor of Infosys Technologies, will join the HSBC board in May. His annual remuneration will be 65,000 (about Rs 52 lakh).
    
	Nagavara Ramarao Narayana Murthy has been appointed a director of HSBC Holdings with effect from May 1, 2008. He will be an independent non-executive director, HSBC said in a regulatory filing here.
    
	The appointment shall be for an initial three-year term, which will expire at the conclusion of the 2011 annual general meeting, it said.
    
	As a non-executive director, Murthy will not have a service contract with HSBC Holdings and will be paid a directors fee of 65,000 pounds per annum as authorised by the shareholders at the 2006 annual general meeting, it said.
    
	According to the statement, the directors have determined that Murthy is independent and he has no interests in the shares of HSBC.
    
	Murthy is also an independent non-executive director of Unilever.
    
	Profits up 10%
    
	HSBCs profits rose 10 per cent last year, just below analysts forecasts, as strong gains in Asia helped Europes biggest bank absorb a $17.2-billion hit for bad debts largely because of the US housing problems.
    
	The London-headquartered bank reported a record pre-tax profit of $24.2 billion for 2007, up from $22.1 billion in 2006. This was below an average forecast of $24.7 billion from a Reuters Estimates poll of analysts but well within the forecast range.

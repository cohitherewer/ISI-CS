          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Hopeful                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: P. Chidambaram today said the economy would register a very satisfactory growth, notwithstanding a temporary slowdown. He today bid adieu to the finance ministry to take charge of home.        
	Inflation will moderate and the growth rate will be very satisfactory, he said.        
	The year was the most eventful of Chidambarams career. He had to fight inflation and the global financial meltdown, only to be confronted by the terror attacks in Mumbai, which led to his shift to the home ministry.        
	He said there was some incomplete work in the finance ministry, adding that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was the best person to guide the economy and tackle the fallout of the financial crisis and the attacks. Singh is now in charge of the finance ministry.        
	Prime Minister was a governor of the RBI, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and a finance minister. We need co-ordination of these three (in finance ministry) and he (Manmohan Singh) has held all the three positions earlier, said Chidambaram.        
	Chidambaram said India would overcome the negative business sentiments caused by the Mumbai terror attack.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tatas weigh firm to meet input needs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Hunt is on      
	Calcutta, April 23: The Tatas are exploring the possibility of setting up a mining firm to meet the raw material requirements of their group companies.        
	The company will mainly scout for mining rights abroad in coal and iron ore. Two group companies, Tata Steel and Tata Power, are likely to hold stakes in the venture.        
	When contacted, a Tata group spokesperson declined to comment.        
	However, sources said such a company was in the making to tap global opportunities in a more focused manner.        
	Tata Steel is actively scouring for coal and iron ore reserves, primarily to feed the operations of the UKs Corus, which it acquired last year.        
	It has bought an iron ore mine in Mozambique and obtained an iron ore lease in Ivory Coast. Tata Power has also bought a mine in Indonesia for its mega power project at Mundra in Gujarat.        
	Sources said there could be synergies between Tata Power and Tata Steel in coal, though their requirements were different. Tata Power needs thermal coal to fire its boilers, while Tata Steel requires coking coal for steelmaking.        
	There are mines where both exist  a prime example being Riversdale Minings coal project in Mozambique, in which Tata Steel acquired a 35 per cent stake in August last year. It contains both hard coking coal with a low ash content and thermal coal with a higher ash content.         
	There is a possibility that the new mining company could look at other raw materials besides coal and iron ore, depending upon the future requirement of the group, sources said.        
	Tata Steel has decided to enter into a joint venture with public sector MMTC for mining abroad, as announced by minister of state for commerce and power Jairam Ramesh earlier this month.        
	It has also entered into a joint venture with another public sector company, Steel Authority of India Limited, for coal mining within India.        
	S amp;P downgrade        
	Rating agency Standard and Poors (S amp;P) today downgraded Tata Steels corporate credit rating to stable (BB) from positive, while assigning the same rating to the companys unsecured bank loans.        
	The downward revision was prompted by the uncertainty over the infusion of additional equity for the acquisition of Corus and some increase in capital commitments, specifically for its expansion projects in India.

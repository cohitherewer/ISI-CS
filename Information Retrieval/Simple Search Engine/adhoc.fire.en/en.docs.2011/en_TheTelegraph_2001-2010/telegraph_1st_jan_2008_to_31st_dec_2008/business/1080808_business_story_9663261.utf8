	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The rate of inflation today breached the 12-per-cent-mark as prices of pulses, spices, eggs, fish, sugar and meat continued to rise, though the finance ministry and some analysts saw signs of stability.        
	For the week ending July 26, inflation was at 12.01 per cent, a marginal 0.03 per cent increase over the previous week.        
	Both the finance ministry and the Planning Commission struck a positive note.         
	While the finance ministry said the rate of price rise was stable on a week-on-week basis, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia felt inflation would moderate to single digits in the next few months. It will come down below double digit this fiscal, Ahluwalia said.        
	According to D.K. Joshi, principal economist with credit rating agency Crisil, Inflation appears to have broadly stabilised. Much will depend on the movement of global crude oil prices and the monsoon.        
	However, Sonal Varma, economist with Lehman Brothers, said Lehman expected inflation to peak in October-November at around 13.5-14 per cent and stay in double digits till the end of this fiscal.        
	Varma said the price of crude was likely to fall sharply to $90 a barrel in the first quarter of 2009, which would have a decisive impact.        
	Data showed that prices of most of the food articles were rising, though fruit prices fell 0.5 per cent. The prices of iron and steel remained unchanged but cement prices marginally increased.        
	According to the revised data, inflation for the week ended May 31 was 9.32 per cent against 8.75 per cent reported earlier.

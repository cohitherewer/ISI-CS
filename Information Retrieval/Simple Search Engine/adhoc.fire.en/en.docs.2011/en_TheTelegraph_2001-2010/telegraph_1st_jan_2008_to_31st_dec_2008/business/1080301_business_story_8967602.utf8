The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Populism wins over fiscal prudence
                                                                                                               Populism wins over fiscal prudence
        Guest Column - Anil Singhvi                        
	In perhaps one of the longest budget speeches in recent times, P. Chidambaram delivered exactly what was expected to be delivered: An Election Budget.        
	In one stroke, the government has tried to please three-crore farmers, and if one takes the average family size of four, 12 per cent of our population.         
	Time only will tell whether the so called relief to the farmers really turns into a vote bank.         
	But this government, otherwise very weak on all fronts, has delivered this very bold initiative to woo farmers at the cost of the Indian banking sector and fiscal prudence.         
	A Rs 60,000-crore waiver is about 1.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and almost half of the estimated fiscal deficit for the next year.         
	The question is  who will pay for this? We are going through very uncertain times of a global slowdown this year with inflation as a major cause for concern.         
	In such a scenario to grant a Rs 60,000-crore waiver is definitely going to fuel inflation. It is political populism against economic prudence.        
	Chidambaram devoted over 90 minutes to share his governments initiatives on health, education and social welfare. All his initiatives are definitely populist than growth oriented, with both eyes firmly on the coming elections.         
	If one views this budget as probably the last of this government, one is clearly disappointed.         
	During last four years the present government completely missed the opportunity of bringing major policy initiatives and accelerate the reform process.        
	One is also reminded of the fact that in 2004 when this government came into power, the economic ministries were hailed as a dream team.         
	Now when one compares with results versus expectations, one is clearly disappointed that most policy measures remained uninitiated whether it is in the sectors of insurance, disinvestment, pension, labour or agricultural reforms.         
	In fact if the government had initiated large irrigation projects and agricultural reforms, we would have avoided the sad events of farmer suicides leave alone the Rs 60,000-crore hole in our pockets.         
	It is ironical that on the one hand we have spiralling food inflation and on the other, we are writing off Rs 60,000 crore of farmers loan. It can happen only in India.        
	The revenue estimates of the budget are prepared on a high expectation of a GDP growth of about 9 per cent during 2008-09, and in that backdrop Chidambaram has estimated a fiscal deficit of 2.5 per cent, which clearly does not include the Rs 60,000-crore waiver and the big impact on account of a hike in salaries based on Sixth Pay Commission recommendations to be implemented from April 1 2008.         
	I am sure the fiscal deficit for the next year is going to be much larger than 2.5 per cent.        
	Apart from this, there is no major policy decision in this budget and it is no different than any other budget with usual tinkerings.

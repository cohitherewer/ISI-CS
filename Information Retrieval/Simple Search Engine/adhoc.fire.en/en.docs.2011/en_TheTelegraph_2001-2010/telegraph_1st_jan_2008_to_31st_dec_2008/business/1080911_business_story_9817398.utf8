	For a firm with a capacity of just 45 mega watt, DPSCs attractiveness, according to analysts, lies in its distribution power  it has a licence to supply electricity over a 618-square-kilometre area in the AsansolRaniganj industrial belt, where many steel plants and downstream units are coming up.        
	Moreover, it has a transmission network extending up to Bihar. The company has land and a right of way. In todays time, they are highly valuable, the analysts said.

	Tide Water stake        
	Andrew Yule is set to float a tender for the appointment of a merchant banker to sell its stake in subsidiary Tide Water Oil, which makes auto lubricants such as Veedol and Eneos.         
	The company had posted a 14 per cent growth in volume in the last financial year compared with a three per cent industry growth. Profit had risen to Rs 23.17 crore in 2007-08 from Rs 8.97 crore a year ago.         
	R.N. Ghosal, chief executive of Tide Water, was confident that the company would be able to repeat the result this year.        
	Despite the highly volatile crude oil market, we have hedged our position and achieved this result. We are the No. 2 player in our segment. Tide Water will consolidate its position further, he said.

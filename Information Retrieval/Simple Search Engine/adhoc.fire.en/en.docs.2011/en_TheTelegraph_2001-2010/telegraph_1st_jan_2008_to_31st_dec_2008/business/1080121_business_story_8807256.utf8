     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: UPA alliance members are likely to meet on Monday to discuss fuel prices. This will be followed by a meeting of the group of ministers (GoM) on fuel.
    
	Depending on the outcome of the alliance meeting and that of the GoM, the Union cabinet can meet later in the evening to take a final call on the issue.
    
	On Friday, the government had postponed the GoM meeting of Saturday as four of its seven members were unavailable. 
    
	Sources said the government wanted to take its allies into confidence before taking any decision on a price hike, even though it might be nominal.
    
	On Friday, the government issued bonds worth Rs 11,256.92 crore to state-owned oil companies to partly compensate them for selling fuel below cost.
    
	It issued bonds worth Rs 6,362.25 crore to the Indian Oil Corporation, Rs 2,539.13 crore to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Rs 2,355.54 crore to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited.
    
	The bonds, which will mature in 2025, will pay 7.95 per cent interest, the finance ministry had said in a statement.
    
	The companies will get compensated for 42.7 per cent of their losses through oil bonds and 35 per cent through assistance from upstream government entities Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, GAIL (India) Limited and Oil India. 
    
	This still leaves uncovered a gap of 22.3 per cent.

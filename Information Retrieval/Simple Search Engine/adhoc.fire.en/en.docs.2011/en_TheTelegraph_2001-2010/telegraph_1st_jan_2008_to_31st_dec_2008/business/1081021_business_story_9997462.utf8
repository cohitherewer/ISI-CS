          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The board of Ranbaxy Laboratories has approved the allotment of equity shares and warrants to Daiichi Sankyo through an off-market deal.        
	With this, Daiichi will acquire a 52.5 per cent stake in the domestic pharmaceutical company, comprising 22.06 crore shares. It had earlier acquired a 20 per cent stake.        
	The announcement comes amid speculation of the deal getting scuttled because of the global market meltdown.         
	Malvinder Singh, CEO and MD of Ranbaxy, said, We expect to assimilate the available synergies of both partners to exponentially enhance the overall scope, scale and effectiveness of the business.        
	Ranbaxy shares closed 2.15 per cent higher at Rs 261.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Ranbaxy received Rs 3,585 crore from the Japanese firm for the preferential allotment.        
	Market regulator Sebi had earlier rejected the companys proposal to close the transaction through a block deal on the bourses.         
	Singh said the transaction tax would be paid by the promoters to the government.

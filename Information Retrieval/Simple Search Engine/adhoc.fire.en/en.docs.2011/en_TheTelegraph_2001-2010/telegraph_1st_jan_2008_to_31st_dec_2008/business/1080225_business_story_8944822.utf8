The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RPower reveals bonus detail
                                                                                                               RPower reveals bonus detail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Sunday. (Reuters)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: The board of Reliance Power Ltd (RPower) today approved a bonus issue for all its shareholders, excluding the promoters, in the ratio of three shares for every five shares held.        
	This will bring down the price of RPower shares to Rs 269 per share for retail investors and Rs 281 for institutional investors.         
	For both the categories of investors, the new prices represent a reduction of 40 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively, compared with the price at the time of the initial public offering. Prior to the bonus issue, the retail investors were allotted the shares at Rs 430, while the institutional investors got them for Rs 450.        
	Anil D. Ambani, chairman of Reliance Anil Dhirubai Ambani Group (R-ADAG), will also transfer 2.6 per cent of the groups shareholding in RPower to Reliance Energy Ltd. The move will enable promoter company Reliance Energy to retain its 45 per cent shareholding in RPower.         
	Reliance Energy and R-ADAG are the two promoters of Reliance Power, and they own around 45 per cent each in the power generation company. A bonus issue to the other investors would have brought down their shareholding in RPower.         
	I am contributing my personal shares in Reliance Power free to the Reliance Energy shareholders. Hence, Reliance Energys shareholding in Reliance Power will be intact at 45 per cent, Anil Ambani told newspersons after a meeting of RPower and Reliance Energy boards that lasted for over three hours.         
	At the board meeting of Reliance Energy, the directors agreed to forego their rights to receive bonus shares from RPower. After the bonus issue and Ambanis voluntary contribution, R-ADAGs stake in RPower will come down to 40 per cent from 45 per cent, while the public shareholding will increase to 15 per cent from 10 per cent.         
	I have been personally concerned by the notional losses arising to millions of long-term investors in Reliance Power because of a dramatic adverse change in sentiment in global and domestic capital markets, Ambani said.         
	RPower will seek shareholders approval through a postal ballot for the bonus issue. A record date for the offering will be fixed by the stock exchanges. As on the record date, whoever holds shares of RPower will be eligible for the bonus shares.         
	Responding to a query on the companys earlier stand that its rivals wanted to hammer down stocks of entities controlled by him, Ambani said a complaint had been lodged with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.         
	When around seven Mauritius-based FIIs sell stocks in a falling market, there is something more than that meets the eye, he added.        
	Shares of Reliance Power were down 1.21 per cent on Friday at Rs 416.85 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

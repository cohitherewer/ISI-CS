The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US expects upturn in economy
                                                                                                               US expects upturn in economy
                                  
	Amman, Feb.11 (Reuters): The US growth, hurt by a sharp housing market downturn, should pick up in the second half of 2008 driven by a stimulus package and the resilience of the economy, US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez said today.        
	However, Gutierrez said the impact of the housing crisis, which took a heavy toll on growth in the latter part of 2007, could last a couple of quarters before recovery to a growth rate more akin to what we have been having over the last several years.        
	In the first half of the year we will see a lower growth rate ... but our growth should pick up in the second half of 2008, he added.        
	Gutierrez said the economy, which grew last year at 2.2 per cent, the slowest pace in five years, would continue to grow despite the downturn.        
	While we go through this correction, we will see a slower rate of GDP growth but we will continue to see GDP growth ... our economy is strong. We will get through this correction the way we got through many others, he said.        
	Gutierrez said a government stimulus package of over $150 billion approved by Congress was designed to be temporary, quick and impactful to keep the economy moving while we go through this housing correction.        
	The less-affected segments of the economy will ease the impact of the crisis in the housing sector on growth.        
	Our economy is so large and diverse that we have a lot of segments that can offset when one segment is going through a correction ... you cannot really point to one area and say thats what we are going to use to drive growth, he said.        
	Gutierrez cited positive factors such as latest unemployment figures, resilient exports, continuing investments and healthy non-residential housing construction.        
	Our last reading of unemployment was 4.9 per cent. Thats below the average of each of the past three decades, he said.        
	A US export boom encouraged by free trade deals and relentless efforts to open up new markets for US products by getting rid of barriers was now paying off and helped growth, he added.        
	The fall in residential construction spending, which was 16.9 per cent over the year, marking the worst annual performance since 1982, was being tempered by growth in commercial and industrial construction, Gutierrez said.

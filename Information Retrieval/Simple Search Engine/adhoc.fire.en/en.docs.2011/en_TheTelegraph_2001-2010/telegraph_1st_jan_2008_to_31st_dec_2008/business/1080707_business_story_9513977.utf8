	Mumbai, July 6: The Left has roundly criticised the Centre for raising fuel prices, but a key state that it rules  Bengal  has ironically failed to make any contribution to Indias energy security by promoting the use of alternative fuel sources.         
	Bengal has fallen way behind other states in implementing the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme because of a variety of issues that include the delay in the notification of taxes on ethanol and the issuance of licences.         
	Oil marketing companies (OMCs), which negotiate with the sugar industry to procure ethanol, have not been able to procure any ethanol for the state. The oil companies have projected Bengals requirement of ethanol over a three-year period at 58,831 kilolitres.         
	Bengal isnt the only state where the procurement of ethanol is nil. Orissa and Chattisgarh have been equally remiss.         
	Back in 2002, the Centre had mandated the marketing of five per cent EBP in nine states. Later, in 2006, the government ruled that subject to commercial viability, the OMCs would market five per cent EBP in more states and Union territories. These included West Bengal, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh.         
	EBP holds out the promise of environmental and macro-economic benefits. Doping petrol with ethanol supplies extra oxygen, which reduces carbon monoxide levels in auto emissions, thereby bringing down air pollution.         
	The economy also stands to gain as its implementation in all states can lead to some amount of substitution of crude oil. India imports nearly 70 per cent of its crude oil requirements.         
	In Bengal, the oil industry cancelled the procurement tender as the state government had initially not issued any notification permitting the import of ethanol and indicating taxes or levies applicable. The state government was also silent on the procedure for procurement of ethanol.         
	Although the state government issued a notification in January, the EBP programme is yet to pick up as OMCs want clarity on subjects such as the issue of licences.         
	A fresh tender for ethanol procurement is expected to be floated after these issues are addressed. It could not be immediately ascertained whether the oil companies have invited tenders.         
	In the case of Orissa and Chhattisgarh, ethanol procurement tenders could not be floated as sugar companies quoted a higher price than that anticipated by the industry.         
	Subsequently, OMCs invited fresh tenders in February and these are now being evaluated.         
	Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd (BHL), Balrampur Chini, and Shree Renuka Sugars are some of the leading ethanol suppliers. BHL officials said their company was now the tenth largest ethanol manufacturer in the world and the largest in India. They added that BHL now made close to 1 million litres of ethanol a month. At present, the company accounts for nearly 25 per cent of the countrys ethanol demand.         
	Initially, there were some problems (in EBP), but now it is smooth. The demand for ethanol will double towards the end of this year as the government is expected to mandate 10 per cent ethanol blending, the official added.

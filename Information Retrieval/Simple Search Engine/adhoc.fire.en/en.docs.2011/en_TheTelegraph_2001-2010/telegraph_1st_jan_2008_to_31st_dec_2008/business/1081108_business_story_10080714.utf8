          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A. Raja in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The government today increased the spectrum charge for telecom operators by 1 per cent of their annual gross revenue (AGR) for holding up to 8 megahertz (MHz) of radiowaves. Beyond 8MHz, the charges will go up by 2 per cent for every subsequent slab.         
	The department of telecom (DoT) has also decided to levy a one-time charge on GSM providers who hold second generation (2G) radiowaves, or spectrum, beyond 6.2MHz.         
	The government has not decided on the quantum of the one-time fee but expects to earn more than Rs 5,000 crore from the latest levy, telecom minister A. Raja said.         
	However, the DoT did not clarify whether state-run telecom companies BSNL and MTNL would also have to pay the one-time spectrum fee.        
	Under the unified access service licence, GSM players can get spectrum up to 6.2MHz. Any spectrum thereafter is allotted through administrative notification.         
	The one-time spectrum charge is likely to affect major telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular who hold more than 6.2MHz of spectrum.         
	Bharti Airtel, which has more than 6.2 MHz of radiowaves in 10 out of the 22 circles it operates, will have to shell out Rs 500 crore-2,000 crore as a one-time payment.         
	However, consumers are unlikely to be affected as these fees form an insignificant part of an operators costs. Moreover, competition is also on the rise with five operators ready to begin operations by next year, said analysts.        
	CDMA operators will be happy with the governments decision as they have been demanding that GSM firms pay an extra one-time fee for spectrum beyond 6.2MHz.         
	According to the DoTs revised annual spectrum charges, operators will have to pay 3 per cent of their AGR for holding up to 8MHz of radiowaves and 4 per cent of their revenues for spectrum beyond 8MHz and up to 10MHz. For spectrum above 10MHz and up to 12MHz, operators will have to pay 8 per cent as annual spectrum usage charges.         
	Currently, a GSM operator holding 4.4MHz of spectrum and a CDMA player with 2.5MHz pay 2 per cent of their AGR as spectrum usage charges.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The government today ruled out a cut in fuel prices despite the softening of global crude as state-owned oil companies continued to make Rs 400-crore loss per day.        
	Where is the scope for reducing prices? Oil companies are still making losses, petroleum minister Murli Deora told reporters here.        
	Oil companies continue to lose money on petrol, diesel, domestic LPG cylinder and kerosene. There has not been a substantial reduction in global prices to warrant a price cut, petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey said.        
	He said the revenue loss of oil retailers would be compensated through a combination of oil bonds and assistances from upstream firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India Ltd.        
	The drop in international oil prices has helped oil retailers, Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, trim their revenue losses  from Rs 450 crore per day a fortnight back to Rs 400 crore now.        
	The Indian basket of crude oil averaged $111.09 a barrel in the second fortnight of August compared with $117.37 per barrel in the first fortnight of the month. Based on an average price of the second fortnight of August, retailers are losing Rs 6.31 per litre on petrol, Rs 13.69 on diesel, Rs 31.39 on kerosene and Rs 312.58 per domestic LPG cylinder.         
	Crude dips        
	Crude oil price plunged more than $4 today as concerns that Hurricane Gustav would cause severe damage to the US oil sector eased as the storm weakened off the Louisiana coast.        
	Gustav  which forced the shutdown of nine refineries and most US offshore Gulf of Mexico oil production  weakened to a Category 2 storm as it approached the coast near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a key logistical port that supports 75 per cent of Gulf of Mexico drilling operations.        
	The US crude fell $4.19 to $111.27 a barrel during mid-day trading in London as markets discounted the potential damage from the storm, which had earlier been forecast to hit the US as a Category 4 storm.         
	Trade in the US was shut because of the US Labour Day holiday.        
	London Brent crude fell $4.31 to $109.74 a barrel. It looks like Gustav is not going to be as strong a storm as the market had feared, said an analyst.         
	At least 12.5 per cent of the total US refining capacity was shut down ahead of the storm and other plants cut rates.

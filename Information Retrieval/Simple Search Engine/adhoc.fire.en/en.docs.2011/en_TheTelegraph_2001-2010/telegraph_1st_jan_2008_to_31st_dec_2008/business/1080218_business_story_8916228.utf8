The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Investors shun REC bonds
                                                                                                               Investors shun REC bonds

	Calcutta, Feb. 17: The cheapest source for market borrowing is fast drying up for Rural Electrification Company Ltd (REC), a public sector entity investing in power projects in the country.         
	The mini ratna company, set to tap the capital market with its maiden public issue on February 19, managed to mobilise only Rs 2,600 crore through capital gains tax exemption bonds so far in the current fiscal.        
	REC expects to raise between Rs 1,405 crore and Rs 1,639 crore from the public offering. The issue closes on February 22.        
	The Finance Bill 2006-07 had authorised only REC and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to issue bonds in which investments will be eligible for exemption under Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act. This was done to allow these institutions to have an easy access to money raised from the market.         
	However, the Central Board of Direct Taxes imposed a maximum investment limit of Rs 50 lakh that an investor can make in these bonds, with effect from calendar year 2007.         
	This has dried up the market to a great extent, said Ajeet Agarwal, RECs general manager (finance and accounts), who is also looking after the companys initial public offering.         
	REC launched its capital gains tax exemption bonds Series VII in July last year and the issue is on till March this year. The bonds offer a coupon rate of 5.5 per cent annually.        
	The company also tapped the market between January and March 2007 with Series VIA bonds at a coupon rate of 5.25 per cent and mopped up over Rs 4,000 crore.         
	The market has shrunk significantly. At present, we have about Rs 13,000 crore outstanding on capital gains bonds issued so far. The annual redemption on this account is around Rs 3,000 crore. This means from the current issue well be able to raise just enough money to meet the redemption requirement, Agarwal added.         
	The story is no different for the NHAI. The state-owned entity floated its capital gains tax exemption bonds in September last year with an aim to raise Rs 2,000 crore. Till December, however, it could collect only Rs 60 crore.         
	According to H.D. Khunteta, director (finance), RECs cost of borrowing is 6.5 per cent compared with 8 per cent for Power Finance Corporation, Our yield on advances is 9.9 per cent and the net interest margin is 3.7 per cent, he added.        
	REC is looking to disburse Rs 14,000 crore during the current fiscal against Rs 10,700 crore in 2006-07. We are planning to increase our annual disbursements gradually to Rs 1,00,000 crore in five years from now, said Agarwal.

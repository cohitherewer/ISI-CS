          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 24: Telecom minister A. Raja is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this week to press the case for the participation of global firms in 3G auctions.        
	Raja has gone public several times over his intentions to let foreign players bid in the upcoming 3G auctions. The minister expects to come out with a final policy on 3G auction and the allocation of spectrum by end of this month.        
	The finance ministry and the Planning Commission are also keen on allowing foreign companies, who do not hold telecom licences in India, to bid for 3G services. The commerce ministry is also expected to support Raja.        
	However, top telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Vodafone-Essar have been lobbying against the entry of foreign players into the 3G arena.         
	They feel the real threat in 3G bidding will come from global majors such as Etisalat and other European and American companies.        
	These firms not only have the ability to shell out huge sums for a 3G licence, but can also subsequently buy out new 2G operators and offer a combination of 2G and 3G services.        
	The Cellular Operators Association of India, representing the interests of GSM operators, had earlier written a letter to the department of telecommunications arguing against new entrants in 3G bidding.

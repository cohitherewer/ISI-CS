                                              CRISIS CONTROL      
	Singapore/London, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Standard Chartered plans to raise 1.8 billion ($2.7 billion) from a rights issue to boost its capital base and give it flexibility to pursue acquisitions.        
	The London-based lender today said the economic situation had deteriorated this month and, although the bank was performing well, the outlook was unclear.        
	Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered, said investors were keen on banks holding more capital during turbulent market conditions and there was merit in retaining excess cash. It could also be used for deals, he said.         
	Having more capital will give us greater flexibility to take advantage of the growth opportunities emerging from the turmoil, he said. Many of our competitors are in disarray, lacking capital or liquidity or distracted by problems, Sands told reporters.        
	UAE bailout        
	The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has begun to bail out and consolidate Dubais rattled lenders and cap a building spree on Monday as it started cutting state spending in the face of the global crisis.        
	In a major policy shift, the federal government will inject capital into Emirates Development Bank, a newly created rescue vehicle preparing to absorb merging Islamic lenders Amlak and Tamweel, a leading official said.        
	Mohamed Alabbar, a member of the Emirates ruling council, assured investors that the Gulfs regional financial hub of Dubai was able to meet its sovereign obligations as pressure from the global financial crisis mounted.

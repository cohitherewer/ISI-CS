	London, July 20 (PTI): After unveiling the worlds cheapest car, the Nano, Tata Motors is now gearing up to tap the other extreme of the market with new models of its recently acquired brands Jaguar and Land Rover priced in excess of 100,000.        
	Jaguar and Land Rover, now owned by the Tatas, are drawing up a business strategy that will take both brands into the 100,000-plus pricing territory, currently occupied by a handful of cars such as Bentley, a report in the UK daily The Financial Times said.        
	Earlier this year, the Tata group unveiled the Nano, which is expected to hit the Indian roads in the next few months, with a base model price of Rs 1 lakh. Compared with the Nano, the new models of the Jaguar and the Land Rover will be over 85 times more expensive at a price of over Rs 85 lakh.        
	Currently, the most expensive Jaguar model is priced at 80,000, while the majority of its models are priced between 25,000 and 75,000. The most expensive model of Land Rover is priced at 72,000, the report said. Tata Motors acquired Jaguar and Land Rover for $2.3 billion in April from the US auto giant Ford Motor.        
	The Financial Times quoted David Smith, the CEO of Jaguar and Land Rover, as saying that the two brands could be taken a lot further up the market. Both Jaguar and Land Rover should be able to produce very credible products to appeal to people in those markets, he said.

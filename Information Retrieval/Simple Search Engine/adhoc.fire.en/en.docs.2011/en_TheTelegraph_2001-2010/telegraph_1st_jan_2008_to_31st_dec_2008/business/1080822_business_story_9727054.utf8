                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anil talk offer to lift gas gloom
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Mukesh and Anil Ambani: Sibling saga				                                 
	Mumbai, Aug. 21: Anil Ambani is ready to hold negotiations with brother Mukesh to resolve the dispute over the supply of gas from the Krishna-Godavari field, which is due to start flowing sometime next month.        
	Anil Ambani is willing to meet his brother at any time and any place, Mukul Rohatgi, counsel for Anil-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, told a division bench of the Mumbai high court here today.        
	RNRL and Mukesh-run Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are locked in a legal battle over the modalities of the supply and the pricing of gas.        
	Under the terms of a disputed agreement between RNRL and Reliance Industries signed in January 2006, RNRL has a claim to 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) at a price of $2.34 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu).        
	In response to Rohatgis submission, Justices J.N. Patel and K.K. Tated said the brothers could approach their mother Kokilaben to resolve the dispute.        
	Why cant the two brothers go back to the mother and discuss? said Justice J.N. Patel.        
	Earlier, senior counsel Ram Jethmalani charged Reliance with misusing its trustee position while dealing with RNRL after the split in the Reliance empire.        
	Jethmalani added that Reliance was a trustee of RNRL till it was taken over by the younger brother. He argued that when an entity was a trustee of another company, it was divested of any advantages accruing to itself and it ought to do everything for the benefit of the beneficiary (RNRL).        
	He said the contentious gas supply pact was signed on January 12, 2006 when both companies were under Mukesh Ambanis control. He said RIL was concerned with its own benefit and, thereby, misused its trustee position.        
	He suggested to the division bench that solutions could be found to resolve the gas tangle. He said that one solution was that the companies could negotiate in the presence of lawyers. Alternatively, the court could appoint an expert to renegotiate the gas supply agreement.         
	Reliance could also be asked to pay damages to RNRL, Jethmalani said. This was when Rohatgi submitted that the younger brother was willing to negotiate with Mukesh Ambani.        
	An interesting highlight of the days hearing came when the RNRL counsel admitted that the company was willing to trade in gas till power plants of the group comes up. Rohatgi said the groups power plants would come up in three years if it gets a bankable agreement of supply from RIL. Once the plants come up, RNRL will use gas only for power generation, he said.        
	While RNRL wants to buy the gas at $2.34 per mmBtu, it wants to sell it at the price that has emerged from a government-sanctioned gas pricing formula.        
	Rohatgi said the group was open to the possibility of acquiring power plants, particularly those that were lying closed due to want of gas.        
	The RNRL counsel also submitted before the division bench that RNRL was willing to share production and exploration costs incurred by RIL in the KG-D6 block and costs could be recovered jointly.        
	The arguments will continue on September 1.

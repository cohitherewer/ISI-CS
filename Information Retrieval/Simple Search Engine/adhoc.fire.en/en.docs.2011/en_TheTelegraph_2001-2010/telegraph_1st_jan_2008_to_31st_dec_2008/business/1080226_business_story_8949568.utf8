The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GSM players against spectrum policy tweak
                                                                                                               GSM players against spectrum policy tweak
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          TOUGH CALL                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: GSM mobile operators have opposed the governments move to allocate telecom licence and start-up spectrum to the holders of new letters of intent (LoIs), based on which a company submits the licence fee first.        
	The GSM operators have urged the department of telecom (DoT) to stick to its earlier first come, first served priority order based on the date of application, rather than the new order which states that the company which deposits the licence fee first will head the priority list to get licence and start-up spectrum.         
	The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)  which represents the GSM lobby  feels that priority in granting licences cannot be based on differences of a few fractions of seconds among telecom operators in fulfilling payment and other LoI obligations. We urge the DoT to refrain from allocating any GSM spectrum without following the principle of first come, first served based on the date of application, said T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of the COAI.         
	The government had issued LoIs to seven new operators and two existing players  Idea and Spice  for licences on January 10 this year. Following this, the operators were asked to submit their acceptance offer, entry fee and a bank guarantee to the DoT.         
	The DoT then said the eligibility list for allotment of spectrum would be determined by who deposited the licence fee first. This sudden change of policy implied that among the nine players, the company that deposited the licence fee first after collecting the LoI from the DoT would be the first to get spectrum.         
	So far, under the existing first come, first served policy, priority for licences was based on the date when a company applied for the licence. This also ensured the company some priority in the spectrum queue.         
	The change in policy implies that existing operators such as Idea and Spice, which headed the earlier queue for spectrum  since they had applied for licences in mid-2006  have lost the advantage.

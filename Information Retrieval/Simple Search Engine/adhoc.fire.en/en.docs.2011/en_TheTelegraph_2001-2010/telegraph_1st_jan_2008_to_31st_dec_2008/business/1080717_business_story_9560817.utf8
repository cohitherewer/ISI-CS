	New Delhi, July 16: Leading steel makers today hinted at hiking prices, but the government was likely to oppose the move.        
	In May, the industry had pledged that it would not raise prices for three months. This deadline expires on August 7. The government is concerned about a price hike fuelling inflation, which is already at a 13- year high of 11.89 per cent.        
	At an industry conclave here today, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said the current prices were not sustainable because raw material prices were spiralling. He said prices were ruling at Rs 15,000-20,000 a tonne below global rates.        
	There is every justification for increasing prices because input prices have gone up, Muthuraman said.        
	Though producers had voluntarily cut prices in May, there had not been a commensurate decrease at the retail level. Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the government was against the industry making losses, but we will also safeguard consumer interest.        
	He also said that dealers had not reduced prices to the extent of the cuts undertaken by the large producers. We will take up very severely with such market manipulation. We have already directed the public sector steel companies to keep a strict watch on such malpractice. The minister said he hoped that the industry would continue to co-operate with the government by maintaining the current level of prices.        
	With no sign of inflation falling, the producers and the government could meet again.        
	Steel secretary R.S. Pandey said the government would consider taking steps to cool down prices as long as they contributed to high inflation.         
	Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said negotiated steel pricing might work in the short run but was clearly an unhealthy and unsustainable trend.

	New Delhi, Feb. 24 (pti): The department of telecom (DoT) will issue telecom licences to nine firms that got letters of intent last month.        
	Telecom secretary Sidharth Behura has sent the proposal to communications and IT minister A. Raja for his approval, sources said, adding that the minister has decided to sign the agreements with all the companies over the next two days.        
	Some companies had approached telecom tribunal tdsat and Delhi High Court to stall the process but neither stayed it.         
	The DoT has been saying that the entry of pan-India service providers will reduce mobile tariffs by at least 50 per cent within six months to one year of their starting services.        
	Raja is understood to have prepared a roadmap for bringing down the tariffs to just 25 paise a minute for local calls.

	New Delhi, July 25: The government today shortlisted two private financial players  HSBC and ICICI Prudential  along with the State Bank of India (SBI) to manage about Rs 25,000 crore of provident fund money, covering about four crore employees.        
	Three asset management companies  HSBC, ICICI Prudential and the SBI  have qualified in the financial bid round, said a member of the finance and investment committee of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Earlier, 10 companies, including Birla Sun Life and HDFC, had qualified in the technical round.         
	HSBC and ICICI Prudential were selected as they quoted the lowest fee of one basis point, or 0.01 per cent, of the fund. The SBI beat the others on technical grounds. The three players await the approval of the central board of trustees of the EPFO scheduled to meet on July 29.

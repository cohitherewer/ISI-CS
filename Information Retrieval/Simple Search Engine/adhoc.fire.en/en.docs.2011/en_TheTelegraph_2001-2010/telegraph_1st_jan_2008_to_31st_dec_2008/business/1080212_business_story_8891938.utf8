The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Investors accept plunge
                                                                                                               Investors accept plunge
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Investors in Mumbai on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: Retail investors remained stoic after the first company bearing the Reliance tag showed a loss on listing day.        
	How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! says Subodh Jaiswal, a professor of English Literature at Mumbais National College, quoting the Bible after a Reliance scrip lost its aura of invincibility under the pressure of expectation from grey market operators and the domino effect on markets after edgy investors battered stocks across the world.        
	One has to take such things in ones stride. There is nothing much that a retail investor can do. Reliance Power will hopefully give good returns in the long run, says Jaiswal, clinging to a faith that legions of investors have shown in the Reliance stocks.        
	I did not lose a lot because I did not invest as much as I wanted to because of limited allotments of Reliance Power shares during the IPO. But I know of many grey market players who have been devastated, says Dinesh Vaidya, an electronics goods dealer.         
	Many investors insisted that their faith in the magic of Reliance hadnt been shaken after todays mauling.         
	But grey market operators were at wits end after counting up their losses on the big speculative bets they had made in the run up to the listing.        
	I dont know when I will recover from this. I was hoping to make some crucial investments in realty; all that will have to wait. I dont think the grey market will come out of this for the next two to three months, said Arun Parikh (name changed), a grey market operator who owns two petrol pumps in Mumbai and Thane. Parikh (54) is shaken by the fact that a Reliance scrip has taken beating for the first time.        
	We have had tremendous returns from our investments in Reliance shares. My father owned a few taxis. Right from the time he invested in Reliances first IPO in 1977, we have been continuously buying shares of the company. It financed the wedding of my two sisters. I am shocked by what happened today, he says.        
	But unlike him, some other grey market operators, mostly high net-worth individuals, had taken a cue from the falling premium on the Reliance power stock in the grey market over the last fortnight.        
	I had already informed the company I work with that I would not need the entire lot of funds that I had initially committed to borrow. It was clear that as the premium in the grey market was shrinking, there would be lower gains on the day of listing, quot; said Ashu Lalchand, a property dealer.        
	I began selling other scrips as soon as RPL started slipping as I faced a liquidity crunch, said Arif Hussain a textile merchant and retail investor. Hussain, who has held various Reliance shares over the last 30 years, says his wife used to chide him often for gampling on stocks. But she changed her views over the years. Reliance meant reliability for us. But today, I wonder whether she was right after all about this being a gamble, quot; says Hussain.        
	There is a tide in the affairs of men, quot; says Jaiswal quoting Shakespeare. And it rings the truest in the stock markets, quot; he adds.                          
	 quot;But she changed her views over the years when we accumulated Rs 55,000 to Rs 60,000 from 50 shares of Reliance alone. Reliance meant reliability for us. But today, I wonder whether she was right after all about this being a gamble, quot; says Hussain.                    
	The premium in the grey market had been going down because of weakness in the secondary market. Even though other companies have not been isolated from this, it is more important in case of Reliance Power due to the huge leverage positions taken by the non-institutional investors category who borrowed funds from NBFCs and banks, he adds.

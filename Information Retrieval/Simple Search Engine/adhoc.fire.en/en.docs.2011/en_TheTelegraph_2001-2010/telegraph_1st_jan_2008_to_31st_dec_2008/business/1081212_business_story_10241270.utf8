	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Bankers are set to announce a relief package for the borrowers of home loans tomorrow. We discussed among ourselves what sort of relief could be given to the housing and SME sectors. Some package will be formalised by tomorrow, said T. S. Narayanasami, chairman of the Indian Banks Association.        
	Cheaper loans, a full waiver of processing charges and concessions on margin money requirements are under consideration. Apart from lower interest rates, the government will ensure easy access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).         
	While no decision has been taken on interest rates, the whole exercise is to make housing loans more affordable, said the IBA chief. He, however, ruled out any interest subsidy for home loans up to Rs 20 lakh.        
	The Rs 20,000-crore stimulus package announced by the government on Sunday had proposed incentives for home loans below Rs 20 lakh.        
	The incentives will be split into two  one for borrowers up to Rs 5 lakh, and the other for loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.

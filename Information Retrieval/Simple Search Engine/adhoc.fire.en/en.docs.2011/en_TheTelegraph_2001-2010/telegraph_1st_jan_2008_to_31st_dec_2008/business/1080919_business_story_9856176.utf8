          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said the US financial crisis would have only a short-term and company-specific impact on IT and BPO firms.        
	Our preliminary analysis of the current situation indicates that the impact will be short term and company specific. We will keep a watch on any further downstream impacts, Nasscom said.        
	The countrys software exporters are also closely monitoring the financial crisis as more than half of their revenues come from the banking and financial services segments.         
	Analysts cautioned that the overall revenue impact on the IT and ITeS industry could be anywhere between $750 million and $1 billion, as a result of the US meltdown. The countrys software exports led by TCS, Infosys and Wipro draw over 70 per cent of their revenues from the US market.

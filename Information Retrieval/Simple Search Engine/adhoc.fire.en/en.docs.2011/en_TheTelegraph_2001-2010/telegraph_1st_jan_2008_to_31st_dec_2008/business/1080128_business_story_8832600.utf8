        The recent market crash prompts Srikumar Bondyopadhyay to examine the various options before an investor. He finds mutual funds to be clear winners with the best returns                                        
	The stock market crash made headlines last week but it caused little flutter among small investors.        
	The 7379-point ascent of the sensex to 21206.77 on January 10 from 13827.77 at the beginning of 2006 is interspersed with nine sharp downfalls. This has, perhaps, made them accustomed to the risks involved in equity investments.        
	Stock behaviour        
	The past 12 months are an indication of how stocks will behave in the days to come.        
	Share prices will be more prone to heavy inflows and outflows of money from foreign institutional investors, economic and political developments in other countries and, more importantly, speculation rather than fundamentals of individual companies.         
	With more disclosure requirements and available market research, financial and other information of listed companies are now easily accessible to investors. Hence, the decision to buy a share is based on the firms earnings outlook for the next two to three years rather than its business and profitability in the current or the following fiscal.         
	This builds in excesses in the price quoted for a companys shares.         
	This was not the case till a decade ago when stock prices moved more on fundamentals than on speculation.         
	In the history of the sensex, trading was halted four times after the bellwether index hit the lower circuit filter. The first time was in April 1992, after the Harshad Mehta scam came to the fore.         
	Unfortunately, retail investors seldom get a chance to buy stocks cheap when markets crash. They are invariably restricted by brokerage houses from buying after every steep fall in stock prices.         
	It was no different this time, too. Online and offline, most retail investors could not buy stocks last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.        
	Mutuals the best                   
	Under the circumstances, mutual funds have emerged as the best option for retail investors to invest in stock markets.         
	Let us elaborate this. A person can invest in equities in three ways: first, buying and selling stocks directly from a brokerage; second, through diversified equity schemes of mutual funds; and third, through investments in unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips).        
	Direct investment        
	In direct investment, one needs to make the right choice of stocks and must have a brave heart to withstand the wild swings in share prices.         
	Moreover, with a limited investible corpus, direct investment offers little scope to diversify ones portfolio to mitigate the loss in case of a market crash.        
	A look at the sharp fall in stock prices on Monday and Tuesday last week showed that not all counters declined to the same extent. Again, when the market made a U-turn on Wednesday, some stocks rose more than the others.         
	It is almost impossible for a small investor to manipulate these complexities to ward off losses.        
	However, this is not the case with a mutual fund or an insurance company with huge investible funds at its disposal.         
	Thus, when the sensex and the Nifty fell 19.28 per cent and 21.06 per cent, respectively, over the seven days ended January 22, the net asset value of equity schemes of mutual funds and life insurance companies declined to a lesser extent.         
	Moreover, diversified equity schemes and Ulips bettered the indices returns over a period of one month and one year.         
	MFs vs Ulips        
	When it comes to choosing between the equity scheme of a mutual fund and a Ulip, the former wins hands down. We have compared mutual funds and Ulips of the same parent companies, such as ICICI Prudential, the SBI and the Tatas (See table).        
	The chart shows that equity mutual schemes of these companies gave a superior return in terms of net asset value compared with the growth funds of Ulips.         
	The net return is higher for mutual funds because here one doesnt have to take into account charges such as entry levies, investment allocations and mortality fees that an investor has to pay for a Ulip.        
	From January 4, mutual fund investment has been made more lucrative as investors wont have to pay any entry load if the units are purchased directly from the offices of fund houses.         
	This can be compared with Ulips where investors have to pay a hefty investment allocation sum during the initial years and mortality charges every month.        
	While the full amount that one pays in buying mutual fund units directly from the office of a fund house gets invested, in case of a Ulip only part of the annual premium finds its way to the stock markets.         
	This explains why an increasing number of investors are requesting life insurers to switch their funds from a debt scheme to growth schemes, particularly after the recent market crash.        
	The meltdown in stock prices can be used to ones advantage by investing through mutual funds.         
	A broker may not allow customers to buy stocks immediately after share prices plunged. But one can always walk to the branch office or investor service centre of a fund house to buy mutual fund units without paying any entry load. For Ulips, however, the premium-paying month may not be the best time to buy stocks.

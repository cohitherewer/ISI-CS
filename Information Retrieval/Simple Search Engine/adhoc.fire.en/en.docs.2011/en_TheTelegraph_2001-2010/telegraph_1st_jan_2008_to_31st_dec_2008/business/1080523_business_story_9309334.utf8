          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 22: Soaring crude oil prices today pummelled equities and the rupee.         
	Inflation fears pulled down the sensex by 336.05 points to 16907.11, while the rupee breached the 43-level in intra-day trade.        
	There are apprehensions on the bourses about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) taking liquidity-tightening measures to check inflation. Last weeks data had put inflation at a near-four-year high of 7.83 per cent. According to brokers, early trading on the stock markets was not encouraging because of weak global cues, and news of the spike in oil prices made investors cautious.        
	Barring Japans Nikkei, which closed higher today, other Asian indices ended lower on the back of a steep fall on Wall Street yesterday. Bank stocks fell about 3.06 per cent and remained the biggest sectoral loser on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Heavyweights ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India lost about 3.3 per cent each. The 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also tumbled 92.20 points, or 1.80 per cent, to end at 5025.45.        
	It was a bad day for the rupee. The currency resumed sharply lower at 43.07 to the dollar and dipped further to a low of 43.20, a level not seen since the first week of April 2007. The rupee, however, ended at 42.96 as it recovered because of dollar selling by exporters. There were also reports of state-run banks selling dollars at the behest of the RBI.        
	Last fiscal, the rupee had appreciated by over 13 per cent to touch the 39-mark. Commerce secretary G.K. Pillai today said the fast appreciation as well as the depreciation of the Indian currency was worrisome and not a good trend        
	Sebi margin        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today deferred its plan to charge upfront margins on institutional trades in the cash market from June 16. This move will help foreign institutional investors and institutional investors such as mutual funds.         
	Institutional players in the cash market would continue to follow the norm of paying the margin money one day after trade (T+1 basis).        
	In the light of difficulties expressed by the market participants regarding the implementation of upfront margining of institutional trades in the cash market, it has been decided to keep the same in abeyance. Accordingly, institutional trades in the cash market would continue to be margined on a T+1 basis till further directions, Sebi said.        
	On March 19, Sebi had proposed that all institutional trades in the cash market would be margined on a T+1 basis. It was also then decided that upfront margins would be paid from June 16, which has now been deferred.

	New Delhi, April 7 (PTI): Relaxing regulatory guidelines, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has permitted corporations owning general insurance business to set up insurance broking companies.        
	Keeping in view the international experience and practice, it was decided that corporate houses can have both insurance firms and broking activity subject to certain safeguards, a memorandum issued by the IRDA said.        
	The business houses promoting insurance broking companies, it said, would have to give an undertaking that the clients of the company will not be compelled to use the broker for their insurance requirements.        
	In addition, the insurer will not favour its brokers in any form, be it in terms of providing more remuneration or laying down terms favouring it, the regulator said.        
	The IRDA further said the insurer will be barred from making special products for sale exclusively through the broking company promoted by the business house that owns the insurance company.        
	It would also be obligatory for the broking company to disclose related party transactions with the insurance company in its audited accounts.         
	The broker shall ensure that not more than 25 per cent of the insurances handled by it in any financial year is placed with the insurance company within the promoter group, the regulator added.

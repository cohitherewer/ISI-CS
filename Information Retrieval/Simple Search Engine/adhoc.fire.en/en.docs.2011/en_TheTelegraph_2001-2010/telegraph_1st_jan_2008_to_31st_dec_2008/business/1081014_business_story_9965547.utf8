	London/New York, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Stock markets rejoiced after governments worldwide launched multibillion-dollar bailouts on Monday to shore up banks, and Britain called for a new Bretton Woods agreement to reshape the world financial system.        
	Major Wall Street stock indexes were up more than 5 per cent in early trade, clawing back some of the major losses last week, when the Dow fell 18 per cent. The MSCI world equity index was up 5 per cent after tumbling 20 per cent last week to a five-year low.        
	The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended with a gain of 9.2 per cent  its biggest one-day percentage advance on record  to 929.29 points, more than wiping out Fridays 7.6 per cent slide to a five-year closing low.         
	In Asia, Hong Kong shares surged 10.2 per cent in skittish trade on Monday, rebounding from their worst weekly decline in more than a decade.         
	Britain, Germany, France, Italy and other European governments announced rescue packages worth hundreds of billions of dollars that were designed to combat the global financial crisis, in which the credit markets have seized up at a time when major economies appear headed towards recession.         
	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on world leaders to create a new financial architecture to reflect the global reach of economics and banking, in much the same way that the current international economic system was set up at a conference in Bretton Woods, US, in 1944.         
	Only by global action can we fully restore the confidence that is needed and build the international financial order, said Brown, a leader who has yet to win a popular mandate but whose global profile has risen amid the crisis.        
	Britains plan called for 37 billion ($64 billion) of taxpayers cash to bail out three major banks in a move that is likely to make the government their main shareholder.        
	Germany and France followed with their own plans.        
	While Germanys cabinet approved a rescue plan worth up to 500 billion euros ($680 billion) and France announced government guarantees totaling some 360 billion euros, European central banks said they would lend out as much US dollar liquidity as commercial banks needed to tame money market tensions.        
	The US began releasing long-awaited details of its $700-billion rescue plan  which has evolved from a primary goal of buying distressed debt to taking an ownership position in banks to get them lending again.        
	Wall Street focused on investment bank Morgan Stanley, which steadied itself after reaching a financing deal with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, possibly with US government support. Morgan shares plunged 58 per cent in the last week on doubts over the deal and were up 47 per cent in early trade on Monday.

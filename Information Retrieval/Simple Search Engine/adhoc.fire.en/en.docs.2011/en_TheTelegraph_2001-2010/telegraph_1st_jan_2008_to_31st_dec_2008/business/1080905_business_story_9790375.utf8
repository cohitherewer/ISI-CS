          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: The price demon lied low for the second consecutive week, with the rate of inflation dropping to 12.34 per cent as on August 23. A week ago, inflation stood at 12.4 per cent.        
	The wholesale price index came down on the back of a 0.8 per cent decline in the prices of food articles. Vegetables and fruit prices came down two per cent, while that of tea decreased three per cent.         
	A decline in the prices of rice, pulses and mustard oil resulted in a moderation of the inflation rate for essential commodities, a finance ministry statement said.        
	Commerce minister Kamal Nath told reporters that he expected it (inflation) to moderate further.         
	The government will look at supply-side stress, Nath said.         
	We have taken some steps and that appear to be working. We hope it will continue to work for several weeks and months, he said.        
	In recent months, the government had taken steps to curb rising commodity prices by banning food exports, slapping export duties on metals and persuading steel makers to restrain prices.         
	Analysts with Daiwa Securities said they saw inflation coming down to eight per cent by the year-end.         
	However, D. Joshi, chief economist with credit rating agency Crisil, said, Although food prices are coming down, the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar is offsetting that gain.

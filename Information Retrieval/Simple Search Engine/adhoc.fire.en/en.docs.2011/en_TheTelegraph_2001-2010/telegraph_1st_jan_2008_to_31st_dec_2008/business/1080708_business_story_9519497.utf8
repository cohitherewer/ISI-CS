                              Pay for Peace                            
	Atlanta, July 7 (AP): Coca-Cola Co has agreed to pay $137.5 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit that claimed that company officials misrepresented or omitted information in public statements, causing the companys stock price to be inflated.        
	The Atlanta-based company did not admit any wrongdoing in settling the suit filed in US district court in Atlanta, according to the agreement dated June 26 and entered July 3.        
	The court has preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled a settlement fairness hearing for October 20.        
	The lead plaintiffs in the suit were the Carpenters Health amp; Welfare Fund of Philadelphia amp; Vicinity and Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund, now called 1199 Seiu Greater New York Pension Fund. The class represented by the plaintiffs included all those who bought Coca-Cola stocks between October 21, 1999 and March 6, 2000.        
	The complaint by the institutional investors alleged that certain material facts concerning Coca-Cola and the condition of its business and financial results were misrepresented and omitted from various public statements purportedly, causing the price of the stock to be inflated artificially.        
	Over the last several years, there had been rounds of mediation and settlement discussions, court records show.        
	The agreement says that Coca-Cola and the other defendants, who include several former top executives of the company, continue to deny all substantive allegations of wrongdoing.

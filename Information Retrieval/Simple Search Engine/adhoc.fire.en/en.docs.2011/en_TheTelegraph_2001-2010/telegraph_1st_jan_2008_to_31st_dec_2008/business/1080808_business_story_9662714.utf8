          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 7: The government is planning to release more sugar into the market to try and control prices which have shot up by Rs 2 a kg in the past few weeks.         
	The surge in sugar prices is one of the factors responsible for the spike in inflation for the week ended July 26. Overall, sugar prices have risen by about 20 per cent in the past month.        
	Officials said the monthly release of levy sugar  currently pegged at 9 lakh tonnes  could be raised to 12 lakh tonnes.        
	The government will step up that figure in September and October to ensure that sugar prices remains under control, they said.        
	Levy sugar is sold through the ration outlets within the public distribution system and fair price shops.         
	The sugar trade is normally tightly controlled by the government, which sets monthly and quarterly quotas that millers can sell freely in the market.        
	However, officials said, prices of the sensitive commodity had risen from around Rs 14,000 a tonne in the wholesale market a year ago to nearly Rs 18,000 a tonne now.        
	Officials said they were not immediately contemplating a ban on sugar exports which today stood at about 4 to 5 million tonnes a year.         
	Mills spooked        
	The governments efforts to rein in sugar prices have already started to spook sugar mills, many of which have reported losses in the quarter ended June 30.         
	Bajaj Hindusthan and Dwarikesh Sugar reported losses of Rs 35 crore and Rs 16 crore respectively. Balrampur Chini saw its quarterly profits plunge to Rs 17 crore from Rs 66 crore in the previous quarter ended March 31.        
	It is estimated that sugar output in India could dip to 21 million tonnes in the 2008-09 season from 26 million tonnes in 2007-08. The sugar season typically lasts from October till April.        
	A key factor responsible for the lower output is that area under sugarcane cultivation has shrunk. In its recent monetary policy review, the Reserve Bank said the area under sugar cultivation had declined by 18.2 per cent due to deficient rainfall in major producing regions. However, the industry expects the acreage to fall by 25 per cent.        
	Farmers have shifted from sugarcane to other crops like rice and wheat as the government increased the minimum support price there. There was also a sugar glut as a result of which mills had faced problems in paying farmers. This was also responsible for the shift, an official with one of the sugar firms said.

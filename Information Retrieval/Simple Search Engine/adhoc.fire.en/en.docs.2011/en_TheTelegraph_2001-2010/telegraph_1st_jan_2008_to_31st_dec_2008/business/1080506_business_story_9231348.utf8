	Mumbai, May 5: Anil Ambani group company Adlabs Films Ltd has acquired a majority stake in Malaysian company Lotus Five Star Cinemas and will operate a 51-screen cinema exhibition chain in the country.         
	The chain, which operates across Malaysia, will play mainstream Hollywood films and movies in Hindi, Tamil, Chinese and Malay.        
	The company plans to venture wherever there is a market for Indian movies, be it the US or Malaysia. The acquisition was driven by the fact that there is a huge market for Tamil movies in Malaysia, Reliance Big Entertainment senior vice-president Anil Arjun said in a statement.        
	Adlabs operates 160 screens in India. Internationally the company has 220 screens in Malaysia, the US, Mauritius and Nepal. The company plans to increase the number of its screens to 400 by the end of this fiscal.         
	Adlabs was one of the first companies to identify the opportunities in the multiplex segment. Almost 20 per cent of its revenues generated from the multiplexes come from food and beverages.         
	According to a brokerage report, the average ticket price of an Adlabs-controlled cinema was Rs 118 in 2007-08.        
	Adlabs has also made its foray into broadcast equipment rental business to provide equipment for live shows, reality shows and game shows.         
	This development is in line with its plan to become the largest movie services company. The company also plans to set up 10 studios with shooting facilities in Film City, Mumbai.        
	Adlabs has recently entered into megaplex business.         
	As part of this venture, the company will set up a number of megaplexes, which will be five to six times larger than a multiplex.

	New Delhi, Jan. 20: Some new telecom players stand to gain by selling their licences at a hefty premium since current government regulations do not prevent them from undertaking such an exercise.
    
	The government last week granted licences to nine companies and is yet to take a call on merger norms recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
    
	These norms prevent firms from entering into mergers or acquisitions within three to four years of acquiring a licence.
    
	Trai had proposed that companies should not be allowed to sell licences until they met certain minimum network commitments. This could have prevented companies from selling licences for at least three years. 
    
	Present licence conditions do not place any such bar on companies for mergers or acquisitions.
    
	Trai officials said, According to our recommendations, any company obtaining a new telecom licence should ensure that in metros, 90 per cent of the service area is covered within one year.
    
	In telecom circles at least 10 per cent of (a) district should be covered in the first year and 50 per cent within three years of the effective date of grant of licence, they said.
    
	The government, which has been selectively choosing Trai proposals, has neither accepted nor rejected the recommendations on mergers. Officials of the department of telecom (DoT) said, Merger rules will be decided on as soon as the spectrum allocation issue is sorted out.
    
	According to Sudipto Basu, telecom analyst, EXL Services, It makes business sense for small companies to sell the newly acquired licences at a premium to existing players in the telecom sector. 
    
	While a new pan-India telecom licence is priced at Rs 1,650 crore, market valuations put the price between Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore.
    
	New licence-holders such as Videocon owned-Datacom have already started talks with multinational companies for a strategic partnership. 
    
	Videocon officials said, A number of players, including Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited, whose applications were rejected by the DoT, are keen to share ownership of Datacom.
    
	Companies such as AT amp;T, Moser Baer and DLF, who had applied after the cut-off date of September 25, 2007, are also planning to offer premium prices to get telecom licences.
    
	Actual roll-out for a pan-India licence will require investments of up to Rs 30,000 crore. This is an amount many of the new applicants cannot afford, said Basu, adding that smaller players can use this opportunity to make a fast buck.
    
	The Trai officials said if the government had approved merger norms before granting licences, there would have been bidding only from serious players.
    
	The DoT has received more than 500 applications for new telecom licences and, so far, granted 121 licences to nine companies for various telecom circles.
    
	Commission query
    
	The central vigilance commission has asked the DoT to explain the reasons for allotting spectrum to GSM mobile operators beyond their eligibility limit, reports PTI.
    
	The vigilance agency has asked the department to make a detailed presentation on all the issues related to the allocation of spectrum on January 28.
    
	Licence pacts
    
	The government will sign license agreements with nine companies that were given letters of intent earlier and allocate start-up spectrum to roll out mobile services.
    
	Licence pacts will be signed in the next few days, sources said. Although some companies have approached the telecom tribunal and Delhi High Court to stall the process, neither has done so.

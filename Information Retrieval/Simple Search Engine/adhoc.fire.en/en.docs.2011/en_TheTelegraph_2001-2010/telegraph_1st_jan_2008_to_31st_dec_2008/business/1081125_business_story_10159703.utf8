	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Congress-led government today signalled its willingness to cut interest rates and excise duties.        
	It said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would have a bias towards lower interest rates, and it would look into the demands for cuts in excise rates. Indian industry is feeling the heat of slowdown, growing 4.8 per cent in September and just 1.4 per cent in August.         
	The RBIs policy is now biased towards stimulating growth. If the rate of inflation continues to decline, the policy rates may also moderate and the bias in favour of growth may deepen, finance minister P. Chidambaram told a conference of economic editors.        
	Industry has been pleading for softer interest rates and fresh credit lines, citing its inability to run businesses and take up fresh expansion plans at the current high rates. It has also been seeking the lowering of excise duties on certain items        
	Analysts expect the government to announce tax sops in textiles and other export-oriented industries, which are labour-intensive and have been forced to reduce production because of the slowdown.        
	While it plans to offer excise sops and invest in infrastructure, the government expects industry to cut prices.         
	From automobiles, realty and steel, Chidambaram said, only steel units had actually cut prices.        
	Realty firms have been talking of price cuts, and the government was waiting for the car makers to reduce prices.        
	The finance minister, who has held several rounds of meetings with the RBI governor, admitted that the availability of credit had hit a bottleneck.         
	Chidambaram and D. Subbarao, the RBI governor, would hold meetings on credit supply with bankers.         
	The UPA is worried that the political fallout of the economic slowdown could impact its chances in the general elections slated for early next year        
	Opposition politicians have criticised the government for not creating a consensus on fixing the economy.         
	Chidambaram said he was open to talking to other parties and taking their views on board in shaping a rescue plan.         
	He said he had taken on board an 11-point action plan the BJP had given to him.         
	Reforms would be pushed when needed, Chidambaram said, adding that financial sector reforms were necessary to tide the economy over the current crisis.         
	In another statement, which may not be welcomed by the Left parties, the finance minister said the government was currently reviewing its foreign direct investment policy and indicated that it might be tweaked to bring in more hard currency into the country.

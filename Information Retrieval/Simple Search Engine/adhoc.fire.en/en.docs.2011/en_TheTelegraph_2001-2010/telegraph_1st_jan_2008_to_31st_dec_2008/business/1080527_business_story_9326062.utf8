	Mumbai, May 26: Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications could pull off a deal with Johannesburg-based MTN because it doesnt quite have the same constraints that Bharti Airtel faced.        
	Bhartis real problem was that MTN had suggested a corporate structure that could well have breached the 74 per cent limit on the foreign stake that is permitted in telecom companies in India.        
	Bhartis immediate concerns were to juggle the 30.5 per cent stake that Singapores Singtel held in Indias largest private telecom operator and still knit a deal that would have effectively turned it into a subsidiary of MTN.        
	Reliance Communications has a major advantage here because its foreign stake  all held through foreign institutional investors (FIIs)  is limited to 9.95 per cent.         
	Another 2.55 per cent of the stock is held against depository receipts that have been issued  but these wont come into play until conversion.        
	The promoters of Reliance Communications  Anil Ambani and 10 other individuals and entities  hold a 66.12 per cent stake. It shouldnt be difficult to hand over part of this stake to MTN in exchange for a holding in sub-Saharan Africas biggest mobile operator.

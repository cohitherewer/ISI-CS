          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Road runner                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: Czech car major Skoda is working on a small car for emerging markets such as India. The car, which will debut in India before being launched in the global market, will be priced in the range of Rs 3-5 lakh.        
	Our small car will be launched first in India. The car will cater to new markets and will be priced in the Rs 3-5 lakh bracket, sources in the company said.        
	Skodas small car will be different from the existing model of parent Volkswagen (VW). The Czech car maker recently launched its hatchback, the Fabia in India, priced between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.68 lakh. The car is available in three variants  the 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines and the 1.4 litre diesel engine.         
	Skoda has lined up five models for India in the next five years, including multi-utility and sports utility vehicles, and expects to sell 100,000 cars annually by 2012.        
	The company plans to introduce its Roomster multi-utility vehicle by the end of this year. The Fabia Combi, a larger version of the hatchback, and a new Superb sedan built on VWs B6 platform will be launched by mid-2009.        
	In 2010, the company will launch the Yeti sports utility vehicle.         
	Skoda is exploring the possibility of increasing the localisation content of its cars in the country, to cut prices.        
	The localisation content is now around 15 per cent. Skoda plans to increase this to 50 per cent in the near term.        
	To support the companys expansion activities, Skoda will increase the size of its Aurangabad facility by 50 hectares.         
	The plant manufactures 30,000 vehicles annually. The company also plans to shift production of the Fabia to VWs Chakan facility, near Pune, by 2009.

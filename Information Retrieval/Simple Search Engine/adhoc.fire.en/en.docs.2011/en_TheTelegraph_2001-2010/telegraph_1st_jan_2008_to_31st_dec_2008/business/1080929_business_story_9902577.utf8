   Congress alters Bush proposal
                                              
	Washington, Sept. 28 (Reuters): US law-makers on Sunday are likely to sign a deal to create a $700-billion government fund to buy bad debt from ailing banks to stem a credit crisis threatening the global economy.        
	After marathon talks, Congressional leaders from both parties emerged with an agreement that altered key parts of a Wall Street bailout programme initially proposed by the Bush administration.        
	The preceding week of negotiations over the rescue package roiled financial markets and altered the course of the US presidential campaign less than six weeks before the election. Weve made great progress, US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters after the talks.        
	Treasury secretary Henry Paulson lobbied hard for the package  the largest bailout in the US history  saying it would keep credit markets from grinding to a halt under the burden of bad mortgage-backed bonds created by banks at a time when it looked like home prices had nowhere to go but up.        
	It was unclear when the House and the Senate would vote on the bailout legislation, or whether last-minute hitches might arise.        
	The proposed legislation would disburse the $700 billion in stages.        
	The first $250 billion would be issued when the legislation is enacted, while another $100 billion could be spent if the US President decided it was needed. The remaining $350 billion would be subject to Congressional review.        
	To further protect taxpayers, institutions selling assets under the plan would issue stock warrants giving taxpayers an ownership stake and profit-making opportunities with participating companies, Pelosi said.        
	The plan would also let the government buy troubled assets from pension plans, local governments and small banks.        
	In response to a clamour for limits on executive pay, no executives at participating companies can get multi- million-dollar severance pay.        
	The government could use its power as the owner of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to help more struggling homeowners modify the terms of their home loans.

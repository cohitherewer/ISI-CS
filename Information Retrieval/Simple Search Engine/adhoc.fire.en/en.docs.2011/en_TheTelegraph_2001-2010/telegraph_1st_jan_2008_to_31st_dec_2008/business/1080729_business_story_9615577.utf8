	Mumbai, July 28 (PTI): Large foreign capital flows into the domestic market have slowed so far in the current fiscal, the RBI said today.        
	Large capital flows, which acted as a key driver for the monetary conditions of the country in 2007-08, have witnessed a slowdown during 2008-09 so far, the central bank said.         
	The apex bank had taken a slew of measures to contain the liquidity conditions in the system  a 125 basis points hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and a 75 basis points hike in the short-term repo rates since April.         
	CRR is the amount of money that banks are required to keep with the RBI and the repo is the rate at which the apex bank lends to banks.         
	Monetary and liquidity aggregates continued to expand during the first quarter of 2008-2009, while growth in broad money stood above RBIs target of 16.5-17 per cent, the apex bank said. At present, the money supply growth is close to 20 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chennai, Feb. 22: French car maker Renault and Japanese major Nissan today signed a fresh memorandum of understanding with the Tamil Nadu government to set up an automobile plant in the state at an investment of Rs 4,500 crore.        
	The MoU had to be reworked following the withdrawal of Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) from the project. Initially, Renault and Nissan had tied up with the Mahindras for the proposed automobile plant. Later M amp;M decided to pull out of the joint venture, and these two companies decided to go on their own.        
	To be built at Oragadam near Chennai, the plant will have capacity to roll out four lakh units per annum over the next seven years.        
	Both Renault and Nissan will hold 50 per cent each in the plant.         
	Patrick Pelata, executive vice-president of Renault, and Carlos Tavares, executive vice-president of Nissan, signed the MoU with the Tamil Nadu government in the presence of chief minister M. Karunanidihi.

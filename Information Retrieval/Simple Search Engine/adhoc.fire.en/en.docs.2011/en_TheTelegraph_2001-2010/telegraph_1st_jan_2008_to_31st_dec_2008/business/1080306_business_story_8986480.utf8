                                                                                                               AT amp;T to ramp up India operations
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Spread out      
	Calcutta, March 5: Global telecom major AT amp;T will increase its investment in emerging markets such as India to expand its infrastructure.        
	The company had earlier stated that it would target India to consolidate its mobile operations outside the US.        
	AT amp;T will invest $1 billion worldwide this year  up 33 per cent from last year  to build undersea cables and expand its network services.         
	Last year, AT amp;T spent $750 million outside the US of its total investment of $18 billion.        
	In India, it will set up three nodes and an Internet data centre. A node is a connection facility, either a redistribution or an end point, for data transmission.         
	A node is programmed to recognise, process or forward transmissions to other nodes.        
	AT amp;T has seven nodes in India and will add three, one each in Delhi, Pune and Calcutta. The Internet data centre will be set up in Bangalore, AT amp;Ts India CEO and managing director Sanjiv Bhagat told reporters in New Delhi.        
	He said the company was considering the option of setting up a customer briefing centre in India for product demonstration.        
	Revenues from India increased 85 per cent year-on-year in 2007, Bhagat said. He declined to give further details.        
	AT amp;T has applied for a mobile licence in India in partnership with Mahindra Telecommunications.         
	It plans to focus on large entities rather than on individual customers.        
	In the US, AT amp;T focuses on consumer operations while for its overseas operations, it caters to multinational companies.        
	Expansion in West Asia is also on the companys radar.        
	The $1-billion investment will be mainly to build a subsea optical fibre cable in Asia and for an Ethernet network in Europe and Asia.

	Calcutta, Oct. 21: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are expected to scoop up frontline stocks on the bourses once again.        
	But this isnt going to be a great show of confidence in sagging Indian stocks. Instead, it is a scramble to duck strictures from the capital market regulator which has been incensed by the manner in which these foreign investors lent shares to entities outside the country and precipitated a sharp fall on the local bourses.        
	According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the FIIs lent shares in Reliance Industries, the Tata group, companies ICICI Bank, Wipro, Hindustan Unilever, Axis Bank, Reliance Petroleum, Housing Development amp; Infrastructure Ltd and Reliance Communications to overseas entities. This sparked short selling pressure in the cash segment of the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.        
	Short selling is an activity wherein a trader/investor sells the shares of a company without actually owning them. It is done in anticipation that the price of the stock will fall in the future so that the trader/investor can make some profit by buying the shares later at a cheaper price.        
	Short sellers borrow the shares that they sell for a definite period of time at the end of which the shares are bought from the market to cover the short position.         
	Earlier, Sebi had informed the FIIs registered here that it disapproved stock lending and borrowing by them to entities outside the country as the market regulator did not know the identity of the entities involved in deals outside the Indian jurisdiction.         
	Last week, Sebi asked the FIIs to make regular disclosures of the number of participatory notes (P-Notes) they had issued to overseas entities in the past few weeks.         
	The market regulator believes that overseas lending and borrowing of stocks through P-Notes issued by FIIs have precipitated short sales on the domestic bourses.         
	P-Notes are instruments issued by registered foreign institutional investors to overseas investors who wish to invest in the Indian stock markets without registering themselves with the market regulator.        
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave yesterday said the stock lending and borrowing activities of FIIs would be monitored and it would take stringent measures, including the banning of an FII, if it indulged in activities that the regulator disapproved of.         
	Sensex gains        
	Sebis warning to the FIIs helped the stock markets consolidate above the psychologically important 10000 level with the benchmark sensex today posting a smart gain of 460 points.         
	While the BSE barometer ended at 10683.39, higher by 460.30 points, or 4.50 per cent, its counterpart on the NSE, the Nifty, rose 112.10 points, or 3.59 per cent, to close at 3234.90 points.

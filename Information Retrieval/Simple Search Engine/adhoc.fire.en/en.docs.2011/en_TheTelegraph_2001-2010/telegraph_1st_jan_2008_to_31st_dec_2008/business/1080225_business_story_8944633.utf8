                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Take it easy
                                I am 69 years old. My annual income from deposits in post offices and banks and from house rents does not add up to Rs 1 lakh. Do I need to continue filing income tax returns? If not, should I mention it while submitting Form 15H every year with post offices and banks for non-deduction of tax at source?          Dilip Kumar Bhattacharyya, Behala
                      Since your annual income is less than the threshold limit of Rs 1,95,000 for people above 65 years, filing income tax return is not compulsory. Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source is submitted by those who do not have taxable income. So, there is no problem in your submitting Form 15H and not filing the income tax return.                                     Private matter      Some nationalised banks are sending a pro-forma to their customers asking them to fill in the form. One of the columns asks the customers to disclose their accounts with other banks. This is irrational and risky. Is a customer bound to answer the question?        K. Sen, Calcutta
                The particular information mentioned by you is private and confidential, and hence a person is not liable to disclose it under ordinary circumstances. But without knowing the details of the form and the nationalised banks involved, it will be difficult to comment anything on the matter                                   Free trade      I am a retired government employee. Can I purchase and sell shares daily? What are the limits on purchase and sale of shares on a daily basis?         Amit Kumar Roy, Howrah
                Government employees, who are currently employed, can dabble in shares with their own money. There are no restrictions on an ex-employee of the government to trade in shares. The limits for trading in shares are set by the individual brokers with whom you will have to register with to buy and sell stocks.

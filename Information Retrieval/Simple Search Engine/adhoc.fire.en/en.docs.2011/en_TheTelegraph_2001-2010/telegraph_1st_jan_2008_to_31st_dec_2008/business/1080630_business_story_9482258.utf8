                                In my income tax return for the assessment year 2007-08, I had included the income from interests on bank fixed deposits and paid the tax accordingly. Subsequently, the bank deducted tax at source on the interest income. On August 10, 2007, I had applied to my income tax assessing officer for refund of the amount deducted by the bank and submitted a photocopy of the certificate of deduction of tax at source issued by the bank (Form 16A). I have not yet received the refund. What should I do?          Girish Roy, Calcutta
                    You will definitely get refund of the excess tax deducted from your interest income. The income tax office takes some time to refund. However, you may enquire about the refund with your assessing ITO once again. Next time what you should do is to calculate the tax liability on your interest income pre-TDS. Deduct from this tax payable the TDS amount and pay the balance. This way you dont have to wait for the refund.                                  House on sale      We have a house built in 1912 and plan to sell it soon. Do I have to pay capital gains tax, if so in how many days?        R. Dasgupta, Calcutta
                    Yes, you will have to pay long-term capital gains tax at the rate of 10 per cent without indexation or at 20 per cent with indexation. The tax amount has to be paid within the same financial year during which the property would be sold. For example, if you sell the house this year, you will have to pay the capital gains tax before March 30, 2009.                                  Free bird      I am a pensioner. My total annual income from pension and interest from post office deposits is around Rs 1.5 lakh. I have a PAN card. Do I have to file income tax return every year?        S.R. Chakravorty, Calcutta
                    The threshold limit of annual income for senior citizens (people who are above 65 years of age) has been increased to Rs 2.25 lakh in the current financial year. Your annual income is much lower than the basic exemption limit. This means you dont have any taxable income. For people having no taxable income, filing income return is voluntary and not mandatory                        If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                          FINISHING LINE                                  
	Calcutta, June 23: Quippo Infrastructure Equipment Ltd of the SREI group is set to complete the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in the cellular tower arm of Tata Teleservices by the end of the month.        
	We are very close to wrapping up the deal and hopefully all the loose ends will be tied up soon. The valuation has not been altered because of rising steel prices, said Sunil Kanoria, vice-chairman and managing director, Quippo.        
	The company is expected to pick up a 49 per cent stake in Tata tower arm Wireless Tata Telecom Infrastructure Ltd as it has a tower business and therefore, cannot compete with the Tatas.        
	With close to 5,000 towers in its portfolio, Quippo is valued at Rs 3,000 crore.        
	According to Kanoria, Quippo plans to increase the number of towers to 10,000 by 2009.         
	Wireless Tata, which has over 10,000 towers under its belt, has an enterprise valuation of over $3.5 billion. The merged entity will command a valuation of around $4.5 billion, according to analysts.        
	Quippo has earmarked $3 billion for growth both through new facilities and acquisitions this year. Earlier in the year, it acquired the 875 towers of Spice Telecommunications across Punjab and Karnataka for Rs 600 crore.        
	An investment of $1.5 billion is required to buy a 49 per cent stake in Wireless Tata.        
	Kanoria had earlier hinted that rising steel prices might lead Quippo to reconsider valuations but has dispelled such notions now.         
	Rising steel prices not only push up the rent of towers but also make the towers more valuable.        
	Structural steel angles and plates contribute to around 60 per cent of the cost of a tower, with the investment per tower ranging from Rs 25 to Rs 40 lakh. Companies are now sharing around 25-30 per cent of their networks, which is expected to go up.

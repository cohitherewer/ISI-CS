          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Taxing times                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 5: Bombay High Court has given short shrift to Vodafones arguments against the $2-billion tax tab that the government slapped it with last September for the acquisition of a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar for $11.2 billion.        
	In a 160-page ruling, the two-judge bench said the dominant objective of the transaction was a transfer of capital asset or business in India.         
	While dismissing the Vodafone petition, judges S. Radhakrishnan and A.V. Nirgude said the Vodafone deal with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa through its Cayman Island subsidiary was not simply a transfer of shares by overseas companies.         
	The court was also of the view that Vodafone had wilfully failed to produce the original agreement between itself and Hutchinson Telecom International. In the absence of this document, it refused to go into the constitutional validity of income tax provisions under which the showcause notice had been issued.        
	The judges took a very dim view of Vodafones move to challenge the showcause notice in court when it could have taken an adjudication route. They felt that Vodafone could have first approached the authority issuing the notice instead of the court.         
	The reason why ordinarily a writ petition should not be entertained against a mere showcause notice is that at that stage the writ petition may be held to be premature, the judgment said.         
	In a statement issued today, Vodafone said it intended to appeal to the Supreme Court within the eight weeks granted by Bombay High court. Vodafone, based on advice received, continues to believe that the transaction is not subject to tax in India and is confident of a positive outcome ultimately.        
	One of the advisers to Vodafone, PricewaterhouseCoopers leader in tax practice Dinesh Kanabar said, The judgment has dealt with very few arguments presented by Vodafone. For instance, it was Vodafones contention that foreign companies dont have a withholding tax obligation. Once a person has paid consideration, the tax has to be paid by the recipient. None of these have been addressed and neither has the constitutionality of the retrospective amendment.        
	The decision of the Supreme Court will be closely watched in what is turning out to be a landmark case for cross-border mergers and acquisitions.

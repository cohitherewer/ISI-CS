          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, March 28: The 30-share sensex notched up a 356-point gain on Friday as domestic institutional investors scooped up large and mid-cap shares with the market expecting a stream of robust fourth-quarter earnings.        
	After opening on a strong note in the morning, the market fell 231 points just after noon as news filtered in that inflation had leapt to a 14-month high. But the bellwether bounced back and closed at 16371.29. The 50-share benchmark index at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also rose 112 points to 4942.         
	The earning season is round the corner and they are expected to live up to our expectations, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (market strategy), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.        
	The sensex has risen about 1400 points this week, which may be read as a resurgence of investor confidence with most negatives already factored in.        
	This is crucial for the equity market as it prepares to adjust to the imposition of securities transaction tax in the new financial year. The spurt in inflation has quelled all hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India.         
	Analysts believe that the markets will claw back to 18K in the near term unless the western markets throw up further shocks.        
	The global markets ended on a positive note, except for the Nasdaq and the S amp;P indices which fell by about 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively.

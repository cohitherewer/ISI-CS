          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: Investors survived another major scare today when the sensex came close to breaching the 10,000-mark on renewed fears of a recession in the US.        
	The benchmark index, which plunged 790 points during the day, recovered from the depths to end with a loss of 228 points following lower inflation numbers and a recovery in overseas markets.        
	Stocks went into a deep dive at the start of trading, mirroring the steep fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.        
	The Dow had plummeted on Wednesday as data showed that retail spending declined 1.2 per cent in September. This exacerbated worries that the worlds largest economy was slipping into a recession. While the Dow Jones dropped 733 points, it resulted in Asian bourses opening sharply down with losses between 4 and 10 per cent.        
	The sensex opened at 10284.90, lower than the previous close of 10809.12, thereby ignoring the actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India to pump more liquidity into the banking system.         
	Although stocks managed to consolidate later, selling resumed towards noon which saw the benchmark index slipping to 10017.80, only a few points away from breaking the 10k-mark.        
	However, the first signs of resistance to selling were visible when data showed that inflation had slipped to 11.44 per cent from 11.80 per cent.        
	The figure triggered a small rally in bank stocks on expectations that the central bank could bring down interest rates.        
	With European markets also recovering from their lows, the benchmark index came off the lows and ended at 10581.49 against yesterdays closing level of 10809.12, a loss of 227.63 points, or 2.11 per cent.        
	Analysts say that although stocks may show a rally, it is still too early to assume that equities will recover from here on.         
	Sebi move        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today removed the conditions limiting FIIs allocation of funds between debt and equity, a decision that will provide greater flexibility and investment options to overseas investors.        
	It has been decided to do away with the conditions provided in FII regulations pertaining to the restrictions of 70:30 ratio of investment in equity and debt, respectively, with immediate effect, Sebi said.

                                                                                                               Ficci favours common agenda
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chandrashekhar in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 11: Indian industry wants political parties to jointly prepare a common minimum economic agenda.        
	Rajeev Chandrashekhar, the newly elected president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said the chamber would prepare the agenda and present it to the political parties.        
	The ruling UPA had framed a common minimum programme (CMP) for the purpose of governance. Ficcis idea is borrowed from the CMP but is meant for a broader constituency.        
	One of the key things in this election year for us (Ficci) is to try and establish this agenda for political parties. We hope leading political parties include it in their manifestos, he told the media.         
	Marut Sengupta, head of policy at the Confederation of Indian Industry, said they too had come up with similar proposals in the past.         
	If this happens, it will create a greater degree of understanding between industry and the government, he said.         
	Chandrashekhar said the agenda would focus on the governments role in strengthening independent regulators, increasing economic efficiency, improving institutional framework and restructuring government expenditure.        
	To help formulate views, the chamber will soon launch a series of seminars on politics and governance.         
	Most political parties in India believe in the irreversibility of economic reforms but differ in the nitty-gritty of the process.        
	Chandrashekhar said the chamber would like its members to follow the suggestions of finance minister P. Chidambaram against price fixing and cartelisation.

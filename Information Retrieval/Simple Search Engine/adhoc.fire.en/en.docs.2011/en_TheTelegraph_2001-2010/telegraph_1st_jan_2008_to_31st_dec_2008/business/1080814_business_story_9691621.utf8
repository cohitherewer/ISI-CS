	Ludhiana, Aug. 13: Hero Electric, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Hero group, will soon venture into manufacturing three-wheelers.        
	We are looking at diversifying into electric three-wheelers. There are no concrete plans yet, but we will take a decision by the end of this year, said Naveen Munjal, managing director of Hero Electric.        
	Indian customers are highly price sensitive, they need value-for-money products. One has to keep in mind that usually three-wheelers are overloaded. So we will have to carefully look at price points and offer a good product, Munjal said.        
	In the electric two-wheeler range, the company has 10 models, including the recently launched Optima Plus. In Delhi, Hero Electrics products are priced in the range of Rs 12,000-Rs 23,500.        
	Munjal said the company would launch three new scooters by the end of this fiscal. The company has also chalked out plans to earn a high share of revenue from exports. The firm has decided to foray into the overseas market starting with the export of e-bikes to Saarc countries this year. It plans to set up a greenfield assembly facility with annual capacity of 60,000-70,000 units to meet the demand for e-bikes.

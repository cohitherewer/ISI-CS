          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Object of Interest                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Leading real estate players Ansal API and Raheja Developers will invest over Rs 8,000 crore in special economic zones (SEZ).        
	While Ansal API plans to invest Rs 3,600 crore in developing six IT special economic zones and parks spread over 270 acres, Raheja Developers will invest about Rs 4,500 crore to develop an engineering SEZ in Gurgaon over the next three to five years.        
	A higher profit margin is encouraging developers to turn to SEZs from housing projects.        
	Ajit Krishnan, an analyst with Ernst and Young, said, SEZs would position the country as a global manufacturing hub and these projects would help strengthen the infrastructure base.        
	According to Rajeev Dayal, senior vice-president (retail and SEZ) of Ansal IT City amp; Parks Ltd, We will be investing Rs 3,600 crore in developing IT SEZs and parks in different states. The construction for some of the projects has already started and they are expected to be completed in the next five to seven years.         
	The IT special economic zones, under the brand name of The Campus, will come up in Greater Noida, Gurgaon, Lucknow and Khapoli (near Mumbai), while one park each will be set up in Lucknow and Noida under the Net City brand.        
	These SEZs are aimed at IT and IT-enabled services firms looking to set up centres in adjoining areas of tier-1 cities in view of the global economic pressures to reduce costs and maximise returns, company chairman and managing director Pranav Ansal said.        
	On the source of funding, Ansal said, About Rs 1,000 crore will be invested through a mix of equity and debt in the ratio of 1:3. The remaining will be raised from various private funds through equity dilution in the projects.        
	We are looking to further dilute stakes in the Greater Noida SEZ, but will retain the controlling stake, Dayal said.        
	According to Raheja Developers chairman Navin M. Raheja, the Gurgaon project is the first notified engineering SEZ in northern India.         
	The investment would be funded through a mix of debt, equity and internal accruals, he said, adding that the company was also looking at strategic investors.        
	Of the total 255 acres, about 60 per cent has been purchased. The company has entered into partnership with land owners for the remaining land.

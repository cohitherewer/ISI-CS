	New Delhi, Feb. 1: The wholesale price-based inflation accelerated to a five-month high of 3.93 per cent for the week ended January 19, on the back of rising prices of some manufactured items and industrial oils.
    
	In the previous week, inflation stood at 3.83 per cent and was 6.31 per cent during the corresponding week a year ago.
    
	Inflation may increase to higher levels as the government is preparing to raise fuel prices next week for the first time in more than 18 months. 
    
	Concerns about rising prices had prompted the Reserve Bank of India to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged during its third-quarter review of its 2007-08 monetary policy announced this week. 
    
	Industry, however, was expecting a cut to spur production.
    
	Higher oil and food costs pose the risk of aggravating inflation risks, the central bank had said in the review. 
    
	In industrial oil, the price of furnace oil rose by 2 per cent and light diesel oil, 1 per cent. 
    
	Some manufactured products such as textiles, metals and food products also became costlier, while the prices of primary food items such as vegetables and pulses came down.
    
	Fear of bird flu in some parts of the country led to a fall in the prices of eggs.

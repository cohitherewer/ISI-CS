	Seattle, Feb. 3 (Reuters): Yahoo Inc said it might take quite a bit of time to weigh its strategic options, including keeping the company independent, following Microsofts $45-billion offer to buy the company.
    
	In a weekend posting on the companys web site, Yahoo said it was undertaking a deliberate review of Microsofts unsolicited offer to pay Yahoo shareholders either $31 in cash, or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock.
    
	The review will include evaluating all of the companys strategic alternatives, including maintaining Yahoo as an independent company, the posting said. 
    
	A review process like this is fluid, and it can take quite a bit of time, it added.
    
	In response to a frequently asked question about whether Yahoo would seek proposals from other companies, the company said it was going to evaluate all options.

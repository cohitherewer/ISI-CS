	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Sun Microsystems has launched Sun Startup Essential to provide technology support to start-up companies. 
    
	Under this free programme, Sun Microsystems will help start-ups conserve cash and speed up the development cycle, get Sun products at very cheap prices and rent Sun infrastructure from web hosting partners at low monthly subscription rates. 
    
	The company also provides technical advice through emails and Web-based training to developers.
    
	There is a panel that screens which applications would qualify for the process.
    
	The programme was launched in the US in November 2006 and introduced in India in September 2007.
    
	We have 125 applications, of which 10 per cent are from the eastern region, said K.P. Unnikrishnan, director  strategic alliances and tele-web sales, Sun Microsystems India. 
    
	Private equity and venture capital inflows into the country are expected to touch $13.5 billion this year, up from $7.46 billion in the previous fiscal. 
    
	By the end of December 2010, private equity and venture capital funds would have invested up to $20 billion in India, according to Evalueserve, a research and analytics firm. Typically, technology start-ups receive over a fifth of these investments. 
    
	This is the first time that Sun is venturing into the consultancy domain as a technology venture capital. The response has been very encouraging and we hope that the response from the east will catch up, said Unnikrishnan.

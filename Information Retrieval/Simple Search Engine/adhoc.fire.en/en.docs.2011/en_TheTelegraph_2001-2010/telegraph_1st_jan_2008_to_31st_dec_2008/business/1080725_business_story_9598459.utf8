          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The government today approved Swedish truck major Volvos proposal to invest $275 million (over Rs 1,150 crore) in a joint venture with commercial vehicle manufacturer Eicher Motors.        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today gave its approval to Aktiebolaget Volvo, Sweden, to invest 45.6 per cent in the paid-up equity share capital in a joint-venture, Eicher Motors India Ltd, an official spokesperson said.        
	While the commercial vehicle business of Eicher Motors Ltd will be transferred to the joint venture company Eicher Motors India Ltd, the sales and distribution network of Volvo India will also be merged with the joint venture firm.        
	The proposed FDI will have to conform with the RBI and the Sebi guidelines, besides approval of the relevant high courts for the demerger of distribution business of Volvo India, he said.        
	Eicher will hold the balance 54.4 per cent equity of the company and shall act as an operating-cum-holding company, the spokesperson said. The finance ministry had earlier approved the FDI proposal of Volvo to invest $30 million (Rs 123 crore) to buy up to an 8.1 per cent stake in Eicher Motors Ltd.        
	In May, the two partners had formalised the joint venture. Volvo, because of its 8.1 per cent stake in Eicher Motors Ltd, will have an economic interest of 50 per cent in the joint venture.         
	According to Par Ostberg, executive management member and chairman of Volvo Trucks Asia said the move was a part of the truck manufacturers plans to tap the fast growing commercial vehicles market in Asia, particularly in India.         
	India is the fourth-largest market for heavy trucks in the world and with the country investing heavily in improving infrastructure, there is a big opportunity for us, Ostberg said.        
	All Volvo group truck projects in India will be routed through the joint venture. Volvo may also look at entering the commercial vehicles financing business in which it has achieved global success.         
	The joint venture will make and market Eicher and Volvo branded products with the former focusing on 5-50 tonne trucks and the latter on heavy-duty vehicles.

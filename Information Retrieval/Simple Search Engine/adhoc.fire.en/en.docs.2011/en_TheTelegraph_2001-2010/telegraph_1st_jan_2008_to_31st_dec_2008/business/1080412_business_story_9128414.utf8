	Mumbai, April 11: Export curbs on cement and steel are unlikely to have a big impact on domestic prices, analysts said.        
	In steel, even after the withdrawal of incentives, world prices are high enough to encourage exports. An official of a leading steel company said the world price of steel was $1,100 per tonne, while the domestic price was around $850.        
	Analysts said the removal of incentives would increase the availability of steel in the local markets, but strong domestic demand would ensure high prices.        
	In cement, the proportion of exports is relatively small to the installed capacity. Higher supplies, as a result of a ban on export, are likely to be absorbed domestically without any impact on prices. Prices of steel and cement have been rising in the past few months because of a combination of higher input costs and a strong demand in the domestic markets.        
	An industry source said cement exports till February at around 3.6 million tonnes were a fraction of the industry capacity of 170 million tonnes.        
	The industry had been focussing on domestic markets because of better price realisations. It exported over 5 million tonnes in 2006-07.        
	However, the impact of the ban could be felt in Gujarat and Maharashtra from where most of the exports take place.         
	Though a mild softening of prices in these states is on the cards, strong demand will keep the prices firm.        
	The steel official said the industry had not been taking fresh export orders, in line with its commitment to the Centre. We are only exporting those under contractual obligations, the official said.

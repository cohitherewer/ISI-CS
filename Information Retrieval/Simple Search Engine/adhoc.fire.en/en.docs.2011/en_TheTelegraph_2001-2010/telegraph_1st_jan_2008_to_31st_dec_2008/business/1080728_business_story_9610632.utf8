          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          Ambani: Significant move                                  
	Calcutta, July 27: Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd and China-based Shanghai Electric Corporation Ltd will enter into an agreement tomorrow to set up a $3-billion joint venture for power equipment manufacturing.         
	The two companies will also set up four smaller joint ventures to provide third-party services in technical designing, operation and maintenance, erection of power plants and aftersale services to power utilities.        
	The joint ventures for third-party services will involve an investment of $400-600 million and are expected to create 400 jobs.        
	Anil Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, and Xu Jianguo, chairman and CEO of Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group, will sign the agreement for long-term strategic co-operation tomorrow.        
	While the power equipment manufacturing entity will be a 50:50 venture, the shareholding patterns between Reliance Infrastructure and Shanghai Electric in the four other companies are not yet known.        
	The $3-billion joint venture is one of the biggest tie-ups between a Chinese company and an Indian company.         
	The locations for these projects will be decided after the memorandum of understanding is signed. However, it has been learnt that the power equipment company will be ready by 2010, with an initial manufacturing capacity of 10,000MW.         
	The new entity will supply equipment to Reliance Power  the flagship generation company of ADAG (Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group) that has bagged two mega power projects of 4,000MW each at Sasan in Madhya Pradesh and Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.         
	Reliance Power aims to have a generation capacity of 30,000MW by 2017 and to achieve this target, it wants to ensure a steady supply of equipment.         
	The joint venture company will also supply equipment to domestic producers and firms in neighbouring countries.        
	The government has set a target of adding over 78,000MW generation capacity during the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12). However, a number of projects are getting delayed because of inadequate supply of primary equipment, such as boilers.         
	Shanghai Electric Corporation has already bagged a $7-billion contract from Reliance Power to supply equipment to the Sasan project, which is expected to be completed by 2013.

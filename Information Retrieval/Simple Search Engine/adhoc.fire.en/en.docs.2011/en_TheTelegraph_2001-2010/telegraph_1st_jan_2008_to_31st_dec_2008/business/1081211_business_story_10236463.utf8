                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       U-turn on job loss in BPO
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 10 (PTI): The Business Process Industry Association of India today reversed its stand on the employment outlook in BPOs and said firms would employ more people despite problems in the US and other developed economies.         
	The future of the Indian BPO industry is safe. The sector has no plans for job cuts. In fact, the BPOs require more people to scale up their operations. The sector will continue to contribute around 2.5 per cent to Indias GDP. There is no need to panic as things will settle down, said association president Deepak Ohlyan.        
	Only last week, former president Samir Chopra had said that over 2.5 lakh people could lose their jobs by the first quarter of 2009 in the wake of the global downturn. Chopras comment created a flutter in the industry, which employs about seven lakh people.         
	Nasscom, the umbrella IT and BPO body, also came out with a statement rejecting the negative outlook portrayed by the association.

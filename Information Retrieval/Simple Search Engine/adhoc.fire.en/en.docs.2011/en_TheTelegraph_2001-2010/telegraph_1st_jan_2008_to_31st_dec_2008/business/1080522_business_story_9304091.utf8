	New Delhi, May 21: Soaring crude oil prices could cost Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited its navratna status.        
	The companys borrowings from banks have touched Rs 17,400 crore, against a cap of Rs 21,500 crore.         
	At the current global price of crude and products, the company can exhaust its borrowing limits in around 45 days, officials said.        
	Sources said the company could lose its navratna status, which gave it financial autonomy, if it hit the borrowing cap and there was a stress on its balance sheet.        
	Navratna status is given to a public sector unit if it fulfils some criteria such as earning profits continuously for some years, having positive net worth and not seeking budgetary support. Besides, there should be no instances of loan default and no guarantees from the government. The situation could only get worse in the coming months, if the trends projected by Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential investment banks, are to be believed.        
	It said that the global oil price was likely to rule at an average level of $141 a barrel in the second half of this calendar year.         
	The sources said HPCL had placed before the government a bail-out package. It wants the government to increase the amount of oil bonds and give permission to use the bonds at their face value to pay Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India Limited for crude oil.        
	The company also wants the duration of the bonds to be less than 10 years, reduction of the customs duty to zero, besides a hike in petrol and diesel prices.

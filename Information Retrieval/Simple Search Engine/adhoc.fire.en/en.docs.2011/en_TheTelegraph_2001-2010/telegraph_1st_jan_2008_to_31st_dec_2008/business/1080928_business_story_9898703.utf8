	Mumbai, Sept. 27 (PTI): The State Bank of India (SBI) today increased its deposit rates on certain maturities effective from October 1.        
	The bank has introduced a 1000-day deposit scheme that offers 10.5 per cent interest to depositors, an SBI press release said. Senior citizens will receive a higher 11 per cent interest in the new deposit scheme, it added.        
	Besides, an additional 0.25 per cent rate above the card rate will be given on a single-term deposit of Rs 15 lakh and above, having a tenure of 181 days to less than two years. Similarly, a 0.1 per cent rate above the card rate will be paid on a single-term deposit of Rs 15 lakh and above for other periods of less than 181 days and for two years and above.        
	Last week the SBI had hiked interest rates on foreign currency non-resident (B) account deposits. FCNR(B) dollar deposits, having a maturity of 1-2 years, now fetch an interest of 2.96 per cent against 2.46 per cent earlier.

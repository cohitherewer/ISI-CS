          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          GREEN SIGNAL                                  
	New Delhi, March 13: The Union cabinet today cleared the National Mineral Policy, 2008, which favours exporting minerals in a value-added form and auctioning iron ore mines to user industries.        
	The policy, which will make it easier for foreign and domestic firms to invest in mining, is expected to attract foreign direct investment to the tune of $250 million per year.        
	According to the policy, efforts shall be made to export minerals in a value-added form as far as possible.         
	However, it does not impose any specific restriction on exports.         
	The policy was given an in-principle approval by the cabinet as recommended by the high-level committee together with modifications on the basis of consultations with state governments, inter-ministerial consultations and in line with the recommendations of the group of ministers, an official spokesperson told reporters after the meeting.        
	The cabinet also cleared the setting up of an independent dispute resolution mechanism the mining administrative appellate tribunal. This will be fully operational within six months.        
	Several states, including Orissa, Chattisgarh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, had opposed the policy of auctioning mines, which, they felt, could see user industries deserting them for other locations that are better endowed with ports, infrastructure and ready markets.        
	The new policy says end users, such as steel plants, can buy mining rights through an auction process, under which part of the mined mineral will go to the state where the mine is located as a licence payment. The rest can be shipped to any part of the country for processing.         
	Mineral-rich states had been arguing that steel makers should set up mills in their states in return for mineral concessions given to them.        
	However, officials said the central government believed a bidding process was necessary to ensure transparency.        
	According to official sources, an amendment bill will be introduced during the budget session to bring about suitable amendments in the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act, 1957, MCR Rules 1960 and MCDR 1988 to give effect to the new policy.

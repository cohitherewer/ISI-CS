The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | User fee to be based on pure aviation cost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       User fee to be based on pure aviation cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ready for takeoff                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The government today announced draft guidelines on user development fees at airports.         
	Charged by an airport developer, the fee will be on departing passengers and enable developers to bridge the gap between their expenditure and earnings.        
	In the guidelines, the government said the costs should be based on accepted norms.        
	Passengers will not pay for the costs that are not directly related to aviation such as the cost to develop malls, hotels and staff housing.        
	Developers must show they have followed a competitive bidding process in awarding contracts for various works. The contracts must be in line with the costs that the developers had shown in their proposals to the government.         
	The need for guidelines arose when the developers of the recently built Bangalore and Hyderabad airports sought high user fees that led to protests by passengers and airlines.        
	The civil aviation ministry, which had asked private developers to put on hold their plans for user fees, said taxes paid by developers and their operational costs would be included in the user fee. In addition, a 14 per cent return on equity capital of a developer will be included in the fee.        
	Earlier this month, GMR Hyderabad International Airport had announced that it had submitted five different models for the fee to the ministry. It plans to use whichever model is approved by the government.        
	Airlines, hit by the rising cost of jet fuel and fewer passengers, is opposed to the fee as this may lead to air passengers using trains.         
	The guidelines will be finalised after detailed discussions with all stakeholders including airports and passengers, civil aviation ministry officials said.

             Gupta: Fresh plans
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: The Jindals have decided to set up a 6-million-tonne plant in Bengal in the first phase instead of the 3-million-tonne unit proposed earlier.
    
	This will raise the investment to Rs 15,000-18,000 crore compared with Rs 10,000 crore earmarked for the first phase.
    
	Biswadip Gupta, chief executive officer of JSW Bengal, said production would start in 2011. 
    
	We have been able to tie up raw material sources for coal and iron ore. This has given us the confidence to double capacity in the first phase, Gupta said.
    
	He was speaking on the sidelines of the Strategy Summit 2008, organised by ICFAI Business School in association with The Telegraph in Calcutta today.
    
	Jindals Bengal project involves a 10mt plant and a 1,600-mega-watt power plant at an overall investment of Rs 35,000 crore.
    
	The foundation stone for the project is expected to be laid by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the second week of February. Our target is to commission 3mt capacity in March and another 3mt in June 2011, Gupta said.
    
	The project had received the clearance from the ministry of environment and forest last month.
    
	The company is now in the final stages of acquiring land at Salboni in West Midnapur district. The acquisition has been peaceful so far. Work on a boundary wall around the area will begin soon.
    
	JSW Bengal will also come up with an initial public offering (IPO) to finance the project.
    
	The debt-equity ratio in the initial phase will be 3:1. We are looking at Rs 5,000 crore equity and Rs 10,000 crore of debt, Gupta said.

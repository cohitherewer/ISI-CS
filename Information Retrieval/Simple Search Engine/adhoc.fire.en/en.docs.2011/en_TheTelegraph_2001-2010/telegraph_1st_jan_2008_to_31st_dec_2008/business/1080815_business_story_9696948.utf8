          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: The department of telecommunications (DoT) today ruled out any change in third-generation (3G) spectrum pricing rules and the time frame for an auction.         
	According to the current schedule, the auction for 3G spectrum will be held within three months, spectrum allotted by the year-end and services launched by mid-2009.         
	DoT officials said if needed, there could be more consultations with the finance ministry.         
	However, 3G policy is consistent with the 2003 cabinet decision on spectrum pricing, they added.        
	The finance ministry yesterday alleged that the DoTs announcement of the 3G guidelines without consulting it was inappropriate and contrary to the 2003 cabinet decision.        
	The cabinet meeting held on October 31, 2003, had decided that spectrum pricing would be decided mutually between the DoT and the ministry of finance to provide incentives for efficiency and discourage the sub-optimal use of spectrum.        
	Earlier this month, telecom minister A. Raja had announced the guidelines for 3G services  which offer high-speed downloads of data and voice such as movie and video clips  saying the government will auction five to 10 3G licences per service area.        
	Raja also issued 3G licences to state-owned BSNL and MTNL without waiting for the auction and said they would roll out their services within six months.

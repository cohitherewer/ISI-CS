                                I had deposited Rs 6,00,000 in a post office monthly income scheme (POMIS) in a joint account with my son. Will the post office issue one cheque on maturity in the name of the first holder or two cheques in the names of each account holder? Will there be any TDS on maturity of the account?          Somnath Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
                    The post office will most likely ask you to open a savings account where they will transfer the maturity value. This is because post offices are facing a hard time in mobilising small savings, particularly after the bonus in a POMIS was withdrawn and re-introduced at a lower level. However, the post office is bound to give you the maturity value in cheque and the same will be issued in the name of the first holder of the account. It would be wise if you open a savings account with a bank jointly with your son in the same sequence as your names appear in the POMIS. TDS is not applicable to post office small saving schemes..                                  Pension pain      I had invested Rs 1,34,000 in the Varishta Bima Yojana Pension Plan in March 2004 to receive a pension of Rs 1,000 per month. In March 2007, I took a loan of Rs 1,00,000 against the above policy at an interest rate of 9 per cent. However, my pension payment has been suspended from October 2007 without any information. Should I now stop payment of interest on the loan that I had taken against the policy? ?         Mihir Kumar Das, Calcutta
                    If you are referring to the Varishta Pension Bima Yojana announced in Budget 2003-04 and sold through the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the plan stands withdrawn. You will have to approach an LIC office to check why they had stopped the pension payment.                                   Saving grace      Can I show the accrued annual interest in NSC as reinvestment and claim deduction under Section 80C?        P. Chaudhuri, Howrah
                    Yes, you can show the accrued interest in NSC as reinvestment and claim deduction under Section 80C thereon. However, you will first have to show the accrued interest as your income during the year and then you can show this as reinvestment and claim deductions thereon.

	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Fortune Park Hotels Ltd, an ITC subsidiary, has signed up with developers to manage 50 hotels that are in various stages of construction.        
	Of the 50 hotels, spread across different locations in the country, 30 will be operational by the end of 2008.        
	The company is looking at eastern India in a big way, with three properties in Calcutta and one each in Jamshedpur and Darjeeling.        
	It is scouting for more locations in the east, including Ranchi and some places in Orissa.        
	According to Suresh Kumar, president, Fortune Park, We are very optimistic about our projects in the eastern region, especially in Calcutta. We operate on a revenue -sharing model with developers and, if we find a right fit, take over the management of a hotel usually on a ten-year contract period. The entity is then branded as a Fortune property.        
	Depending on locations, the room rates range between $100 and $150 per night, going up to $200 per night in certain places.        
	Fortune opened its first property in Calcutta, and the 23rd in the country, the Fortune Park Panchwati, at the erstwhile Lakeland Country Club in Howrah with 72 rooms.        
	Calcutta is experiencing a flurry of hotel projects, such as from DLF-Hilton, Emaar, and Intercontinental. Oberoi is also looking for a second property under the Trident brand.        
	Most of these are premium brands though business hotels such as Ginger and Taj Gateway Hotels are also coming up.        
	We have different Fortune brands depending on the location. There are Fortune Park and Select, which are full service business hotels.         
	For smaller cities its Fortune Inns, and Fortune Faith for pilgrimage places. The room rates will also vary according to the type of the project and the location. The need of the hour is affordable, customised lodging solutions, Kumar said.        
	Fortune Park is also looking aggressively at joining hands with developers for properties along the highways.        
	As infrastructure development in the country gains momentum, there will be a huge demand for such properties. Our properties will be branded as Fortune Spots or Highways, said Kumar.        
	In Calcutta, of the other two properties, one is on AJC Bose Road, while the other is the Rutt Din hotel on Loudon Street, which is being refurbished.        
	Companies such as Fortune are giving a new lease of life to old, existing properties within city limits, as land scarcity has made it next to impossible to find fresh project sites.         
	Fortune Hotels has a resort chain at popular destinations such as Darjeeling, Jaipur, Mahabalipuram, Tirupati, Ooty and Port Blair.

	New Delhi, April 16 (PTI): Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy today admitted that inflationary pressures were more than expected and indicated that some steps might be taken in the forthcoming annual credit policy to rein in prices.        
	We anticipated some inflationary pressures but they turned out to be more. We have to see that the aggregate demand management is consistent with supply side initiatives, Reddy said.        
	In terms of detailed analysis, he said the RBI was holding a meeting of its monetary policy advisory committee. We expect to make an announcement on April 29, he said. The level of inflation is unacceptable to us. It is higher than our tolerance limit, he said.        
	The regulator will come out with its annual credit policy on April 29, which, many believe, will tighten money supply to tame the inflation rate that soared to a 40-month high of 7.41 per cent last week. Speaking at the World Leaders Forum in New York earlier, Reddy said India had experienced benign inflationary conditions averaging around 5.2 per cent since 2004-05.

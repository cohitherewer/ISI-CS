                                                                                                               Plantations get a fillip
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Green signal                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 29: The budget brought in some glad tidings for the plantation sector with funds for rejuvenation and crop replantation extended beyond tea to other crops such as cardamom, rubber and coffee.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram also announced that the crop insurance scheme for tea, rubber, tobacco, chilli, turmeric, ginger, pepper and cardamom would be operational during the course of the next year.        
	The outlay of Rs 40 crore announced for tea will comprise the subsidy element, the actual outlay will be four times at Rs 160 crore. The response to the Rs 4,500-crore fund to be disbursed in the next 15 years has been very encouraging, said Basudeb Banerjee, chairman, Tea Board.        
	Around 15 per cent of agricultural export earnings come from plantation crops such as tea, coffee and rubber, while they occupy only one per cent of the plantation land.        
	Exports of plantation crops have been suffering because of increasing production costs as well as low productivity. Such a support for replantation and rejuvenation was also announced by the finance minister to cardamom (Rs 10.68 crore), rubber (Rs 19.41 crore) and coffee (Rs 18 crore).        
	Minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh had stated that such funds were required for Indian exports to become more competitive in the global plantation markets.        
	While Indian tea comprises 27 per cent of global production, coffee and rubber account for 4.5 and 8.6 per cent, respectively.        
	The Rangachari task force on plantations had recommended an insurance cover for small growers because of the absence of any credible alternatives to meet the risks of price movements.        
	The task force had suggested that the premium cover be shared between the beneficiary and the price stabilisation fund trust on a 50:50 basis.        
	According to the task force, the insurance cover should also include a personal accident cover for small growers as well as for plantation workers.                          
	The Rs 20-crore grant to the Tea Research Associations Tocklai Experiment Station for its centenary year in 2010 would also help in researching productivity issues.        
	Bengal which accounts for 22 per cent of national tea production does not have much exports besides Darjeeling tea.

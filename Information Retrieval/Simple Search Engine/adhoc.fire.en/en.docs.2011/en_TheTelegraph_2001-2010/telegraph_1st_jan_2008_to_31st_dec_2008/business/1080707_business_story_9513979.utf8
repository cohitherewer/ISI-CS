	London, July 6 (PTI): Whyte amp; Mackay may take over Elgin-based distillery Glen Moray, the British media reported today.        
	According to a Sunday Times report, Vijay Mallya, who had taken over Whyte amp; Mackay last year, is in regular talks with LVMH Moet Hennessy, the owner of Glen Moray, on issues such as potential asset swaps. According to the newspaper, LMVH had said the company was putting Glen Moray on the block as part of a restructuring plan of its single-malt Scotch whisky Glenmorangie business.        
	The report added that Whyte amp; Mackay might be interested in second-tier malts and consolidating the supply of spirit for Scotch whiskies to tighten its grip on the fast-growing Indian market.         
	LMVH had earlier announced an investment of $45 million in its distilleries at Tain and Ardbeg. However, the company will sell Glen Moray as part of a phased withdrawal from the bottling and sale of blended Scotch.

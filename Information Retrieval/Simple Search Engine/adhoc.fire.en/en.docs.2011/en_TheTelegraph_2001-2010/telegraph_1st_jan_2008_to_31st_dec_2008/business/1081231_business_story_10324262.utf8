          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, Dec. 30: Reliance Communications Ltd (R-Com) today announced the launch of its nationwide global system for mobile communications (GSM) service.        
	Anil Ambani, chairman of R-Com, indicated that the company was likely to come out with an aggressive pricing strategy for its national GSM rollout on Wednesday.        
	R-Com has invested close to Rs 10,000 crore in the project, which will provide mobile telephony services in over 11,000 towns and 300,000 villages.        
	The company is planning to bid for 3G spectrum when the auction is held sometime next month. It has a cash chest of up to Rs 4,000 crore ready for its foray into 3G .        
	Although the company did not announce its tariff structure, Ambani hinted that it would be as attractive as the Monsoon Hungama scheme that the company had launched in 2003 under which a customer had got a mobile phone connection with an upfront payment of just Rs 501. Pricing for the GSM service will be announced tomorrow.        
	Ambani said the GSM rollout was completed six months ahead of schedule. The company plans to double the GSM coverage over the next few months to more than 24,000 towns and 600,000 villages. It will cover all rail routes and national and state highways.        
	According to Ambani, customers will now have the option of choosing either the GSM or code division multiple access (CDMA) technology or both.        
	Foreign bonds        
	R-Com said it had bought back foreign currency convertible bonds worth Rs 121.22 crore ($25 million). The zero coupon bonds have been bought back at a discount of 52.5 per cent over the issue price and they have been extinguished, the company said.        
	The repurchase comes after the Reserve Bank allowed companies to buy back FCCBs prematurely in rupees if they were at a minimum discount of 25 per cent on the book value.

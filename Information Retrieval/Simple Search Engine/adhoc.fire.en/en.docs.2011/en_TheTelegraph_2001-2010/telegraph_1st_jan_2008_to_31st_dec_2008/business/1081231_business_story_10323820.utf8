          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 30: The Haldia port faces a significant drop in cargo with Indian Oil Corporation finally operationalising the Paradip-Haldia pipeline to carry crude after a delay of two years.        
	The 330km pipeline will carry 10 million tonnes of crude oil. IOC will now take the delivery of crude at Paradip in Orissa and pump the oil into its Haldia and Barauni refineries.        
	Haldias low draft does not allow IOC to bring large ships, which is not the case at Paradip. It will substantially reduce the transportation cost.        
	Haldia had handled 14mt crude oil in 2007-08. In all, it had handled 18mt petroleum, oil and lubricant last fiscal.        
	The port will lose the coveted third spot among Indian ports in terms of cargo handling.        
	Last year, Calcutta Port Trust, which manages the Calcutta and Haldia ports, handled 57.28mt cargo, including 18mt petroleum, oil and lubricant.        
	Haldia will have to look at an alternative to fill up the vacuum created by the pipeline.        
	A 5mt refinery by Delhi-based Cals Refinery is slated to come up.        
	A refinery of 15mt capacity is also likely to be built in the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks get some respite
                                                                                                               Stocks get some respite
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 14: The stock markets today recouped some of their earlier losses as a Standard amp; Poors projection of an end to subprime write-downs lifted sentiments across the globe.         
	The sensex rose 403 points before closing at 15760.52. The 50-share Nifty, too, ended with a 122-point gain at 4745.80.        
	The confidence in todays market stems from strong global cues and the S amp;P report which indicated that the credit crisis is nearing its end, said V.K. Sharma of Anagram Stock Broking.        
	Standard amp; Poors estimated that write-downs of subprime asset-backed securities could reach $285 billion globally, up from a previous $265 billion projection. Yet, S amp;Ps statement that the end of write-downs is now in sight for large financial institutions lifted investors moods across all markets.        
	The G7 countries step to fight against the weakening dollar held some hope for investors.         
	The Indian stocks have also risen because of short covering, and the uptrend is expected to continue in the next week. Any negative news at this moment can again hurt investors sentiments, Sharma added.        
	Meanwhile, the international markets ended flat yesterday. Technology-heavy Nasdaq and the S amp;P benchmark indices closed with marginal gains, while Japans Nikkei and Hong Kongs Hang Seng dropped by 1.5 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.        
	Bajaj demerger        
	As part of the demerger process of Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Holdings amp; Investment was listed at Rs 1,100.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.         
	The scrip hit a high of Rs 1,143.80, dipped to a low of Rs 720 and closed at Rs 771.90.

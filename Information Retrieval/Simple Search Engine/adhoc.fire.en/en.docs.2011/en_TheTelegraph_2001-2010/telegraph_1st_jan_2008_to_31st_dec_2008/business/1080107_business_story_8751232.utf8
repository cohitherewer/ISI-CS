   Bond puzzle

                I had purchased bonds of Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd on December 6, 2005 through a registered broker and got them transferred in my name. In June 2007, I got the maturity value of the bonds but the company had deducted tax at source on the interest amount. What will now be my income under the income tax law?
     B.D. Mehta, Calcutta

          The interest income on the bonds was subject to tax deduction at source. You should get the TDS certificate from the company or at least the taxpayer identification number (TIN) and mention it in your income tax return. 
                 Taxing times
   I am 62 years old and my total income from pension, interest from POMIS, and interest on bank deposits will be Rs 2,40,000 in 2007-08. Interest from NSC deposits, five-year tax saving bank deposit and life insurance premium will be Rs 27,300. How much tax do I have to pay?
    Tapan Guha Roy, Dum Dum

          You can claim a deduction under section 80C on annual interests from NSC and five-year tax saving bank deposits as reinvestment. The amount of interest will have to be considered while calculating the total annual income. However, you can claim a deduction on the full amount of annual life insurance premium. Calculate the total annual income by adding up all incomes. From this, deduct the life insurance premium to get your taxable income. Your tax liability will be Rs 4120 + Rs (2,50,000  your taxable income)x20.6 per cent. 
                 Flat dilemma
   We live in a flat consisting of three types of accommodation sizes  450 sq ft, 850 sq ft and 920 sq ft. No flat association or committee has been formed so far. Therefore, we are not sure about the monthly share for each owner in the common expenses. What should be the correct share?
    S.K. Banerjee, Calcutta

          The common space and facilities in an apartment is used equally by all owners. There should be no restriction on smaller flats on such utilisation. Therefore, the common expenses should be shared equally by all.

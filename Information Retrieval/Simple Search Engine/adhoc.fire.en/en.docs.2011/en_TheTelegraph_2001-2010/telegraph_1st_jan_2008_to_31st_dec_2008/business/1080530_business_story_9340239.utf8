                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Selloff back on IFCI agenda
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 29: IFCI Limited today decided to seek fresh bids for the sale of a 26 per cent stake in the company, some months after it rejected an offer of a consortium led by Sterlite Industries to buy the same amount of stake.        
	The board of the Delhi-based non-banking finance company met today to consider the induction of a strategic investor and issues related to the optional convertible debentures held by the government. However, company officials said no final decision had been taken. The board will meet again on June 12.        
	Just before the rejection of the Sterlite bid, in December 2007, the IFCI board had approved issuing 123.7 million shares at Rs 107 each on the conversion of zero coupon optionally convertible debentures held by banks and institutions. The board of directors also discussed the optionally convertible debentures worth Rs 923 crore held by the government.         
	The company may think of repaying the money to the government or converting them into equity. Earlier, the government had told IFCI that it would not exercise its conversion option in respect of these debentures.        
	The shares of the countrys oldest financial institution rose around 9 per cent, the most since April 22, to Rs 62.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

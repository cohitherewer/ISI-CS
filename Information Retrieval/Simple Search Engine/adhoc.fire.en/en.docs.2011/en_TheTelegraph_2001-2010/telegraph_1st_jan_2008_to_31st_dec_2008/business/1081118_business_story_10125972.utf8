	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today held a high-level meeting on possible steps against a slowdown, hours after flying back from the G20 meeting in Washington.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, commerce minister Kamal Nath and RBI governor D. Subbarao were among those who attended the meeting.        
	Though officials and ministers were tight-lipped about the outcome of the meeting, sources said a possible rate cut by the central bank and a slew of measures suggested by a committee of secretaries were discussed.         
	The Reserve Bank had earlier cut its key overnight lending rate for banks (repo) by 1.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. It had also cut the cash reserve ratio  the portion of deposits banks must keep with the central bank  to 5.5 per cent from a seven-year high of 9 per cent.        
	However, industry leaders feel the rates are, still, high. They are lobbying for further cuts and holding up investment plans. Industrial growth has bounced back to 4.8 per cent in September after falling to just 1.4 per cent in August.         
	Banks, too, have been demanding more cash for loans.         
	For the government, the need is to fit its plans with the steps being adopted by other countries, particularly the rich nations. At the Washington summit, world leaders have agreed to undertake co-ordinated action.        
	The government is also known to be working on an expenditure package, which will see higher spending on infrastructure and job creation.         
	Officials said this would be far smaller than similar stimulus packages being worked out by other countries, since India was not in the grip of a recession and still remained among the fastest growing economies.         
	Industrial slowdown notwithstanding, the country is expected to grow 6-8 per cent, according to different estimates prepared by the government and international bodies.         
	The officials said the government would try and revive exports, which shrunk 15 per cent in October. Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the government would help export units engaged in labour-intensive activities.        
	We are going to see how a level playing field can be provided to our exporters, which means totally waiving duties and taxes, Nath said.        
	He said there was a case for refunding taxes and levies to enable exporters to compete in the world market.        
	Following the October growth setback, the minister said the government would review the export target of $200 billion for this fiscal.        
	I am reviewing it to see whether our target will be met or not. Till now, we are on track. But the next five months will determine whether target (will be met), he said.         
	A four-member group headed by finance secretary Arun Ramanathan and including the secretaries of the commerce department, the department of industrial policy and promotion and the Planning Commission has submitted its report to the Prime Minister.        
	The report, sources said, has 62 recommendations to bail out exporters.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ramadorai: Strategy shift                          
	Hyderabad, Dec. 3: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is reviewing its capital expenditure plans in the backdrop of the global financial crisis.        
	Indias No. 1 infotech firm intends to delay its acquisition plans and take up other cost-management initiatives.        
	How you turn adversity (the crisis) into opportunity is vital. Thats how we look at things. Thats how we engage with our customers, TCS chief executive officer and managing director said here today at a forum on Internet governance.        
	TCS plans to improve the productivity of its employees and reduce travel, communication and power expenses. In the last quarter, TCS human resource utilisation was 81 per cent, he said.        
	Asked if TCS would reduce its exposure to banking, financial services and insurance sectors, Ramadorai said, Consciously, we dont, but we are also looking at other areas. The company earns 45 per cent of its revenues from banking, financial services and insurance.

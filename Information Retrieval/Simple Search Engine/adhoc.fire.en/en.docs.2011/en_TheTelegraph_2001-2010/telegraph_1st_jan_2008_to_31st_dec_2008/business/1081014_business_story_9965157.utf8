  Panel weighs options to tackle crisis          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: The crisis committee headed by finance secretary Arun Ramanathan met here today to toss options on the measures that they could take to head off any turmoil on the financial markets.        
	The options include a further cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which was trimmed last week by 150 basis points to 7.5 per cent, a relaxation in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) which is currently pegged at 25 per cent, and the possible trimming of the repo rate.        
	CRR is calculated as a percentage of the total deposits with banks and the sum must be parked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).        
	The SLR is the percentage of deposits that banks must invest in approved securities  usually gilts. Soon after he took over as RBI governor last month, Duvvuri Subbarao had effectively trimmed SLR by allowing banks to dip into this reserve to the extent of 1 per cent.        
	In June, the RBI had raised the repo rate to 9 per cent. This is the rate at which the RBI provides loans to banks against securities.        
	The panel of experts will continue their deliberations in Mumbai on Wednesday. It is expected to have its action plan ready by the end of the week.        
	The root cause of the present uncertainty is liquidity and not any dramatic change in the fundamentals of the economy, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters in an uncharacteristic attempt to talk up the markets before they opened for trading.        
	We are working on more measures that will infuse liquidity and increase the confidence of depositors and investors, Chidambaram said.        
	The finance minister said the government, the central bank and the stock market regulator were coordinating on an hourly basis.        
	According to analysts, if todays rebound is sustained over the next week, then the RBI may decide to wait until October 24 (when it reviews the monetary policy) before announcing any measures.        
	The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister today proposed cuts in SLR and CRR. I do expect those measures could be taken to further ease liquidity, council chairman Suresh Tendulkar said.        
	There has been a demand to ban short-selling of stocks but officials said no such move was being contemplated. Late tonight, the RBI relaxed norms for exchange- traded interest derivatives and permitted banks to take trading positions in interest rate futures.

    You can avoid entry load if you invest through a fund house, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay
                     
	Starting this week, entry loads should stop bothering you if you invest in a mutual fund scheme without the mediation of an agent, a broker or a bank.
    
	All you should do is follow four steps: prepare an address book of all the fund houses in your town, select a scheme and then refer back to the address book for a branch or collection office of the fund house of your choice. Purchase units of the scheme directly from the fund house and you will not have to pay an entry load.
    
	Which means, if you buy a mutual fund scheme directly from an office of a fund house, you will get the units at the net asset value (NAV) of the scheme. On the other hand, if you buy the same units through an agent, a broker or a bank, you will have to pay the NAV plus an entry load.
    
	Mutual funds dont charge any entry load for their close-ended funds but charge between 2.25 per cent and 2.75 per cent in open-ended schemes, which includes tax saving plans and balanced funds. 
    
	You can save up to 2.5 per cent of your investment if you buy units of an open-ended equity scheme directly from a fund house. For debt schemes, however, savings will be lower at 1 to 1.5 per cent.
    
	In percentage terms, the savings may appear insignificant. However, if the scheme has a high NAV or if you want to invest a large sum, the amount you save can be big enough to make a personal visit to the fund house seem worthwhile. 
    
	Sample this: you can buy units of an open-ended equity scheme launched after January 4 for Rs 10 each instead of Rs 10.25 earlier. Therefore, if you invest Rs 5,000 in the new fund offer, you save Rs 125 by purchasing units directly from the fund house. If you invest Rs 1 lakh, the amount will be Rs 2,500. 
    
	Moreover, if you had to purchase an existing equity or a tax-saving scheme having a NAV of Rs 100 before, you would have to pay Rs 10,250 to buy 100 units of the scheme. With the same amount you could now purchase 102.5 units if bought directly. The gain would be more if you considered the capital appreciation on these additional units over the period of holding. 
    
	To illustrate it further, let us assume that you invest Rs 10,250 in an existing scheme with a NAV of Rs 100. We also assume that the scheme gives a 20 per cent annual return. Refer to the table to see what will be the value of the investment after one year if bought directly from a fund house vis--vis from an agent or distributor.
    
	Till January 3, the agents, brokers or distributors would have pocketed most of the amount you had paid as an entry load as their commission. Now you have the option of bargaining with them for a share of the commission if you purchase the units through them.
    
	Those who make systematic investment plans (SIPs) in a mutual fund will also benefit by enrolling directly at a fund house. After offering SIPs without any entry load to popularise the concept among small investors initially, mutual funds have slapped 1 to 1.5 per cent entry loads on their systematic investment schemes. 
    
	There is a hitch, however. Not many fund houses have enough branch or collection office networks. Most of the smaller MFs depend primarily on their agents and distributors to sell schemes.
    
	Therefore, if you come from a small town, the odds are against your finding a collection office of a fund house of your choice.
    
	But the good news is that the MFs are planning aggressive branch expansion to grab a share of the growing retail pie.

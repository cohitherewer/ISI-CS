                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bailout bill clears House hurdle
                            
	Washington, Oct. 3 (Reuters): The US House of Representatives passed a landmark $700-billion financial industry bailout bill on Friday, sending it now to President George W. Bush, who is expected to sign it into law.        
	Eyeing both the November 4 elections and stock market indexes, the House voted 263-171 to approve the largest government intervention in the financial markets in decades. The measure passed the Senate on Wednesday.        
	Some lawmakers complained that the bailout would help big banks, but do little for troubled homeowners, while giving sweeping powers to treasury secretary Henry Paulson and whoever replaces him after the election.        
	This will give unprecedented, unbelievable authority to Henry Paulson, a Wall Street speculator who created the financial weapons of mass destruction and now says he knows how to disarm them, said Oregon Democratic representative Peter DeFazio.        
	Others said the plan was needed to prevent Wall Streets problems from causing a potential economic disaster.        
	Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican who opposed the bill on Monday but supported it on Friday, said,Were out of choices, our backs are up against the wall.         
	Fortis fate        
	The Dutch government nationalised the banking and insurance activities of Fortis in the Netherlands on Friday after the troubled financial services company hit an acute cash crunch.        
	Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said the second state rescue of the Belgian-Dutch group in less than a week was made necessary by increasing liquidity problems in the banking activities.        
	The transaction, effectively breaking up the cross-border group along national lines, is worth 16.8 billion euros ($23.3 billion) and includes Fortis interest in ABN Amro, the Dutch bank it bought in a consortium with Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander last year.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Idea suffers spectrum setback
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The government today asked Idea Cellular to surrender either its licence or that of the recently acquired Spice Communications for the Punjab and Karnataka circles to avoid overlapping. It said it would not refund licence fees to Idea for the spectrum vacated.         
	Idea spokesperson Rajat Mukarji said the company had not received any notification from the department of telecommunications (DoT) and was, therefore, not in a position to take a decision.        
	The mobile service provider, which had acquired a controlling stake in Spice Communications in June, had earlier told the DoT that it was willing to surrender the licences issued to it in January 2008 for the Punjab and Karnataka circles.         
	Idea had also sought a refund of the Rs 300 crore it had paid as licence fees for the two circles.        
	However, telecom secretary Sidhharth Behura said, The policy is very clear. What will one do with two licences? You need just one to offer the service. Obviously, Idea has to return one licence (in each circle) but there wouldnt be any refund for this.         
	Though Idea Cellular was awarded universal access service licences effective from January 25, 2008, it was not given start-up spectrum in Karnataka and Punjab where Spice is an operator. Spice holds around 14 megahertz (Mhz) spectrum in these two circles and caters to 4.4 million subscribers.        
	Spice has spectrum in the 900Mhz band in these two circles, which can accommodate a larger number of subscribers than the 1,800Mhz band used by other GSM operators.         
	Idea Cellular now stands to lose the Rs 300 crore paid as the licence fees for the Karnataka and Punjab circles.        
	According to analysts, this does not augur well for the company, which had reported a 14.7 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 263.1 crore for the first quarter of this fiscal, while its revenues grew 47 per cent on the back of robust subscriber addition.        
	The DoT guidelines allow a merged entity to be entitled to the total amount of spectrum held by the merging companies but require the merged entity to meet the subscriber criterion within three months.        
	However, there is no clarity yet on Ideas spectrum in Andhra Pradesh. The combined spectrum of Idea-Spice at 12.6Mhz is far in excess of the norms. Idea has 8.2Mhz in the state, while Spice had recently received 4.4Mhz, taking total spectrum to 12.6Mhz.        
	For 12.6Mhz, the norms state that an operator must have 9 million subscribers, whereas there are just 3.55 million Idea users in Andhra Pradesh.

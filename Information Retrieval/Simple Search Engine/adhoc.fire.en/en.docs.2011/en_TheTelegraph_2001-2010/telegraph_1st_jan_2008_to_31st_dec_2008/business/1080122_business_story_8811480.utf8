             Ramesh: Action front
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The Centre has asked the Bengal government to allow horticulture and tourism in sick tea gardens to make them financially viable.
    
	The problems faced by the financially weak tea gardens are enormous and need to be addressed at the earliest. The way out is to make them financially viable, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce.
    
	The Bengal government should allow five per cent of the garden land for horticulture and tourism to prevent them from turning sick, Ramesh said. For this, the state government will have to amend the land ceiling act as the existing law debars any such activity beyond 24 acres.
    
	In Assam and Tamil Nadu, such measures have resulted in turning around the gardens. It is for the state government to act fast and help the industry, Ramesh said. 
    
	The minister also suggested an exit package for tea workers. According to Ramesh, the number of workers in Bengal gardens was nearly five times more than what was required to produce 1 kg of tea.
    
	A delegation comprising members of the Bengal assembly rejected the VRS proposal, but agreed to consider the option of using horticulture and tourism as alternative sources of income.
    
	The 27-member team submitted a memorandum to the minister requesting the reopening of 13 closed tea gardens in Jalpaiguri district.
    
	Some of the members expressed apprehensions about the five per cent land allocation proposal. However, they said it could be considered to prevent the closure of gardens.
    
	On VRS, the leaders asked whether the Centre had done any study to suggest that the number of workers employed in the gardens were more than what was required.
    
	Ramesh said the Bengal government had cancelled land leases of two gardens  Ramjohra and Kathaguri  and had issued expressions of interest (EoIs). While two parties have shown interest for Ramjohra, Kathaguri has not received any bids.
    
	He said negotiations were on between existing and prospective owners for the revival of Samsing and Bharnobari gardens 
    
	Ramesh said the law ministry was expected to clear the proposal for nine other gardens and the EoIs would be issued later this week after invoking Section 16(E) of the Tea Act that empowers the Tea Board to take over gardens closed for over three months.

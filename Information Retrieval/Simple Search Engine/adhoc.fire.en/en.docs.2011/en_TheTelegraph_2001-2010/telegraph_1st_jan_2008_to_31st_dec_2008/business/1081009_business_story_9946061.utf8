  - Govt favours more cash injections
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Congress-led government today said it was monitoring the global financial crisis closely and might infuse more cash into the economy.         
	Central banks across the world today cut interest rates to counter the financial crisis ravaging the US and Europe.        
	We will watch the situation carefully and continuously and respond swiftly to the needs of the market. Steps will be taken to infuse more liquidity, if required, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after briefing the cabinet on the crisis. He is flying tonight to Washington for a G7 meeting on the crisis.         
	Chidamabaram said the ripple effects of this crisis are being felt in other countries, including India. We wish to assure the people of India that the Indian economy has the capacity and the resilience to weather the storm that is blowing across the world.         
	Unlike in the US and Europe, where banks were in the doldrums, deposits in Indian banks are safe, the finance minister said. No one need have any fear.         
	The capital adequacy ratio of the Indian banks is well above stipulations, both local (RBI) and global (Basel).        
	The fundamentals of the Indian economy were strong, with GDP (gross domestic product)growth of 7.9 per cent recorded in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal. Going by current trends, growth for 2008-2009 would be close to 8 per cent, Chidambaram said.         
	Foreign direct investment from April to August has been robust at$14.8 billion. The investment pipeline is strong in power, steel, oil and automobiles. However, Chidamabaram said that we are conscious of the fact that liquidity conditions in India too have tightened in the last few weeks.         
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had cut the cash reserve ratio, or the proportion of deposits that banks have to compulsorily keep with the central bank, from a 7-year high of 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent earlier this week, releasing Rs 20,000 crore into a cash-starved banking system. Many analysts expect the central bank to take stock of the monetary situation and decide whether to inject more cash.         
	The government had also eased the norms for external commercial borrowings by allowing refining, mining and exploration companies to borrow up to $500 million, while market regulator Sebi had relaxed the rules for foreign institutional investors.        
	The cuts in rates by the central banks have also put pressure on the RBI to take a call on marginal relaxation of its overnight lending rate which is now at a high of 9 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rights issues are a hit
                                                                                                               Rights issues are a hit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 2: Domestic rights issues sprang 778 per cent for the fiscal ending March 2008. According to a report by Prime Database, the total amount raised by Indian companies through rights issues rose to Rs 32,518 crore in the last fiscal against Rs 3,703 crore a year ago. However, easier norms could have resulted in even better numbers.         
	The mobilisation in 2007-08 was the highest ever in history. In fact, it was more than the combined mobilisation of the preceding 12 years, said Prithvi Haldea, chairman of Prime Database.         
	But for the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) restrictive guidelines on rights issues, which act as a huge deterrent to companies opting for this route, the mobilisation through rights issues could have been even higher, Haldea added.         
	Only 30 companies had adopted the rights route to raise money in 2007-08 against 38 in the previous year.         
	The largest issue was floated by the State Bank of India, which raised about Rs 16,736 crore, followed by Tata Steels Rs 9,135-crore issue, Federal Bank (Rs 2,141 crore) and Indian Hotels (Rs 1,447 crore).         
	The response to all the issues was good. Rights offers are made at a discount to the ruling market price and draw shareholders attention, especially when the secondary market is doing well, Haldea said.         
	Though the number of companies taking up the rights route was lower compared with the previous year, companies continued to meet its fund requirements through other avenues such as preferential allotment of equity and qualified institutional placements.         
	Several companies also tapped the overseas markets through global depository receipts, American depository receipts and foreign currency convertible bonds.        
	For 2008-09, already 20 companies have applied for or have received Sebis nod to raise Rs 1,855 crore.

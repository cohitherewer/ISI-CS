The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Private airline duo to hike surcharge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Private airline duo to hike surcharge
          ANIRUDH LASKAR                          SOARING FARES                                  
	Mumbai, May 30: Jet Airways and Kingfisher  the countys leading airlines  are planning to raise the fuel surcharge on domestic air fares by 10 to 15 per cent from the first week of June.        
	Crippled by a surging fuel bill, the airlines have finally decided to raise the surcharge and take some of the burden off their back. Jet Airways, the countrys largest private airline, plans to increase the fuel surcharge by about Rs 350, or 15 per cent, on domestic flights of over 750 km.        
	Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher and low-cost carrier Simplifly Deccan plan to raise the surcharge by Rs 450 and Rs 300 on long-haul and short haul routes, respectively.        
	Once these airlines raise the surcharge, others are expected to follow.        
	Soaring crude oil prices and its impact on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) over the past few weeks have left us with the only alternative of raising the fuel surcharge. Considering other governing factors such as the rupee-dollar ratio, a fuel surcharge hike of around 15 per cent can be expected from the first week of June, K.G. Vishwanath of Jet Airways told The Telegraph.        
	On May 1, when crude oil was hovering at about $120 a barrel, all major domestic airlines including Jet Airways, Kingfisher and SpiceJet, raised the fuel surcharge by Rs 150 on flights over distances of less than 750 km and by Rs 350 on long haul routes  destinations beyond 750 km.         
	Currently, the airlines levy a surcharge of Rs 1,950 on short haul and Rs 2,350 on long-haul routes. After next weeks increase, passengers will have to pay a fuel surcharge of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,800 on long range flights, and Rs 2,200-2,250 on short haul destinations.         
	Rocketing crude oil prices have landed the aviation industry in trouble. We have to increase the fuel surcharge at the earliest to recover our operational costs. From early June, an increase in surcharge in the range of Rs 450 can be expected. The hike will be applicable on Deccan flights also, said Hitesh Patel, executive vice-president at Kingfisher Airlines.         
	Patel added that the airline was also considering the option of levying a surcharge on check-in baggage.        
	We are looking at various ways to optimise our operations to prevent losses. In the current scenario, we are not ruling out a surcharge on baggage, he said.

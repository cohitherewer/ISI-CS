	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Peerless General Finance amp; Investment Company Ltd is focussing more on the distribution of financial products of other fund houses than its traditional business of taking public deposits.         
	The Reserve Bank has set March 2011 as the deadline for the residuary non-banking company to wrap up its business of mobilising deposits.         
	Peerless will have to pay its depositors all outstandings by March 2011 and from April onwards, stop accepting deposits. In 2007-08, Peerless collected Rs 953 crore as deposits, according to company chairman D. Basu.

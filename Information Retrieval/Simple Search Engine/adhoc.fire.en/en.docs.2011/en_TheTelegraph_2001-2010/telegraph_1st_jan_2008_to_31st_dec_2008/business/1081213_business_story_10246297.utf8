   Consumer goods output dips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The consumer appears to have finally turned coy.         
	Buyers seem to be hanging on to their credit cards and cash in their wallets  a clear sign of thrift in hard times  which has resulted in negative growth in the consumer goods segment for the first time this year.        
	Industry will find it hard to digest this disagreeable fact that has been thrown up by the latest numbers churned out by the Central Statistical Organisation while tracking the monthly index of industrial production.         
	It may be facile to predict consumer behaviour on the basis of a stream of production statistics but, in a scenario that clearly indicates an economic slowdown, it may be safe to assume that companies are cutting back output in the face of dwindling demand.         
	The latest IIP numbers show that growth in the consumer goods segment has contracted 2.3 per cent. In the two sub-categories, growth in consumer durables slumped almost 3 per cent while that in consumer non-durables fell 2 per cent.         
	This is the first time in this fiscal that began in April that all three consumerrelated categories are showing negative growth, which may exacerbate worries for the makers of a wide range of products from cars to soaps, and refrigerators and washing machines to television sets. Already, carmakers have started to cut back production at their plants to deal with inventory stockpiles and others could be adopting similar measures to trim output to match demand.         
	But the consumer durable industry was quick to punch holes in the statistics.         
	We dont buy the view that the consumer durables industry has shown negative growth, said Samsung Indias deputy managing director Ravinder Zutshi who is also president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association.        
	Most consumer durable makers said they had notched up very strong sales during Diwali and had started to taper off production to trim inventories.         
	We had controlled production because of the slowdown, poor bank lending, and the pile-up of inventories. This might be the reason behind the negative growth, said Sunil Sethi, marketing head of Weston Appliances.         
	Seven of the 17 industry groups that the IIP tracks showed negative growth in October against just one a year ago.         
	Leather and leather products saw the sharpest decline of 18.1 per cent, followed by wood and wood products (-14.4 per cent) and cotton textiles (-9.6 per cent).         
	Seven other industry groups showed positive growth in October 2008 compared with the corresponding month of the previous year.         
	The industry group other manufacturing industries has shown the highest growth of 11 per cent followed by 7.5 per cent in beverages, tobacco and related products and 5.4 per cent in paper and paper products and printing, publishing and allied industries.

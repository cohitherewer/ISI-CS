          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Emami has finally bagged control of Zandu Pharmaceuticals.        
	The Parikh family, who had set up Zandu with the Vaidyas almost a century ago, has sold an 18.18 per cent stake at Rs 16,500 a share, giving Emami a controlling stake. Emamis price includes a non-compete fee of Rs 1,500 per share and the deal is valued at Rs 242 crore. The Parikhs have been vigorously resisting Emamis bid for Zandu.         
	Emami has bought another Rs 54 crore worth of Zandu shares from the open market, taking its stake to more than 50 per cent.        
	Emami staked its claim on Zandu, whose products have a strong brand recall in the ayurvedic segment, by buying the Vaidya familys 24-per-cent stake in the company.         
	The Calcutta-based FMCG firm held 27.5 per cent in Zandu before striking a deal with the Parikh family.        
	It had bought the Vaidyas stake at Rs 6,900 a share, costing about Rs 120 crore.         
	An open offer for 20 per cent additional shares of Zandu closed yesterday. Upon full acceptance, the Emami shareholding will go up to 70 per cent.         
	A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows Emami paying close to Rs 700 crore for Zandu.        
	Harsh Agarwal, director of Emami, said final data from the merchant bankers were yet to arrive. He did not disclose the future management structure of the company.        
	Girish Parikh, managing director of Zandu, said his family would not sever ties with Zandu.        
	We are not selling all our shares. I will remain a shareholder of Zandu in the future, he told The Telegraph from Mumbai. Parikh said he was satisfied with the arrangement and that shareholders of both the companies would derive maximum benefit.        
	Parikhs statement will be music to Emami promoters  the RS Goenka and the Agarwal families  ears as he was against Emami getting a foothold in Zandu.

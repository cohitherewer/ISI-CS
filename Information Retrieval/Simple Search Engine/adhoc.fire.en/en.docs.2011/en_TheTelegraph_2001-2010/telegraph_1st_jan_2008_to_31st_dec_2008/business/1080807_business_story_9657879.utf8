          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 6: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said banks would need to seek the regulators approval before trading in currency futures.         
	It also stipulated that banks should have a minimum net worth of Rs 500 crore, a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 per cent and should have made a net profit for the last three years to qualify for trading in currency futures on exchanges. These directions are part of a report by the RBI-Sebi standing technical committee on exchange-traded currency futures.        
	Currency futures is a standardised foreign exchange derivative contract traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy or sell one currency against another on a specified future date, at a price specified on the date of contract.        
	Stock exchanges will now have to put in place the requisite infrastructure to enable currency futures to kick off.        
	While draft guidelines on currency futures were released by Sebi in late May, indications are that currency futures will become operational by the end of this month.        
	The central bank seems to be keen to avoid the crisis that erupted earlier this year when banks suffered losses on their forex derivatives trading and became embroiled in legal disputes with companies over various derivative deals they had structured. The RBI also stipulated that net non-performing assets of the bank should not exceed 3 per cent.        
	Under the guidelines, only US dollar-rupee contracts will be allowed to be traded in standardised currency futures.         
	The RBI said the size of each contract shall be $1,000 and that the maturity of the contracts shall not exceed 12 months. Further, membership of the currency futures market of a recognised stock exchange shall be separate from the membership of the equity derivative segment or the cash segment.        
	In the context of liberalisation of the capital accounts, as also continued development of the financial markets, it is felt that wider hedging opportunities could enhance the flexibility for the residents to manage their currency risk dynamically, the central bank said.

	Calcutta, April 18: LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd will invest Rs 480 crore in 2008 in marketing and product development.        
	The consumer electronics major is also considering a price hike of between 2 and 3 per cent across categories because of the inflationary condition and the hike in input costs such as that for steel.        
	We will continue our strong investments in India. Of the total amount allotted for capital expenditure, Rs 360 crore will be invested in marketing and Rs 120 crore in new product development and expansion, said Moon B Shin, managing director of LG Electronics India.        
	The price hike will only be considered for the premium segment.        
	LGs high-end refrigerators are priced between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1,20,000 and high- end washing machines come for Rs 39,000.         
	The company, which clocked a turnover of Rs 9,500 crore last year, plans to take it to Rs 11,000 crore this year.        
	The global revenue of LG is $42 billion, and Indias contribution is $2.5 billion.        
	The three growth drivers for the company will be GSM mobiles, flat panel displays and IT products such as notebooks and desktops.        
	We are aiming at becoming the third largest mobile manufacturer in the country by more than doubling our market share from 3 per cent to 7 per cent. Around seven to eight models have been lined up for this year, Shin said.        
	Existing facilities of the company will be utilised to manufacture mass market models. High-end models will be imported.        
	The company is augmenting its manufacturing capacity at its 56-acre Pune plant. It expects a 15 per cent growth in sales this year.        
	India is emerging as an export hub for LG. The company has dedicated its Pune plant to exports.        
	Products are exported to 40 countries, including West Asia, Africa and some countries of Europe and central America. Last year, the export revenue was $230 million. The company aims to increase the amount to $300 million this year.        
	Exports contribute 10-15 per cent to the companys total product basket. This is expected to rise to more than 20 per cent.        
	The company plans to enter the air purifier market this year. It will also market the Wine Cellar  a wine cooling facility that protects wines from vibration, light and noise damage, while preserving it at an optimum temperature, keeping it fresh.        
	The focus in India would be on the high-end consumer segment.

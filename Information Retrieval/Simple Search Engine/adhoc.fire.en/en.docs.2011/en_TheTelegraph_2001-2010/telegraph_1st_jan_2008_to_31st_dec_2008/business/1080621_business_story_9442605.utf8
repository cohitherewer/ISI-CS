	New Delhi, June 20: Inflation has whittled down real salary growth to paltry levels.        
	According to consulting firm Hewitt, Indian salaries have risen 15.2 per cent in the last financial year, but 11 per cent inflation means the real rise is just around 4 per cent.        
	Last year around the same time, inflation stood at 4.28 per cent, leading to a substantial hike in real income.        
	Crisil chief economist D. Joshi said, Unless there is a crash in global crude or commodity prices, even if the monsoon is normal, inflation is likely to be near double digit for the next few months. This means that salary hikes will just be a shade above inflation.         
	Human resource analysts are fearing an exodus abroad in segments such as real estate, telecom, ITeS, banking and retail.        
	We will need to work to provide better learning and professional growth prospects to retain talent now. Mere money dollops may not help out, though that will also happen, said Manoj Madhusudanan, head business research, Evalueserve India.         
	However, in the future, salary increases will continue to be at high levels. Mercers Gangapriya Chakraverti said in a report that Indian companies were likely to keep raising salaries by about 14 per cent a year until 2011 as skill shortages will continue.         
	Going ahead, the Indian inflation rate will taper down to near 5 per cent, salary hikes then will seem much more and employee retention should not be such a big headache, said Joshi.

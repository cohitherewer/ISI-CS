	New Delhi, Jan. 25: French President Nicolas Sarkozy is looking forward to investments from India to help power his countrys economy.
    
	Speaking to business leaders in India, Sarkozy said, French companies need Indian capital and entrepreneur skills to help the growth of its economy. He hoped trade with India would double to 12 billion euros ($17.7 billion) by 2012.
    
	The President said his country was ready to rebid for a contract for defence helicopters. Last month, the Indian government had cancelled a global tender for 197 helicopters, but defence ministry sources said fresh bids might be sought. 
    
	Sarkozy added that he had spoken to L.N. Mittal to try and save French jobs in a steel plant run by Mittal. 
    
	The Indian is part of the business delegation which has come with the President of France.
    
	Sarkozy said, I met (Mittal) as a friend and investor and not as an opponent... In a democracy there is no prohibition on talking.
    
	Carrefour entry
    
	Frances Carrefour, the second-largest retailer in the world, plans to enter the cash-and-carry market in India by 2009. It is in final stages of negotiations to pick a partner for its retail stores, a French embassy statement said today.
    
	The French firm plans to follow the model of Wal-Mart, which has tied up with Bharti.
    
	Carrefour has set up a wholly owned arm for a wholesale merchandise business in India and will opt for the franchisee route to open multi-brand retail stores in the country, officials said.
    
	Kingfisher order
    
	Vijay Mallya-promoted Kingfisher Airlines is in talks to buy around 40 Airbus planes in a deal worth about $5 billion, said French diplomatic sources. 
    
	Discussions are on between Kingfisher and Airbus for a potential deal of $5 billion, the sources said.

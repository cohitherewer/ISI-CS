                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata Motors springs share surprise
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 28: Tata Motors could become the first company to list shares with differential voting rights on the bourses  almost eight years after the government amended section 86 of the companies act to allow firms to issue shares that carry either different voting or dividend rights.        
	The companys board of directors today cleared plans to raise Rs 7,200 crore from three unlinked rights issues. Tata Motors will use the funds raised to finance the Jaguar-Land Rover acquisition.        
	The company plans to raise Rs 2,000 crore from the differential voting rights (DVR) shares. The DVR shares will carry one vote for every 10 shares and will rank as Class A stocks. It is also planning to raise Rs 2,200 crore from a rights issue of equity shares that will have the same voting rights as the ones already listed on the bourses.        
	And finally, it plans to raise Rs 3,000 crore from five-year 0.5 per cent convertible preferences shares (CCPs). These can be converted into Class A shares (or the DVR shares) after three years but before five years from the date of the allotment.        
	In a statement issued today, the Tatas said, The precise terms of the issues (ratios on which these securities would be offered, the offer price and the conversion price of CCPs will be decided when the issues are ready to be made. The issues are subject to approvals and clearances as may be required and may undergo some changes during this process, the statement said.        
	After these rights shares are issued, the company plans to raise another $500-600 million (Rs 2000-2400 crore) through an issue of securities in the overseas markets on terms that will be decided at a later date.        
	The acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover, which is expected to be completed by June this year, was transacted at a price of $2.3 billion. At the time of the acquisition, Tata Motors had said it would raise a bridge loan of $3 billion. This loan will be fully repaid through the capital-raising scheme.        
	The company said these issues would enhance the equity capital of the company by about 30 to 35 per cent during the current financial year. Tata Motors has a paid-up equity capital of Rs 385.54 crore.        
	The incremental dividend on this increased capital will represent about 10 per cent of the companys net profit for 2007-08. If the CCPs are converted between 2011 and 2013, the equity capital will increase by only about 12 per cent at that time, depending on the conversion price. If they are not converted, the CCPs will be redeemed along with the back-ended premium in 2013, the statement added.        
	Legal angle        
	The Tatas could, however, be beaten in the race to list the DVR shares by liquor maker Jagatjit Industries, which issued a class of super shares with a voting right of 20 per share back in June 2004 but hasnt been able to list them on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as yet. The promoters of the company  LP Jaiswal amp; Sons Pvt Ltd and Karamjit S. Jaiswal  are embroiled in a legal battle over the validity of these super shares which were issued to ward off a takeover threat.        
	Even though the government permitted companies to issue DVR shares back in 2000, the bourses havent amended their listing agreement rules to enable these shares to list.        
	Jagatjit Industries had tried to list the super shares in 2006 but was fobbed off by the BSE which said Sebi would first have to come out with appropriate guidelines in this regard. Sebi hasnt come out with these guidelines till date.        
	Last month, the Jagatjit case came up before Sebi after the regulator issued a showcause notice for a violation of the takeover regulations arising from the issue of the super shares.        
	After hearing the parties to the case, Sebi whole-time member T.C. Nair ruled that under the present statutory provisions, Sebi does not have any power to regulate the issuance of DVR shares. It is not clear whether in the light of such an interpretation, the regulator will desist from coming out with the guidelines for listing of DVR shares.

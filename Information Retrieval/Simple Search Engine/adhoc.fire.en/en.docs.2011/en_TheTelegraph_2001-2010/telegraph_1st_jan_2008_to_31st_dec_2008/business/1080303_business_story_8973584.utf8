The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Yellow metal close to milestone
                                                                                                               Yellow metal close to milestone
                                      Gold rush      
	London, March 2 (Reuters): Gold traders expect the yellow metal to touch $1,000 per ounce this week after it reached $975 on Friday, propelled by speculative buying on the back of record high oil prices and the lifetime-low dollar against the euro.        
	The metal pared gains later that day as some investors took profits, but market sentiment remained bullish. Silver jumped to a 27-year peak before falling, while palladium surged nearly 4 per cent to its highest in more than six years.        
	Gold set a record, hitting $975.90 an ounce before falling to $971.10/971.85 versus $968.90/969.70 in New York late on Thursday. It has risen 16 per cent this year on the top of a 32 per cent rise in 2007.        
	All the newsflow coming out of the US is hugely bullish for the gold market. In the end, what lower interest rates mean is that it will be difficult for the dollar to come back strongly said Michael Widmer, analyst at Lehman Brothers.        
	Inflationary pressures are something that are also playing into the market. Fundamentals are strong and I think $1,000 would not be an end. We are going to go higher from there.        
	The dollar lingered near record lows against a basket of major currencies, pressured by concerns about the US economy and expectations of further aggressive interest rate cuts.        
	A report indicating that US core inflation, which the US Federal Reserve watches, matched economists median forecasts had a little impact on investor expectations for rate moves.         
	A rate cut tends to weaken the dollar as investors shift assets for better returns. A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for other currency holders and lifts metal demand. Gold is also seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation.        
	It looks very likely that we will go above $1,000, said Michael Lewis, global head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank.        
	The next focus is the degree of Fed easing at the next FOMC meeting on March 18. So that would be another possibility that we would start to see dollar weakness accelerating, he said, referring to the US Federal Open Market Committee.

	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Several Indian companies are holding talks with oil multinationals for making joint bids in the seventh round of auction for oil and gas blocks.
    
	For this round, the government will give additional weights if domestic companies tie up with multinationals having experience in deep sea exploration and production of oil. 
    
	There is a possibility of the worlds largest publicly traded oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, Americas Chevron Corporation and UK giant BG bidding for 57 blocks along with Indian partners, sources said.
    
	State-owned exploration major Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is holding talks with ExxonMobil; Reliance Industries Limited, ONGC and the Indian Oil Corporation are wooing Chevron Corporation; and Oil India Limited is negotiating with BG. 
    
	Lakshmi Mittal is exploring possibilities with ONGC as well as with global exploration majors. Mittal has a joint venture with ONGC to acquire oil properties abroad. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation is holding talks with GAIL (India) Ltd, the IOC and ONGC.
    
	Apart from BG, others did not show much interest in the earlier rounds. Only smaller players such as Scotlands Cairn and Ukraines Naftogaz took part. This time, too, Cairn and Naftogaz are interested in alliances.
    
	According to Raghav Upadhya of Infraline Energy Research and Information, Not all the companies which are talking would be participating in the bids. Global majors are generally interested in picking up stakes in already explored oil and gas blocks. 
    
	He said Chevron could participate, but it is too early to rule out the participation of others. We have to wait till the end of the roadshow in the US and the UK to get some firm idea, he said.
    
	The first roadshow for the auction is in Mumbai on January 8, while the overseas ones will begin from January-end. Petroleum minister Murli Deora along with officials from his ministry will go to a number of places, including Houston, Calgary, London and Perth.
    
	Of the 57 oil and gas blocks, nine are in shallow water, 19 in deep sea and 29 on land. Bids will close on April 11, 2008, and the entire process will be over in six months.
    
	India expects to draw anything between $3 billion and $3.5 billion from the auction. This is expected to be Indias biggest auction of exploration blocks  six have been held previously  and the first under new rules aimed at attracting global firms.
    
	The new rule makes it mandatory for domestic oil companies keen on prolific oil and gas exploration blocks in deep waters to form a consortium with experienced foreign partners. Joint ventures with a minimum 10 per cent foreign stake will get a maximum 10-point weightage.
    
	Auctions of blocks started in 1999 under the new exploration and licensing policy. So far, the government has awarded 162 blocks, with ONGC bagging 74.
    
	There have been 49 oil and gas discoveries so far.

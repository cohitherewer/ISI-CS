	Mumbai, Aug. 19: Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications (R-Com) today launched its DTH venture  Reliance Big TV Ltd  which will use the worlds most advanced MPEG4 direct-to-home platform.         
	Reliance Big TV will target a 40 per cent market share in an expanded market within a year of its launch.         
	The company will offer 202 channels initially with digital quality picture and sound, including 32 movie channels. It hopes to take the number of channels to 350 by the first quarter of next year.        
	At present, DTH accounts for only 7.5 per cent of the Indian market, with six million subscribers compared with 8 crore cable subscribers in the country.        
	The home entertainment service market, in spite of serving close to 120 million TV households for decades, has still not delivered the quality, choice and service experience leading to customer delight. Big TV DTH would be the first and only home entertainment service to deliver fully digital picture and sound, choice of channels for every family member and highest levels of customer service across the country, said Arun Kapoor, chief executive officer of Reliance Big TV Ltd.         
	Kapoor said the advent of other players such as Bharti and Videocon in the segment would help expand the market. From 6 million now, we see around 60 million subscribers by 2015. In the next 12 months alone, the DTH platform will add around 12 to 13 million subscribers, he said.        
	Big TVs service will be available at Rs 1,490 which will include a three-month complimentary subscription. The service will be available from 2,000 exclusively branded Reliance Stores in addition to Reliance Web World stores.

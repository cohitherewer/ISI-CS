          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Domestic software and information technology giants, fighting the global financial downturn, are in a cautious mode.         
	The export-driven sector is likely to see fewer fresh projects and revised annual earnings guidance over the next few months. This in turn could mean less recruitment.        
	The industry earns more than 60 per cent of its revenue from the US. The recent spate of closures and mergers there will decelerate business coming from foreign banks and financial institutions, making a dent in the Indian IT firms growth prospects.        
	Earnings from services such as new application development and implementation of packages is sure to be affected by the slowdown, said Priya Rohira, an analyst at Mumbai-based broking house Enam Securities.        
	She said local software companies could be more badly hit than their peers in other countries because they are more dependent on banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) firms in the US, the segment worst affected by the turmoil.        
	Some outsourcers may also cut their dollar revenue forecasts because of the slump in the US market, which contributes more than half their revenue, analysts said.         
	Infosys has slashed its dollar earnings per share guidance for the financial year 2009 to $2.24 from $2.32-2.36, which is about 5 per cent lower. This means earnings will grow by 10 per cent in the current year against 14-16 per cent expected earlier.         
	Satyam Computer Services lowered its revenue guidance in dollar terms by 5 per cent even as it reported handsome growth in net profit for second quarter ended September 30.        
	While Tata Consultancy Services does not give any guidance, analysts said the uncertainty surrounding its performance had increased. It is expected to take a greater hit from the global meltdown because of its exposure to some of the troubled financial service giants such as Merrill Lynch.         
	Indias IT export growth could be slower than its July forecast of a 21-24 per cent rise to about $50 billion in the year to March, Nasscom had said last month.         
	Top officials from Indian IT firms have also said customers were delaying decisions on new projects in the tough global environment.        
	The IT companies are also going slow on new recruitment. The top four IT exporters  TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Satyam  have almost frozen hiring of experienced professionals and have deferred the joining dates for freshers, said analysts.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt awaits report on Satyam flip-flop
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Vice-President Hamid Ansari (centre) with company affairs minister P.C. Gupta (left) at an awards function in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The registrar of companies (RoC) will look into the aborted Satyam-Maytas deal and submit a report within three weeks.        
	We have asked the RoC to get the information from the company and let us know in three weeks. Only when the facts are available can the government do anything, said Union corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta.        
	The ministry of corporate affairs had said it would find out if the company violated any corporate governance law while entering into a deal that involved shareholders money.         
	Satyam Computer Services had decided to buy two firms  Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra  for $1.6 billion, but called off the deal within a few hours following investor protest.        
	The companies were promoted by Satyam chief B. Ramalinga Rajus two sons.         
	Gupta said the RoC would also explore if Satyam had tried to manipulate stock prices. I wont say whether there was any irregularity unless we get the report, but unfortunately this has brought a bad name to the corporate sector not only in India but also world over ... very unfortunate, Gupta said.        
	Satyams shares had taken a beating of over 55 per cent on the US bourses on the day the deal was announced, while the scrip lost 30 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange the following day.         
	Market regulator Sebi is also looking into the corporate governance issues of the three companies.        
	The deal today drew flak from Vice-President Hamid Ansari. Two days back, the nation heard a text book study of corporate governance failure by the promoters of a top IT company that took a decision that directly benefits the promoters with no consultation with the other shareholders, he said at a corporate governance awards function.              
	Even after the deal was called off, it raised questions of corporate governance.

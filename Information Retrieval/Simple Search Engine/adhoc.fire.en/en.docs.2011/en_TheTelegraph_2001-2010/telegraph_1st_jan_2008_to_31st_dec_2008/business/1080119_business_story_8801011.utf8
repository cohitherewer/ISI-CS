     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                      
	Mumbai, Jan. 18: The sensex tumbled 687.12 points today its third-biggest fall  to close at 19013.70 points. The bellwether index hit the days lowest at 18930.42 points.
    
	The sensex was last seen in the 18000 territory about two months ago  on November 29 last year. It fell for the fifth straight day, a decline of 1813.75 points from its close at 20827.45 last Friday.
    
	Heavy profit booking by foreign institutional investors across counters triggered the slide. The 9 per cent drop in the value of the index has sliced about Rs 5.2 lakh crore from investors pockets during the week.
    
	All benchmark indices ended in the red with the oil and gas index being the worst hit with losses of 5.87 per cent. The realty and bank indices were big losers, too, declining 5.73 per cent and 5.17 per cent, respectively. 
    
	On the National Stock Exchange, the 50-share Nifty tumbled 207.9 points to 5705.30, while the midcap and the smallcap indices on the Bombay Stock Exchange registered 5 per cent losses each. 
    
	There is no reason to panic. The sensex has been outperforming other emerging market indices over the past couple of months. Given that Reliance Powers initial public offering has been oversubscribed 50 times, there is also a possibility that a lot of investors have pulled money out of the secondary market, said Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking Ltd.

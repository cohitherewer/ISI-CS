	New Delhi. May 12: The governments intention to either keep current interest rates unchanged or lower them to spur growth, have put banks in a fix.         
	If they cut lending rates, they need to reduce the cost of raising funds by reducing deposit rates. However, bankers say high inflation has forced them to keep deposit rates stable or peg them higher.         
	Government officials said finance minister P. Chidambaram, in repeated meetings with bank chiefs, had underlined the need to bring down rates, or at least stop raising them. This is more so in the case of consumer and home loans.         
	The Reserve Bank of Indias tight monetary policy is also preventing banks from reducing lending rates. It has increased the cash reserve ratio  the portion of deposits that banks must keep with the central bank  that has lowered bank margins, meaning banks have little leeway in reducing rates.        
	For every 25-basis-point increase in the cash reserve ratio, my margin comes down by 2-3 basis points, said K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman and managing director of Punjab National Bank.         
	To attract more money, banks could increase deposit rates but with their margins already taking a hit, they find it unattractive. We are not changing our deposit rates. The higher inflation has already eroded depositor earnings, said Chakrabarty.         
	Bankers even say that with money in short supply, they tend to give fewer loans to borrowers at rates below PLR or prime lending rates. PLR stands at 12.25 per cent, but blue chip companies often manage to get loans at 9-10 per cent.         
	Net margins are taking a hit, forcing banks to give fewer sub-PLR loans and even reduce the number of loans they would normally have doled out in a month, confirmed Amit Mukherjee, a banking analyst.         
	Within the confines of a tight money policy, one way to garner more funds without hitting margins is to offer higher rates to bulk deposits. This keeps the cost rise at bay as the lower cost of servicing the deposit offsets the higher interest rate.         
	Since the RBI has not stopped banks from giving more interest, they are finding it attractive to offer higher rates to big depositors. B.D. Narang, former chairman and managing director of the Oriental Bank of Commerce, said.

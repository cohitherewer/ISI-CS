	New Delhi, June 16: Magneti Marelli, part of Italian automobile major Fiat, and Aurangabad-based Endurance Technologies have signed a joint venture agreement to manufacture shock absorbers for vehicles in India and Thailand.        
	Endurance Technologies will have a 50 per cent plus one share, while Magneti Marelli will hold a 50 per cent minus one share in the joint venture, the two companies said in a statement.        
	The joint venture will be operational by the first quarter of 2009 and will set up an industrial facility at Chakan in Maharashtra.        
	Another production unit is also being planned in Thailand, where the Endurance group is already present.         
	The new company will be involved in the design, production and marketing of shock absorbers, including semi-corner modules and gas springs, for cars and commercial vehicles.

	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the countrys largest car maker, plans to launch its compact model, the A-Star, in the country next month.         
	Maruti is gearing up to export the car, which sports the advanced K-star engine, to Europe by January.        
	Initially, the car will be exported to Europe, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki, on the sidelines of the 48th annual convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers here today. We will launch the Splash in India next year, he said.         
	Nakanishi ruled out any plan to cut the price of the Maruti 800 to compete with the Nano.        
	We are not in a position to get into that segment (the Nano) and we have no plans to cut the price of the Maruti 800 to compete with the Nano, he said.        
	R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said, Maruti has always been in the small-car segment, and we have always concentrated on the category of up to 1200cc cars. But the Nano is a totally different segment that we are not venturing into or competing in that category.        
	According to Bhargava, the company plans to export over 2 lakh units of the A-Star by 2010-11. A-Stars K-series engine is not only fuel efficient but also compliant with Euro V emission norms.

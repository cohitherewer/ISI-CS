          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: India Resources Ltd (IRL), an Australia-based mining company, is sniffing opportunities in gold, copper and uranium.        
	The Australian Stock Exchange-listed company is working with Hindustan Copper Ltd.        
	IRL has entered into a contract with Hindustan Copper to operationalise the once closed Surda mine, which will produce 4,500 tonnes of copper ore.        
	Arvind Misra, director (operations) of the IRL, said the company had so far invested $30 million in the project.        
	We are ready to pull in any amount for new projects, Misra said.        
	Apart from copper and uranium mining, where it will work with public sector companies, IRL is joining hands with private players for coal, iron ore and gold mining.        
	We are in a dialogue with a number of entities. Some of them will fructify and IRLs portfolio will increase, Misra said.        
	IRL has received two reconnaissance permits in Rajasthan where it will be scouting for copper, lead, zinc and gold.        
	The Australian miner plans significant business growth in India before listing the company on local bourses.        
	We are targeting some time next year to list. Preparatory work has already began so that we can enter the market when it revives, Misra said.

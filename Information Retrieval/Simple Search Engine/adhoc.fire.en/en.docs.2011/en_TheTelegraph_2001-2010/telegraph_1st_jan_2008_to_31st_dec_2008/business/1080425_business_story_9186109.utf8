          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 24: Indias top car maker Maruti Suzuki has registered a 34 per cent fall in quarterly net profit, its first decline in five years, on higher depreciation and loss from its investments in derivatives.         
	The company, in which Japans Suzuki Motor has a majority stake, is also considering raising prices of its cars as steel has become costlier.        
	Steel prices are rising and ideally we will pass it on to customers, said Mayank Pareek, executive officer (marketing and sales) of Maruti. He, however, did not disclose the extent of the imminent price hike.        
	Maruti managing director S. Nakanishi said the company was negotiating new contracts with steel companies, who are demanding a 40 per cent price hike.        
	The company had last increased prices by Rs 1,000-11,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi) of most of its models in February.        
	It, however, reduced prices of six models following the excise duty reduction in this years budget on small cars to 12 per cent from 16 per cent.         
	Prices were reduced for the Maruti 800, Omni, Zen, Wagon R, Swift Diesel and the Alto in the range of Rs 6,500-18,030.        
	Marutis net income for the three months ended March 31 fell to Rs 298 crore, or Rs 10.3 a share, from Rs 449 crore, or Rs 15.53 a share, a year earlier.        
	However, the company posted a 10.8 per cent higher net profit in 2007-08 on a 23.4 per cent rise in revenue. It reported a net profit of Rs 1,790 crore compared with Rs 1,588 crore a year earlier. Total revenues, including sales, rose to Rs 19,121 crore from Rs 15,489 crore.        
	Unlike Maruti, the net profit of Suzuki grew 7 per cent to $775 million for the year ended March 2008.        
	Maruti, which will pay a final dividend of Rs 5 a share, said net income wasnt comparable year-on-year because of a more stringent depreciation policy adopted voluntarily by the company.        
	Depreciation in the fourth quarter surged to Rs 311 crore from Rs 71.82 crore.         
	For a tighter and more prudent financial reporting, the company has voluntarily adopted shorter depreciation cycles for its equipment and tooling assets, said Ajay Seth, chief general manager of finance.         
	He said the full depreciation for equipment and tooling assets would be eight years instead of 13 years previously. The depreciation for dyes would be four years instead of five.

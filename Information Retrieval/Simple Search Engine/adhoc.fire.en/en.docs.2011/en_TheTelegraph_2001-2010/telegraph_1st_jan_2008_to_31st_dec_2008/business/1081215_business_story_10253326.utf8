          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              ALL CHARGED UP      
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: The Central Electricity Authority  the apex power regulator  will determine the allocation of coal from the mines of Coal India Limited to various power companies.        
	The regulator intervened because Coal India and power firms were constantly bickering over coal supplies.        
	Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said the intervention was decided last month at a meeting between the power and coal ministries. The electricity regulator will soon meet the top brass of power utilities. The allocation will be determined after taking into account the availability of coalfields and logistics, such as rail rakes, in different regions.        
	He said power firms had accused Coal India of inadequate supplies, though the PSU had exceeded the supply target fixed by the Planning Commission for April-October. Coal India had supplied 164 million tonnes (mt), while the target was 161.5 million tonnes.         
	The onus should not be on Coal India if power firms fail to develop captive coal blocks within a time frame or import less of the mineral than the target, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Power utilities in the country get coal from three sources  Coal India, through a supply agreement; captive coal blocks awarded by the government; and import. Firms may bring less through import because of high costs.        
	A number of power utilities, including NTPC, have not signed the fuel supply agreement with Coal India.         
	According to Bhattacharyya, the utilities had objected to a clause in the agreement which made it mandatory for Coal India to supply a minimum of 60 per cent of the agreed amount and the buyer to lift a minimum of 60 per cent. On failure to fulfil the obligations, the parties will have to pay a penalty. Power utilities had objections to this trigger clause in the FSA (fuel supply agreement) following which they didnt sign the agreement so far, Bhattacharyya said.        
	With the regulator deciding to intervene, both Coal India and power firms have agreed to lift 90 per cent. The deadline for signing fuel supply agreements, too, has been extended to January.        
	For the power ministry, a steady supply of coal is essential to meet the governments ambitious target of electricity in all villages in another four years. Power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had said last week that 53,000 villages had received electricity.        
	The ministry has set a target to give electricity to 1,20,000 villages in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) under a village power scheme.

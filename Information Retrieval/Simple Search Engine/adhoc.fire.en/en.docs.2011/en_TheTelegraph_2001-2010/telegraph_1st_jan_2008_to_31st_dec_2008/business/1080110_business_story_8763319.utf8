     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             PEACE AT LAST
                 
	Chennai, Jan. 9: Bowing to the Tamil Nadu governments pressure, cement manufacturers in the state have agreed to offer 20 lakh bags of blended cement every month to the economically weaker sections at a subsidised rate of Rs 200 per bag.
    
	Chief minister M. Karunanidhi had threatened to take over cement units in the state if the manufacturers failed to cut prices. The price of a bag of cement ranges between Rs 280 and Rs 290 per bag.
    
	In a letter to the chief minister, the representatives of the cement industry said each company would adopt districts that are close to its plants to provide subsidised cement to the economically backward sections and the lower middle class.
    
	Though the price of cement has always been determined by demand and supply, it is in deference to the chief ministers directive to make cement available at reduced prices that they have agreed to this cut, the manufacturers stated in the letter.
    
	The commodity will be delivered to the target group who will get permits from government officials. 
    
	Cement companies not based in Tamil Nadu but with a supply network in the state will also participate in the scheme.
    
	The letter was signed by M. Srinvasan of India Cements, P.R. Ramasubramania Raja of Madras Cements, B. Venugopal representing Grasim and UltraTech Cement, T. Venkatesan of Dalmia Cements and M. A. M. R. Muthiah of Chettinad Cement.
    
	The manufacturers also stated that cement consumption in Tamil Nadu had grown 16 per cent during the current year against the national average of 10 per cent. This was possible because of the progressive policies of the state government.
    
	Import move
    
	The state-owned Tamil Nadu Cements Corporation (TNCC) will go ahead with its decision to import cement. 
    
	The tender for the supply of 1.80 million tonnes over a one-year period will be opened shortly. The imported cement will be distributed through TNCC outlets.

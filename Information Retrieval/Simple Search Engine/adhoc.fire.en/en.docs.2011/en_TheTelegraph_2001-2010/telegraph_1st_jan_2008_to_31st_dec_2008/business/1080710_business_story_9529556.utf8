The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora effort to slip free from tax debate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Deora effort to slip free from tax debate
          R. SURYAMURTHY                      Cause for concern                          
	New Delhi, July 9: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today tried to duck Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singhs demand for a windfall profit tax on private oil refiners by claiming that the commerce and finance ministries would have to decide on the imposition of such a tax.        
	The issue does not come under my ministryit is for the finance ministry to decide, Deora told reporters here.        
	At the same time, petroleum ministry officials argued that private oil refiners could not be singled out for such a tax that, in any case, would require parliamentary approval.         
	They argued a windfall profit tax could hurt state-owned oil companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), as well.        
	If the tax is slapped on all stand-alone refineries or units that are not involved in fuel retailing, then entities such as ONGCs subsidiary Mangalore Refinery, Chennai Refinery of Indian Oil Corporation and Numaligarh Refinery will come within the ambit of the new tax.        
	A windfall profit tax on the existing exploration and production (E amp;P) firms could hit ONGC the hardest.        
	The private exploration and production companies are in the preliminary stages of exploration. Barring Cairn, no private E amp;P company produces significant quantities of oil.         
	The major E amp;P company in the public sector is ONGC. An across-the-board windfall tax will hit ONGC, which is already weighed down by the burden of having to subsidise the costs of state-owned oil marketing companies.        
	The Samajwadi Party, which is now extending crucial support to a beleaguered UPA government, has demanded that companies such as Reliance Industries, Essar Oil and Cairn India be taxed to tide over the crisis created by high oil prices.        
	The Left parties had also been demanding such a tax while opposing the increase in retail prices of petroleum products.        
	Analysts reckon that the government might come up with an export tax on petroleum products to meet fiscal pressures arising from mounting oil and fertiliser subsidies.        
	Profit and loss        
	State-run oil firms have been facing a revenue loss because they are being forced to retail petroleum products at uneconomic prices at a time when global crude oil prices have leapt to almost $140 a barrel.        
	However, Reliance Industries Jamnagar refinery has seen its net profit jump 28 per cent to Rs 15,261 crore in 2007-08.        
	The RIL refinery at Jamnagar, which became an export-oriented unit last year, earned a margin of $15 a barrel, almost double of its public sector competition. The move is to now tax that windfall gain of around $7.50 a barrel.        
	Amar Singh had suggested in his letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that a windfall profit tax of up to 50 per cent on both upstream and downstream operators should be levied.

	Mumbai, May 22: Bajaj Auto Ltd, the countrys second largest motorcycle manufacturer, expects sales growth to remain flat this year as banks are likely to continue their clampdown on two-wheeler loans.        
	Speaking to reporters after declaring the companys annual results, Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj said though the industry sold more two-wheelers in April, a robust revival in sales growth was unlikely.        
	We dont see a change happening. We are prepared, he added. Though observers had cited high interest rates as the crucial factor affecting the sales growth of two-wheelers, Bajaj felt it was the unwillingness of banks to give more two-wheeler loans that was responsible for the sluggishness.        
	Banks have been going slow on two-wheeler loans because of rising delinquencies.        
	In such a scenario, Bajaj Auto is ramping up its own finance company, Bajaj Auto Finance Ltd, to step up consumer loans.         
	Bajaj Auto has already moved its entire sales team to the finance company to strengthen operations.         
	Though sales are expected to remain sluggish, Bajaj Auto will continue to lay emphasis on the 125cc segment.         
	According to Bajaj, this segment had been the most rewarding for the company and it compensated for poor margins on its entry-level models.        
	In the 125cc segment, Bajaj Auto has been successful in garnering a market share of around 50 per cent. The growth in the 125cc plus segment is attributable to the introduction of new models such as the XCD 125, DTS-Si, Discover 135 and the DTS-I among others.        
	We are not investing in the 100cc segment. But we are not exiting this segment either, Bajaj added.        
	Bajaj Auto reported a net profit of Rs 755.9 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008 on a turnover of Rs 9,168 crore. The year saw motorcycle sales declining by 8 per cent        
	For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008, Bajaj Auto reported a net profit of Rs 120.79 crore. The companys total income for the quarter stood at Rs 2,094.89 crore.

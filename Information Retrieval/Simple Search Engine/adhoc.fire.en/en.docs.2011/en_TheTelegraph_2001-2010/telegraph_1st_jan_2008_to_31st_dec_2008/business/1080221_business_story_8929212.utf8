                                                                                                               Economist passes away
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Eminent economist and fiscal policy expert Amaresh Bagchi passed away here today.        
	Bagchi (77), a former director of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, is survived by wife Ratna Bagchi and two children.        
	In his condolence message, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Bagchi as one of the most influential fiscal policy experts in the country.        
	It is no exaggeration to state that Amaresh has been associated with almost every major fiscal policy reform in the past 30 years, he said, adding that as a member of the finance commission, Bagchi had contributed to major policy initiatives in the field of centre and state finances.         
	In his passing away, the country loses the experience and knowledge of one of our most distinguished fiscal policy experts, the Prime Minister said. When Singh was a finance minister in the early 1990s, Bagchi was one of his key advisers on fiscal policy.

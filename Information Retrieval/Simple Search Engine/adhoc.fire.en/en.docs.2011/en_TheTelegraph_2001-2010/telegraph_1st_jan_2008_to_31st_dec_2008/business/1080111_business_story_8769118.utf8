     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 10: Bharti Shipyard today said the company would wait for six months to get land from the Bengal government. If it did not materialise by then, the company will relocate the project to Orissa.
    
	We have received the Bengal governments approval for the project and set a deadline of around six to seven months for the land, during which preliminary work for the project will be done. If we dont get the land by then, we will have the project in Orissa, said Bharti Shipyard managing director P.C. Kapoor today.
    
	The company currently operates shipyards in Calcutta, Goa and at Ghodbunder near Thane and Ratnagiri.
    
	Bharti has proposed to build its largest shipyard, with a capacity of building vessels of over 100,000 DWT, on the eastern coast in a joint venture with the Apeejay group. 
    
	DWT is dead weight tonnage, a measure of cargo capacity of a ship.
    
	Investment for the project is likely to be around Rs 1,600 crore, which the company plans to raise through debt and equity. 
    
	Bhartis equity contribution in the special purpose vehicle with Apeejay Shipping will be Rs 125 crore. 
    
	The shortlisted location in Bengal is Badur, close to the confluence of Haldi and Hooghly rivers, in East Midnapore district.

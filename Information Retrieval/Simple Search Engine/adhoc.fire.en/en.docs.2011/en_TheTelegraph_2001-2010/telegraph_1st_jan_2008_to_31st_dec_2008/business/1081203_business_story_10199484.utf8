          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Dec. 2: The rupee today touched a new low of 50.60 against the dollar in intra-day trading.        
	The weak stock markets have created a huge demand for the dollar and led to the fall in the value of the rupee.        
	However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened, and the Indian currency ended 13 paise higher at 50.16.        
	At the foreign exchange market today, the rupee came under pressure from the very beginning. The market was reacting to overnight losses in the US stock markets, which generated fears of shares falling steeply in India.        
	At one point of time, analysts feared that the rupee could even hit the 51 mark against the dollar. The tide turned as equities recovered in late afternoon and the RBI intervened.        
	Traders said a sharp fall in global crude oil prices also helped. The rupee had resumed weak at 50.52 and later moved in a range of 50.09-50.60.         
	Global oil prices fell below $49 per barrel in Asia today after losing $5.15 to close at $49.28 in the New York market on Monday.         
	Analysts fear more pressure on the rupee, with the dollar gaining against other currencies and foreign institutional investors selling heavily.         
	The BSE sensex today ended 101 points lower at 8739.24. It recovered from an intra-day low of 8467.43.

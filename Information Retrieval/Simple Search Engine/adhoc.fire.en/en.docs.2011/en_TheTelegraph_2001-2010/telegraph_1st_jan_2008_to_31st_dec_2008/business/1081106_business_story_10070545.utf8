          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cost comfort                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: The government today asked hoteliers to cut room tariffs by 10 to 15 per cent to avoid a slump in tourism in the wake of the current financial crisis.        
	Representatives of the Federation of Hotels amp; Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI) today met tourism secretary Sujit Banerjee, who asked them to cut room rates to attract tourists.         
	According to a tourism ministry statement, hoteliers said that they would consider the guidance given by the tourism secretary regarding room tariffs and formulate their response as soon as possible.        
	Sources said hoteliers were likely to announce a tariff cut on Sunday at a travel fair in London.         
	The five-member FHRAI team had representatives of leading hotels such as Taj Ambassador and the Leela group.        
	According to sources, The FHRAI will request its members to reduce room rates. However, the final decision will be left to each hotel.        
	After the concerns raised by the ministry, one can expect the hoteliers to lower their room tariffs, sources said.        
	In the aftermath of the global financial turmoil, many hotels have witnessed a fall in room occupancy. India has been one of the costliest destinations with rates in five-star hotels priced at over $300 a night compared with $150-250 per night in Southeast Asian cities.         
	However, hotels claiming 100 per cent occupancy are not ready to review rates. We now have 100 per cent occupancy and expect the situation to be the same throughout. So, we are really not looking at any price cuts, said Tarun Thukral, chief operating officer of Le Meridien.        
	At todays meeting, the delegation demanded infrastructure status which could help hoteliers to access cheaper loans. They also wanted easier terms for external commercial borrowings.

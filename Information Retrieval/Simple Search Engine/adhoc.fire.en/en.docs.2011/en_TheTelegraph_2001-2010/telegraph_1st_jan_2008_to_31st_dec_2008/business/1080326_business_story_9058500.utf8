The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sweet sensex surprise
                                                                                                               Sweet sensex surprise
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 25: The sensex today stunned all by notching up its second biggest single-day gain. Backed by positive global cues and continued short-covering, the index rose 928 points, or over 6 per cent, before settling at 16217.49. The Nifty too crossed 4800 and ended up 268 points at 4877.50.         
	Todays rally can be attributed to positive global cues and short covering. The short covering will continue through the week, which will provide some support to the markets, said Amitabh Chakraborty of Religare Enterprises.         
	A lot of value-buying is also happening in bank stocks. The positive housing sales numbers in the US, which were released yesterday, will help the rally in the Asian markets for some more time. JPMorgans higher bid price of $10 for Bear Stearns is also a positive sign, he added.        
	Analysts, however, are sceptical about the stability of the market. Although foreign institutional investors have started buying again, domestic insurance companies are still reluctant to park money in equities. Moreover, mutual funds are hardly investing, and retail investors are also staying away. Market pundits believe the future course of Indian equities will depend on global signals.         
	Though the positive US housing sales data fired up the global markets, it is too early to conclude an end to the subprime crisis. In India, retail investors will take some time to return to the market. Going by current fundamentals, a range of 18500 to 19000 is attainable for the sensex, said Hitesh Agrawal of Angel Broking.

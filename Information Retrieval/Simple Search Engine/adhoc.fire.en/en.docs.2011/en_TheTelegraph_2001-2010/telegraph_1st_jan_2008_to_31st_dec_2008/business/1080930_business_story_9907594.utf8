The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi bails out Wachovia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Citi bails out Wachovia
                              Sigh of relief                            
	New York, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corp in a deal brokered by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).        
	Under the deal, struck in consultation with the US Federal Reserve, Treasury and President George W. Bush, Wachovia depositors will be fully protected and no cost to the deposit insurance fund is expected, the FDIC said.        
	Wachovia did not fail; rather, it is to be acquired by Citigroup on an open-bank basis with assistance from the FDIC, the agency said.        
	It said it would share losses with Citi on certain Wachovia loans.        
	The FDIC has entered into a loss-sharing arrangement on a pre-identified pool of loans, the agency said.        
	Under the agreement, Citigroup will absorb up to $42 billion of losses on a $312-billion pool of loans.        
	The FDIC will absorb losses beyond that. Citigroup has granted the FDIC $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants to compensate the FDIC for bearing this risk.        
	Citigroup will buy the bulk of Wachovias assets, including five depository institutions, and assume its senior and subordinated debt.         
	Wachovia will retain ownership of AG Edwards, a big retail brokerage it bought a year ago, and its asset- management division, Evergreen. We will continue as a focused leader in retail brokerage and asset management, Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said.        
	It was not immediately known how much Citi was paying for the Wachovia assets.

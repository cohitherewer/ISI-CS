                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt push to power IPOs
          SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                                       
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: The government has put the initial public offering (IPO) of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and NHPC on the fast track and is contemplating the listing of other power utility firms as well.         
	KPMG has submitted its recommendations for the DVC flotation, while the NHPC float will take another three months.         
	I believe that all public sector companies should look at listing possibilities. We will study KPMGs final report on the DVC before deciding our future plans, said Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for power, commerce and industry.        
	According to Ramesh, other power utility firms which can be considered for listing are Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd, Tehri Hydro Development Corporation and the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation.         
	The listing will take place in a phased manner over the next two to two-and-a-half years.         
	Ramesh said, there were two ways of taking these firms to the capital markets  either by amending the act under which they were formed, which is a long drawn process, or by floating subsidiaries.         
	He said the government favoured the latter, adding that KPMG was examining options of whether the DVC subsidiary would be an umbrella company looking after some of the existing projects or whether it would float special purpose vehicles for each project.         
	NHPC, which received approval for the public issue in 2006, will hasten the process.         
	The company can sell up to 24 per cent of its stake. According to the initial plan, the IPO would comprise the sale of 10 per cent of fresh equity shares and 5 per cent disinvestment of government equity. NHPC plans to raise around Rs 1,700 crore from the public issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude retreats after spike
                                                                                                               Crude retreats after spike
                            
	London, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Oil retreated on Wednesday, a day after hitting a record high above $100 a barrel, as investors focused on a US report expected to show crude stockpiles rose for a sixth week.        
	US crude stocks were expected to rise by 2.3 million barrels. The US Energy Information Administration report will be released on Thursday, a day later than usual, because of Mondays holiday (Presidents Day).        
	Oil fell 65 cents to $99.36 a barrel by 1623 GMT, having risen nearly 5 per cent, or $4.51, to a record peak of $100.10 on Tuesday. London Brent crude fell $1.10 to $97.46.        
	Its a bit of a correction after the strong rally yesterday, said Christopher Bellew, senior vice president at Bache Commodities. It looks like its going to be a downward day today.         
	The latest peak for US crude was 1 cent above the previous record of $100.09 reached on January 3. Prices could rally further, but concerns remain that the slowing US economy could take a toll on demand, analysts said.        
	We could still go up a few more dollars, but I do not think its onwards and upwards, said Mike Wittner, oil analyst at Societe Generale.        
	The US is in an economic slowdown. We dont know how deep and for how long. The oil demand concerns are still there.        
	Strength in gas oil limited the decline for crude because of a tight market in Europe and cold weather, dealers said.

                                Can I deposit income tax in a bank in a different state in a different income tax circle/ward? Will the bank send the tax receipt challan to the circle/ward when the return is filed? Where can I get the challans? What are the income slabs for senior citizens above Rs 1.95 lakh?          S.K. Basu, Calcutta
                    You have to pay the tax using the appropriate challan mentioning your PAN and assessing officer code in the challan. The tax has to be deposited with the RBI or with the SBI, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank and other notified banks. You will have to collect challan forms from the income tax office. The cheque accompanying the challan has to be made payable to Name of Bank/Branch  a/c Income Tax in case the cheque is deposited in a branch different from where you have your account. It has to be payable to Yourselves  a/c Income Tax if the cheque is deposited in the branch where you have an account.

Land locked      I received a portion of vacant land from my father by a registered deed of gift in 2002. The valuation of the land was shown as nearly Rs 5 lakh in the deed. Now I want to sell the same at Rs 8 lakh. Do I have to pay any income tax on the sale value? If so, how much?        Tapas Kumar Roy, Sonarpur
                Yes, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the property. The tax will be calculated on the basis of the capital gains made, that is on Rs 3 lakh, the difference between the sale value and the acquisition cost of the property. The tax will be calculated either at a flat rate of 10 per cent or at 20 per cent if take the indexation benefit.                                   Mature instrument      My PPF account will mature soon. Will there be any tax on the maturity value? What will be the right instrument, such as single premium, unit-linked life insurance to park the fund so that the investment will not attract any tax?         S.K. Das, Garia
                There will be no tax on the maturity value of your PPF deposit. You can reinvest the deposit in PPF for a block of five years.

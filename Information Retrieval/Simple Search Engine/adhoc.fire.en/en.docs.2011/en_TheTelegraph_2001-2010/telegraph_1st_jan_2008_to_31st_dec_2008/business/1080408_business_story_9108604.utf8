The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hoteliers demand infrastructure status
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hoteliers demand infrastructure status
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                                                Not enough      
	New Delhi, April 7: Hoteliers, dissatisfied with the tax sops given to them in this years budget, are demanding infrastructure status, finance initiatives and extension of tax benefits for two- three- and four-star hotels.        
	The finance minister has not provided any support to attract finance to the sector. There will still be a shortage of rooms, said S.P. Jain, managing director of The Pride Hotels.        
	The hotel industry wants infrastructure status to procure easier financing, which will help it meet the required number of rooms.        
	According to the Federation of Hotel and Restaurants Association of India, the industry suffers from a shortfall of about one lakh rooms.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram proposed a five-year tax holiday for two- three- and four-star hotels in districts that have Unesco-declared World Heritage Sites in Budget 2008-09.         
	Moreover, the hotels should start operating between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2013.        
	Hoteliers said the tax holiday should have been extended to all budget hotels in Tier II and Tier III cities, since smaller cities are witnessing higher growth.        
	The budget failed to grant infrastructure status to the hospitality business, which we have been hoping since long.         
	Even the pending issue of depreciation on hotel buildings has remained unchanged, said Kamal Sharma, chief operating officer of Congentree Hotels and Resorts.        
	The tourism and hospitality industry has, however, welcomed the tax holiday proposed in this years budget.         
	They, however, argued that tax holidays should have been given on a pan-India basis.        
	Prabhat Pani, chief executive officer of Roots Corporation, a subsidiary of Indian Hotels Company Ltd, which operates Ginger Hotels, said, Although the tax holiday will be an impetus to set up hotels at the World Heritage Sites, we would rather look at destinations such as Aurangabad, Agra, Goa and Delhi, which have a steady flow of both leisure and business traffic.

	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Honda Motor Company plans to cash in on Indias free trade agreement (FTA) with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to make the companys local operations a key part of its global business.        
	The implementation of FTA will help the company realise its plans of sourcing components from India for its manufacturing sites in the Southeast Asian countries.        
	The FTA between India and the Asean will create new opportunities for our operations in India, especially in sharing components. With the trade pact, a lot of components can be sourced from India, and there will be a lot of possibilities for Indian vendors to supply to our global operations, said Fumihiko Ike, president and CEO of Asian Honda Motor Company. He said the present level of component sourcing was low.        
	Honda Siel Cars India today launched the third-generation Honda City, aimed at increasing the companys presence in the entry-level sedan segment.        
	The new City is priced between Rs 7.7 lakh and Rs 8.9 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).         
	Jnaneshwar Sen, vice-president (marketing) of Honda Siel, said, The sedan segment constitutes nearly 15-16 per cent of the total passenger car market, and we hope to capture good growth in this segment.         
	The company will phase out the older City by the end of this month. There are only a few left in our inventory and we hope to sell these by the end of this month, said Masahiro Takedagawa, president, Honda Siel.         
	Honda has sold about 2,34,800 units of the City in the country since its launch in 2003.         
	The City is one of the most successful car brands in the country and a global strategic model for India. With this launch, India will become the largest market for Honda City, Takedagawa said.        
	The company has recently introduced the car in Thailand.        
	At present, the car is being produced in seven countries and sold in 39 countries.

                                  I am a 60-years-old and an income tax payee. My son is an NRI and has an NRO account here. I want to gift him through the NRO account a part of my fixed deposit that are going to mature soon. Can I gift money through the NRO account? Is there any maximum limit that I can gift him? Should I record the gift on a stamp paper or will it suffice to make the declaration on a plain paper? Will my son have to file income tax return in India?            M. Sengupta, Calcutta
                    The legal status of a gift deed is equivalent to a contract and will be covered by the Contract Act. Declaration of a gift on a plain paper and without a witness is an invalid document in the eyes of the law. You will have to declare it on a stamp paper and get it registered with a sub-registrars office. You can gift any amount to your son through the NRO account. But he will have to pay income tax on the interest accruing to the deposit.                                  Tax query      I purchased 2,500 units of Stanchart Premier Equity Fund in 2005. If I now sell these units to the fund house directly, shall I have to pay long-term capital gains tax?        D. Tiwari, Calcutta
                    The particular scheme is investing more than 65 per cent of its corpus in equities of domestic companies. You are holding on to the investment for more than 12 months. Hence, you dont have to pay any capital gains tax.                      Daughter dear      I want to gift some money to my daughter who is married. How can I get exemption of income tax from that amount? Is it possible to get income tax exemption in a joint account where my daughter is the first applicant?        Monika Paul, Calcutta
                    Gifts received from any lineal ascendant are tax exempt. This means that the money that you propose to gift to your married daughter will be tax-free in her hands and not yours. You should ensure that the money that you want to gift her is out of your income (from profession, salary, property or investment) and you have paid the liable income tax thereon.

	New Delhi/Calcutta, June 16: Banks  both public and private  are jacking up fixed deposit rates to remain competitive in the face of rising inflation that is eating into the real earnings of depositors.        
	Private lender Yes Bank today altered its deposit rates by 50 basis points.         
	Yes Bank managing director and CEO Rana Kapoor said, For all existing and potential customers, the interest rate on fixed deposits for one year and one day has been increased from 9 per cent to 9.5 per cent.        
	Calcutta-based United Bank of India (UBI) raised its interest rates by 25 to 75 basis points on fixed deposits for more than one year and up to five years.         
	The bank will now offer a maximum of 8.75 per cent for deposits above two years but below three years, up from 8 per cent. Fixed deposits between one and two years will now fetch interest of 8.5 per cent against 8 per cent earlier. For deposits above three years, the rate has been increased to 8.5 per cent from 8.25 per cent.        
	For now, we have increased deposit rates for certain maturity brackets while keeping the prime lending rate unchanged, said UBI chairman P.K. Gupta at a banking conclave organised by the eastern regional council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Calcutta today.         
	If inflation is at 8.75 per cent and one-year deposit rate is just 8 per cent, customers may not be interested in parking their funds in bank deposits, Vijaya Bank chief Prakash P. Mallya, told The Telegraph.         
	Mallya, however, said the bank would wait for the July review of RBI credit policy before taking a call on hiking deposit rates. He expects the Reserve Bank to raise the cash reserve ratio (CRR), or the portion of deposits that banks keep with the central bank, in the next credit policy.         
	In the last two months, RBI has raised CRR by 75 basis points to 8.25 per cent in an attempt to control inflationary expectations. PNB executive director J.M. Garg feels banks cannot keep deposit rates low as inflation is eating into the real earnings of customers.

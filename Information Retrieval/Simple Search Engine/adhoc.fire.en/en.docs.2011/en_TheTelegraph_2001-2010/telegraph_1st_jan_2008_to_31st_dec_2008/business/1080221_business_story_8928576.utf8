                                                                                                               TCS bags $120m deal from Chrysler 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has bagged a $120-million multi-year contract from the US-based Chrysler LLC to provide a comprehensive portfolio of IT services.         
	Chrysler LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chrysler Holdings LLC, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP and Daimler AG.        
	TCS will use its global network delivery model to offer application maintenance and support services to Chrysler.         
	The IT services initiative will encompass a portion of the functional areas within Chrysler, such as sales and marketing and shared services, TCS said in a statement.        
	This growing partnership is a testament to TCSs capabilities which continue to help customers in their business transformation by providing innovative IT services, said N. Chandrasekaran, executive director and chief operating officer of TCS.        
	TCS has done work with Chrysler before and this is another deal that they have won from them, said a market analyst. Chrysler LLC consists of Chrysler Motors Company LLC and its subsidiary, Chrysler Canada Inc.         
	TCS is betting big on the automotive industry, which is part of its manufacturing vertical. The vertical accounted for 15.1 per cent of its $4.3-billion global revenues in 2007. TCS provides services to many original equipment manufacturers and Tier I companies in North America, Europe and Japan.         
	In its third quarter results announced earlier this year, the company attributed its growth to a slew of significant deals across sectors, strong traction in services and an impressive pipeline of projects across geographies.         
	TCS has 25 deals in its kitty worth over $50 million. One-third of these deals are from North America and another one-third from Europe.

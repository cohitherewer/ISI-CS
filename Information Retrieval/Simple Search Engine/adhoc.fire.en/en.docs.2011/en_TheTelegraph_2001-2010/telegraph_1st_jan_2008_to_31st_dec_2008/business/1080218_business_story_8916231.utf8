                                                                                                               Ramky Haldia plan kicks off

	Calcutta, Feb. 17: Hyderabad-based Ramky Infrastructure Ltd has started work on its proposed pharmaceutical and chemical park in Haldia.        
	The company has received a 250-acre plot from the Haldia Development Authority (HDA) for the park, which is expected to expand to 2,500 acres over time.        
	The local authority has promised to hand over at least 650 acres for the project, originally conceived as a pharmaceutical special economic zone (SEZ).        
	The violence over the chemical hub at Nandigram had stalled the projects progress, but the company has now decided to ignore the possibility of any opposition to its plans.        
	The state government had agreed to this SEZ in-principle, and it was to be developed along with the Salim groups chemical hub and multipurpose SEZ.        
	The three projects were to be part of a petroleum, chemical and petrochemical investment region, which was originally planned to be spread over Haldia and Nandigram. The petroleum hub will now come up at Nayachar and in Haldia. The government started work on the chemical zone this Friday.        
	Ramky, which has a pharmaceutical hub in Visakhapatnam, is not seeking SEZ status for its project right now as it plans to scale up slowly.        
	We will complete the SEZ formalities only after getting the total 2,500 acres, chairman and managing director Ayodhya Rami Reddy said.         
	The project will start off with common infrastructure and ready facilities for smaller pharmaceutical firms. Ramky will develop the site and basic infrastructure and invite major pharmaceutical companies to set up units.        
	We are carrying out a detailed project report for the initial stage, Reddy added.        
	Ramky has filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India and is in the process of setting up a joint venture company with the HDA for the pharmaceutical park. It will hold 89 per cent share in the company with the HDA holding the rest of the equity.        
	The project was initially estimated to cost Rs 950 crore. The first phase will require an investment of Rs 95 crore. However, the actual cost will be known only after the completion of the detailed project report.        
	The 250-acre plot has been leased out to Ramky for 90 years. The HDA asked for Rs 10 lakh per acre. It will also charge a token rent, which will initially be Rs 2,500 per acre every year and increase 5 per cent annually.        
	Construction of the first 250 acres of the park will be completed by December 2010. The initial development will be over approximately 150 acres.        
	The pharmaceutical units will use intermediates generated by chemical and petrochemical firms in Haldia.

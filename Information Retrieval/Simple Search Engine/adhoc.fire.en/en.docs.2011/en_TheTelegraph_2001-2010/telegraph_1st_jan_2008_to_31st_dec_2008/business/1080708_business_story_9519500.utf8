The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recycled oil blocks a headache
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Recycled oil blocks a headache
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          LEFT IN THE LURCH                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: The response to the seventh round of new exploration licensing policy (Nelp VII) was generally lukewarm. However, the worst fate was in store for blocks in the Gujarat-Saurashtra region, the Krishna Godavari basin, onshore Bengal and the Ganga valley, all of which found no takers.        
	We will analyse data on why these blocks did not get any response, said V.K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons. These blocks were recycled as they were either returned by the bidders or did not evoke any response in the previous rounds.        
	A total of 181 bids were received from 96 companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries, Essar Oil, British Petroleum and BHP Billiton for the 45 of the 57 oil blocks on offer.        
	There were no takers for the four deep-water blocks in the Gujarat-Saurashtra region.        
	One block in the gas-rich Krishna Godavari basin did not find any bidder. The countrys richest gas reserves have been discovered in this region, and gas is expected to flow for commercial use later this year.        
	The data also showed that onland blocks in Bengals Murshidabad, Birbhum and Burdwan did not evoke interest among bidders. So did the two blocks in the Ganga Valley  the Purbi-Champaran-Paschim and the Champaran-Gopalganj-Siwan regions.        
	Energy analysts said exploration firms had concentrated only on those blocks which had good geological data. Almost half of the blocks have been won by the ONGC alone or in a consortium, indicating that private players were cautious in their approach.        
	Raghvendra Upadhya of Infraline Energy Research said, Several factors were responsible for the subdued response to Nelp VII and the lack of response towards some of the blocks.        
	As the country was competing against blocks in energy-rich nations of Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, the response that Indian blocks got is not all that bad, he said.        
	Observers said most global majors refrained from bidding, the only exception being BHP Billiton and British Petroleum.

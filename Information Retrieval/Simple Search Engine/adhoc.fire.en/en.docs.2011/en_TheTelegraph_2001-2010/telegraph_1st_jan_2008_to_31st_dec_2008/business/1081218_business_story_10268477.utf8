          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Japans No. 2 car maker Honda has shelved plans for capacity expansion at its Rajasthan plant for two years and cut production at its Greater Noida facility.         
	The new assembly line in Rajasthan was initially scheduled to be set up by 2009-end. It has been deferred in view of the current economic slowdown, which has impacted the automobile industry, resulting in a drop in demand, said Jnaneswar Sen, marketing head, Honda Siel Cars India. Honda makes cars in a joint venture with the Siel group.        
	The company had earmarked Rs 1,000 crore for the Rajasthan plant, of which Rs 600 crore has been invested.         
	Sen said the production at Noida would be reduced because of negative growth in the domestic automobile industry. Honda had expanded capacity at its Greater Noida facility to one lakh units per year.         
	We are closely monitoring the market situation and will adjust monthly production volumes to respond to market demands, while ensuring operational efficiencies and low inventory levels, he said.         
	In Tokyo, Honda Motor issued its third profit warning this year, slashing its operating forecast by two-thirds as the global recession batters car sales and sends the yen soaring.

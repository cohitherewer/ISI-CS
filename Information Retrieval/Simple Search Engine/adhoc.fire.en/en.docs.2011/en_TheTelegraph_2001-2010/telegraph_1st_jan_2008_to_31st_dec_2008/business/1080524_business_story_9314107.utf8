	Calcutta, May 23: The eastern zonal office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is aiming to sell 52,50,000 policies this fiscal.        
	The office also plans to earn a premium income of Rs 5,500 crore from new policy sales in 2008-09 compared with Rs 4,102 crore in 2007-08.         
	The public sector insurer expects at least one-third of its targeted premium income from new policy sales to come from Money Plus 1, a unit-linked endowment plan launched two days ago.         
	Money Plus 1 replaces the popular Money Plus, which the insurer stopped selling in August last year.         
	The LIC also closed another market-linked pension plan, Market Plus, in March this year.         
	Well launch two to three plans, including a pension plan, this fiscal. We expect these new plans to increase our first-year premium income by 30 per cent, said R.R. Dash, zonal manager (eastern zone) of the LIC.        
	The insurer said the fund size under both the Money Plus and the Market Plus plans grew too large to manage, which forced it to close the schemes. Moreover, agents could not sell these two unit-linked plans properly.        
	Money Plus and Market Plus sold largely on single premium mode and the plans contributed more than 50 per cent to the insurers premium income from new businesses from the eastern region.         
	Money Plus 1 doesnt have a single premium option. However, a policyholder gets two years to revive the policy that has lapsed for a discontinued premium.        
	The eastern zone has done relatively better compared with other regions. In 2007-08, we generated a surplus of Rs 6,193 crore compared with Rs 4,102 crore in the previous year, said Dash.

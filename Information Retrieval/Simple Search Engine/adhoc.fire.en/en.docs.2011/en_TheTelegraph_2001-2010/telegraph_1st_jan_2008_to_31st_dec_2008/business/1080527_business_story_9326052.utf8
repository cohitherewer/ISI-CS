                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       R-Com, MTN shut out rival bids
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, May 26: Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications has opened talks with MTN of South Africa  the largest telecom operator in sub-Saharan Africa  to find a way to create a $66-billion behemoth by market capitalisation that would rank among the 10 largest mobile operators in the world.        
	Sources said the two sides started talks at an undisclosed location in Europe on Saturday to put together a potential business combination.        
	The discussions will take place over the next 45 days, opening an exclusivity window during which neither party can hold talks with any other telecom player.        
	However, the deal between R-Com and MTN will be different from the discussions that the Johannesburg-based telecom operator held with Bharti Airtel, which centred on a possible merger of the two companies.        
	Officials said the alliance between R-Com and MTN could see the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in which both companies would hold a stake. Alternatively, they could swap about 10 per cent equity with each other.        
	The two companies could also combine some of their businesses in the field of undersea cable connectivity.         
	Flag Telecom, part of Reliance Globalcom and an R-Com subsidiary, is building a terabit cable from Egypt to Africa connecting seven to eight countries along the way. MTN could provide R-Com the last-mile link in Africa, which is a bandwidth-deficient region, said an official.        
	R-Com could also look to partner MTN in Africa in passive infrastructure sharing, sources suggested.         
	The structure and cost of the combine will be thrashed out in later meetings.        
	MTN has been approached by the Reliance Communications with regard to a potential business combination between Reliance Communications and MTN. MTN has agreed to enter into exclusive negotiations for a period of up to 45 days in respect to such potential combination. There is no certainty that these discussions will result in a transaction, the African major said in a filing with the Johannesburg stock exchange today.        
	It also informed the exchange that MTN and Bharti were unable to reach agreement on a suitable transaction structure and ended their discussion by mutual agreement.        
	Meanwhile, R-Com said the negotiations were currently taking place and an announcement would be made when appropriate.         
	It is to be noted that there is no certainty either on completion, or the timing of the said proposal. In the meantime, shareholders are advised to exercise caution in their dealings in the companies securities dealings until a further announcement is made, it said.        
	R-Com chairman Anil Ambani said, We are delighted to be engaged in exclusive negotiations with the MTN Group to achieve a partnership, which would provide investors, customers and the people of both companies a unique and global platform for exponential growth, creating substantial long-term shareholder value.        
	Market watchers, however, said R-Com did not have the financial clout to acquire a company like MTN.        
	Stock trend        
	The R-Com stock fell by Rs 29.10 or 5.08 per cent during the day to close at Rs 543.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	On the Johannesburg stock exchange, the MTN stock tumbled by 7.6 per cent.

	New Delhi, Jan. 10 (PTI): Bajaj Auto will increase its stake in Austrian sports bike maker KTM to 25 per cent by investing around Rs 300 crore.
    
	The two-wheeler maker also plans to bring KTMs racing cars and high-performance bikes to India.
    
	Bajaj will increase its stake in KTM to 25 per cent from 20.9 per cent in the next few months and launch two high-performance KTM bikes for the Indian market this year, Bajaj auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj said.
    
	S. Ravikumar, vice-president (business development) of Bajaj Auto, said when the company picked up the 25 per cent stake in KTM, it would have invested nearly Rs 600 crore.
    
	On the planned launches, Bajaj said KTMs two models  the 1190 RC8 and the 690 Duke  would be rolled out by the middle of this year. 
    
	On the prices of the bikes, Bajaj refused to give details. 
    
	I cannot share the exact price at the moment, but rest assured it is going to be higher than one of the cheapest cars launched at the Auto Expo today, he said.

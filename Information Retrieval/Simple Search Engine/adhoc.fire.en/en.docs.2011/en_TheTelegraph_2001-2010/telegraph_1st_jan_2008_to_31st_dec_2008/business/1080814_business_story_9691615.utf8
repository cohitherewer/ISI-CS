                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rights issue rules relaxed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today relaxed rules to make it easier for companies to raise money through rights issues and qualified institutional placements (QIPs).        
	It brought down the time limit to complete a rights issue to around 43 days from 109 days and lowered the date for determining the floor price for a QIP issue to two weeks from six months at present.        
	The decisions were taken at a board meeting of the market regulator held today.        
	The measures are expected to help both investors and companies. For India Inc, the decisions will enable it to raise resources faster at a time when banks have started winching up interest rates.        
	The decisions will also benefit investors as the shares will be priced closer to current market prices.        
	In the case of a rights issue, Sebi said the number of days for the notice period for a board meeting would be reduced from seven days to two working days.        
	The notice period for the record date will be cut to seven working days for all scrips from around 30 in some cases now. The record date determines the investors who will be eligible for the rights .        
	Shorter timelines would reduce the market risk faced by investors, Sebi chairman C. B. Bhave told reporters.        
	According to Prime Database, mobilisation of resources through rights issues recorded a huge increase in 2007-08. Prithvi Haldea of Prime said a record Rs 32,518 crore was raised  778 per cent higher than Rs 3,703 crore that was raised in 2006-07.         
	A subdued secondary market has dampened enthusiasm for rights issues in the current fiscal. Still, Prime Database says 20 companies, including Tata Motors and Hindalco, have either already applied for or have obtained Sebi approval to raise Rs 1,855 crore.         
	QIP norms        
	Sebi also revised the norms for QIP and preferential allotments.        
	Under the current regulations, the floor price for issuing securities depends on the higher of two averages: the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the shares during the two weeks or six months preceding the relevant date.        
	The relevant date is taken as 30 days prior to the date when shareholders meeting is held to approve the issue.        
	The Sebi board decided to revise the pricing norms for QIPs and preferential allotments under which the floor price will now be linked to the two weeks average for making a QIP or for making a preferential allotment to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).        
	Moreover, the relevant date for the QIP issue shall be the date on which the board of the company or a committee of directors authorised by the board of the company meets to take a decision on the issue.        
	Experts said companies could now expect a better response to their issues, as the issue price will be closely aligned to the current market price.        
	Sebi also modified Clause 41 of the listing agreement giving companies with a large number of subsidiaries more time to submit consolidated results.        
	Companies will now be allowed to submit their consolidated results two months after the end of the quarter instead of one month at present.        
	Sebi also made some changes in scheme-wise annual reports sent by mutual funds to unit holders  it has reduced the time period for dispatching such reports from six months to four months.

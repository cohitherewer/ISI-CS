The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum panel to fix norms

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Call waiting                                  
	New Delhi, June 29: A panel formed by the department of telecommunications (DoT) to recommend the methodology for the allocation and pricing of second generation (2G) spectrum for mobile services would be meeting for the first time this week.        
	The government wants to finalise the spectrum pricing and allocation policy by July. The panel was formed on June 23.        
	The 2G spectrum allocation process has been mired in controversy with some operators suggesting that beyond the start-up spectrum, operators should pay for the additional amount of the scarce resource. The DoT is exploring the possibility of auctioning additional spectrum to existing operators.        
	At present, on paying a licence fee, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4 megahertz (Mhz) and 2.5 Mhz, respectively, of spectrum per circle to launch operations. Licence conditions also provide for the allotment of GSM spectrum of up to 6.2 Mhz, on getting a certain number of subscribers.        
	Auction route        
	There is a suggestion to treat 6.2 Mhz GSM spectrum as threshold and allot spectrum beyond this through auction. But this would amount to a change in existing guidelines and appropriate amendments would be necessary after this approach is approved in-principle, said DoT officials.         
	The panel, headed by DoTs additional secretary Subhod Kumar and comprising other senior officials from the department besides professors from IITs and IIMs, is expected to recommend an appropriate auction mechanism for additional spectrum.        
	The finance and law ministries have repeatedly called for the auction of spectrum to both new entrants and existing operators.         
	However, explaining the logic for auctioning only additional spectrum and not start-up spectrum, the DoT said, Considering that the allotment of initial spectrum is linked with the telecom service licence for which an operator pays an entry fee, the auctioning of initial spectrum is not feasible.         
	Demand-supply analysis        
	The new panel will also assess the demand for spectrum for GSM, CDMA and 3G services based on the projected growth of the telecom industry and the availability of radio waves. The committee is also expected to recommend steps to bridge the gap between the availability and demand for spectrum through re-farming and other technological methods.         
	It will also make recommendations on the transfer of spectrum in mergers and acquisitions as also in the case of the use of spectrum of one licensee by another through transfer, sub-licensing and otherwise. The other terms of reference include the norms to be followed for rewarding players for the efficient use of spectrum along with penalties for poor use.

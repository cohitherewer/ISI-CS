          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: State-run banks want the Congress-led government to pay interest on reimbursement promised to them for the Rs 70,000-crore farm loan write off announced in this years budget.         
	The government is supposed to pay the banks around Rs 25,000 crore as the first tranche of reimbursement this year but has not done so because a supplementary demand for part of the sum is yet to be voted in the Parliament.         
	Banks have suggested that they be compensated on payment of farm debt waiver, financial sector secretary Arun Ramanathan said after a meeting of finance minister P. Chidambaram with the chiefs of regional rural bank (RRB).         
	Officials said since the Parliaments session was starting late, it might not be possible to reimburse the banks before October-end.         
	Parliament has already voted around Rs 10,000 crore towards reimbursing the banks for the loan waiver from the 2007-08 budget. Another Rs 15,000 crore will be voted as a supplementary to this years (2008-09) budget.         
	Another tranche of Rs 15,000 crore will be paid from budget 2009-10, which the Congress government is entitled to present as a vote-on-account. This implies that within 14 months the government will have funded two thirds of the loan waiver. The remainder is to be funded in the next few years.         
	The bankers told Chidambaram that they were facing a liquidity crunch because of the delay in reimbursing the loan waiver and consequently were unable to provide credit to farmers.        
	The RBI and Nabard have been asked to look into the matter so that the banks do not face fund shortage, the minister told the bankers.

	New Delhi, Sept. 4: The countrys foreign debt jumped 30.3 per cent to $221.2 billion at the end of March, mainly because of the fall in the value of the dollar against major currencies.        
	Valuation change because of the weakening of the US dollar vis--vis other major international currencies accounted for almost 20 per cent of the increment in total external debt during the year, the finance ministry said in a status report on external debt.        
	In rupee terms, the increase in external debt during 2007-08 was lower at 19.6 per cent as the Indian currency appreciated against the dollar.        
	However, the countrys debt stock, which includes government borrowings from international lenders as well as corporate debt, increased on account of a rise in external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term loans.        
	While ECBs rose 39.5 per cent, short-term debt was up 34.8 per cent, the report said.

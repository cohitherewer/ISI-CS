	Calcutta, Dec. 16: Bank fixed deposits may not yield more than 8 per cent interest from January. Public sector banks are contemplating a cut in deposit as well as lending rates beginning next year.         
	In an interactive session with the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today, Uco Bank chairman and managing director Subodh K. Goel said, Deposit rates are likely to come down in January next year to 7 to 8 per cent, but not below that. Banks will also reduce their lending rates in tandem with deposit rates. In fact, beginning next year you shall see a significant change in the interest rate situation.        
	The city-based public sector bank may reduce its deposit and lending rates by a percentage point or more. Our board meeting is scheduled for December 26 and well take a call on an interest rate reduction then. Rate cuts will most likely be effective from January 1 next year, he said.         
	A number of public sector banks have already reduced their peak deposit rate of 10.50 per cent offered under special deposit schemes by 50 to 75 basis points with effect from December. One basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point.         
	State-run Indian Bank had reduced its deposit rates across different maturities by 25 to 150 basis points from December 15. The maximum rate of interest that the bank now offers is 9.25 per cent on deposits of more than two years but less than five years.         
	Last week, Union Bank had slashed its benchmark prime lending rate by 75 basis points to 12.5 per cent.

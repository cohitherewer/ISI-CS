	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Vodafone Essar plans to invest around Rs 24,000 crore over the next three years to expand its Indian operations. We shall invest $2 billion annually for the next three years in our Indian operations, said Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin.
 
	The funds will be spent on setting up telecom towers, mobile retail shops and advertisements, he added. 
 
	Vodafone, which plans to launch a slew of services by the end of the year, aims to increase its subscriber base to 100 million by 2010 from 40 million now. 
 
	This investment will help us to cover more rural areas, Sarin said on the sidelines of a meeting between industry leaders and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. 
 
	The company will also provide lower call rates, better handsets and value-added services, he added.
 
	On whether there was any plan to launch an initial public offering (IPO), Sarin said, We first want to consolidate and strengthen our position in the Indian market before thinking of initiating an IPO.
 
	Thinking of an IPO will be a bit premature. We have to run the business really well. How it gets capitalised in the future is something that we will examine later, he added.
 
	Sarin considers India, Turkey and South Africa as extremely important markets because they can provide Vodafone with a much-needed growth opportunity. 
 
	The company is facing saturation and stagnation in most countries where it is operating now. 
 
	Indias tele-density is just over 20 per cent, with only 60 per cent of its population having access to telephones.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 15: SingTel Australia Holding of Singapore has got the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to set up a joint venture in India for offering national and international long-distance services.        
	SingTel will hold up to 74 per cent stake in the joint venture entity.         
	SingTels proposal attracts Press Note 1 because the Singapore telecom firm holds 15.6 per cent in Bharti Airtel and 32.81 per cent in Bharti Telecom Ltd.         
	Bharti, which already has national and international long-distance operations in India, had given its no-objection certificate to the SingTel joint venture.         
	According to the SingTel application, involving an estimated foreign direct investment of around Rs 48 lakh, Bharti would also hold under 10 per cent stake in the new entity.

	Calcutta, Feb. 4: Ispat Industries plans to spin off its captive jetty into a separate entity and bring in a strategic investor.
    
	The company runs a 10-million-tonne (mt) bulk cargo handling terminal at Dharamtar in Maharashtra to import coking coal and iron ore.
    
	It has appointed Mott MacDonald to carry out the valuation of the business. The market estimates the value of the facility at $1 billion.
    
	The Pramod and Vinod Mittal-owned company, which runs a 3mt steel plant at Dolvi, close to the jetty, has already approached the Maharashtra Maritime Board to expand the terminal.
    
	It intends to turn the terminal into a full-fledged port having handling capacity of 25mt.
    
	This will call for significant investment on the part of Ispat, straining its already weak balancesheet.
    
	After the jetty is spun off into a new entity, with a strategic investor holding a majority stake, the funding requirement from Ispat will come down.
    
	The move is aimed at unlocking value from the non-core business. Ispat will also benefit if the jetty is expanded, sources said.
    
	Ispat plans to increase the capacity of the Dolvi plant to 5mt in the next three years. This necessitates more facilities at the jetty to handle the enhanced capacity.
    
	The company will also put up a coke oven unit and a pellet plant at Dolvi to support steel making operations.
    
	The new investor will also bring in knowledge about the port business.
    
	After it gets a nod from the maritime board, Ispat will approach the Union shipping ministry for clearances.

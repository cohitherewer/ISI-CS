The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loss-hit Sony lists growth drivers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Loss-hit Sony lists growth drivers
                                              Nobuyuki Oneda in Tokyo on Wednesday. (AP)		    
	Tokyo, May 14 (Reuters): Sony Corp posted a surprise quarterly loss today after a weak stock market ate into the value of securities held by its financial arm, but it forecast a bigger-than-expected profit this year as it boosts sales of digital cameras and flat TVs.        
	Sony, locked in a three-way battle with Microsoft Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd in the game industry, has been able to narrow losses on the PlayStation 3 game console by cutting manufacturing costs and expanding sales.        
	The electronics and entertainment conglomerate has also enjoyed strong sales of Cyber-shot digital cameras, VAIO PCs and handheld video cameras, helping push its operating profit up more than five-fold in the business year that ended on March 31.        
	Considering that Sony was operating under adverse economic conditions, including a strong yen, both the results and outlook seem to show that Sonys stamina has grown stronger, quot; said Kazuhara Miura, an analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research.        
	It suffered an operating loss of 4.7 billion yen ($45 million) in January-March, an improvement from a 113-billion-yen loss a year earlier but short of an average estimate of a 27.3-billion-yen profit from five analysts. The fourth-quarter loss was due mainly to a slide in the value of stocks and convertible bonds held by its financial division.        
	Sony said it expected operating profit to grow 20 per cent to 450 billion yen in the year to March 2009, beating the market consensus of 428.5 billion yen. It sees revenues rising 1 per cent to 9 trillion yen.        
	Japanese exporters, including Sony, are facing tough business conditions this year because of a firmer yen, rising raw material prices and signs of a slowdown in the global economy.         
	Sony aims to sell 17 million liquid crystal display TVs in the year to next March, up from 10.6 million in the year just ended. That compares with Sharp Corps target to sell 10 million LCD TVs and Matsushitas plans to sell 11 million flat TVs.        
	The business environment is not so good but we will generate sales growth from LCD TVs, Sony chief financial officer Nobuyuki Oneda told a news conference.        
	In a bid to secure enough display panels for its Bravia LCD TVs, Sony plans to take a one-third stake in Sharps 380-billion-yen LCD panel plant set for completion by March 2010.        
	It will also be building a new LCD panel production line with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sonys partner in panel production but its arch rival in retail outlets.        
	For the full year that ended on March 31, operating profit surged to 374.5 billion yen from 71.8 billion yen, helped by smaller losses and one-off gains from the sale of part of its former headquarters site and chip-making facilities.        
	But the result still missed Sonys own forecast in January of 410 billion yen.

	Mumbai, May 2: Reliance Power (RPower), an Anil Ambani group firm, has acquired three coal mines in Indonesia. These mines have total reserves of around 2 billion tonnes, and the company will invest close to $1 billion in developing them.        
	RPowers wholly owned subsidiary, Reliance Coal Resources, closed the deal. According to the agreement, the payment will be linked to the actual production of coal and no amount will be paid up front.        
	Reliance Coal Resources has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 per cent economic interest in three coal concessions in Indonesia, the company said.        
	The mines, spread over 40,000 hectares, are Srivijaya Bintangtiga Energy, Bryayan Bintangtiga Energy and Sugico Pendragon Energy in the South Sumatra area of Indonesia.        
	The coal reserves will be used by RPower for its Krishnapattanam mega power project, the 1,200MW Shahpur project in Maharashtra and other large power projects. Sources said the reserves would fuel 10,000MW of power. The Krishnapatnam project will go onstream by September 2013. The coal required for the project is estimated at 14 million tonnes.        
	News of the acquisition saw RPower shares closing positive on the stock exchanges today.         
	On the BSE, the scrip finished at Rs 396.75, a gain of 0.62 per cent over its last close after hitting an intra-day high of Rs 404.35.        
	RPower was established to develop, construct and operate power projects in India and overseas.

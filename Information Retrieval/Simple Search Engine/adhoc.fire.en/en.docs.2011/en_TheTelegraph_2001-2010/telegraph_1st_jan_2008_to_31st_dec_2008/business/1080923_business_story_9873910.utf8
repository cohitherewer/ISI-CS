          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The government today relaxed external commercial borrowing norms by allowing infrastructure companies to bring in $500 million for rupee expenditure against the present limit of $100 million.        
	It also allowed companies to borrow at a maximum rate 4.5 per cent above the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for seven-year loans against 3.5 per cent now.         
	Six-month Libor stood at 3.02 per cent today. A higher interest rate means foreign entities will be keen on lending more to Indian companies.        
	Considering the huge funding requirements, particularly for meeting rupee expenditure, it has been decided to enhance the existing limit, the finance ministry said.        
	It said that borrowings in excess of $100 million should have a minimum average maturity of seven years.        
	Companies going for external commercial borrowings with a maturity of three to five years will have to arrange such funds up to two per cent above Libor, same as is the case now.        
	The finance ministry also retained the interest ceiling for external commercial borrowings of more than five years and up to seven years at 3.5 per cent above Libor.        
	However, it did not change the existing ECB norms for companies other than infrastructure firms.         
	They would have to continue to bring in only up to $50 million into India for rupee expenditure, with prior permission of the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Tabs on crisis        
	Ashok Chawla, secretary, department of economic affairs, today said the unfolding global financial crisis calls for vigil on part of the government and all regulatory agencies.         
	According to Chawla, there was very little scope for the government to manoeuvre domestic interest rates.         
	The government had last year imposed curbs on ECBs following the appreciation of the rupee.

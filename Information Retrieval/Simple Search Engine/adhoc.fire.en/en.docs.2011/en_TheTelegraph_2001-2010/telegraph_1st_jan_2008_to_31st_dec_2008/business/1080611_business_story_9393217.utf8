          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 10: Ruchi Realty Holdings Pvt Ltd will invest Rs 1,200 crore in the next three years to build townships, residential complexes and IT parks.        
	Ruchi Realty is part of the $4-billion Ruchi group having business interests in diverse areas such as soya, dairy, edible oil products, steel and infrastructure. We have earmarked around Rs 800 crore for the eastern region. Two of our main projects  the Rs 450-crore residential complex and the Rs 150-crore IT park  will be developed in Calcutta. We are currently looking at Jamshedpur and Bhubaneswar to set up business hotels which will have over 150 rooms and entail an investment between Rs 75 crore and Rs 100 crore, said Manish Shahra, managing director of Ruchi Realty.        
	The company will fund 30 per cent of the Rs 1,200 crore through internal accruals, 30 per cent through debts and 20 per cent through receivables from existing projects.         
	The balance will be funded by the US-based private equity firm Sun Apollo, which will pick up a stake of between 25 per cent and 49 per cent in the township projects. These townships will be spread over 100 acres on an average. Ruchi is planning such projects in Bhopal and Indore and is exploring opportunities in Raipur and Nagpur.

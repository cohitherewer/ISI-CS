          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 6: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today moved the Supreme Court challenging Allahabad High Courts stay on its order to ban Sahara groups para-banking company from accepting fresh deposits.        
	The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court yesterday stayed the RBI ban, following a plea by Sahara India Financial Corporations (SIFCL) executive director .P. Srivastava.        
	The RBI order was passed in public interestto protect the interests of the depositors  but the high court stayed it without even giving the RBI an opportunity to present its case, central bank counsel T.R. Andhyarujina said.         
	Earlier in the day, Andhyarujina had placed the RBIs plea before a vacation bench for immediate permission to file an appeal. The high court order will have a disastrous effect, he argued.         
	The court permitted him to file the appeal and also allowed the Sahara group to file a caveat  which implies that the company would have to be necessarily heard before any order is passed by the court.         
	The RBI had cited several violations on SIFCLs part justifying its decision. It had also asked the company to repay existing deposits as and when they mature.

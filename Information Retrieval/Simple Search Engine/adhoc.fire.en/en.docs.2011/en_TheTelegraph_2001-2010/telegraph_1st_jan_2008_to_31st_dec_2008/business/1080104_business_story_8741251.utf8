     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
             Deora: Thinking hard
                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The government is mulling various options on fuel prices, including price hikes and changes in taxes, in the wake of the global price of crude touching $100 per barrel.
    
	Oil minister Murli Deora said, Price hike is not the only solution. Others, such as an excise duty cut on auto fuel, as suggested by the Left, are also being considered. My endeavour will be to get a decision this month. 
    
	Crude at $100 is of concern for India as the country imports 70 per cent of its crude requirements. 
    
	The Indian basket of crude was at a record high of $92.29 per barrel on Wednesday.
    
	We are very much concerned at crude oil crossing $100. This will trigger search for alternatives and we will also press for energy conservation to cut our reliance on imported oil, Deora said.
    
	Ahead of the meeting of the group of ministers on fuel prices, Deora has discussed the situation with the Left parties who have opposed a hike in fuel prices.
    
	A decision on prices is a two-step process. First, the group of ministers, which is expected to meet later this month, comes at a decision on prices. This then goes to the cabinet for its approval.
    
	On prices, Sarthak Behuria, chairman of the Indian Oil Corporation, today said, We need a lasting solution, not ad hoc responses. The government should free pricing of petrol and diesel from its control and subsidise domestic LPG and kerosene from the budget.
    
	He said the company would sell bonds worth Rs 2,000 crore this month to tide itself over the financial crunch due to the non-revision of fuel prices.

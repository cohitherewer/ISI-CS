          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 26: The tottering rupee could tumble to a level between 52 and 53 to the dollar if capital flows remain tight.        
	Last Friday, the rupee plunged to a historic low of 50.15 against the dollar before clawing back to 49.98 at the close of trading. If there are more outflows, the rupee will breach the 50-mark again. It could then go down to as low as 53 in the next two months, said Ashish Parthasarathy, deputy treasurer at HDFC Bank.         
	Others feel the same way, notably Peter Redward, the Singapore-based head of research for Barclays Bank, who forecast that the rupee would weaken by 6 per cent to an all-time low of 52 to the dollar by the year-end.        
	The biggest factor that is weighing on the rupee is dollar outflow as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are selling stocks and taking the money out of the country. The FIIs have sold stocks worth over $11 billion till date. The worry is that they do not plan to halt stock sales.        
	At the same time, exporters are not bringing their earnings immediately into the country. They are holding their dollars abroad in anticipation that the rupee will weaken. There is also a huge demand for dollars from importers who fear that the US greenback can appreciate further.        
	All these factors have led to a huge gap between the demand and supply of dollars, skewing the exchange rate further.        
	The global financial institutions will continue to de-leverage in the near to medium term. Emerging markets, including India, will lead this process, resulting in more domestic liquidity pressures.         
	Market rumours indicate that we can witness a record outflow because of hedge fund redemptions.         
	Hedge funds have sizeable investments in Indian equities and are likely to be large sellers in the local markets, warns a report from HDFC Bank.        
	While deleveraging, these entities trim the debt exposures that they had taken to grow quickly. They do so by selling off shares in emerging markets such as India to unwind their debt positions in other markets, especially the US.        
	On Friday, the rupee recovered after hitting a historic low following aggressive intervention by the Reserve Bank of India. The central bank is believed to have pumped in at least $3 billion to prop up the faltering rupee.        
	Experts say that though the RBI intervention can limit the Indian currencys fall, it will continue to hover around the 50 mark.         
	A depreciating rupee has a varied impact on the economy. Exporters will benefit as they will get more rupees for their dollar earnings, but imports will become expensive.         
	Those travelling abroad also stand to lose as they will have to shell out more rupees to buy dollars.        
	The IT, BPO and garment exporters are just a few sectors that stand to gain from the fall in the rupees value. Analysts say that for every one per cent fall in the rupees value, the operating margins of IT companies will go up by around 40 basis points.        
	A depreciating rupee will make oil imports more expensive. However, global commodity and crude oil prices have crashed in recent weeks, thereby sparing the country the risk of importing inflation.        
	D.K. Joshi, director and principal economist at Crisil, says falling crude oil and commodity prices have helped to check inflation. However, inflation  which is currently ruling at just over 11 per cent  would have been much lower if the rupee had not fallen so quickly.        
	Joshi believes that the rupee will become strong once stability returns to the global financial system.

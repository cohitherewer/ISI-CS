	New Delhi, April 21: The Abhijit Sen committee failed to reach a conclusion on whether futures trading is linked with inflation. The government is under increasing pressure to ban futures trade on essential commodities to contain inflation.        
	It cannot be concluded emphatically that futures trading has in any way fuelled increase or volatility in prices of agricultural commodities, the committees draft report said. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said last week that the government would take a decision on allowing or banning futures trading in food after 10 days if the committee did not submit the report by then.

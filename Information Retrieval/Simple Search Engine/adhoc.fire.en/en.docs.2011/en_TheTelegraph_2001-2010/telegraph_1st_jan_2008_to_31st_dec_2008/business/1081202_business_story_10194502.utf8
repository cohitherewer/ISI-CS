                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indian Hotels to take 30% revenue hit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Scary signs                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL) is likely to see its revenues tumble 30 per cent next year as it struggles to restore its terrorist-ravaged Taj Mahal Palace and Tower luxury hotel.        
	The indications are that it can take about a year to rebuild the hotel.        
	Analysts fear that with the hotel unable to take any bookings for the next few months and revenues from some of its high-margin businesses such as food and beverages and retail outlets on the property also taking a hit, the topline can be affected by 5 to 10 per cent this year.        
	Analysts had expected IHCL to post net sales of nearly Rs 1,900 crore this fiscal.        
	The century-old Taj property is a cash-cow for IHCL, and estimates say that it contributes nearly 35 per cent to its standalone revenues.        
	Observers reckon that the financial impact will be a lot less at East India Hotels (EIH), which is also wrestling with the after-effects of the terrorist strike at its Oberoi-Trident property in Mumbai.         
	Last Saturday, P.R.S. Oberoi, chairman of EIH, said the property contributed close to 45 per cent to its topline. Unconfirmed reports say that it will take around six months for the property to be fully restored.        
	The terrorist strikes could not have come at a worse time for the hotel industry as it had already been feeling the pinch of global economic slowdown. Industry circles now fear that the attacks will lead to higher cancellations from both business and leisure travellers not only in Mumbai but also in other parts of the country.        
	Amol Rao, analyst at PINC Research who tracks IHCL, said the companys standalone topline would be impacted to the extent of 30 to 35 per cent.        
	The property gets revenues not only from rooms, but also from other sources such as restaurants, shops and banqueting, Rao said, adding that all these were high margin businesses. Some of the prominent retail outlets in the property include that of Ermenegildo Zegna, Louis Vuitton, MontBlanc and Girard Perregaux.         
	Some of the popular money-spinning restaurants in the property include Masala Kraft, Harbour Bar, Sea Lounge, Wasabi and Shamiana.

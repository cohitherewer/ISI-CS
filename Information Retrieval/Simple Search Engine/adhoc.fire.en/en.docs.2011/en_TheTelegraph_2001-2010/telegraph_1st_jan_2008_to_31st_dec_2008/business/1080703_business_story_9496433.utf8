          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 2: Rural India will play a major role in taking forward the countrys telecom growth story.         
	According to information technology research and advisory firm Gartner Inc, revenue from the telecom services market is projected to surpass $37 billion by 2012 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18 per cent.         
	A separate study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Ernst amp; Young (E amp;Y) said of the next 250 million wireless users, approximately 100 million (40 per cent) would be from the rural areas.        
	As the population and disposable income of rural India grows, rural telecom connectivity is poised for explosive growth in the next five to 10 years, the Ficci-E amp;Y study said.        
	The Gartner report also estimated the mobile subscriber base to exceed 737 million connections by 2012, growing at a CAGR of 21 per cent during the same period. The growth in the mobile subscriber base is on the back of a rapidly proliferating rural market, lower handset costs and falling tariff rates, said Madhusudan Gupta, a senior research analyst at Gartner.         
	Rural telephony will continue to trigger growth and is expected to grow four-fold during the forecast period. Call rates have further dropped to about 1.5 cents per minute narrowing the gap with fixed-line rates. These factors along with an increasingly competitive landscape will fuel market growth and encourage the adoption of wireless services in the rural and semi-urban provinces of India, he said.         
	Cellular market penetration is projected to increase to 60.7 per cent in 2012 from 19.8 per cent in 2007.         
	Analysts attribute this growth to the increasing focus on the rural market, local consumer durable and electronic companies entering the domestic mobile handset segment and lower handset prices. Vendors will continue to focus on sub-$25 handsets to capture market share.         
	The mobile market continues to be dominated by prepaid subscribers, accounting for more than 89 per cent of the connections in 2007. The prepaid customer base is expected to grow to more than 92 per cent by 2012. The total services revenue from prepaid connections is expected to grow at 18.9 per cent CAGR for 2008-2012.

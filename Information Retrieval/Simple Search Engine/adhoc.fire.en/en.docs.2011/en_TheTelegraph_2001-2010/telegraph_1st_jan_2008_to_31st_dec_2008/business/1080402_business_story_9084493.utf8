The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti clears 3G test
                                                                                                               Bharti clears 3G test
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 1: Bharti Airtel has tested third generation (3G) mobile applications with various equipment suppliers and is all set to start the services once spectrum is allocated.         
	We have tested 3G applications in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore on a trial indoor spectrum given to us, said Sanjay Kapoor, president (mobility), Bharti Airtel.         
	On whether Bharti Airtel has the technology to offer 3G mobile services, Kapoor said, We as an operator have 3G services in Seychelles. Our licence in Sri Lanka is also for 3G services. By the time 3G will be launched in India, we will have enough experience.        
	Moreover, we have SingTel as our partner which has wide experience in the segment, Kapoor said, adding that for an operator who has 2G operations, 3G is just an incremental service.         
	Bharti Airtel has offered the 3G services contract to Huawei in Sri Lanka. Once we start here, we will negotiate with all the players before taking a final decision, said Kapoor. The company will take six to nine months to offer the services from the date of allotment of spectrum.        
	Existing players such as Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance are gearing up for 3G, which provides faster downloads and enhanced data transmission.

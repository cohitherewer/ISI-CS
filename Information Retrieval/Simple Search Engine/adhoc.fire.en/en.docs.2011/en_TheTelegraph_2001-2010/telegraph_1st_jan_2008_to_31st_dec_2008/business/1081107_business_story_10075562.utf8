	New Delhi, Nov. 6 (PTI): A day after Tata Motors announced a three-day shutdown at its Jamshedpur unit, Ashok Leyland said it would roll out fewer commercial vehicles during the next two months and its manufacturing plants would work only three days a week till December because of a slump in demand.         
	After Jamshedpur, Tata Motors is also mulling a similar closure of its passenger vehicle plant in Pune.         
	Production will match demand, a Tata Motors spokesperson said when asked about reports that the Pune facility would be shut down from November 22-27. He neither confirmed nor denied the reports.        
	An Ashok Leyland statement said, Taking into account the inventory in pipeline and the suppressed market demand, Ashok Leyland has decided to moderate the production plan for the next two months.        
	The companys manufacturing facilities would also reduce the number of working days to three a week till December this year, it said.        
	This decision has also been partially influenced by the problems encountered by the suppliers as a result of power shortage in some parts of the country, the company said.        
	During the past few weeks, the market for medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles had been facing problems of inadequate funding and high interest costs, which affected demand.        
	Sales down        
	Ashok Leyland today reported a 50.23 per cent decline in vehicles sales in October at 3,397 units compared with 6,825 units in the same month last year. Domestic sales for the month fell 52.61 per cent to 2,976 units from 6,280 units in the year-ago period.

	Calcutta, Aug. 31: Wipro Technologies plans to ramp up its brand visibility in Europe, Australia and the US.        
	The $5-billion IT major has increased its marketing spend five-fold in the last three years.        
	We want to increase our brand visibility through innovation. We want to be visible on New York buses and major airports of the world. We would also like to organise events such as the Innovation Awards with the IT association of the US, said Jessie Paul, chief marketing officer of Wipro Technologies.         
	Paul was speaking on the sidelines of an IT symposium organised by Nasscom and the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in Calcutta last week.         
	Wipro organised 70 events in the US and over 25 in Europe last year. It is now looking to participate in international forums and panel discussions to make its presence felt globally.        
	In a latest restructuring move, Wipro has appointed separate heads for its operations in the US, Europe, Japan and West Asia. We are making these people more visible in their respective markets through participation in various forums, said Paul.        
	About 10 per cent of Wipros 54-member marketing team is non-Indian. Paul said the company would hire locals as marketing heads in the US, Europe and Japan.        
	Wipro has a 50 per cent exposure in the US market and around 30 per cent in the European market. Paul said the emphasis would be on innovation in partnership with other firms. Around 10 per cent of the companys revenues comes through innovations.        
	Earlier, Wipro had announced that Girish Paranjape and Suresh Vaswani  two of the five business heads within the group  were being elevated as joint chief executive officers of the IT division.        
	The recently appointed country chiefs for overseas operations will report to Vaswani and Anand Sankaran, who heads Wipro Infotech.         
	The heads of strategic business units in segments such as manufacturing and heathcare, energy and utilities, retail and transportation will also report to Vaswani.

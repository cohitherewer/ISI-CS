	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Car buyers want to see what the New Year has to offer and have postponed their purchase decisions. As a result, passenger car sales rose just 8.8 per cent in December, while motorcycles sales skid by 11.4 per cent.        
	According to figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic passenger car sales in December 2007 were 88,220 units against 81,033 units in the year-ago period.        
	The growth rate, however, came down to single digits from the previous months 15 per cent.         
	However, auto analyst Hormazd Sorabji said, The year 2008 will only get better for the automobile industry. The dip in sales last year was largely because of product fatigue. With newer and affordable cars hitting the market this year, the industry will have some reason to rejoice.        
	Some of the new models are likely to be showcased in the Auto Expo starting tomorrow in New Delhi.        
	Overall vehicle sales dropped 5.6 per cent at 7,29,915 in December compared with 7,73,972 in the same month of the previous year.        
	Market leader Maruti Suzuki India managed to increase sales by 4.5 per cent to 50,056 units against 47,877 units in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Rival Hyundai registered a growth of 18.2 per cent at 13,069 units compared with 11,049 in the year-ago period, while Tata Motors witnessed a fall of 14 per cent at 10,876 units against 12,672 units in the same month in 2006.        
	General Motors more than tripled its sales during the month at 4,130 units, compared with 1,064 in the same month a year ago, on the back of heavy discounts offered on its hatchback, the Spark.        
	According to Jnaneswar Sen, senior manager (marketing) of Honda Siel Cars India, Last years growth has been disappointing for the industry but stable interest rates and newer models should help pick up growth this year.        
	For motorcycles, the down-slide continued with all the top three manufacturers Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto and TVS  registering negative growth.

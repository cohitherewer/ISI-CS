          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Bhowmik: Optimistic		    
	Calcutta, May 6: Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) has acquired Larsen amp; Toubros 51 per cent stake in joint venture HPL Cogeneration Ltd for Rs 180 crore.        
	The 116MW captive power utility was set up on the premises of the petrochemical unit.         
	HPL said the move was strategic as the company planned to boost its profitability with minimum investments to ward off losses it was likely to report this year after the reimposition of import duty on naphtha in this years Union budget.         
	It was a win-win deal, Swapan Bhowmik, managing director of HPL, said.        
	With the buyout, HPL will have full ownership of HPL Cogeneration. HPL will be able to tap synergies between itself and HPL Cogeneration.        
	HPL Cogeneration produces power from naphtha supplied by HPL. The power company takes a processing fee for the same.         
	In 2007-08, HPL Cogeneration had posted a profit of Rs 76 crore on a turnover of Rs 133 crore.        
	HPL is planning to use an alternative feedstock instead of naphtha for the power plant. One of the options being considered is to use gas, produced as a byproduct in polymer making, to generate power. The company is in talks with technology licensors for help in using the gas instead of naphtha when the gas becomes available in a greater amount after expansion.        
	HPL has embarked on a 30 per cent capacity expansion plan.         
	Once completed by the end of this year, the company will produce more gas.         
	The technology change will not involve much investment, but the savings will be huge because of the naphtha replacement.        
	Bhowmik also promised more changes and investments in the future. HPL hopes to turn profitable again next year.

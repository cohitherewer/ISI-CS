          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sushil Kumar Shinde in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, March 17: Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today promised electricity on demand by 2012.        
	By 2012, on-demand electricity will be available, Shinde said in the Rajya Sabha while replying to supplementaries.        
	The minister said there was a proposal to further rationalise the policy for mega power projects to attract more players.         
	The government provides key fiscal sops, such as duty exemption on capital equipment imports, under the policy, he said.        
	He said 78,577MW generation capacity would be added in the Eleventh Five Year Plan period.        
	The country has added 54,000MW in the past 15 years, the minister said.         
	The target for the Eleventh Plan period does not include captive power plants set up by industries, he added.        
	India has an installed power generation capacity of 1,41,079 MW.        
	Shinde said the government proposed to introduce a restructured accelerated power development and reforms programme (APDRP) in the Eleventh Plan period to cut transmission and distribution losses.        
	The APDRP was launched in 2002-03 to encourage reforms, reduce aggregate technical and commerical losses and improve the quality of power supply.

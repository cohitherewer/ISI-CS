          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                                Sharma in Calcutta on Monday. ATelegraph picture      
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company has curtailed its aggressive expansion plan following the global financial turmoil.        
	Shikha Sharma, managing director of the company, said, We have decided not to expand our business as aggressively as we did last year.         
	However, she denied any drastic employee retrenchment.        
	In 2007-08, ICICI Prudential expanded its branch network to 1,956 from 583. But in the first six months of the current financial year, the company has added only 94 branches.         
	With the gloom spreading all around, the rate of attrition has come down. This has significantly cooled down wage inflation in the industry. The pressure of a salary hike is no longer there, she said.         
	However, the insurer will go slow on recruitment this year.         
	Between April and September this year, the insurer has clocked a premium income of Rs 6,726 crore.         
	Premium income from new businesses was Rs 2,650 crore, a growth rate of 22 per cent from the same period last year.         
	Though we have grown 22 per cent in terms of new business, the industry has witnessed a greater-than-expected slowdown in growth. However, we expect to end this financial year with positive growth , she said.         
	According to Sharma, this will call for some capital infusion during the remaining months of the current fiscal.        
	In 2007-08, the promoters of ICICI Prudential pumped in Rs 808 crore, taking the paid-up capital of the company to Rs 4,580 crore.

	New Delhi, Jan. 9: BMW plans to increase the manufacturing capacity of its Chennai plant to more than 3,000 units per annum as it expects sales in 2008 to touch 2,000 units. 
 
	We have achieved our target of selling 1,000 units in 2007 by delivering 1,387 vehicles. We now need to increase our capacity to 3,000 units per annum from 1700 units on a single shift basis, said Peter Kronschnabl, BMW Indias president. 
 
	BMW plans to invest Rs 3 crore in streamlining its production capabilities. 
 
	Last year, the company sold 320 units of its five series car, 251 units of its seven series, 743 units of its three series and six units of the SUV X3. 
 
	The German car maker today launched three M-series cars and a BMW individual series car. The BMW M6 coupe is a 5.0-litre, V-10 engine rear-wheel drive, priced at Rs 1.24 crore. BMW M5 sedan comes for Rs 1.01 crore and packs a 500-horsepower wallop from its V-10 engine.
 
	The next in the M series, the BMW M3 Coupe, has an eight-cylinder power unit. It is priced at Rs 74.9 lakh.

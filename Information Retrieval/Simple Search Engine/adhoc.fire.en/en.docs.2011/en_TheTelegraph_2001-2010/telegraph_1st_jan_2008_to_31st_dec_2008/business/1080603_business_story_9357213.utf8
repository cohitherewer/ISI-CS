	Mumbai, June 2 (PTI): Public sector lender Allahabad Bank is planning to raise capital through a rights issue subject to governments approval.        
	In a notice sent to the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the Calcutta-based bank said the board of directors of the bank had taken a decision to approach the finance ministry for its permission to float a rights issue.        
	The announcement comes close on the heels of the State Bank of Indias rights offer at a price of Rs 1,590 a piece. The government had issued bonds worth Rs 9,995.99 crore to the countrys largest lender for subscribing to the issue.        
	At present, the government holds around 55 per cent in Allahabad Bank. According to the existing provisions, the governments stake cannot fall below 51 per cent. Shares of Allahabad Bank declined 1.43 per cent to close at Rs 79.40 on the BSE.         
	For the financial year ended March 31, the bank had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 993.98 crore, a 31 per cent growth rate over the previous years figure. Total income rose 36 per cent to Rs 7,156.41 crore during the year ended March 31, from Rs 5,267.21 crore in the previous fiscal.        
	The bank announced a stand-alone net profit of Rs 974.74 crore in 2007-08, a 29.94 per cent growth rate over the year-ago period. The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 750.14 crore in 2006-07.

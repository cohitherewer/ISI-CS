                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata Motors rights at a steep discount
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Sept. 2: Tata Motors Ltd today announced the pricing details of its rights issue. It will offer one ordinary share at Rs 340 for every six held and one share with low voting rights at a price of Rs 305 for every six held.        
	The stock with differential voting rights is dubbed as A ordinary share and will have one-tenth the voting right of the regular shares but will be entitled to receive dividend at 5 percentage points more than the rate of dividend declared on the ordinary shares.         
	The automobile major is planning to raise about Rs 4,147 crore from the simultaneous but unlinked rights issue. Proceeds from the issue will be used to prepay part of the $2.3-billion short-term bridge loan availed by its subsidiary to finance the acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Company. The deal was completed on June 2. The issue of low voting stock is expected to mobilise Rs 1,961 crore. The rights share issue will raise another Rs 2,186 crore.         
	The offer prices  Rs 340 for the regular share and Rs 305 for the low-voting stock  mark a discount of nearly 19 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, to the closing price of Tata Motors share on the stock exchanges today.         
	On the BSE, the Tata Motors share closed lower at Rs 429.85, a drop of 2 per cent over its previous close of Rs 437.80.         
	Shares of Tata Motors have been under pressure because of worries relating to the state of the domestic automobile industry in addition to equity dilution on account of the rights issue.         
	The price of the rights issue is in line with our estimates and will result in 33.4 per cent equity dilution, said Vaishali Jajoo, auto analyst at Angel Broking.         
	She said high interest rates and a cut-back in credit by banks and NBFCs continued to hurt the company.         
	The lack of new rollouts in the passenger vehicle segment impacted its overall volumes in 2007-2008 and in the first half of 2009, Jajoo said.

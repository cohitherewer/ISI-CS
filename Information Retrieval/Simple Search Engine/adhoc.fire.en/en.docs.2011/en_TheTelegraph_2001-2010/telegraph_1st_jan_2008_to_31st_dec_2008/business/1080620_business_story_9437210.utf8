The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Monsoon test for mineral policy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Monsoon test for mineral policy
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Awaiting Progress                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: The Congress-led government plans to introduce its contentious national mineral policy, which proposes the auction of iron ore mines, in the monsoon session of Parliament.        
	The chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Orissa and Jharkhand have opposed the move. Barring Jharkhand, where the Congress is a partner in the ruling coalition, the other states are governed by the BJP or, as in Orissa, the BJP is part of the ruling coalition.        
	According to the new policy, end users such as steel plants can buy mining rights through auctions.         
	The users will promise a certain part of the mined mineral as licence payment and ship the ore to any part of the country for processing.         
	However, the mineral-rich states want concessions to be given on the basis of promises by the end users to set up facilities within the states. New industry and jobs not only enrich a state but also create political capital for the incumbent government.        
	On the other hand, officials said, the central government believed a bidding process was mandatory as otherwise, transparency would be compromised and the states might be robbed off their mineral wealth merely on the basis of promises.        
	Officials said they had been looking at compromise formulas such as assigning weights to proposals to set up processing factories in the state where the mine was located and invest in social infrastructure in areas around the mines.         
	The other option is to let Parliament decide on amending the various mining acts during the monsoon session.        
	If the policy is implemented, global steel leaders such as Posco and ArcelorMittal will be able to buy iron ore mines through auctions instead of negotiating with the state governments of Orissa and Jharkhand for leases.

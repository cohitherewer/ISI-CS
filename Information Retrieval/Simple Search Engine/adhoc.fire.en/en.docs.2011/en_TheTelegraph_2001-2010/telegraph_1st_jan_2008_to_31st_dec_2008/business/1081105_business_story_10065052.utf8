The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US rap for Sun Pharma unit 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US rap for Sun Pharma unit 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bitter dose                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 4: After Ranbaxy Laboratories, it is the turn of Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories  the subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries  to get a rap from the US drug regulator.        
	The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning letter to Caraco over quality control issues relating to its manufacturing plant at Detroit.        
	The letter was issued as a follow-up to an FDA inspection of the companys plant in May.         
	According to Caraco, the US regulator may also withhold approvals of pending drug applications that list the facility as the manufacturer.        
	Caraco said a notice was issued in June following the inspection. The company had responded to all the observations made by the FDA within 30 days and corrective actions were taken and substantially completed.         
	Subsequent letters communicating additional improvements were also provided to the FDA that were similar to what the company had done in previous correspondence with the regulator.        
	The observations set forth in the warning letter include, among other things, the inadequate and untimely investigation by the quality control unit of certain incidents at the facility contrary to the companys standard operating procedures. The FDA considered some of its observations to be repetitive, Caraco said.        
	The company said it would respond to the regulator within 15 business days.        
	Caraco develops, manufactures, markets and distributes generic and other drugs.        
	Sources said the FDA first noticed a deficiency in manufacturing called a dispensing error. Although this was noted in one of the batches of a drug, the product was never made and the batch was stopped.        
	News of the notice impacted shares of Sun Pharma on worries that its topline could be hurt if the FDA withholds approvals for pending drug applications of Caraco. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Sun Pharma scrip ended 4.7 per cent lower at Rs 1,054.10.

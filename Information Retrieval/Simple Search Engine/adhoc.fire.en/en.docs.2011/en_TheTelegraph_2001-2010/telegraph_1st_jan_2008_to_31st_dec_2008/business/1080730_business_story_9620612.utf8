The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trade talks flop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trade talks flop

	Geneva, July 29 (Reuters): Marathon talks on a new wave of trade liberalisation collapsed on Tuesday after nine days of intense but ultimately fruitless negotiations.        
	We were so close to getting this done, US trade representative Susan Schwab told reporters at the World Trade Organization headquarters after countries failed to compromise over measures to protect farmers in poor countries.        
	The US remains committed to the Doha round. This is not a time to talk about a round collapsing, said Schwab, who looked frustrated and distressed. The US commitments remain on the table, awaiting reciprocal responses.        
	As failure looked likely, New Zealands trade minister, Phil Goff, held out hope for Doha talks continuing at a later date. I hope ... that what weve achieved this week can be used at least to build a foundation for the future, he said.        
	However, failure of the talks to find a broad agreement on the Doha trade round could delay any global agreement on trade liberalisation for several more years, experts say.        
	The negotiations for a global deal trade began in 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks on the US, in the hope of boosting the world economy and helping poor countries.        
	They have lurched from crisis to crisis and risk further years of delay without a breakthrough now because of the US presidential election in November and other factors.        
	Washington had opposed a push from India, China and Indonesia to secure measures to protect their farmers if faced with sudden surges of cheap farm imports.        
	Earlier, European Union trade commissioner Peter Mandelson had urged parties to seek compromise. If people dont want this deal, theres no better deal coming along and we just have to consider, if this fails, what they will lose, he said.

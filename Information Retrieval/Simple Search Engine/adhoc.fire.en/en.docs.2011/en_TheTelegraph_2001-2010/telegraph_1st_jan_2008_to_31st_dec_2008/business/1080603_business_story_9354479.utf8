          KAKOLY CHATTERJEE                                        TOUGH GOING		        
	New Delhi, June 2: Indias export duty on basmati rice has helped Pakistani rice traders.        
	Since Pakistan has not hiked the export duty on the rice, its basmati is cheaper, according to Arvinder Pal Singh, managing director of Lal Qilla Rice.        
	India charges an export duty of $200 per tonne on basmati rice.        
	We have to bear the brunt of the duty. We pass it on to the buyers at times, but if they do not want to pay more, the burden is all on us, Singh said.        
	However, government officials feel the duty is not a hurdle before Indias rice exporters.         
	According to Asit Tripathy, chairman of Apeda (Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), Earlier the minimum export price of basmati was $1,200. The government has reduced the minimum price of basmati to $1,000 and added $200 as export duty.         
	 Paying the export duty is not a problem since traders were already paying that much as minimum export price, he said.         
	However, exporters said the minimum export price was not pinching their pocket while the tax was.         
	Exporters said the price of basmati had increased 50 per cent to $1,500 per tonne from $1,000 per tonne last year because of increasing global demand and surging production and distribution costs.         
	While buyers in the European Union and the US are willing to pay more  including the export duty  customers in West Asia are not ready to do so, resulting in exporters bearing half the duty.         
	However, industry experts feel the exporters will rather reduce margins than lose out on a market they have built up.        
	On a more positive note, Danesh Beg of Reiagro Ltd said, With the economy doing well in West Asia  where India sends 70 per cent of its total basmati export  more people are converting to basmati from other rice, leading to a rise in demand.        
	At present, India holds a 53 per cent share in the global market of basmati rice with Pakistan occupying the second slot.

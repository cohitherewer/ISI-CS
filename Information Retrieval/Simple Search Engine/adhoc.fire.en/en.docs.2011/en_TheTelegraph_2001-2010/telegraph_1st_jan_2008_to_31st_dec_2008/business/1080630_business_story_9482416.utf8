The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Premium LPG cylinders on way
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Premium LPG cylinders on way

	Mumbai, June 29: A premium pricing plan for gas cylinders in kitchens may be just round the corner.         
	The Centre has cleared a plan to allow oil marketing companies to sell higher priced gas cylinders to the affluent sections of society.         
	The companies are already selling premium petrol and diesel and a higher priced gas cylinder is just another revenueearning stream for cash-strapped oil refiners who have been weighed down by losses for having to sell petroleum products at government-mandated prices that do not help them fully recover their costs.         
	Unlike the conventional cooking gas cylinder, which will continue to be subsidised, the new product will be translucent and it will show the level of LPG present in the cylinder.         
	They are composite cylinders, being made up of two materials  fibreglass and polymer  which ensure durability and lightweight.         
	The three public sector oil companies  Indian Oil Corpation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd  are initially planning to import such cylinders by floating a global tender. Later, they will test market the product in select areas.         
	Industry circles say that the test marketing can be done sometime next year. Oil companies are currently engaged in the process of finalising terms and conditions to float the global tender even as they have also initiated action to secure approval from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation. On June 4, the Union government raised cooking gas, or LPG, prices by Rs 50 more per cylinder of 14.2 kg.         
	While announcing the decision, petroleum minister Murli Deora said the price should have been raised by Rs 353 a cylinder if the oil companies had to be fully compensated for their loss.         
	Despite the increase, oil companies continue to suffer a loss of over Rs 300 for every cylinder sold.         
	Although the government had increased petrol and diesel prices, oil companies continue to make losses on these products. Though there are price controls on normal fuel, premium petrol and diesel, which contain additives to improve their quality, are outside the purview of this restriction.         
	The oil marketing companies have been pushing these products through their retail outlets, particularly in the cities, to bring down their losses. The prices of the premium variety are about Rs 3 more than the subsidised fuel.         
	Industry sources say that though premium fuels made a slow start, consumers have started to accept them, and the product is now even being sought by the non-transport sector. Premium fuel now accounts for nearly 20 per cent of IOCs total fuel sales. Reports say that it jointly accounts for over 30 per cent of total fuel sales among the three oil marketing companies. It could increase to over 40 per cent this year. Based on this experience, oil companies are confident that they should also get a positive experience from the composite gas cylinders.         
	Although their introduction is still some way off, we may have to price them marginally above normal cylinders, said a spokesperson for a public sector oil company who did not wish to be identified.         
	The composite cylinders are also corrosion-resistant. The most commonly used materials in them are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharyya in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) will invite bids in a couple of months from private sector players to develop 18 pit-head washeries.         
	The washeries, which will be owned by CIL and managed by private players, will have a total capacity to wash 97 million tonnes of coal per annum.         
	Setting up these washeries will require an investment between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore, said Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman of CIL.         
	Coal India has earmarked an investment of Rs 3,200 crore for 2008-09, including the setting up of the washeries. It plans to sell only washed coal in the future to improve its price realisation.         
	Washed coal is sold at a 15 per cent to 20 per cent premium compared with unwashed coal.         
	The company also invited bids today from domestic and global mining companies to develop 18 abandoned mines.        
	Today we are inviting expressions of interest to develop 18 mines that had been abandoned for various reasons. These mines still have an estimated reserve of over 800 million tonnes of thermal and coking coal. The mines are located at Bharat Coking Coal, Eastern Coalfields and Central Coalfields, Bhattacharyya said.         
	Pre-tax profit        
	CIL clocked a pre-tax profit of Rs 8,738.46 crore in 2007-08 compared with Rs 8,622 crore in the previous year.         
	The companys net profit, however, has gone down to Rs 5,243.27 crore during 2007-08 from Rs 5,708.72 crore, because of higher provisioning for income and fringe benefit taxes.

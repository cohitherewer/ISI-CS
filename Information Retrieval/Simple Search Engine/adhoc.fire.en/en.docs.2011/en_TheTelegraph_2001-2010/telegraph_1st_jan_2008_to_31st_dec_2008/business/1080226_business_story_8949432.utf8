	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Reva Electric Car Company plans to roll out a new vehicle every year.         
	Chetan Maini, deputy chairman and chief technology officer of Reva, told The Telegraph, We will launch one vehicle and one variant every year. By the end of 2008, we will introduce another electric car with more advanced features.        
	The Bangalore-based company has a plant in Bommasandra, which has a capacity of 6,000 units. Reva is expanding this capacity to 30,000 by the middle of this year to meet the increased demand in foreign markets as well as to tap the potential in the domestic market.        
	Of the 30,000 cars, we expect to sell about 15,000-20,000 units in India alone while the rest will be sold overseas, said Maini.        
	However, the sales target appears to be a bit ambitious, considering the company had managed to sell only about 2,500 vehicles since 2001.        
	According to Maini, the response to electrical vehicles has improved. With surging crude oil prices, the company expects better demand in the years ahead. About 80 per cent of Reva cars are sold in 21 countries abroad, including the UK and Japan.        
	The company also sells its cars in Norway, Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Malta. It is also test-marketing its vehicles in South America and Southeast Asia. In India, the company plans to expand in cities such as Delhi, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Chennai.

          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, July 15: The state jute industry is worried over the fate of the packaging order for 2008-09 because of the political uncertainties at the Centre.        
	It is feared that the delay in getting cabinet approval for the continuation of the mandatory order for packaging foodgrains and sugar in jute sacks may give way to synthetic substitutes.         
	The standing advisory committee (SAC) has allowed the use of alternative packaging material under pressure from a strong lobby in favour of synthetic material.         
	State mills are worried that the withdrawal of the Left support to the UPA government is likely to further weaken their position at the Centre.        
	Last year, the cabinet had approved 100 per cent packaging of the two commodities in jute bags overriding a recommendation from an inter-ministerial committee to reduce the monopoly of jute.        
	The jute industry is dependent on orders from the government and state procurement agencies and the cabinet decides the percentage of jute sacking materials to be used every year. It was a collective effort by two Union ministers from Bengal  Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi  along with the Left that helped the jute industry sail through last year.         
	For the current year, the SAC, sources said, has repeated its recommendation for reducing the jute monopoly by 25 per cent and 30 per cent for foodgrains and sugar, respectively.         
	However, while the Congress MPs have maintained their demand for the continuation of the 100 per cent packing order, members from the Left parties are found wanting, sources said.

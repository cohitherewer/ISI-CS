	Mumbai, March 3: Germanys Metro Cash amp; Carry, which caters to retailers, is facing difficulties in acquiring land for its centres. 
    
	Metro, which entered India in 2003, has set up three centres, of which two are in Bangalore and one is in Hyderabad. 
    
	It plans to set up two more centres this year. Of this, one will come up in Mumbai by April and the other in Calcutta. 
    
	In China where it had entered in 1996, Metro has around 34 outlets.
    
	According to Vishal Sehgal, head, corporate relations at Metro Cash amp; Carry India, the company is keen on opening more than one centre in key markets such as Mumbai, Delhi and Calcutta.
    
	However, real estate  both its availability and procurement at reasonable prices  is proving to be difficult. 
    
	Admitting that land is a problem, Sehgal said that the company was trying to solve it by tweaking the arrangement that it normally followed in setting up a store. For instance in Mumbai, its forthcoming outlet will have a vertical structure.
    
	Sehgal adds the diversity of the regions in India is also a potent challenge.A customer in Delhi may have different preferences from that in Mumbai. We are also trying to meet that, he says.
    
	Metro has, however, tasted success in Bangalore and Hyderabad where it sells both food and non-food products. 
    
	The company has managed to not only enrol small restaurateurs but also small retailers as its customers. The target audience for Metro includes restaurants, food kiosks, hotels and catering companies. 
    
	The company is now looking forward to opening its first store in Calcutta later this year after a district court vacated an earlier stay order imposed on the construction of the store.
    
	In Calcutta, the wholesale store, like its counterparts in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai, will target neighbourhood stores, restaurants and even institutions. 
             
	Officials from Metro say that though the company is keen on opening more centres in Calcutta, it will initially focus on opening the first store that will come up in 7.53 acres of land along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. The store will sell products ranging from fresh foods to non-food products.
    
	Metros plans to open a store in Calcutta was delayed after it was dragged into a litigation over the ownership of the land which it had taken on a lease from the state government.

                                                                                                               Govt set to take a call on Goa SEZs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          ROAD AHEAD                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The board of approval for special economic zones (SEZs) is likely to take a decision on the controversial Goa SEZ denotification on Monday.        
	The law ministry has already given its opinion, which can be a crucial input for the board to take its decision, officials said.        
	The board will move cautiously as the issue has a great political impact and can affect the confidence of investors, they added.        
	On December 31, the Goa government had asked the Centre to scrap all SEZs because of political opposition and charges of irregularity in land allocations.        
	Sources said the commerce ministry suggested a way, which would allow the board to denotify the SEZ zones  this was the demand of the state government  but let the industries in the zones to continue.        
	They said land was already in the possession of companies and investments have started flowing in. Besides, the units had captive power plants, so asking them to move out would not be possible.        
	Ciplas Meditab Specialities, Peninsula Pharma Research Centre and K Raheja Corp have acquired land. Cipla has already started work on its SEZ and reportedly pumped in about Rs 500 crore into the project.         
	However, the units may not get the tax concessions given to SEZs. As the firms can challenge this in court, the law ministry has been asked to take the middle path.         
	Sources said the solution being worked out would not put the Centre and the state government on a path of confrontation and might not dampen the confidence of investors.        
	Goa is the first Congress-ruled state to have gone back on the SEZ policy.         
	There have been protests against SEZs in several states including Bengal, Maharashtra and Haryana.

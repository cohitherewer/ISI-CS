	Mumbai, Jan. 19: Good news for subscribers of Reliance Powers maiden offer. Chairman Anil Ambani today said his company would try to ensure that every applicant received a minimum number of shares.
    
	Its our desire that every retail applicant gets some bare minimum number of shares, Ambani told reporters today. He, however, did not disclose what this number will be.
    
	RPowers IPO, which closed on Friday, generated huge interest both in India and abroad. With retail applications at a whopping 50 lakh, the question on the minds of most investors is whether they will be allotted any shares. 
    
	Around 6.84 crore shares had been reserved for the retail category and this segment was oversubscribed 14 times. In other words, there were applications for over 100 crore shares.
    
	According to Ambani, the market capitalisation of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group will be close to $100 billion after the listing of RPower.
    
	RPower today fixed the issue price for its IPO at Rs 450 per share. Assuming that the companys scrip lists at this price, the market capitalisation will stand at Rs 100,000 crore ($26 billion). 
    
	The market capitalisation of Reliance Energy is placed at Rs 50,00 crore ($13 billion), Reliance Natural Resources (RNRL) at Rs 33,000 crore ($8.55 billion), Adlabs at Rs 6,500 crore ($1.64 billion), Reliance Capital at Rs 58,000 crore ($14.6 billion) and Reliance Communications at Rs 58,000 crore ($37 billion). This will make R-ADAG the second largest business house in the country in terms of market capitalisation.
    
	With the issue price fixed at Rs 450 per share, retail investors will be allotted shares at Rs 430 apiece. This is after taking into account the discount of Rs 20 per share announced earlier. 
    
	RPower, which will list in early-February, will have the highest number of shareholders in the world in a single company. It will also be amongst the top ten listed companies in India.
    
	Ambani said the bid amount of Rs 7,50,000 crore was greater than the combination of top five IPOs that aggregated Rs 1,31,000 crore. 
    
	It also received subscriptions of over $100 billion from foreign investors. Moreover, the 50 lakh retail applications received were the largest for any IPO in the world.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sudip Dutta in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Sudip Dutta-led Ess Dee Aluminium Ltd is set to revive India Foils.        
	Duttas company had acquired India Foils from the earlier management of Vedanta and would resume full-fledged production at the Kamarhati unit in North 24 Parganas by the end of the current financial year.         
	India Foils had shut down two of its three plants in Bengal, while the Kamarhati facility carried out production at a snails pace.        
	We will begin full production of 9,000 tonnes by the end of this financial year and upgrade the manufacturing standards required for the pharmaceutical industry, Dutta said. The Kamarhati unit will manufacture aluminium foils for the pharmaceutical industry. Earlier, it manufactured foils for industrial use.        
	Dutta visited the plant today along with Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen, sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, and local MPs Tarit Topdar and Amitava Nandi among others. Production at the plant was formally announced today.        
	Ess Dee may have to invest Rs 50 crore to upgrade the plant which has 286 permanent employees.        
	The challenge before us is to change the mindset of the workers  to sensitise them about the hygienic requirements of the pharma industry, he said.        
	Dutta also promised to open the plant at Hoera in Hooghly by March 2009. Financial restructuring of India Foils has been completed and it will be out of the BIFR soon. He asked the workers to work closely with the management for the revival of India Foils.        
	Pharma plan        
	Dutta said he was exploring the possibility of setting up a pharmaceutical unit in Bengal.        
	I am in talks with pharma companies for contract manufacturing work. We will do formulation business, he said. Topdar has promised to give him land for the project.        
	The details are being worked out, he said.         
	Nirupam Sen also encouraged Dutta to set up the pharma plant as this could bring down the cost of drugs in the state.        
	The foray into drug formulation will be a diversification for Ess Dee which makes aluminium foils for packaging, especially the pharma industry.        
	Dutta, however, is also betting big on expansion. The asset prices will come down once the result of this quarter is out. We will have many opportunities then, he said.                    
	Ess Dee has 8 plants in India, excluding India Foils. It is looking at Europe, north America presence now.        
	, Sen said he spoke to the workers representative at Hoera to facilitate the revival process.        
	He fervently requested workers to work closely with the management for revival of India Foils.

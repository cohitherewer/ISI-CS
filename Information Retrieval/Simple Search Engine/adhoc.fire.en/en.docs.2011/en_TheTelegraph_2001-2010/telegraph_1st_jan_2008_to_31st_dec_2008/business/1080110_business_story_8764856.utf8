	New Delhi, Jan. 9: German car maker Daimler today launched a roomier Mercedes Benz C-Class sedan.
    
	The car is longer, wider and its wheelbase has been increased, which means there is more stretch room in the backseat. The models boot is also bigger. Front shoulder room has been increased by 40 mm.
    
	The petrol variant of the C-Class is priced at Rs 27 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), while the diesel variant will cost Rs 30 lakh.
    
	The design of the new C-Class is based on the modern Mercedes idiom, which reflects the technical superiority of automobiles bearing the star with taut lines and large tranquil surfaces, the company said. 
    
	The C-Class also sports additional features such as bluetooth functions and hands-free telephony.
    
	Besides the C-Class, Daimler today rolled out a CLK-Class model, priced at Rs 60 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
    
	With the two launches, we are aiming to sell 3,000 units in India this calendar year. We expect to maintain double-digit sales growth in the country over the next 10 years, said Joachim Schmidt, president  central Europe, Africa and Asia, Daimler.
    
	Daimler sold 2,491 units last calendar year in India, a growth of 18 per cent.
    
	The company had recently launched its high-end trucks Actros in India. It expects to sell 100 units of the vehicle in the next 12 months.
    
	The S-Class has been one of the best-selling sedans in India. A total of 457 S-Class cars were sold in 2007 against 248 units in 2006, a growth of 84 per cent.
    
	The E-Class, which was introduced in December 2006, recorded sales of 1,137 units in 2007, a growth of 24 per cent over 2006.

	New Delhi, June 25: The government today backed the Reserve Banks move to raise the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by 50 basis points each and indicated that more fiscal and administrative measures would be taken to contain the 13-year high inflation.        
	The objective of the RBI is to moderate and manage aggregate demand. The intention is to achieve the objective while ensuring that the prospects for overall economic growth remain positive, said a finance ministry statement issued here.        
	It noted that these steps were necessary in the face of rising inflation, which has crossed the 11-per-cent- mark, because of a relentless increase in crude oil prices.        
	Officials said the government might consider fresh measures to prevent steel prices from rising. The metal makers, under pressure from the government, had agreed to reduce the prices and hold them for a period of three months. Officials said fresh meetings would be held to persuade steel makers to hold the price line.        
	According to the officials, inflation is likely to rise for the next few weeks and will only cool off around September. It is feared that the rate of inflation may go beyond the 11.05 per cent recorded for the first week of June.         
	Iron ore exports could face fresh curbs as the punitive tax imposed some days back has failed to yield the desired result. Officials said they were monitoring the price of cement as well. If it shows an upward trend, the government will allow more imports from Pakistan and stop exports.

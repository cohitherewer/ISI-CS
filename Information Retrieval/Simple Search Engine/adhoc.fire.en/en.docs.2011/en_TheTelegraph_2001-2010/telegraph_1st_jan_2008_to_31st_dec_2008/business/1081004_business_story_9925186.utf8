          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: McLeod Russel has acquired Phu Ben Tea Company of Vietnam. This is the first overseas acquisition by an Indian bulk tea producer.        
	The takeover will make McLeod the largest plantation company in the world with a combined production of 80 million kg.        
	The long-term vision of the company is to become a global player. We will go wherever we find a strategic fit  today its Vietnam, tomorrow it can be Africa, said Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel India Ltd.        
	Borelli Tea Holdings, the wholly owned subsidiary of McLeod Russel India, has signed an agreement with Belgium-based SA SIPEF NV for the acquisition of a 100 per cent stake in Phu Ben. While the actual cost of acquisition is $2 million, Borelli will have to pay another $5 million to the Belgian firm as debt-related expenses.        
	The total cost comes to $7 million in four instalments. In November-December, we will be paying the direct acquisition cost of $2 million. Thereafter, we will be paying $1.67 million every year to pay the $5-million debt with the parent company, said Khaitan.        
	After the buyout, Phu Bens capacity will increase to 12 million kg in the next four years from 4.5 million kg. McLeod will also invest around $1 million in Phu Bens three processing factories.        
	The acquisition comes at a time when the domestic tea industry is expecting a hike in prices, on the back of an estimated shortfall of 65-70 million kg by April 2009.

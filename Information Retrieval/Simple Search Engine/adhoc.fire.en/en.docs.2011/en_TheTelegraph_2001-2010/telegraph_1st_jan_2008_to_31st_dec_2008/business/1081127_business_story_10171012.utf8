                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FDI flow to stay robust
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Foreign direct investment (FDI) is likely to remain healthy despite the global credit freeze, industry secretary Ajay Shankar said.        
	FDI inflows were robust till September and my sense is that the October figures will be robust as companies such as the General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota are going to execute their ongoing projects, Shankar said.        
	According to official data, India attracted foreign investment inflows worth $17.21 billion between April and September, a growth of 137 per cent over $7.25 billion in the corresponding period last fiscal.        
	The country received FDI worth $32.44 billion in the last financial year and inflows are expected to rise to $40 billion for the fiscal ending March 31, 2009.        
	The government is also set to relax restrictions on certain sectors to attract more foreign funds. The issue of liberalisation and rationalisation of FDI norms is under ministerial consultation and a decision is expected soon, Shankar said.        
	An empowered group of ministers, headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to meet soon to discuss a proposal to exclude foreign institutional investors (FII) stake from the overall FDI ceiling.         
	The proposal has been mooted by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) , but is believed to have been opposed by the ministries of finance and corporate affairs.        
	According to the DIPP, raising the investment limit for FIIs will not give them management control over companies, which is a right exercised by those making long-term foreign direct investment. The ministry of corporate affairs, however, says there is no law to prevent FIIs from gaining management control in a company in which they own shares.        
	Proposals cleared        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today approved 32 FDI proposals that will bring Rs 845.70 crore into the country.        
	Oriental Structural Engineers Ltds plan to set up a holding company attracting Rs 450-crore FDI is among those to be approved.

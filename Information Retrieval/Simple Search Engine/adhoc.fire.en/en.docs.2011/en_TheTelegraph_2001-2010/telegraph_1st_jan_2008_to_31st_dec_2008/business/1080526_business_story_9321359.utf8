	New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): India  determined to protect the interest of its farmers and nascent industries  will press for changes in the latest WTO proposals on agriculture and industrial goods as hard negotiations begin tomorrow in Geneva on the much delayed Doha round.        
	The country has already rejected the proposals in the drafts on opening global market for agriculture and industrial goods on the ground that they were unfair to the marginal farmers of the developing world.        
	It will press for increasing the number of items to be included in the special safeguard mechanism, through which it can protect its farmers from cheap imports.        
	At the talks stretching over the next 10 days, the Indian side, led by additional secretary in the ministry of commerce Rahul Khullar, will engage with key interlocutors from the US, the European Union, Japan and Canada to bridge the differences on the issues of livelihood concerns and farm subsidies.

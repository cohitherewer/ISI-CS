	New Delhi, May 18 (PTI): Italian truck maker Iveco, a company owned by Fiat, has said it would resume talks with Tata Motors for a commercial vehicle joint venture in Latin America, South Africa and Southeast Asia.        
	We are considering an agreement (with the Tatas) in Latin America, South Africa and Southeast Asia for the joint development of vans and trucks. From the Indian part there was a pause (in negotiations) to allow the closure of the acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover. Soon, however, dialogues will resume, Iveco CEO Paolo Monferino told the il Giornale.        
	The Tatas already have a joint venture with Fiat to produce and market cars, engines and commercial vehicles, while Iveco has dissolved its association with Indias second largest truck maker Ashok Leyland.        
	A tie-up with Indias largest automobile company will help Iveco leverage on the technologies that Tata Motors acquired from Daewoo. The Tatas acquired Daewoos truck business in 2004.        
	Tata has acquired the Korean technology. Now the Indian group plans to have the know-how necessary to complete its development plans, Monferino was quoted as saying by il Giornale.

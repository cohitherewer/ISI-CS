     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The Union cabinet is expected to take a call on fuel prices early next week.
    
	A marginal hike in prices and a tax rejig appear to be on the cards after todays meeting of the group of ministers on fuel. The ministers are expected to meet again early next week to finalise their recommendations, to be followed by the cabinet meeting. 
    
	Oil minister Murli Deora said, Of course we discussed this (price increase) issue (but) the committee has decided to leave it to the cabinet.
    
	He said the cabinet could meet as early as February 4 or February 5.
    
	Only four of the seven ministers attended the meeting today.
    
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan have not attended a single meeting, fuelling speculations about their unwillingness to be seen as a party to the fuel price hike decision. 
    
	The group of ministers is headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.
    
	Sources said the ministers appeared to have accepted the necessity of a hike in prices.
    
	Various options are being considered on the extent of the increase. The price of petrol could be increased by Rs 2 a litre and diesel by Re 1.
    
	However, last minute calculations of tax cuts are being made to see if an increase in fuel prices, especially of diesel, can be avoided.
    
	Deora and Mukherjee, along with farm minister Sharad Pawar and finance minister P. Chidambaram, dropped a proposal to raise cooking gas (LPG) prices.
    
	Instead, Chidamabaram was asked to cut excise duties.

	Karaikudi (Tamil Nadu), Nov. 2 (PTI): Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said he would ask PSU banks to consider lowering lending rates, in the wake of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) easing its monetary policy yesterday.        
	Chidambaram said he would take the issue of interest rate cut forward during a meeting with the chairpersons of public sector banks in Delhi on November 4.         
	I am happy with the policy package announced by the RBI. When it announced its (peak season) policy on October 24, the RBI had promised swift action to infuse more liquidity. I am happy that it has responded swiftly, he said.        
	The RBI yesterday cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 per cent, the cash reserve ratio by 100 basis points to 5.5 per cent and the statutory liquidity ratio by 100 basis points to infuse an additional Rs 85,000 crore into the system.        
	The central bank had already injected liquidity worth Rs 1,85,000 crore in October in the wake of the global financial crisis in the US that had spread fears in India of a recession and brought in volatility in the stock markets.         
	Chidambaram said the RBIs policy was a signal to the banks that they should now consider lowering their interest rates.        
	Citigroup rejig        
	Citigroup, which recently reported a net loss of $2.8 billion for the quarter ended September 30, has said its business in India was being repositioned to cut costs and offset losses.        
	In a regulatory filing, Citigroup said, Higher credit costs were mainly driven by continued deterioration in the credit environment in India, where the business is being actively repositioned to reduce costs and mitigate losses.

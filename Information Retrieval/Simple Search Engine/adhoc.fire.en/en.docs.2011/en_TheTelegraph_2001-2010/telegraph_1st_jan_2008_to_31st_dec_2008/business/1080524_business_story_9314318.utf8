The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Farm loan waiver gets costlier
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Farm loan waiver gets costlier
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram in New Delhi on Friday (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: The government has extended the farm-loan-waiver package to arid and dry regions. This will push up the cost of the populist scheme to Rs 71,680 crore from Rs 60,000 crore announced in this years budget.        
	All farmers, including those with large holdings, in 237 identified dry and arid districts will be eligible for debt relief of either 25 per cent of their outstanding loans or Rs 20,000, whichever is higher, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after a cabinet meeting today.        
	Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier demanded in Parliament an extension of the scheme to farmers with holdings of over 5 acres in dry and arid districts.         
	Analysts say large farmers in these districts earned less than farmers who held below 2 hectares in fertile regions.        
	Under the original scheme, announced by Chidambaram in the budget, a full waiver was given to farmers holding 5 acres and a 25 per cent write-off was granted to bigger farmers who were willing to pay back outstanding dues.        
	Small and marginal farmers will get a full debt waiver (under the extended scheme), while 60-65 per cent of large farmers will also get a full debt waiver, Chidambaram said.        
	The scheme will be implemented by the end of the next month.        
	It comes just ahead of elections in a string of states, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, which have many of the dry and arid districts identified by the government for the relief. The Opposition, therefore, is seeing the relief as a pre-poll sop.         
	Chidambaram said the new package was expected to benefit 4.3 crore farmers against 4 crore farmers who were to benefit earlier.        
	The package would be fully financed through cash in 36 months between July 2008 and June 2011, and the burden in any single year would not exceed 0.25 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).        
	There are fears that the fiscal deficit for 2008-09 can go up by one percentage point from 2.5 per cent of the GDP projected in the budget.        
	This is because the government will have to provide for another Rs 11,000 crore on account of the new loan waiver, besides money to fund fertiliser subsidies and the Pay Commission recommendations for the 3.1 million government workers.        
	D. Joshi, chief economist of Crisil, said, It (the farm loan waiver) will show up as a cost somewhere. There are no free lunches. It will impact the fiscal deficit, the degree of impact will depend on the final packaging.        
	Maharashtra farm activists said the new offer was laughable and would not benefit a large number of cotton farmers of Vidarbha, reeling under a severe drought.        
	We had demanded that a blanket loan waiver on loans up to Rs 50,000 should be given to all farmers irrespective of land holdings. However, under the new decision farmers with more than two hectares can get a waiver on loans only up to Rs 20,000. Most farmers would be disappointed with this, said Shetkari Sanghatana leader Vijay Jawandia, who has been fighting for the rights of the Vidarbha farmers.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram: Hopeful                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet top officials of public sector banks tomorrow to review the current interest rate structure and its impact on credit growth.        
	The meeting is being held just a day after official data showed that industrial growth had nearly halved to 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of the current financial year from 10.3 per cent a year ago.         
	Chidambaram will be meeting the bank chiefs for the first time after the quarterly review of the Reserve Banks monetary policy on July 29.         
	The RBI had raised both the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by 50 basis points to 9 per cent on that day.         
	Following the RBIs move, many banks had raised their lending rates.        
	Economists attributed the industrial slowdown to the poor performance of manufacturing because of rising interest rates. They projected the economy to grow at sub-eight per cent this fiscal from 9.1 per cent last year.        
	It is expected that the finance minister will also review the implementation of the debt waiver scheme.        
	Chidambaram may even ask banks to increase credit exposure to productive sectors and cut down credit growth to unproductive segments.        
	Banks could also be asked to keep interest rates as low as possible for key sectors such as housing and education.

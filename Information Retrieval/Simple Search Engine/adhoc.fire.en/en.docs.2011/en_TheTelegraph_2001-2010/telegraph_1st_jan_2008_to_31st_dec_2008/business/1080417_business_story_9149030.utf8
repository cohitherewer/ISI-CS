          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    Paswan, Nath: Common cause      
	New Delhi, April 16: A group of ministers, which met today to take a decision on raising taxes on iron ore exports and slashing the duty on steel imports to zero, have agreed on measures that would be revenue neutral.         
	We will submit the report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow ... we are willing to cut duties but we have to balance this with revenue outgo, said steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan.         
	The meeting at Udyog Bhawan was attended by steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, commerce minister Kamal Nath and finance minster P. Chidambaram.         
	The committee met to resolve a spat among ministries over differing positions on taxes.        
	On the agenda was a decision on slashing the customs duty on steel and zinc imports to zero, imposing an ad valorem tax on iron ore exports and reducing the countervailing duty on construction-grade steel.        
	A possible hike in export duties on iron ore and a cut in excise duty on semi-finished steel to 8 per cent were also discussed.         
	The higher export tax on iron ore is slated to be 15 per cent of its value, instead of the current Rs 50-a-tonne in case of low-grade ore and Rs 300 for a tonne of high-grade ore.         
	The commerce ministry had opposed a move to increase taxes on iron ore exports as it felt the move would kill exports. Moreover, the mining industry has already made long-term commitments to buyers abroad, the ministry argued.        
	The revenue implications of a tax cut on steel is Rs 5,000 crore. The finance ministry has made it clear that it would like to club the earnings from taxes on iron ore with the duty cuts on steel imports and a excise rebate on semi-finished steel.         
	The meeting also discussed the reclassification of railway freight charges to reduce rates for carrying steel and iron ore, but a final decision on this is possible only if the railway ministry agrees.        
	The meeting also decided to ban futures trade in steel and iron. Steel prices have gone up 49 per cent in the past one year.         
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today told Parliament there was reason to believe that the cement and steel manufacturers are behaving like a cartel... If their behaviour does not change, the government will not hesitate to take tough measures.        
	Paswan said in case the steps discussed today did not work, the government could declare steel an essential commodity, which would give the government powers to fix the prices of steel products.         
	The government could also consider appointing a steel regulator.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The economic survey has called for divestment of government stakes in profit-making non-navratnas, auction of loss-making PSUs that cannot be revived, regulated entry of private players in coal mining and sale of old oilfields by state firms.        
	The survey said the government should remove bottlenecks in infrastructure, revamp labour laws and increase the supply of raw materials and inputs.        
	Between April and November 2007, industry grew 9.2 per cent against 10.9 per cent in the same period in 2006-07.         
	During this period, automobiles, textiles, metal products and non-metallic mineral output were the laggards.         
	Consumer durables, too, did not fare well.        
	The slide in consumer durables can partly be attributed to the constrained demand conditions arising from adjustments in policy variables such as interest rates, the survey said.        
	It also asked the government to list all unlisted public sector enterprises and sell a minimum of 10 per cent of equity to the public.         
	In oil, the suggestion for the sale of old oilfields is on the grounds of the need for funds to revive sagging output of these fields through new technology.        
	The survey also called for allowing private players in coal mining, privatising oil mines to improve recovery of in place reserves by 5 to 10 per cent.        
	Entry of private players in coal mining will bring new technology and infuse more competition in coal.

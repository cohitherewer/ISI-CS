	The finance minister today presented the last budget of the UPA government before it faces the general elections next year. The budget lays strong emphasis on growth in social sector and agriculture.         
	The budget does not propose to reduce the corporate tax rate which remains at 33.99 per cent. However, to encourage investors to remain invested for the long term, the FM has increased the tax rate on short-term capital gains from the transfer of listed equity shares or units of an equity oriented fund, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.         
	With a view to help domestic companies to efficiently structure their businesses, the FM has proposed to introduce a mechanism by which a domestic parent company can claim a set-off of the dividends received from the subsidiary company against the distributable dividends while computing dividend distribution tax, subject to the conditions that the subsidiary company has paid dividend distribution tax and the parent company is not a subsidiary of another company. The proposed amendment is to mitigate the cascading effect of dividend distribution tax up to one level.         
	With respect to the computation of the minimum alternate tax, it has been clarified that the book profits shall be increased by the amount of deferred tax and the provision therefore, if debited to a profit and loss account. Further, it also proposes that the amount of income tax to be added to the book profits shall include dividend distribution tax, interest on tax, surcharge and education cess. It is important to note that these amendments are proposed to be effective retrospectively from assessment year 2001-02.        
	Currently, the benefit of amortisation of specified post commencement preliminary expenses for the extension of an industrial undertaking or for setting up of industrial unit is available to the manufacturing sector for five consecutive years. With a view to provide a level playing field to the service sector, this benefit of amortisation has also been extended to the service sector.         
	The corporate tax provisions in the budget do attempt to rationalise some of the existing provisions and to provide relief in some cases. Corporates are may be justified in being a bit disappointed at the fact that the surcharge which was intended to be temporary was not removed, or at the very least reduced.         
	May be the FM could have done more for corporates in view of the record tax collections in 2007-08.                    AUTHORS ARE FROM KPMG

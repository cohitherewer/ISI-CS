The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | JPMorgan ups Bear bid
                                                                                                               JPMorgan ups Bear bid
                              BACK IN NEWS                            
	New York, March 24 (Reuters): JPMorgan Chase amp; Co has raised its all-stock offer for Bear Stearns to about $10 a share, roughly five times its original offer.        
	Under the revised terms of the deal, each share of Bear Stearns common stock will be exchanged for 0.21753 shares of JPMorgan common stock.        
	JPMorgan will also purchase 95 million new Bear Stearns shares, representing 39.5 per cent of the investment banks outstanding common stock. JPMorgan is buying the shares at the same price as its takeover offer and expects to complete the deal by April 8.        
	The boards of both companies have approved the revised takeover offer and the share purchase agreement.        
	JPMorgans original agreement on March 16 to pay $2 per share in stock for Bear Stearns was widely considered a fire-sale price for the 85-year-old Wall Street investment bank. Bear collapsed as large sub-prime mortgage losses and falling confidence in the company prompted a run on the bank.        
	Bear shares surged more than 65 per cent to $10.60 on news of the higher bid.         
	The original Bear takeover agreement was forged with the support of federal regulators, and the US Federal Reserve is balking at the higher price, The New York Times said, citing people involved in the talks.        
	The newspaper said the Fed originally directed JPMorgan to pay no more than $2 per share to assure that it would not appear that Bear shareholders were being rescued.        
	Representatives of Bear and the Fed were not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. An offer of $10 per share would value Bear at more than $1 billion. That price, however, is less than one-third of the stocks price on March 14, the last trading day before the original deal was announced. It is also less than 10 per cent of the stocks price throughout much of 2007.        
	Jamie Dimon, JPMorgans chief executive, grew convinced the merger was in jeopardy after spending much of the last week taking calls from indignant Bear shareholders, The New York Times said.        
	Among these shareholders was British entrepreneur Joseph Lewis, who spent well over $1 billion on some 12.1 million Bear shares, including some as recently as March 13. Last week, Lewis said he would take whatever action was needed to protect his investment.

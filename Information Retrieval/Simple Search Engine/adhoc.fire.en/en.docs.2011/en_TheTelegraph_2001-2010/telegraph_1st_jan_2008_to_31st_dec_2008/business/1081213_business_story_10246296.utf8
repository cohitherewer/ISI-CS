	Washington, Dec. 12 (Reuters): The Bush administration warned on Friday that the US economy could not withstand the collapse of the auto industry and said it might be willing to provide emergency funding to bail out the auto makers, a day after Congress failed to pass a bill doing the same.        
	Democratic leaders and the main US auto workers union appealed to the administration for emergency funds after a US Senate deal to save Detroits Big Three auto makers collapsed in acrimony late on Thursday.        
	Analysts said without quick help, General Motors and Chrysler could face bankruptcy. The administration said it was considering tapping a $700-billion financial industry bailout fund to prevent an industrywide collapse.        
	Given the current weakened state of the US economy, we will consider other options, including use of the TARP (troubled assets relief programme), to prevent a collapse of troubled auto makers, White House spokesperson Dana Perino told reporters.        
	The United Auto Workers blamed the failure of the $14-billion bailout on Senate Republicans who want more wage concessions from the union.         
	The UAW said it was now up to treasury secretary Henry Paulson to find a way to bail out GM and Chrysler, along with Ford.        
	India plans        
	GM today said the failure of the bailout package of the Big Three  GM, Chrysler and Ford  will not have any impact on its planned investment in India.         
	We are on track with our planned investments, General Motors India vice-president P. Balendran said.        
	Ford India also said its $500-million investment plans for the country were on track.        
	Our investment plans have not changed, a Ford India spokesperson said.                                                                          
	The ball is squarely in his court, the UAW said in a statement. He has the power to prevent the imminent collapse of the companies and the disastrous consequences that will follow, it said.                                                   
	The administration had previously supported the Senate compromise measure, which had earlier passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.        
	The Treasury had said on Thursday it still believed the financial industry bailout funds were intended only to help the financial sector, while the White House said it was studying its options.        
	Congressional Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi had already asked Bush to reconsider this position, a call echoed by some Republicans who represent districts dependent on auto industry jobs.        
	Bush shouldmove now, said Republican Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, adding,The dominoes are already falling throughout the United States.        
	Thursdays Senate deal fell apart over proposed wage concessions by the UAW, including the date at which the Detroit autoworkers would accept pay parity with workers at foreign-owned U.S. auto plants.        
	While the autoworkers blamed Republicans for settingan arbitrary deadline for parity, some analysts said the UAW had revealed it was not ready for the wrenching changes any auto bailout and restructuring program would require.        
	If they wont move that distance before they got the money, why would they ever move that distance after they get the money? Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland, told theCBS This Morning program.        
	Polls show Americans split on bailing out Detroit. The U.S. automakers are widely criticized for fighting tougher fuel efficiency standards and poor model designs that have left the companies gasping with a stable of products losing popularity with consumers.        
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said it was possible Congress could try again at a rescue in January when Democrats will have larger majorities in both houses. President-elect Barack Obama, who takes office on Jan. 20, favors helping the automakers.        
	Billions in aid        
	General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC sought billions in aid to see them through March and have warned of potential collapse if they did not receive a bailout. Ford is in slightly better financial shape but says it needs a major line of credit.        
	U.S. stocks fell on Friday, indicating major markets could open down 3 percent or more following sharp downturns in Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 2 percent in early trade.        
	Because of their shared suppliers and vendors, industry observers fear the failure of one Detroit manufacturer could drag down the other two as well as other businesses at a moment when the U.S. economy is already in a deepening recession.        
	Lawmakers have been among the industrys biggest critics. But Democrats and some Republicans  and the White House in the end  had fought to craft a legislative lifeline because no one wanted to be blamed for an economic disaster if any of the companies went bankrupt.        
	Job losses hit a 34-year high in November and the unemployment rate reached a 15-year high.        
	GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler employ nearly 250,000 people directly and 100,000 more jobs at parts suppliers could hang on their survival. The companies say one in 10 U.S. jobs are tied to the auto sector, which adds up to several million.        
	GM and Chrysler both said that in the face of their cash crises, they had hired outside advisers to help them explore possible bankruptcy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mukesh buddy breaks into Anil turf
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mukesh buddy breaks into Anil turf
          SAUMITRA DASGUPTA                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 3: The title fight used to read: Ambani vs Ambani.        
	That script may soon change. Get ready for a gripping proxy battle where the card reads: Anand Jain versus Anil Ambani.        
	Jain (51), Mukesh Ambanis closest buddy, has started to muscle into areas such as power generation, telecom and city gas distribution  areas that were supposed to be Anils exclusive preserve for at least 10 years under the terms of a non-compete agreement between the two Ambani camps before the carve-up of Dhirubhais empire in early 2006.        
	Jains biggest foray is in the area of special economic zones: his company, Jai Corp Ltd, is a stakeholder in the entities that will be developing the 5,000-hectare Mumbai SEZ and the 5,289-acre Navi Mumbai SEZ  the two large projects conceived by the Mukesh Ambani group. He is the chairman of the boards of both SEZs.        
	He is also developing a mega port-based SEZ at Rewas with 70 deep draught berths on the west coast of Maharashtra, about 10km away from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. Jai Corps annual report for 2007-08 says, Rewas port will emerge as the Rotterdam of Asia.         
	It plans to establish nine berths in the initial phase with a draught of 20 metres against an average 12.5 metres in other Indian ports.        
	However, the foray into SEZs has also been a nice little ruse to push into areas that Mukesh Ambani cannot enter till at least late 2015 without running foul of the non-compete pact.        
	So, Jai Corp has set up three associate companies  Urban Energy Generation Pvt Ltd, Urban Energy Distribution Pvt Ltd and Urban Energy Transmission Pvt Ltd. Jai Corp holds a 26 per cent stake in each of the three entities.        
	Whats wrong with that? A great deal.        
	The non-compete agreement also bars the Mukesh Ambani group from helping anyone else set up business in these prohibited areas till such time as it is in force. This could spark another legal quibble over whether Mukesh and Anand are colluding to circumvent the restrictions spelt out in the pact.         
	Expansion plans        
	Jains Urban Energy Generation has already received approvals and environmental clearance for a 2,000MW gas-based power plant at Dronagiri in Navi Mumbai. In the first phase, it will set up a 700MW plant for captive use by the SEZs.        
	The company has also received two support letters from the Maharashtra government to set up two other gas-based power plants each with a capacity of 2,100MW  one to be located at Kondgaon near Nagothane in Raigad district (which also houses the bedevilled Enron project) and the other at Kalamboli in Thane district.        
	The company proposes to make power available to the other consumers after meeting the needs of the SEZs, says the annual report.        
	There is no word about where it plans to source the gas from. With Reliance Industries planning to start commercial production from the D-6 gas field in the Krishna-Godavari basin sometime in October, it might want to tap that source. That will depend on how the court battle between the Ambani brothers over gas supply and pricing pans out.        
	The other big area of promise is city gas distribution  an area where several companies, including GAIL (India) Ltd and the Anil Ambani group, plan to enter in a big way.         
	The newly formed downstream regulator  Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board  is currently vetting a sheaf of proposals relating to city gas distribution projects. It isnt clear whether Jain has submitted his application.        
	Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Gas recently submitted expressions of interest to the gas regulator for 54 cities, including Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. But he is barred from distributing gas in Mumbai under the pact.        
	Jai Corp has formed three wholly owned subsidiaries  Urban Gas Ltd, Urban Gas Distribution Ltd and Urban Gas Suppliers Ltd  to anchor its ambitions in this arena. All three became subsidiaries of Jai Corp on February 27, indicating that this plan might have been conceived fairly recently.        
	Initially, piped gas will be delivered to large residential townships within the SEZs and later extended to other townships that the company plans to build in other areas.         
	Going forward, the company will also cater to the LPG requirements of other small cities, the report added.        
	There is less information available on the telecom business even though this is also a stated objective. Urban Telecom Pvt Ltd was an associate of Jai Corp until last December and was then presumably spun off to some group entity.         
	There are two other associates  Urban Communication Infrastructure Ltd and Urban Infotech Solutions  which might provide services within the SEZs.        
	Pact problems        
	The non-compete pact is pretty unequivocal: telecom, power generation and distribution, financial services and city gas distribution in Delhi and Mumbai are reserved for the Anil camp.        
	The agreement sets December 21, 2005, as the effective date from which it commences but there are sliding dates for protection of Anils exclusive turf: 10 years from the date the ADAG group took control of the telecom entities (February 7, 2006); and 10 years from April 1, 2009 in the case of power generation and distribution.        
	The agreement defines the two camps as the demerged group (i.e. Mukesh Ambani entities) and the resulting group (Anil Ambani outfits).        
	In power, the agreement is very explicit; it even carries an illustration. It says, if the demerged group commences the business of power generation internationally and sells electricity in India, the same would constitute a subject of the non-compete obligation of the demerged group in favour of the resulting group, and would be a prohibited activity for the demerged group to the extent of the sale of electricity in the territory of India.        
	The agreement specifically bars the Mukesh Ambani group from helping anyone else set up business in these prohibited areas till such time as it is in force.         
	It says, RIL agrees to ensure that  for so long as resulting group companies are in compliance with their obligationsneither it nor any of its affiliates or any company or entity promoted by RIL shallengage or attempt to or assist any other person to engage in, participate in or carry on any of the resulting group businesses, directly or indirectly, either on its own account or as a partner, agent, consultant, manager, associate or shareholder.        
	Money muscle        
	Jai Corp is a fairly small entity in comparison to the Ambani behemoths: it had a turnover of Rs 327.9 crore in the year ended March 31 and a net profit of Rs 128.2 crore. But it carried forward a surplus of Rs 238 crore.        
	However, it is preparing for a major financing programme. Last week, its shareholders approved a resolution to raise money through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue.        
	The question that all this raises is this: can Anil Ambani do anything to block the strategy?         
	Back in July, the Mukesh Ambani camp used the non-compete pact to scuttle a deal between Reliance Communications and South Africa-based MTN that involved that involved the sale of a part of the promoters stake in R-Com.        
	Anil could use it as well to stymie Jain.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: Construction firm J Kumar Infraprojects Limited will hit the capital markets with an initial public offering of 6.5 million equity shares of Rs 10 each at a price to be decided through a 100 per cent book-building process. The issue will open on January 18 and close on January 23. The price band has been fixed between Rs 110 and Rs 120 per share. 
    
	We plan to deploy Rs 51 crore for the purchase of capital equipment and Rs 19 crore will be used to cover other capital requirements, said Kamal J. Gupta, executive director of J Kumar Infraprojects. 
    
	The net issue will constitute 30.4 per cent of the fully diluted post issue paid-up capital of the company. 
    
	As of November 30, 2007, the companys order book was Rs 461.15 crore. This includes some projects that are yet to take off as well as some unfinished and uncertified portions of projects. 
    
	We have a land bank of around 1,200 square metres near Pune, but no plans on that as yet, Gupta said. 
    
	The company also has no immediate plans to enter the real estate sector. We prefer the engineering work that we do, he added. 
    
	However, the company is building a 22-floor building at Goregaon in western Mumbai suburb for commercial purposes. 
    
	We are just building it for the clients. We are ourselves not into realty at present. We may think of getting into realty in the future but not as of now, he added.

          OURS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatnagar: New role                                  
	Calcutta, May 14: ArcelorMittal today appointed Vijay Kumar Bhatnagar as the chief executive officer for its Indian operations.        
	Bhatnagar will replace Sanak Mishra who has been redesignated as vice-president and CEO of greenfield projects.         
	Bhatnagar, a former Indal executive, is a member of the management committee of ArcelorMittal. He was previously executive vice-president of ArcelorMittals eastern European operations (flat and long products), looking after Poland, Romania and Czech Republic.        
	The reshuffle comes at a time when the worlds largest steel company is gearing up to invest $20 billion in India.         
	Industry observers say Bhatnagar will become the new face of the company here.         
	Mishra, a Steel Authority of India old-timer, will be in charge of onfield implementations, more like a chief operating officer.        
	M.P. Singh has also been appointed vice-president for mining projects in the merger and acquisition group.        
	Bhatnagar joined the erstwhile Mittal Steel in 2002 after spending decades in Calcutta-based Indal, formerly Indian Aluminium. He is a metallurgical engineer and has a bachelors degree in engineering (metallurgy) from the Regional Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur.         
	Net profit        
	ArcelorMittal has reported a net profit of $2.37 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2008, up 5.4 per cent over the same period last year, backed by higher steel production and increased prices.

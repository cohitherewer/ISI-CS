	Railway minister Lalu Prasad today had his audience in splits with his own brand of poetry while delivering the railway budget. Starting the speech with self-adulation, Lalu said, Sab kah rahe hain humne gazab kaam kiya hai, karoron ka munafa har ek shaam diya hai, phal salon yeh ab dega, paudha jo lagaya hai, seva ka smaran ka hamne farz nibhaya hai. Later, referring to the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chak de India, he said in true Bollywood style, We are scoring goal after goal in every match. Every child in the country will now say Chak De Railway.
          
	The e-ticketing facility will now be extended to passengers on the waiting list. Online display screens will be installed by March 2009 to inform passengers on the remaining distance and the likely time of arrival at the approaching station. 
          
	Private professional agencies will be employed to help maintain cleanliness in passenger trains, railway lines and waiting rooms. The minister proposed to place discharge-free green toilets in all the 36,000 coaches by the end of 2012 at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. Each toilet will cost around 1.5 lakh and ensure cleaner train tracks. 
          
	The minister announced free monthly passes for girl students up to the graduation level. A seven-coach Mother and Child Express with facilities such as delivery rooms, and child health centres are also part of the budget kitty.

	London, Jan. 3: Two of the most prestigious names in British, indeed world motoring  Jaguar and Land Rover  could soon be in Indian hands after Ford today confirmed weeks of media speculation that it would like to sell to Tata Motors rather than to rival bidders, Mahindra amp; Mahindra and Americas One Equity Partners. 
    
	The estimated Pound 1.5billion deal is not quite in the bag because detailed negotiations need to be completed but a source at Tata (UK) joyfully told The Telegraph: This is a big coup for India. Jaguar and Land Rover are in safe hands. 
    
	This is also the assessment of the British unions which point out that the livelihoods of 40,000 people in the UK, 18,000 of them directly employed at Jaguar and Land Rover plants, depend on who owns two of Britains best loved brands. 
    
	Fears expressed in America that Jaguars prestige will be driven down by Indian ownership were not shared today by the British unions following Fords confirmation that it wants to settle matters with Tata Motors. 
    
	Andrew Dodgshon, spokesman for Unite, the biggest union at Jaguar and Land Rover, said to The Telegraph: The comments from America were most unfortunate. We dont want to come down to their level. 
    
	With the brands come remarkable skills which have often been handed down from father to son, the unions said proudly. 
    
	Although this news was expected before Christmas, formal confirmation that Tata is the preferred bidder (though Ford does not like to use this expression) came in statements released today in London and in Detroit, the companys global headquarters, from Lewis Booth, executive vice president, Ford Motor Company with responsibility for Premier Automotive Group (PAG) and Ford of Europe. 
    
	PAG is the company with responsibility for Jaguar and Land Rover. Ford is committed to focused negotiations at a more detailed level with Tata Motors concerning the potential sale of the combined Jaguar Land Rover business, Booth said. 
    
	There is still a considerable amount of work to do, and while no final decision has been made, we will proceed with further substantive discussions with Tata Motors over the forthcoming weeks with a view to securing an agreement that is in the best interests of all parties concerned. 
    
	The unions were unhappy when Ford first announced in June, 2007, that it wanted to sell Jaguar and Land Rover to shore up the biggest losses in the companys 103-year history. But the unions finally came round to the view that if the marquees had to be sold, they would much rather the buyer was Tata Motors. 
    
	Union officials also felt more confident about the future after talks with executives from Tata. 
    
	It has to be said that Ratan Tatas handling of the Pound6billion plus takeover of Corus, which has safeguarded the jobs of thousands of former British Steel workers, has given the unions further reassurance that he is perhaps a man who can be trusted. In particular, Tata is said to be keen to keep all three of Jaguar and Land Rovers UK factories, at Solihull and Castle Bromwich in the Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside. 
    
	Ford has circulated a memo to its UK workers, making it clear that the negotiations with Tata Motors would have to remain confidential and that a running commentary could not be provided. 
    
	A bulletin to workers, signed by Geoff Polites, chief executive officer of Jaguar and Land Rover, said the companys future for 2008 was a little clearer but the firms plan was unchanged. 
    
	He made the same point as Booth: There is still a considerable amount of work to do and, while no final decisions have been made at this time, Ford will proceed with further substantive discussions with Tata Motors over the forthcoming weeks. 
    
	However, he added: These are complex commercial discussions and Ford believes it is in the interests of all parties concerned if the process continues to be conducted in a confidential manner. Therefore, Ford is not discussing the content of its ongoing dialogue with Tata Motors at this point in time other than to say any final decisions Ford makes will be in the best interests of Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford. 
    
	The unions could still kick up a fuss if they feel the interests of their members are not being taken into account. 
    
	Plant and job security must be at the heart of discussions over the future of Jaguar Land Rover or Unite, Britains largest trade union, will not support or accept Fords intention to sell or transfer the company, Tony Woodley, Unite joint general secretary, warned in a statement. 
    
	It was explained he was not issuing an ultimatum but he stressed: We need further and more detailed meetings and discussions with Ford and Tata which will focus on the job security of our members in the Jaguar Land Rover and Ford plants in the UK. There are also crucial issues around wages, terms and conditions and pensions to address before any final decision is considered. 
    
	Ford, which bought Jaguar in 1989 for Pound1.6 billion and paid Pound1.7 billion for Land Rover in 2000, has said it hopes to conclude a deal by early this year. A sale to Tata would mark the first takeover of a major western car group by an Indian firm, analysts pointed out. 
    
	Ratan Tata may get involved in the negotiations at some point but it is understand they will probably be led by Ravi Kant, CEO and managing director of Tata Motors. 
    
	On behalf of Tata Motors, Financial Dynamics, the PR which acted on its behalf during the Corus takeover, issued a statement. 
    
	We have said for some time that we are interested in the Jaguar Land Rover business, it said. We can confirm that we have had positive discussions so far with Ford concerning the possible purchase of Jaguar Land Rover and we are now entering a period of more focused and detailed negotiations with Ford. 
    
	It went on: We hope both parties can reach an agreement in the forthcoming weeks, though these are complex discussions and there is still much work that needs to be done before that position is reached. We are pleased by the progress in the discussions to date and very positive about the prospects of this business going forward.

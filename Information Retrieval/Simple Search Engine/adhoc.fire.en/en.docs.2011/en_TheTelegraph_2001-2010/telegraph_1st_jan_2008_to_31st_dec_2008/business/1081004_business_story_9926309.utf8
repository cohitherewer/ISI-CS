          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Helping hand                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 3: It is suddenly a problem of plenty for Lehman Brothers India employees.        
	A fortnight back, the next months pay packet had looked uncertain as Lehman went bankrupt. And then, Japanese brokerage major Nomura had walked in as the saviour.        
	Now, it is raining gold.        
	On Friday as agencies reported Nomuras decision to buy out Lehmans last unsold operation in Asia as well, over 2,000 people at the Mumbai back office heaved a sigh of relief. All of them are expected to retain their jobs.        
	The icing on the cake is Nomuras decision not just to protect the salaries paid by Lehman  three times the amount that a Nomura employee otherwise gets  but also offer huge retention bonuses to all its India staff.        
	Though expensive, the move will fill several holes in Nomuras strategy, say Lehman India insiders.        
	It will allow Nomura to make a full-fledged push into prime brokerage services, bolster its programme trading operations and land more lucrative contracts by advising on overseas deals. But to do all this, it needed the right people with the right contacts and experience. And they are all here at Lehman India, said a Lehman employee who has just signed an employment contract with Nomura.        
	Lehmans back office in Mumbai handles the investment banks information technology, research, and trading settlements.        
	Suddenly we are spoilt for choice as everybody wants a piece of former Lehman staff, said an employee at Lehmans investment banking arm.        
	The top brass is expected to pocket anywhere between Rs 125 crore and Rs 130 crore to stay on with Nomura and hold on to their Lehman flock.        
	There was panic to retain the India staff after some of the top Lehman Asia officials joined UBS, Merrill Lynch and Blackstone, said an ex-Lehman India employee.        
	A top official at Lehman India said Nomuras incentives to stop staff from fleeing to rival banks at any cost would stretch the financially conservative Japanese firms cost-base.        
	Nomuras risk management is fairly strict. At Lehman, it was all about aggressive risk-taking. Will they be able to generate as much revenue as Lehman? There may be a mismatch in the way we are used to operate work and business, said an apprehensive Lehman employee.

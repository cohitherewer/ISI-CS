	New Delhi, Jan. 21: On a day when markets tumbled at home and abroad, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown proposed an insurance cover against sudden capital outflows. 
    
	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide the insurance. 
    
	The UK Prime Minister said the IMF should develop a financial instrument to insure well-managed economies against sudden reversals of capital flows. 
    
	He, however, gave no details of the scheme.
    
	Brown, who was addressing an industry meet here today, believes the rapid spread of credit crisis last year after problems involving US sub-prime mortgages indicates a failure in global financial supervision.
    
	We have to find new ways of dealing with global financial turbulence, he said. 
    
	I propose that the IMF should act with the same kind of independence as a central bank in a national country, Brown added.
    
	It should focus on the surveillance of the global economic and financial system. Its role should be to prevent crisis and not simply to manage or resolve them as in the past, Brown said.
    
	The IMF, working with the global Financial Stability Forum, should be at the heart of ... an early-warning system  involving regulators and supervisors in all countries  for financial turbulence affecting the global economy, the British Prime Minister said.
    
	The Financial Stability Forum includes central banks, regulators and international bodies.
    
	In his speech to Indian and British corporate bosses, Brown asked the World Bank, the IMF and the rich nations G-8 club to revamp their structures to reflect India and Asias rising prowess in the global economy. 
    
	I support changes to the World Bank, the IMF and G-8 that reflect the rise of India and Asia ... we can and must do more to make our global institutions more representative, he said.
    
	Brown also said he would press for an early agreement on an international system to help non-nuclear states acquire sources of energy and called for the creation of a multi-billion-dollar global climate change fund within the World Bank to finance environmentally sustainable development in the poorest countries.

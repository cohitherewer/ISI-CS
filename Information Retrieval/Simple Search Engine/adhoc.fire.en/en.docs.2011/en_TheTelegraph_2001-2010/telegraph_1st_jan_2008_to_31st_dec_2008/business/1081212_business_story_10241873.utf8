                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lower hotel price whets ITC appetite
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Deveshwar: Tactical move                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The slowdown in economic growth has thrown up an opportunity for ITC to buy hotels at attractive prices.        
	We are looking for opportunities to buy assets, particularly in the hotel area. We will buy where asset prices are feasible and are looking at all categories of hotels, ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar said.        
	Sources in ITC-Welcomgroup said the company could consider buying the new hotels of realtors who needed to raise cash. The tobacco-to-hotels-to-food group may also look at existing properties that are put up for sale.         
	For the acquisitions, Deveshwar said, ITC would not alter the size of its capital expenditure plan.         
	Last year, the Calcutta-based company said it planned to invest about Rs 15,000 crore in the next five to seven years in hotels, agri-businesses and FMCGs.         
	ITC sources said the company was unlikely to target any existing hotel group for a hostile takeover.         
	Russell Credit, a subsidiary, had bought a 14.95 per cent stake in East India Hotels two years ago. ITC officials have always maintained that the stake purchase was only for investment purpose.

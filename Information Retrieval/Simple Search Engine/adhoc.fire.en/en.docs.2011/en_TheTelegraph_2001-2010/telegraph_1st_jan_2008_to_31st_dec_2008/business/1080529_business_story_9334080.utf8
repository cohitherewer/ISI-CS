	Calcutta, May 28: Visa Steel has finalised plans to set up a 2.5-million-tonne steel plant in Chhattisgarh at an investment of Rs 8,000 crore.         
	It is preparing a detailed project report, and work for the first phase will start this year.        
	The company is building a stainless steel mill in Orissa.        
	Visa Steel plans to initially set up a rolling mill of one- million-tonne capacity at an investment of Rs 500-600 crore.        
	The company will start backward integration into primary steel making after receiving a captive iron ore mine lease on long-term contract from NMDC.        
	In Orissa, we built plants for primary steel making and then went on to finished products. Here, finished products will be followed by backward integration, Visa Steel chairman Vishambhar Saran said.        
	Saran added that Visa had signed an MoU with Chhattisgarh before Orissa, but the Orissa project started first.        
	The Chhattisgarh project was stuck over legal disputes. However, it is over now. We have requisite land for the unit as well, Visa managing director Vishal Agarwal said.        
	The Chhattisgarh mill is expected to start production by 2011.        
	In Orissa, the company has already spent Rs 1,000 crore and has placed additional order of Rs 800 crore.         
	The plant is likely to be completed by the end of 2010-11.        
	The company is selling pig iron, low ash met coke and ferro chrome in Orissa.        
	Saran said Visa Steel would double its ferro chrome capacity in Orissa at an investment of Rs 80 crore.        
	Ferro chrome prices are now at a record high all over the world        
	The company is waiting for an Iron ore mine lease from Orissa.         
	It has been awarded a part of the Patrapada coal block at Talcher, which has a deposit of 54 million tonnes.         
	It is also developing a chrome ore deposit.         
	Profit rises        
	Visa Steel posted a revenue of Rs 259.66 crore in the fourth quarter of 2007-08, while profit stood at Rs 20.99 crore.        
	For the whole fiscal, revenue was Rs 682.81 crore and profit was Rs 43.15 crore.         
	The company has announced a 10 per cent dividend.        
	Power venture        
	Visa Power is gearing up to start work on its 1200 mega watt plant at Chhattisgarh.         
	It will invest Rs 5,000 crore to set up the plant.         
	The company has already started acquiring land and is expected to commission the plant by 2012.

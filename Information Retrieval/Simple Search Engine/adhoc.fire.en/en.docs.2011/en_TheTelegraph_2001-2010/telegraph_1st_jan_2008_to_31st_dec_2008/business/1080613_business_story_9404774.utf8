          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani with wife Nita in Mumbai on Thursday (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, June 12: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will sell gas produced from its KG basin at a price one-fifth of the cost of global crude.        
	While international gas prices are hovering around $14 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), Reliance will sell the same at $4.2 mmBtU as desired by the government.        
	Disclosing this at the companys 34th annual general meeting (AGM) here today, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said gas sales, to commence this year, would be at a wellhead price equivalent to $25.2 per barrel of crude compared with the current market price of $135 per barrel.        
	Sources said the RIL chief was only trying to drive home the point that it would sell gas cheap. International prices of gas are now ruling at around $14 mmBtu. We will be selling much cheaper despite a surge in costs incurred in the exploration business, they said.        
	Last year, Reliance had invited a few power and fertiliser companies to participate in a price discovery programme for the gas produced from the KG basin. After receiving bids from these companies, RIL had indicated a price of $4.33 per mmBtu. However, the government fixed the wellhead price at $4.2 per mmBtu.        
	RIL aims to produce 80 million standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) of gas from the KG block.        
	The company is now locked in a legal battle with Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd, and Bombay High Court has restrained RIL from selling gas to third parties.        
	The matter will come up for hearing on July 22.        
	Speaking about exploration and production, Ambani said the company had set an ambitious resource accretion target of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. To achieve this, an aggressive exploration campaign aimed at diversifying its search for new accumulations over the next three years will be launched.        
	We plan to drill a majority of our blocks during this period. We also propose to accelerate our campaign in the Krishna-Godavari basin, he said.        
	Referring to the KG D6 block, Ambani said the two major deepwater fields were poised to go on stream with a combined capacity of about 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is about 44 per cent of Indias current indigenous production.        
	At current prices of crude oil of $135 dollars per barrel, they imply an annual saving of Rs 114,000 crore in energy imports by India. The price approved by the government for selling this gas implies a potential savings of about Rs 85,000 crore for Indian consumers, he added.

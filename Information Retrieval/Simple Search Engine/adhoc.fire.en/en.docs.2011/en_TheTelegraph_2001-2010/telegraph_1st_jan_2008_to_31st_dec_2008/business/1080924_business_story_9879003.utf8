	Calcutta, Sept. 23: After a disappointing first quarter, bank profits are set to look up in the second quarter ending September 30.        
	In the April-June quarter, the net profit margin  its the ratio of net profit to income of banks fell to 7.3 per cent from 10.6 per cent in the January-March quarter, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.         
	For the first time since June 2005, the growth in net profit of banks fell in the first quarter of the current fiscal because of higher provisionings. However, things are looking up in the second quarter. Banks margins are likely to go up compared with the June quarter.        
	Net profit margin will recover to 9.7 per cent (from 7.3 per cent in the June quarter), while growth in banks total income (during the second quarter) will remain healthy at 23.8 per cent, the CMIE report said.        
	Strong credit growth, in an environment of high lending rates, may help banks in improving their performance.        
	Banks had started jacking up their lending and deposit rates from the beginning of this calendar year following tight monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to curb soaring inflation and liquidity in the system. At present, public sector banks benchmark lending rates vary between 12.75 per cent and 14 per cent, while those of private sector banks are in the 13.50-17.25 per cent range.         
	Banks profit margin fell in the June quarter because they witnessed a significant moderation in net interest income, which is interest earned from advances and discounting of bills minus interest paid on deposits.         
	Net interest income started looking up from July as there was a moderation of deposit costs, while banks also raised their lending rates by 0.50 percentage points following a hike in the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by the RBI.         
	Credit expansion        
	Despite high lending rates, banks credit growth, particularly non-food loans, has been robust till the end of August.         
	According to RBI data, year-on-year growth in aggregate bank credit as on August 29 this year was 25.3 per cent, or Rs 4,96,025 crore, compared with Rs 3,66,095 crore (22.9 per cent).         
	Non-food credit growth in April-August this year was Rs 96,476 crore compared with Rs 39,151 crore in the same period last year.

	New Delhi, March 15: Tata Motors will shift the production of its maxi-van Winger and Magic, the passenger variant of its mini truck Ace, to Uttarakhand by next year.        
	The Winger is produced in Pune, while the Magic is manufactured at the companys facility at Rudrapur. But we plan to shift the entire production to Uttarakhand by the middle of next year, said Ravi Pisharody, vice-president  sales and marketing, Tata Motors.         
	Set up at an investment of Rs 1,000 crore, the Rudrapur facility has a production capacity of 2.25 lakh units per annum. The company plans to utilise the full capacity of the plant by the end of the next year, he said.        
	Tata Motors plans to come out with independent production hubs that will focus on making particular vehicles, instead of the earlier integrated facility where it had the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle production lines under the same roof.

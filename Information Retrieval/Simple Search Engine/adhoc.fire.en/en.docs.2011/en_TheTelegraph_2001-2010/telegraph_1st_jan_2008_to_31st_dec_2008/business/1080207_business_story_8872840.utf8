The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US does a disservice to stocks
                                                                                                            US does a disservice to stocks
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: The sensex tumbled 523.67 points as markets crashed around the world after the US services sector  which accounts for two-thirds of the economy  reported its sharpest contraction since 2001, deepening concerns that the worlds largest economy was heading for a recession.        
	Before settling at 18139.49, the 30-share sensex touched a low of 17936.01 at the middle of the trading session because of huge selling pressure in technology stocks. Led by bluechip stocks, Wipro and Infosys, the IT index remained the worst hit with a plunge of over 5.5 per cent. The Nifty also tumbled 161.35 points to close at 5322.55 for the day.         
	The IMS Services Data, which was released yesterday in the US, suggested that the US economy was headed for a sharp downturn.         
	Almost immediately, the Dow index started falling before closing the day with losses of over 3 per cent.        
	The Asian indices also experienced a steep fall as investors scrambled to dump shares. The Hang Seng index swooned 5.40 per cent, while Japans Nikkei lost about 4.7 per cent. The S amp;P and the Nasdaq, too, tripped over 3 per cent each, mirroring weak US signals and concerns of a slowdown in foreign fund inflows.         
	The IMS data indicated that the US economy is nearing a recession phase, and this has eventually impacted the Asian indices too. The Indian market is just replicating the Asian markets. But, there is a strong probability of a further rate cut by the Federal Reserve before its next meeting on March 18, said Manish Sonthalia, vice-president (market strategy) of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.        
	According to Sonthalia, if the Fed comes out with a rate cut now, all the global markets, including India, will surge. The long-term India story is still intact and the market should see at least 15 per cent growth by March 2009. In the short term, the market should stay in the range of 17500 to 19000, he added.        
	Leading the slide, frontline stocks such as Wipro, Infosys and ICICI Bank lost about 6.45 per cent, 6.25 per cent, and 3.11 per cent, respectively.         
	Market experts believe that the selling pressure is higher in frontline IT and technology stocks as 30 to 40 per cent of their overall revenues originate in the US.         
	The FII figures have also turned negative. A huge amount of redemption has been taking place in emerging market funds and Asia dedicated funds which too is playing a role in this downturn, said Mihir Vora, senior vice-president at HSBC Mutual Fund.        
	The volatility will continue for the next two to three months. Even if the budget comes out with positive announcements, the euphoria will be short-lived, he added.

	New Delhi, June 12: Industry grew 7 per cent in April against just 3 per cent in March on the back of a strong show by manufacturing and mining.        
	However, the growth was much higher at 11.3 per cent in April 2007, according to data on the index of industrial production released by the Central Statistical Organisation.        
	Attributing the year-on-year slowdown to high interest rates and costlier inputs, Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi estimated average industrial growth in this fiscal at 7 per cent.        
	Much of the April rebound is led by stronger growth in manufacturing and mining, which rose 7.5 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively, said Sonal Verma, analyst, Lehman Brothers.        
	Capital goods, a component of the index, surged to 14.2 per cent against 10.9 per cent in April 2007, while consumer durables grew 5.5 per cent against 2.4 per cent a year ago.        
	The sudden consumption spurt is surprising, but the increase in durable goods output could be in anticipation of future price hikes, Verma said.        
	However, analysts doubt the sustainability of the current growth momentum.         
	Joshi said growth could be impacted by the rising cost of borrowing, higher input costs, declining consumer purchasing power and weakening external demand.         
	During the month, as many as 14 of the 17 industry segments showed positive growth.        
	Beverages, tobacco and related products galloped by 30.7 per cent followed by basic chemicals and chemical products, which shot up by 15.4 per cent, and transport equipment and parts, which grew 11.4 per cent.        
	On the other hand the three industry groups, food products, jute and other vegetable fibre textiles, and textile products, have shown negative growth of 6.3 per cent, 9.9 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI adds shine to deposits
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SBI adds shine to deposits
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Crowd puller                                  
	Mumbai, May 26: In a surprise move, the State Bank of India (SBI) today raised interest rates on deposits of select maturities by 25 to 50 basis points.        
	The countrys largest bank increased the interest rate on three-to five-year deposits by 35 basis points to 8.85 per cent.        
	One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.        
	The rate of interest on five- to 10-year deposits has been hiked by 50 basis points to 9 per cent. In the case of two-to three-year deposits, the revised interest rate stands at 8.75 per cent, an increase of 25 basis points.        
	The SBI becomes the second nationalised bank after Bank of India (BoI) to make deposits more attractive after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tweaked its monetary policy on April 29.        
	Earlier this month, BoI had raised interest rates on deposits of select maturities between 50 and 75 basis points. The bank hiked the rates for three maturity buckets.         
	For deposits less than Rs 15 lakh with a maturity period of one year to less than two years, the interest rate was revised to 9.15 per cent against 8.50 per cent earlier. Similarly, for deposits of two years to less than three years, interest rates were increased to 9.25 per cent from 8.75 per cent.        
	The rate on deposits of three years to less than five years was revised to 9.5 per cent from 8.75 per cent earlier.        
	When the RBI raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in its monetary policy, many banks had maintained that interest rates would remain stable because of adequate liquidity in the financial system and soft credit offtake.        
	In that context, the SBI move is surprising. This could be part of the banks asset-liability management exercise; or else the bank simply wants to garner more funds, said a banking analyst.         
	Though liquidity in the system is comfortable, it is slightly under pressure after the CRR hike came into effect on May 24.         
	Moreover, the RBI will siphon off more funds through planned gilt auctions.        
	The SBI move has triggered expectations that other banks may follow suit.         
	Though SBIs counterparts may be forced to revise their deposit rates, bankers say, this may not happen in a hurry. Banks could decide to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for now.        
	However, it is not public sector banks alone that are attracting depositors with better rates. Select private sector and foreign banks have also raised deposit rates and are offering attractive interest rates on certain tenures.         
	Barclays Bank, for instance, has recently announced an interest rate of 9.5 per cent on deposits of 366 days. Last month, Kotak Mahindra Bank had also revised its deposit rates. The bank offered a retail term deposit rate of 8.5 per cent on deposits of 271 days to less than one year and 9.25 per cent for deposits of one year to less than five years.

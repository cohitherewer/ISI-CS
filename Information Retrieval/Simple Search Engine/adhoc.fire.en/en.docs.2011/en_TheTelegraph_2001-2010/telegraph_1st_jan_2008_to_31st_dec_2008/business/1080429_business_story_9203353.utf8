          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Raja: Great going                          
	Sriperumbudur (Tamil Nadu), April 28: The Centre is upbeat on meeting the target of 500 million telephone connections by 2010.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja said the target of 25o million connections was met in 2007, and he was hopeful of reaching the 500 million mark by 2010.        
	Raja was speaking yesterday at the inauguration of Motorolas Rs 172.4-crore manufacturing facility at Sriperumbudur in Chennai. The Motorola plant will be one of the companys largest manufacturing unit outside the US, with capacity to produce over 12 million mobile phones and 6,500 base terminal stations every year.        
	Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, who was also present at the occasion, said the DMK government was keen to make Sriperumbudur the largest hub in the world for manufacturing mobile phone handsets. Nokia has a facility in the state, while Samsung is in the process of setting up a unit.         
	Sony Ericsson is also making handsets through Foxconn and Flextronics here, Karunanidhi said. Foxconn and Flextronics are the global outsourcing manufacturing partners for Sony Ericsson.        
	Sriperumbudur is also becoming Indias largest manufacturing hub for electronic hardware and automobiles, the chief minister said.         
	After the Renault-Nissan project kicks off in 2010, the total installed capacity in the region will exceed 12 lakh cars per year.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Equity mutuals lose sheen

	Calcutta, Sept. 27: Investors are preferring financial instruments other than equities as stocks markets in India and abroad remain volatile.        
	Net fund flow into equity mutual funds last month fell 90 per cent to Rs 123 crore compared with July. Net fund flow is the purchase of units, in terms of value, less the redemption of units.        
	The dip in the fund flow was primarily because of a 38 per cent decline in money flowing into the existing equity schemes of mutual funds, said an analyst with Sharekhan, one of the countrys leading brokerage firms.         
	Fund collection by new equity funds was 11 times higher at Rs 165 crore compared with Rs 15 crore collected in July.        
	However, total assets under the management of equity funds at the end of August stood at Rs 178,657 crore  a 1.6 per cent increase from July. But if we adjust it for the net inflows, the increase will be 1.5 per cent. This is in line with the 1.45-per-cent increase in the sensex in August, the Sharekhan analyst said.         
	Assets under all mutual funds witnessed three per cent growth to Rs 5,44,317 crore in August over July. This growth came on the back of mainly income funds and fixed maturity plans. Last month, 80 income funds were launched along with four equity funds.         
	In terms of fund mobilisation, income funds beat equity schemes. New income funds, most of which were fixed maturity plans, collected Rs 19,246 crore. In comparison, the four equity schemes could collect a paltry Rs 288 crore.         
	Among the four equity MFs launched in August, three were domestic diversified equity schemes that together collected Rs 165 crore, while one was a fund investing in overseas equities.        
	The diversified equity schemes were from Koreas Mirae Asset Global Commodity Stocks Fund, Escorts Leading Sector Funds and ICICI Prudential Banking and Financial Services Fund. Sahara Banking and Financial Services Fund, JM Multi Strategy Fund and JPMorgan India Alpha Fund also tapped the market in August. But since the allotment of units was not completed last month, their collections could not be known.

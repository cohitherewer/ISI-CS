	Calcutta, June 9: Japans Nisshin Steel and Spains Acerinox have shelved their plan to jointly develop a stainless steel plant in India after they agreed to put up a similar facility in Malaysia.        
	The companies said it would be difficult to continue with both projects simultaneously because of the paucity of funds and resources.        
	The development comes close on the heels of the Indian governments attempt to check steel prices by fiscal measures to contain inflation.        
	Steel firms consider the measures as detrimental to large investment.        
	Only last week, newly elected Assocham president and JSW Steel vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal had said that India could lose investments worth $ 100 billion in steel if the government persisted with the restriction on exports.        
	Stainless steel is exempted from an export duty which, therefore, should not have deterred Nissin-Acerinox.         
	However, if there is an attempt to control an industry which is global in nature, it may put doubt into investors minds, especially foreign entities.         
	Had Nisshin Steel gone ahead with its plan, it would have been the first Japanese steel maker to set up an unit.        
	Nippon Steel has a technical collaboration with Tata Steel but no manufacturing presence. Nisshin and Acerinox had been studying the local market from 2006. Apart from land, cheap power sources were a prime concern for the duo.         
	Nisshin, which has about 10 per cent stake in Acerinox, is the worlds second largest stainless steel maker.         
	The company was betting on Indias demand for stainless steel from various sectors such as kitchen units and electrical appliances. However, the two companies now believe that the demand will not grow as fast as expected.        
	It now plans to cater to the Indian market from the Malaysia plant. Since there is no import duty on steel, it appears to be a feasible idea.        
	Moreover, the two companies want to use the plant as a hub to supply to the Southeast Asian market.        
	Even though there is an export duty on only carbon steel, there is no certainty that stainless steel will not be included.         
	The government has said many times that it may take more administrative measures to contain inflation in the future.        
	The Malaysian plant will start operations by 2011. It will produce about 240,000 tonness of cold-rolled steel plate each year.

	Calcutta, March 26: Domestic and international food processing companies want to set up shop at the proposed food park at Amtala, South 24 Parganas.         
	Indrajit De, chairman of Eden City group, a developer of the project, said the park had evoked response from two Italian companies apart from a few from Delhi.        
	Our partner in the project is the Bangalore-based Salarpuria group. So we are hoping for a sizeable participation from the south, De said.        
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) holds a minority stake in the park, which is coming up on a 125-acre plot off Diamond Harbour Road.        
	Rakesh Salarpuria, chairman of Bengal Eden Salarpuria Infrastructure Company (BESIC), said the project would be completed in two years. It will require an investment of Rs 150 crore, he added.        
	Industry minister Nirupam Sen today laid the foundation stone for the project in the presence of land and land reform minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and WBIDC managing director M.V. Rao. Rao said the state was planing to build more such parks with BESIC.         
	Sen said only the steel and petrochemical sectors had received more investment proposals when compared with food processing in Bengal. We need to have more units to improve agriculture in the state, he said.        
	The park will have 85 acres dedicated to food processing. It will also have a cold chain, warehouses, truck terminal, drainage and sewerage treatment plant.

	New Delhi, Jan 15: Tata Motors New Indica will come with four different engine options. Two of these will be sourced from partner Fiat.
    
	The car is scheduled to be launched in the second quarter of the next financial year.
    
	Tata Motors will roll out two variants of the New Indica fitted with Fiats popular 1.3-litre multijet diesel engine and 1.2-litre petrol engine, besides the indigenously developed 1.4-litre dicor diesel engine and 1.2-litre petrol engine.
    
	The New Indica will sport Fiats multijet diesel and also its 1.2-litre petrol engine. The price for the Indica sporting Fiats multijet engine is still being worked out, said S. Ravishankar, senior general manager (engineering systems) of Tata Motors, at the 9th Auto Expo.
    
	The engines for the Indica and the Palio will be made at the Tata-Fiat joint venture plant at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra. 
    
	Fiat has also rolled out a diesel variant of its hatchback Palio, which is fitted with a 1.3-litre multijet engine. 
    
	The company has tied up with Suzuki India to produce the diesel engine.
    
	Maruti Suzuki India, the countrys largest car manufacturer, uses the engine in the diesel variant of its premium hatchback, the Swift.
    
	Beetle magic
    
	The original peoples car, Volkswagens Beetle, is all set to roll out on Indian roads. 
    
	Commonly known as the Bug, the Beetle will be launched in the middle of this year, said Adreas Prinz, managing director (passenger car division) of Volkswagen.
    
	Volkswagen is known as Beetle in India. We have studied the market and feel that there is space for it. We are planning to make it available by the middle of this year through imports, Prinz said.
     
	The two-door car will cost more than the Tatas Rs 1-lakh Nano.
    
	The cheapest Beetle to be sold in the European market is for around 17,000 euros. Since we will be importing them for India, the car will be a little expensive for many, Prinz added.

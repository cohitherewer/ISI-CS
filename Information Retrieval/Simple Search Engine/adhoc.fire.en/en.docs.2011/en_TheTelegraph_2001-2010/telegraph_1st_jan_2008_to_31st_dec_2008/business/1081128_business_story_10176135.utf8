   -Industry calls for tougher regulations          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Nov 27: India Inc is finally breaking out in anger.        
	For once, corporate chieftains chose not to play coy and blasted the government for its poor crisis management and its inability to detect and effectively deal with terrorist attacks in the country.    
	Industry chieftans such as Tata group chairman Ratan Naval Tata  whose premier hotel property, the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, was one of the prime targets of the terror attack in Mumbai  Rahul Bajaj and UB group chairman Vijay Mallya blamed the government for not cracking down on terrorism effectively.        
	We had a bomb blast some years ago. We should have learnt to get a crisis infrastructure in place that could snap to attention as soon as something happens, Tata told reporters outside Bombay House, the Tata headquarters.         
	It is a pity that the government has no crisis management mechanism and Mumbai looks like a city that has suffered the callousness of a third world country instead of being the financial capital of India. Guests who have been innocent have been killed. People got killed on the road, Tata said.        
	Bajaj group chairman Rahul Bajaj was equally vociferous. This government has no right to govern, said Bajaj.   
	He said governance was poor in many states and the repeated terrorist attacks raised serious questions about the ability of the authorities to deal with such situations.        
	Industrialists are billing these horrific attacks as Indias own 9/11 and are convinced that the countrys intelligence systems need to be reviewed.         
	This is Indias 9/11. It is a catastrophic eventThe government has to crack down on terrorism with a firm hand. For too long, we have soft-pedalled on issues, said Mallya who was amazed that terrorists could storm two of the top luxury hotels in the country.         
	It is time we all join this debate on terrorism and demand stronger leadership, including better laws to combat terror, said Ficci president Rajeev Chandrasekhar.        
	Habil Khorakiwala, chairman and managing director of Wockhardt, said, The attack on Mumbai happened mainly because we have not responded adequately to combat terrorism... it is time for politicians to come together to fight this war (against terror).        
	Harsh Pati Singhania, managing director of JK Paper, said, This is a war-like situation and should be treated as such ... we should brace ourselves resolutely and develop foolproof counter-terrorism mechanisms.        
	CII chief mentor Tarun Das said, Like we have so many business conferences, we must also have conferences to fight terrorism globally and in India.        
	Some, however, chose to pay safe. Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot refused to peg the blame on the government for poor crisis management.         
	This is a national tragedy just like one that the Americans faced when the World Trade Centre towers were hit by planes. If the US government could not save its people, how could we be saved from such as attacks, said Dhoot.        
	Analysts said the immediate effect of the terror attacks could be that some prospective overseas clients and international firms might put off planned visits to India. However, they said investor sentiment wont be affected.        
	Infosys chief mentor Narayan Murthy said he saw no impact on the flow of business.         
	Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, said companies were likely to be more cautious, but business would continue.        
	Managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank K.V. Kamath said he was sure that business would bounce back.

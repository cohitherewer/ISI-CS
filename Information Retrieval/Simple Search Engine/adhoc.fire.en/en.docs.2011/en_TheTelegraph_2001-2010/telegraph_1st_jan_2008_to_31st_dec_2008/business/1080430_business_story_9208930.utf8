	New Delhi, April 29: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has extended the seven-year income tax holiday to refineries starting operation by March 31, 2012. However, ambiguity persists over tax breaks to exploration and production firms, spelling trouble for the seventh round of new exploration licensing policy (Nelp).        
	The seven-year tax holiday promised by the petroleum ministry to firms participating in the Nelp auctions was withdrawn in Finance Bill 2008-09. Chidambaram said the dispute would be resolved in six months and the decision by the courts would be applicable to all exploration and production contracts obtained through nomination or bidding.        
	The removal of the tax holiday for oil refineries would have affected all new refineries, except Reliance Petroleum, which expects to commission a 580,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) unit in Jamnagar by the third quarter of this year.        
	HPCL-Mittals 180,000bpd Bhatinda refinery will go on stream in 2010, while Bharat Petroleums 120,000bpd Bina plant is expected to be completed by December 2009.

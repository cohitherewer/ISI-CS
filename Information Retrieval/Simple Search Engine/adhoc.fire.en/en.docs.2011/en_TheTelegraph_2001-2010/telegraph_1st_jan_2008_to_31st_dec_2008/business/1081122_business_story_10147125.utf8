The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh hurdle to 3G rollout
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fresh hurdle to 3G rollout
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NETWORK JAM                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The rollout of third-generation (3G) telecom services has hit a new hurdle as an alternative network for defence forces will not be ready before 2011 because of technical and financial constraints.         
	The alternative optic fibre network will allow the defence sector to vacate radiowaves for civilian use.        
	The department of telecommunications (DoT) has told the defence ministry that the alternative network would be completed only by 2011 and would cost nearly Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Various technical glitches have cropped up which need to be rectified, DoT officials said.        
	Earlier, state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), which had been allocated Rs 1,050 crore to complete the network, had said the project would be completed by December 2008.        
	Defence forces, which occupy a bulk of 3G spectrum, is expected to vacate around 25-30 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum in the 2.1-gigahertz band for 3G services.         
	Unless spectrum is vacated, telecom companies will not be able to launch 3G services that provide high-end mobile services such as real-time transactions, video streaming, voice and data services.         
	However, the armed forces contended that they should have a reliable alternative network and full connectivity before spectrum is vacated for civilian use.        
	According to DoT officials, a proposal to set up a dedicated spectrum band for defence is also being worked out.        
	Under the proposal, the countrys airwaves will be divided into two categories  civilian and military.         
	The communications and defence ministries will soon begin talks on the proposal.

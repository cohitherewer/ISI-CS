          SAMBIT SAHA                          L.N. Mittal: Signs of worry                                  
	Calcutta, July 11: The belligerent union of troubled Bulgarian steel maker Kremikovtzi AD is threatening to block a deal that was bringing the Mittal brothers  Lakshmi Niwas and Pramod  together to do business after many years.        
	The management of the company, owned by Pramod and Vinod Mittal, is understood to have cancelled an outsourcing agreement with ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel company owned by elder brother L.N. Mittal, at the insistence of the union.        
	Instead, the management has signed the outsourcing agreement with Vorskla Steel, a rival bidder.        
	Sources said the ArcelorMittal management was trying to salvage the deal, widely believed as a precursor to the complete takeover of the bankrupt company, signed a week ago. The management had to sign a new deal with Vorskla Steel under duress, they added.         
	Owned by Ukrainian billionaire Konstantin Zhevago, Vorskla is competing with ArcelorMittal for the 2.2-million-tonne Kremikovtzi mill where the Bulgarian government holds a 25 per cent stake. Pramod owns 71 per cent of the company.        
	L.N. Mittal was ahead in the race after it offered a $47-million loan to Kremikovtzi to meet its immediate needs such as salary payments.        
	This was followed by the outsourcing deal under which ArcelorMittal was to provide raw material to the plant.         
	While Kremikovtzi was to market the produce, the revenue would go to ArcelorMittal, according to the agreement.        
	However, the labour union, which forced the Bulgarian government to replace Pramod with a new owner, claimed that no raw material had arrived and salaries were also not paid.

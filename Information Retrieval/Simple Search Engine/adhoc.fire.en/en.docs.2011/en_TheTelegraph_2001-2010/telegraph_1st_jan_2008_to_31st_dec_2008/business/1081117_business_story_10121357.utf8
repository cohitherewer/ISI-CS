The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Poor overseas demand haunts iron ore firms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Poor overseas demand haunts iron ore firms
          SAMBIT SAHA                          GREAT DISTRESS                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Iron ore export has more than halved in October, forcing the closure of mines and prompting miners to demand a complete rollback of export tax.        
	A cut in steel production in China has led to a dearth of buyers and piling up of inventories at the ports of that country. Iron ore exports dropped 50.5 per cent last month compared with the same period last year.        
	Hit by lower demand at home and abroad, many mines in the country, especially in Karnatakas Chitradurga region, have been closed.        
	Alarmed by the situation, the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (Fimi) has decided to make a representation to the Prime Ministers Office on Monday.         
	About 3,200 workers have been rendered unemployed in the Chitradurga area itself where around 17 out of the 21 mines have been closed, R.K. Sharma, secretary-general of Fimi, said. Sharma blamed export duty, high railway freight, a crash in prices and a lack of domestic demand for the closures.        
	Fimi said miners would demand the complete abolition of the export tax, which has been notified at 8 per cent last week, moving away from the flat rate of Rs 200 per tonne.        
	Miners expect exports to fall well short of last years 100 million tonnes, given the current trend. The period between October and March is a busy time for exporters .        
	Around 70 million tonnes of inventory is piled up at the Chinese ports, which is higher than the average of 45 million tonnes. China accounts for 88 per cent of Indias exports.        
	Miners say the impact of the stimulus package announced by the Chinese government will be felt after a few months. The recent slump in Chinese demand is the fallout of the global financial crisis.

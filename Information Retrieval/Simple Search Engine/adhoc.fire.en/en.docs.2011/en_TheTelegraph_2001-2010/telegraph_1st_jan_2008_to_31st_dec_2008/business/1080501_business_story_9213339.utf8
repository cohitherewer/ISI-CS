	New Delhi, April 30: Skyrocketing oil prices have forced two Indian carriers to raise their fuel surcharge.        
	SpiceJet and Jet Airways will raise the fuel surcharge by up to Rs 150 on short-haul routes and Rs 350 on long-haul routes. While SpiceJets decision is likely to be implemented from tomorrow, Jets price hike will be effective from the weekend.        
	Public sector oil firms have raised the prices of aviation turbine fuel by over 9 per cent in line with the increase in global crude rates. An official of Indian Oil Corporation said the company would hike the price of the fuel in Mumbai by Rs 5,276 per kilolitre, effective midnight.        
	Other airlines are also expected to follow suit. An Air India spokesperson said, Well take stock of the situation and then decide.        
	Crude prices had increased to $119 a barrel this week.         
	Jet officers quit        
	Three senior officers of Jet Airways have quit the private carrier, which today refuted similar reports about its executive director Saroj Dutta.        
	The airline said N. Hariharan, vice-president in the chairmans office, A.S. Bedi, general manager (security), and S. Bandula, senior general manager (in-flight services), had quit the company for reasons of career prospects and family commitments.

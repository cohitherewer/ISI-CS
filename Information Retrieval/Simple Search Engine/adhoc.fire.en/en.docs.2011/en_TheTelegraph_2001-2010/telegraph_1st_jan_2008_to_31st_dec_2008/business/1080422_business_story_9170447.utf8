   Refining margin propels numbers          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 21: Reliance Industries  the countrys largest private sector company  today reported a 63 per cent leap in profit for the year ended March 31, 2008, at Rs 19,458 crore. Net profit stood at Rs 11,943 crore a year ago.        
	Turnover for the year surged 18 per cent to Rs 1,39,269 crore on the back of robust gross refining margins of $15.5 per barrel  which were way ahead of analysts expectations and the regional benchmarks.        
	Profit after tax, excluding exceptional items, was Rs 15,261 crore, representing an increase of 28 per cent.         
	The exceptional item was an income of Rs 4,733 crore arising from the sale of just under 5 per cent of the Reliance Petroleum stock in the third quarter.        
	Once again, the refining business underpinned the strong numbers, which were ahead of the Streets estimates.        
	Reliance said the surge in revenue was because of a 12 per cent increase in prices and 6 per cent growth in volumes. During the year, exports were higher by 25 per cent at Rs 83,492 crore.        
	Net profit during the fourth quarter ended March 31 rose 24 per cent to Rs 3,912 crore from Rs 3,156 crore during the same period last year.        
	Analysts had estimated Reliance to report net profit in the region of Rs 3,300 crore to Rs 3,800 crore.        
	Reliances refinery was able to winkle out higher gross refining margins  the difference between value of petroleum products produced and crude oil price  at $15.5 per barrel against analysts estimates of around $15 a barrel.        
	Reliance said its good refinery margins were due to efficiency in the sourcing of crude oil and an ability to produce globally accepted transportation fuels. The net result of this strength was that the R amp;M (refining and marketing) segment revenue jumped to Rs 28,686 crore, a 36 per cent rise over Rs 21,025 crore in the same period last year.        
	On the marketing front, RIL said the margins on petrol and diesel were under pressure because of the lack of a level-playing field for the private sector marketing companies. The period witnessed high crude oil prices without any corresponding improvement in the domestic selling prices.        
	Reliance maintains a price differential of Rs 5 to Rs 19.5 per litre over PSUs retail selling price on diesel and Rs 4.5 to Rs 14 per litre for petrol across India.        
	The downside was represented by the petrochemicals business which saw fourth quarter revenues grow 12 per cent to Rs 14,119 crore (Rs 12,572 crore).        
	Earnings before interest and tax margin came down to 10.4 per cent from 11 per cent. Reliance said the margins for paraxylene, polypropylene and polyethylene had dipped because of lower prices and higher feedstock costs.        
	During the fourth quarter, Reliance reported a turnover of Rs 38,697 crore, a rise of 32 per cent over Rs 29,276 crore in the same period last year.        
	This has been a landmark year for Reliance as we delivered a record financial and operating performance in challenging and volatile market conditions, said Reliance chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani.        
	Our investments in oil and gas development and refining are expected to yield results this year. I expect them to be key drivers in delivering earnings growth in the near future, he added.

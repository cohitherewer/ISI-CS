                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sensex shifts into top gear
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: Stocks surged today as bargain hunters continued to prowl the markets amid hopes that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would trim interest rates again.        
	The sensex leapt by over 743.55 points, or 8.22 per cent, to close at at 9788.06.        
	There were a lot of favourable factors for the market when it opened for trading after Thursdays break.         
	Data released yesterday showed inflation falling below 11 per cent. Moreover, the contraction in the US economy was much less than feared at 0.3 per cent against a market consensus of 0.5 per cent.        
	Sentiment was also buoyed after Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services (S amp;P) affirmed its BBB- long-term and A-3 short-term sovereign credit ratings for India.        
	S amp;P said the outlook on the long-term rating of India remained stable. It added that the ratings reflected the countrys strong economic growth prospects and its deep government debt market, which helps accommodate its weak fiscal position.        
	All these factors saw the benchmark index opening higher at 9361.66 over the last close of 9044.51. Market circles said equities received a further boost when news came in that the Bank of Japan had also cut interest rates.         
	The sensex soared 825 points to an intra-day high of 9870.42 on this news. Heavy selling in key heavy weight stocks pared the gains at the close.

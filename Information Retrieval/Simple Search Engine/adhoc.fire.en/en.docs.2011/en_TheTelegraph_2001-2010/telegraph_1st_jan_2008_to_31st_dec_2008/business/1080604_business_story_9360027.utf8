The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mallya, EADS in pact talks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mallya, EADS in pact talks
                              Mallya: Extending support                            
	Berlin, June 3 (PTI): Aerospace giant EADS is in talks with business tycoon Vijay Mallya to revive its single piston engine aircraft manufacturing business, as a potential tie-up offers a cost advantage to the European firm and an entry into general aviation for the Indian billionaire.        
	Socata, the business jetliner arm of EADS, has made public its plan to relaunch its single piston engine line of products and is on the lookout for a partner willing to resume production at a much lower cost than the one in France.        
	This is the very point that was approached in initial talks with Mallya in the course of the current discussions between him and Airbus (subsidiary of EADS), Socata vice-president (sales and marketing) Nicolas Chabbert said on the sidelines of the Berlin Air Show.        
	However, he was quick to add that the talks were still inconclusive. There are no conclusions or any more development than this initial approach, Chabbert said.        
	Mallya, who founded Kingfisher Airlines in 2005 and acquired Deccan Aviation in 2007, had made his interest to diversify into general aviation public and at one time was interested in the US-based small aircraft maker Epic Aircraft.        
	The fate of the deal is not known as yet, though aviation industry sources said several complications had come in the way of a tie-up between Mallya and Epic.        
	Mallya has also requested the help of EADS and Airbus in evaluating a couple of opportunities in the general aviation sector, Chabbert said.        
	The vice-president of the EADS subsidiary said his company was also planning to enter the Indian market in a big way with its high-speed business turboprop TBM 850.        
	We are planning to develop marketing efforts in India as we think it is more and more appropriate. The aircraft has a four to five passenger seating capacity and can land on small airports, Chabbert said.

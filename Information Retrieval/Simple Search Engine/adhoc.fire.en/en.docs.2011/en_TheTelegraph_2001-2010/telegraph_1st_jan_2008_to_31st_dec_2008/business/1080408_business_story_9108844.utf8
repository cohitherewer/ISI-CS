The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posco deal signals steel price hike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Posco deal signals steel price hike
          SAMBIT SAHA                                        
	Calcutta, April 7: The Centre may be fighting a losing battle while trying to drive down steel prices and tame inflation ahead of the general elections due next year.        
	Steel makers say they are left with little option but to raise prices by as much as Rs 8,000 a tonne after Posco of South Korea today set a new global benchmark for coking coal prices. Posco has agreed to pay around 210 per cent more than last years contract price of $98 a tonne. Coking coal is a vital raw material used in steel making.        
	Indian companies will have to work out their individual contract prices for coking coal, but it wont be less than $300-305 a tonne since they import mostly from Australia.        
	One tonne of coking coal is required to make a tonne of steel and the price hike would raise steel-making costs by $200 or Rs 8,000 a tonne.        
	Unlike iron ore, which is abundant in the country, India depends on coking coal imports to meet its requirements. Of the 30-million-tonne (mt) requirement, India imports 22mt of coking coal, which is turned into metallurgical coke to feed the steel-making process.        
	So far the Centre has tried to persuade steel makers to reduce prices of select items despite the increase in raw material costs. It had also urged local iron ore companies to reduce prices. However, they have not given any commitment so far.         
	The Centre can entertain some hope of restricting the prices of iron ore which is produced by local miners and state-owned companies. But it doesnt have a handle on coking coal prices.        
	Moreover, ocean freight rates have gone up by $25 to $35 a tonne, raising steel-making costs by close to Rs 1,000 a tonne.        
	Another cost increase looms: annual iron ore benchmark prices are due to be decided within the next few weeks and sources contend that this will raise costs by another Rs 3,000-4000 a tonne.        
	Vale of Brazil  one of the largest iron ore producers in the world  has negotiated a 67 per cent increase in the new annual global contracts.        
	Public sector iron ore supplier NMDC has already informed Indian steel producers that once the new annual contract price is settled with Japanese steel mills, the Indian steel producers will have to pay the new price with retrospective effect from April 1.         
	According to steel makers, this is over and above the Rs 6,000-per-tonne unabsorbed cost impact Indian steel companies have been trying to recover through price increases.

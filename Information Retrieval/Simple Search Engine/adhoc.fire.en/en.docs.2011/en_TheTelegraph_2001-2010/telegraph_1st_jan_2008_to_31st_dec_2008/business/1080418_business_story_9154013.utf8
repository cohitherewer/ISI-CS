          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 17: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 50 basis points to 8 per cent  a move that was widely anticipated by bankers though the timing caught them by surprise.        
	CRR is the proportion of deposits that banks must keep with the RBI.         
	The CRR hike is expected to suck Rs 18,500 crore out of the banking system.         
	The hike will be in two phases  the first on April 26 and the second on May 10 .        
	Bankers are divided over the possibility of the RBI now tweaking the repo rate when Yaga Venugopal Reddy and his team hunker down on April 29 to review the monetary policy and consider the measures they should take to tame inflation and keep the economy chugging along smoothly.        
	Earlier in the day, the government announced that inflation had tumbled to 7.14 per cent in the first week of the new financial year  suggesting that the series of measures that it had taken over the past few weeks had started to pay off.        
	But even at 7.14 per cent, inflation is running at a three-year high, way above the RBIs comfort level of 5-5.5 per cent.        
	Coincidentally, China yesterday asked commercial lenders to set aside more cash to cover deposits as it wrestled with inflation which has hit a 11-year high. The Peoples Bank of China raised the required reserve ratio to a record 16 per cent.         
	Curb on liquidity        
	Those who expect Reddy to raise the repo rate contend that inflation is not expected to ease in the near term.         
	They argue that the rate hike is predicated by the fact that the governor has taken a series of measures to manage liquidity.        
	After inflation breached 7 per cent, liquidity was mobilised through regular and market stabilisation scheme auctions. Then came the CRR hike. So one must not rule out a repo rate hike on April 29, a banker said. Many argue that a repo rate hike need not trigger a surge in interest rates on commercial, home and personal loans.        
	Officials from leading public sector banks said they would prefer to wait till the April 29 monetary policy before taking any decision on interest rates. They added that an increase in home loan rates would also be a function of whether the cost of funds move up.        
	We are not going to react immediately to the CRR hike. We will wait till the monetary policy and only then will a decision be taken. If rates are not hiked in the policy, it is unlikely that home loans will be raised, said a public sector banker requesting anonymity.        
	Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director of ICICI Bank, said the private sector bank was not in a hurry to raise rates.        
	Hoping for the best        
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, expects the concerted inflation-busting measures taken by the government and the RBI to yield results.        
	Inflation should moderate to 6.4 per cent by the end of May, she said.         
	Nitsure, however, added that high crude oil prices, which touched $115 per barrel, remained a key risk        
	However, Kochhar felt that many more measures are required to control inflation.        
	Nitsure believes that inflation in India has always had an in-built monetary aspect and it is not purely a supply-side phenomenon.        
	Explaining the rationale for the CRR hike, the RBI indicated that excess liquidity present in the system had the potential to impact inflation expectations. It said that liquidity in the banking system had increased during April 3 to 17 and it had to absorb money during this period against that in March where money had to be injected through its auctions.        
	Year-on-year WPI inflation, which was 3.83 per cent on January 12, 2008, at the time of the announcement of the third quarter review, increased to 7.41 per cent on March 29, 2008 and remained at 7.14 per cent as on April 5, 2008 and its overall impact on inflation expectations requires to be monitored and moderated, the RBI said in a statement.

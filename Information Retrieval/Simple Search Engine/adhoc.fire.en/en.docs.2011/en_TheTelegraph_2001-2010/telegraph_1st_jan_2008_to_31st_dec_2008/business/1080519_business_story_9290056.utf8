          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 18: The tide has turned the wrong way for engineering stocks, with the sector being among the worst-hit indices in this calendar year.        
	The bear run at the stock market along with worries over order execution, high raw material prices and lower margins have left a severe scar on the industry.        
	Since the beginning of this year, the BSE capital goods index has lost almost 31 per cent, while the benchmark BSE sensex has been eroded by 14 per cent, reflecting the losses suffered by firms such as Larsen amp; Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel). These scrips ratcheted huge gains last year.        
	The capital goods index has been the third most affected sector after realty and consumer durables.        
	Though some of these stocks have consolidated their positions in the past few trading sessions, analysts believe the pressure is not yet over.        
	If we look at the results that have been declared so far, its not up to the mark for many of these companies, barring a couple of exceptions. The apprehensions which we had earlier with regard to rising costs and margin pressures have been proved correct, an analyst with a local brokerage said.        
	The analyst added that the effect of raw material costs and lower margins would be more pronounced in the first and second quarters of this fiscal and that the markets were merely factoring these risks in assigning current valuations.        
	Sources said though many of these companies had huge order books, the execution was likely to be slower, leading to tepid growth.        
	Bhel got orders of over Rs 50,000 crore during 2007-08 and the company is targeting orders worth Rs 40,000 crore this fiscal.         
	The stocks value has been eroded by over 30 per cent this year, and the scrip came under selling pressure following the announcement of the companys fourth quarter result.        
	It showed that high wages and raw material costs have impacted Bhels margins. Analysts feel wage pressures on the company is likely to persist as it may have to increase its workforce.         
	In a recent report on the outlook on engineering and infrastructure firms, brokerage Enam lowered its earnings estimate for these companies after factoring in a slowdown in orders and rising commodity prices.

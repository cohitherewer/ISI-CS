The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Biocon eyes buys abroad
                                                                                                               Biocon eyes buys abroad
                            
	Bangalore, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Biocon Ltd is looking at overseas acquisitions for about $10 million to boost its sales globally and gain access to innovative drugs, its chairman said on Wednesday.        
	Biocon, which makes insulin, cholesterol-lowering statins and other branded drugs, had earlier this month agreed to buy 70 per cent of German marketing firm AxiCorp GmbH for 30 million euros ($45 million) to boost the distribution and marketing of pharmaceuticals in Europe.        
	I am looking at smaller companies where even if I have to invest and get a majority or controlling stake it wont cost me more than $10 million or thereabouts, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said.        
	The targets are marketing firms in Europe and research-oriented biotechnology companies in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, she said.        
	Last month, Biocon said its quarterly profit rose more than five times after one-off gains from the sale of its enzymes unit to Denmarks Novozymes, and forecast more growth despite recession concerns in its key US market.        
	Bangalore-based Biocon has been looking to acquire firms to boost its marketing and drug discovery muscles, after it sold off its enzymes business in July last year for $115 million.        
	For Europe, its a totally marketing strategy that we are looking at, said Mazumdar-Shaw, who set up Biocon in her garage in Bangalore in 1978. At the same time we are also looking at acquisition opportunities in, say, innovation.        
	She said a plan to launch an initial public offering of its contract research unit, Syngene, was on track by the end of the fiscal that begins in April. The company has not yet finalised details of the offer.

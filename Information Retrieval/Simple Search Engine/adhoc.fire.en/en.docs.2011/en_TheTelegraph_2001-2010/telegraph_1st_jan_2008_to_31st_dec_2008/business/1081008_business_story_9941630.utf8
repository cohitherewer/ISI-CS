                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Piecemeal responses to global crisis
                            
	Reykjavik/London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Iceland sought an emergency bailout from Russia on Tuesday and the Russians unveiled an aid package for their own banks in the latest piecemeal responses to the global financial crisis.        
	Australia responded to the growing crisis by cutting its interest rates by 100 basis points to 6 per cent, putting pressure on Western central banks to cut the cost of borrowing.        
	Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso said he hoped the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations would send a firm message on stabilising financial markets when it meets later this week in Washington.        
	The impact will be substantial if the G7 didnt send a clear message. European leaders have met, but it didnt go well and European financial markets have fluctuated rapidly and substantially, so Im worried about the impact on Japan, Aso said.        
	The banking upheaval that began on Wall Street has effectively shut down interbank and other loan markets, pushing industrialised countries closer to recession.        
	Sparked by the collapse in the US housing market and increase in bad loans, the crisis is the worst to hit the banking world in 80 years. .        
	EU deposit cover        
	EU finance ministers have agreed to increase the minimum level of bank deposit insurance across the 27 European Union (EU) countries.        
	They also pledged to recapitalise any vital bank if needed to avoid another Lehman Brothers. The ministers agreed to raise the minimum deposit guarantee to 50,000 euros ($68,000), half of what some wanted but more than double the 20,000 euros that is the floor level now.

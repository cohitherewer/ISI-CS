	New Delhi, May 23: The final policy guidelines to introduce third generation (3G) mobile and WiMax services will be announced early next month.         
	By the first week of June, the final 3G and WiMax guidelines would be issued and the rollout of the services would start by January 2009, communications minister A. Raja said at the 4th Assocham global telecom summit.        
	According to the minister, the rules for 3G spectrum auction have already been referred to the law ministry, which will ascertain whether the conditions need to be amended. Raja will be meeting the Prime Minister to discuss whether foreign players should be allowed to participate in the bidding for 3G spectrum.         
	Even if foreign players are not allowed to bid for 3G licences directly, they can enter through a joint venture with existing players as 74 per cent FDI is allowed in the telecom sector, Raja said.        
	The rollout of 3G services had been embroiled in a controversy over foreign entry. While the department of telecommunications (DoT) and the finance ministry are in favour of allowing foreign players to bid for 3G spectrum to enhance competition, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is opposing the move.        
	In its draft 3G policy, the DoT has stated that all players, including the foreign ones, must be allowed to bid for up to 10 Mhz of 3G spectrum through two blocks of 5 Mhz each.         
	However, Trai has proposed that 3G spectrum should be given only to existing operators in slots of 5 Mhz each.        
	According to the telecom regulator, including foreign players will not only complicate the process but also delay the 3G rollout in the country.         
	However, both the telecom minister and the finance ministry want to open up 3G to global bidding to make the system more transparent and attract bigger players so that the auction fetches higher revenues to the government.        
	Third-generation mobile services are high-end value-added products such as real-time transactions, video streaming, and voice and data transmission, which hold high revenue potential for telecom companies.        
	WiMax enables broadband and other 3G services over wireless networks at low costs.

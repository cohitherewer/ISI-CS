The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wine import barrier draws EU ire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wine import barrier draws EU ire
          AMIT ROY                          Tough time                                  
	London, Sept. 22: The European Union (EU) launched fresh action against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) today, saying high state taxes were hurting European wine and spirits.         
	The EUs executive body, the European Commission, said it was concerned about the way taxes and other measures on wine and spirits were applied in states such as Goa, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.        
	If India does not reduce import taxes on wines and spirits, the EU can retaliate by increasing taxes on Indian exports to the EU, a spokesperson for the EU in Brussels told The Telegraph.        
	The EUs complaint is that its exports to India get hammered twice  once when entering the country by central taxes and then by state levies. The result, the EU says, is that the taxes can increase the price by up to 550 per cent.        
	On whether the EU should be talking to the states rather than the central government, the spokesperson said, We cant talk to individual states, we shall talk to the Indian government, hoping it can persuade the states to reduce their taxes.         
	In July 2007, India had agreed to eliminate special central taxes on foreign wine and spirits imports after the EU asked the WTO to intervene.        
	In a statement today, the EU said it would seek clarifications from India on the way tax legislation and other measures on market access for wine and spirits were applied in states.        
	The taxes are unfair, the EU claims.         
	For example, Maharashtra imposes a special fee on imported wines and exempts locally produced wines and spirits from excise duty. Goa adds an import and a label-recording fee to the cost of imported wines and spirits. In both cases, internal taxes are applied only to imported wines and spirits. This is a breach of the WTOs national treatment principle, which requires that WTO members treat imports and domestic goods the same, the statement said.        
	Indian diplomats in Brussels said the taxes imposed by the Indian government are within WTO guidelines.         
	They said the states were free to impose additional levy since liquor was a state subject under the Constitution and the states can ban liquor if they like.

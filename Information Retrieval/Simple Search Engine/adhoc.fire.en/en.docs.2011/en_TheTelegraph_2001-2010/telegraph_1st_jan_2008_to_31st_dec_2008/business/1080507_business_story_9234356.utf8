	Mumbai, May 6: IT solutions provider i-flex Solutions clocked an 11.63 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 415.59 crore for the year ended March 31, 2008, against Rs 372.28 crore a year ago, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Revenue rose 11.8 per cent to Rs 672 crore for this quarter from Rs 601 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. i-flexs revenue at Rs 2,380 crore for 2007-08 was 15 per cent more than Rs 2,061 crore for the same period last year.         
	The company has also sought shareholders and regulators permission to change its name to Oracle Financial Services Ltd. The change in the name is indicative of the companys alignment with its parent Oracle, which owns 81 per cent of i-flex.         
	 We had a record initial license fee signing of $36 million for products this quarter and added 22 customers from the EMEA (Europe, Middle-East and Africa), Japan and emerging Latin American markets. Our integration with Oracle Corporation is also progressing well, said N.R.K. Raman, managing director and CEO of i-flex.        
	 The new identity will enable us to leverage our global reach, infrastructure and brand visibility of Oracle to accelerate growth, Raman added.

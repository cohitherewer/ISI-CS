The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel for monthly fuel price review
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Panel for monthly fuel price review
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): The Prime Minister-appointed B.K. Chaturvedi panel is believed to have suggested raising fuel prices every month to bring them on a par with production cost and has sought imposition of a super profit tax on oilfields awarded before 1999.        
	Besides freeing the pricing of petrol and diesel from administrative control, the panel favoured subsidising LPG and kerosene through a new tax on oil produced from fields awarded prior to the advent of new exploration licensing policy in 1999.        
	At present, only state-run producers such as ONGC shell out a part of their revenues from high oil prices towards fuel subsidies. If the recommendations are accepted, it will require oil producers such as Cairn (in Ravva field) and BG-Reliance (in Panna-Mukta fields) to pay subsidies. Sources said the Chaturvedi committee, that looked into the financial health of oil PSUs, had also suggested the pricing of fuel at export-parity rates that a company might get if the fuel was to be exported.        
	These rates would be 10-15 per cent lower than the trade-parity pricing followed now, thereby bringing down the projected revenue losses. Domestic retail price is currently determined in an 80:20 mix of import-parity and export-parity prices.        
	The panel has also recommended squeezing the marketing margins but has not favoured any tax on windfall gains some refiners, particularly in the private sector, have made in recent times.

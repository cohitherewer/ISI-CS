          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The countrys trade deficit in July widened to $10.80 billion because of a higher oil import bill. Though exports in July rose 31.2 per cent on an annual basis to $16.34 billion, riding on the weak rupee, imports were up 48.1 per cent to $27.14 billion.        
	According to government data released today, oil import during July rose 69.3 per cent to $9.48 billion. Exports during April-July were up 24.6 per cent to $59.19 billion, while the trade deficit for the four months rose to $41.23 billion from $27.35 billion a year ago.        
	K.T. Chocko, director of the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, said, Widening trade deficit is a matter of concern. The gap has increased because of the rise in global crude oil prices and the weakening of the rupee.        
	Analysts said the trade deficit was likely to widen to 10.1 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2008-09, up from 7.7 per cent in the previous fiscal. Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the increase in input costs had pushed up trade deficit. He said the rise in imports might be brought under control in the next few months.         
	The government aims to more than triple Indias share in world trade to 5 per cent by 2020 from 1.5 per cent now.

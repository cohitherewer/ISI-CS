          A STAFF REPORTER                          S. Radhakrishnan in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 7: The Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC) will set up incubation, export facilitation and business support centres in the US for small and medium- sized Indian IT companies that are unable to set up such facilities abroad individually.        
	While the commerce ministry will bear about half the cost of such centres, the other half will be shared by the companies. About 20 non-competing IT and ITeS companies have been shortlisted for the first phase. The first centre will be set up in Montgomery. Other centres will come up in New York and Chicago, said S. Radhakrishnan, chairman (eastern region) ESC.        
	The Montgomery centre will be commissioned by July.        
	Radhakrishnan said such centres would be of great help at a time when rupee appreciation and the subprime crisis had hit infotech hard, especially the smaller firms.        
	He added that the move would help 300 small companies registered under the software technology parks of India (STPI) scheme access the US market.        
	The extension of the STPI scheme will provide some relief but initiatives like these will help new companies engaged in software development, said Radhakrishnan.        
	The Bengal IT department has asked the ESC to hold its flagship IT business-to-business event IndiaSoft in Calcutta next year.

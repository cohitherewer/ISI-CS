	Mumbai, Aug. 24: The roll call has just got bigger.         
	The titans of India Inc  Reliance Industries, the State Bank of India and Reliance Communications  have started doling out stock options to retain their best-performing executives.         
	Its the clearest signal that the countrys largest companies and banks have started to feel the heat as talent scouts start sniffing for front-line executives in the major corporate bastions.         
	Stock options were an accepted part of compensation packages of information technology companies in the early nineties before financial services entities grabbed the concept to buttress pay packets.         
	After 2006, a large number of manufacturing companies also gave out stock options to their super achievers  and that was despite the finance ministrys decision to slap a fringe benefit tax (FBT) on these payouts over and above the capital gains tax that they already attracted.         
	One reason for this is the sharp increase in executive churn within industry  a trend that has continued even though industrial growth has stuttered this year.         
	Reliance Industries is the countrys largest private company; the State Bank of India (SBI) is the largest commercial bank and Reliance Communications is a front-line telecom company.         
	Besides them, companies such as Centrum Capital and Jindal Steel and Power have issued shares as part of the employee stock option plans (Esops).         
	The public sector is also getting into the act. Recently, PTC India, the provider of power trading solutions and a Government of India undertaking, secured shareholders approval to grant up to 5 per cent of its equity capital by way of Esops.         
	Communications minister A. Raja has proposed an Esop for the employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd even though his offer has been rejected by the employees union of the telecom company.         
	This trend comes at a time when infotech companies have cut back sharply on their Esop largesse.

	Role reversal  
	Reports say companies such as Tata Consultancy Services are now relying more on cash incentives than Esops to reward their employees.         
	Sandip Mukherjee, executive director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the low level of interest in the IT sector has a lot to do with the current state of capital markets but admits that Chidambarams decision to impose FBT on Esops has also played a role.         
	The stock market slump this year has gouged value from the IT stocks.         
	Those who are not going for Esops are primarily those employees who dont see value in them as share prices have come down sharply. They are more concerned about the short-term gain and dont see long-term gain in Esops, he adds, stating that the problem is more pronounced in the IT sector as attrition levels are high and career span of an employee doesnt go beyond a couple of years.         
	Manufacturing and finance companies such as the SBI are better placed in this context as employee stability is comparatively high and Esops, therefore, hold value.         
	Tanmay Kapoor, partner (human capital practice) at Ernst amp; Young, says Esops have now become an integral part of a compensation package with many companies stumping up the FBT instead of passing it on to the employees. Employees expect fixed compensation and a variable component. They also expect Esops, Kapoor says, adding that several media companies are now jumping on the Esop bandwagon.         
	Action time        
	The SBI issued and allotted over 34 lakh shares as part of its stock option plan, says Prakash Gangal, secretary of the All India State Bank of India Employees Federation. The federation had asked for Esops last year.         
	Reliance Communications is aiming to cover 20,000 employees in the largest Esop rollout by any Indian telecom service provider.         
	The company had earlier approved the grant of over 17 million options to eligible employees based on specified criteria. Reliance Communications has created a three-tier model that will consider multiple parameters to derive the number of options that will be granted to every individual employee.         
	Reliance Communications shares have been battered after its first quarter results fell short of market expectations.         
	Stock options are first cleared by a committee and then the employee is notified on what is known as the grant date. The shares are then vested in a corpus; the vesting can take place in one go or be staggered over a couple of years.         
	The employee then exercises his option to buy the stock  a decision that will depend on the gap between a pre-notified exercise price and the market price of the stock at that time. If the gap isnt wide enough, he can allow the option to lapse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum hits defence wall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Spectrum hits defence wall
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The rollout of 3G telecom services in the country may get delayed as the defence authorities are unlikely to vacate spectrum before the end of 2009.         
	This is because Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), which is constructing an alternative optic-fibre-cable network for the defence authorities, will take at least some more months to complete the work.         
	While BSNL is hopeful of finishing the work by January, analysts feel it will take the defence authorities another three to six months to vacate spectrum and switch to the new network.         
	Around 30-40 per cent of the communication network is ready and we hope to complete the entire project by December 2008, S.D. Saxena, director (finance), BSNL told The Telegraph. The network is 5,200km long.        
	The government expects the defence authorities to vacate around 25-30 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum in the 2.1-gigahertz band for 3G services. Initially, the government had demanded 45Mhz from the authorities.        
	With telecom minister A. Raja eager to roll out 3G services by early next year, it has become imperative for the defence authorities to give up some spectrum.        
	Because of spectrum scarcity, each 3G-bid winner will get only 5Mhz of radio waves. This is insufficient for new entrants.        
	According to analysts, the defence forces do not utilise spectrum efficiently. They will be best served by an alternate network.         
	Officials of the department of telecommunications (DoT) said the Indian Air Force held 80-85 per cent of spectrum with the defence authorities.         
	The officials said the allocation of spectrum from the defence authorities for second-generation (2G) mobile services appeared bleak.        
	The defence authorities do not have much spectrum and it is very difficult for them to vacate the same in the near future, the officials said. The 1,800Mhz and 900Mhz bandwidth are full at present.         
	Datacom, Unitech and Swan are some of the new entrants in the 2G space.

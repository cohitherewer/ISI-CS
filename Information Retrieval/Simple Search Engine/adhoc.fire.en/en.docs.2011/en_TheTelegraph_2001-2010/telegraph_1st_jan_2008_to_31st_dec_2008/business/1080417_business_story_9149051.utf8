                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Birlas make a U-turn on administrator
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, April 16: The Birlas have withdrawn their petitions seeking the appointment of an administrator for the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla estate.        
	In a sudden turnaround, the Birlas dropped three appeals that they had filed before the Supreme Court, challenging a ruling of a division bench of Calcutta High Court which overruled a single bench that had ordered the appointment of four administrators.        
	The volte face comes just a fortnight after the Supreme Court removed patriarch Basant Kumar Birla, Krishna Kumar Birla and Yashovardhan Birla from the legal battle for the control of the MP Birla empire.        
	The development signals another major victory for Rajendra Singh Lodha, who was bequeathed the MP Birla estate through the will of the late Priyamvada Birla  wife of Madhav Prasad Birla  which is at the centre of a raging dispute.        
	The decision of the high courts division bench will now be treated as final.        
	The Birlas wanted an administrator for the MP Birla estate as that would put the fetters on Lodha, who is the chairman of a number of group companies, including flagship Birla Corporation.        
	They also hoped that an administrator would cripple Lodhas ability to fight a long and expensive legal battle.         
	The Birlas had moved Calcutta High Court in December 2004 seeking the appointment of an administrator.        
	A single judge bench of Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta had then agreed to appoint four administrators to the disputed estate.        
	But within 15 minutes of the judgment, the Lodha lawyers moved a division bench comprising Justices Pinaki Ghosh and Tapan Dutta and secured a stay on the order on the last day before the court closed for the winter break.        
	Debanjan Mandal, counsel for Lodha, was ecstatic after the Supreme Court announced that the Birla appeals had been withdrawn.        
	We have had two big victories on the trot. Todays development indicates that the Birlas have realised they have no hopes of winning the case, he said from Delhi.        
	N.G. Khaitan, counsel for the Birlas, refused to admit defeat. We have got what we wanted in the last case. Our aim was to start proceedings on the 1999 will of Priyamvada. We did not want any more impediments in the way, he added.        
	Lodha has sought probate of the disputed will that was registered in 1999.        
	The probate proceedings will now start in Calcutta High Court.        
	The Birlas are represented by a powerful battery of lawyers, including Ram Jethmalani, K.K. Venugopal and Arun Jaitley.        
	The Birla camp found solace in the fact that there were enough checks and balances in the judgment of Calcutta High Courts division bench which bar Lodha from selling or transferring assets of the MP Birla estate.        
	After the recent setback, in the probate proceeding battle, the Birla lawyers said the case would go on and it didnt matter too much that the two leading Birla patriarchs were no longer in the fray. The Birla clan would still fight the case, they added.

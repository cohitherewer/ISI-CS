          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 21: ArcelorMittal today acquired a 16 per cent stake in Coal of Africa Ltd, a South African coal company, to secure steady supply in a tight international market.        
	The steel behemoth will pay $132.7 million for the stake and get a guaranteed supply of 2.5 million tonnes of hard coking coal, Coal of Africa said.         
	The African company can supply up to 5 million tonnes of coal per year if ArcelorMittal needs it. The coal will be supplied from Coal of Africas wholly owned subsidiary Baobab and Thuli Coal Projects in Limpopo province of South Africa.        
	This investment reinforces ArcelorMittals strategy of vertical integration into raw materials and further strengthening our commitment to South Africa, said Sudhir Maheshwari, executive vice-president of ArcelorMittal.        
	ArcelorMittal agreed to buy the stake at 111 pence a share, a 20 per cent discount to Coal of Africas Friday closing price.        
	The acquisition comes at a time when coking coal prices have settled at over $ 300 per tonne, 200 per cent more than the last year.        
	Steel companies have been going to Africa to acquire iron ore and coal assets.        
	Tata Steel has recently bought a stake in a coal mine in Mozambique.         
	Board recast         
	The company today revamped its group management board.        
	Sudhir Maheshwari, a key associate of the Mittals, is being promoted to the board. Among other things, he will handle mergers and acquisitions and business and project development.        
	Maheshwari is now the executive vice-president on the management committee. He will report to Aditya Mittal, chief financial officer of the company. Davinder Chugh, currently senior executive vice-president, will handle shared services on the group management board. Chugh will report to chief executive officer Lakshmi N. Mittal.        
	Executive vice-president Christophe Cornier will be responsible for operations in Asia and Africa, steel greenfield projects and equipment manufacturing.        
	The positions were created after Malay Mukherjee retired from the group management board. Mukherjee will join the board of directors of ArcelorMittal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price heat on bulk users of diesel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Price heat on bulk users of diesel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          High rise                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The government is exploring the possibility of raising diesel prices to over Rs 50 a litre for bulk consumers to reduce the losses of state-owned oil marketing companies by about Rs 27,000 crore in this fiscal.        
	Oil companies have submitted a note to the petroleum ministry proposing a differential tariff to control a surge in diesel demand at a time when global crude oil prices are taking a toll on the financial health of firms.        
	Officials said the ministry was examining the proposal and could place the issue before the cabinet.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey had earlier said his ministry was in favour of a differential tariff only in power and not for others such as transport as it could unleash inflationary pressure.        
	Sales to bulk users  railways, state transport corporations, defence, power, fisheries and others  had grown 18 per cent in April-July, with power plants emerging as the biggest consumers.         
	Analysts feared that differential pricing of diesel might lead to large-scale diversion of the low-priced fuel to bulk consumers.        
	It is unlikely that any of the bulk consumers are going to accept a dual pricing regime. Even if the petroleum ministry was to move a cabinet note suggesting such a system, it would be widely opposed. The proposal could get the support of the finance ministry  tempted by large estimated savings in subsidy payments  but overcoming opposition from the ministries of power, railways and defence in a cabinet meeting would be a daunting task for the petroleum minister, they said.        
	Sources said the power sector had seen a massive 152 per cent rise in the demand for diesel in the first quarter to 53,000 tonnes, while the fisheries and marine sector had seen near 40-per-cent growth.        
	The oil companies are losing Rs 16.22 on every litre of diesel for selling the fuel below cost. Half of the projected Rs 1,84,801-crore revenue loss on the sale of petrol, diesel, domestic LPG cylinder and kerosene in 2008-09 is being attributed to diesel.         
	This spurt in demand has resulted in domestic output falling short of requirement, necessitating 4.14 million tonnes of import in this fiscal. Of this, 1.267 million tonnes has been imported in April-July.

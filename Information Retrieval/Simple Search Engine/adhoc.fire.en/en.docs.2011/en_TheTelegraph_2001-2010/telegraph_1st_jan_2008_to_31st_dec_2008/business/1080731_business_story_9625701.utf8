          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chakrabarty in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: A day after the Reserve Bank of India raised the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio, three banks  Punjab National Bank (PNB), Jammu and Kashmir Bank and Axis Bank  today jacked up their benchmark lending rates.        
	PNB chairman K. C. Chakrabarty said, The board has decided to increase the prime lending rate (PLR) by 100 basis points and deposit rates in the range of 75-100 basis points.        
	The prime lending rate of PNB, the countrys second largest state-run bank, currently stands at 13 per cent. PLR for most state-owned banks vary between 12.75 per cent and 13.25 per cent, while it ranges between 13 per cent and 15 per cent for private banks. The rate increase will come into effect from Friday, PNB officials said.         
	The RBI yesterday increased the repo rate by 50 basis points and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 25 basis points in its bid to rein in inflation which is now close to 12 per cent.         
	Repo is the RBI lending rate to banks, while CRR is the portion of deposits which banks must compulsorily keep with the central bank.        
	Braving a tight money policy, PNBs net profit increased 20.54 per cent to Rs 512.40 crore in the first quarter.         
	Total income of the Delhi-based bank increased to Rs 4,594.62 crore from Rs 3,795.12 crore in the first quarter of 2007-08.        
	J amp;K-Axis move        
	Jammu amp; Kashmir Bank (J amp;K) Bank and Axis Bank raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point each. While J amp;K Bank raised its benchmark rate to 14.5 per cent, Axis Bank hiked its PLR to 15.75 per cent.        
	Axis Bank said the new PLR would be effective from July 30. It added that this decision was taken today by its asset-liability committee, pursuant to the announcement of the Reserve Bank of Indias monetary and credit policy.        
	Many more banks are expected to increase their PLRs. An increase in PLR directly impacts interest rates on all categories of loans, including those to home buyers.

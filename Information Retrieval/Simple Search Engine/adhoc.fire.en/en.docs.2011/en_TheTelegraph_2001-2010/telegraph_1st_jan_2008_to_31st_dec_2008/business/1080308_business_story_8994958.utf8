The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex dips below 16k
                                                                                                               Sensex dips below 16k
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 7: The sensex today dipped below 16000, plummeting 566.56 points on negative global cues.         
	The tailspin began from the start, and the shares were seen trading almost 852 points down in the afternoon before settling at 15975.52. Nifty tumbled by 150 points and closed at 4771.60.         
	Negative Asian markets and complete loss of confidence are the main factors affecting the markets. Investors are sitting on cash but are reluctant to invest as the stocks they bought last month at lower levels are still waiting to touch their expected selling prices, Ambareesh Baliga of Karvy Stock Broking said.         
	Institutional investors are continuously selling. This selling pressure in the absence of adequate buying is contributing to the bear rally, he said.        
	The Asian markets mostly ended in the red with the Nikkei plunging 3.27 per cent and Hong Kongs Hang Seng dropping 3.6 per cent. Nasdaq, the S amp;P 500, Singapores Straits Times, and Koreas Kospi all ended with about 2 per cent losses each on their stocks.         
	Concerns about a US economic slowdown have been bugging the Asian markets over the past few months, and analysts believe the problem will increase in the coming months.         
	Mutual funds are not keen to allocate further wealth into equities as the NAVs are already down, Baliga added.         
	Realty and power stocks were the biggest victims today with losses at 6.64 per cent and 5.57 per cent, respectively, on the BSE. Banking stocks swooned 5 per cent, led by ICICI Bank, which lost about 7.04 per cent on the BSE.         
	The fall is attributed to four factors  global stress, uncertainty over the budgets farm debt waiver, no expectation of any rate cut by the RBI in April and data on imminent monsoon, said Nilesh Shah of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.        
	Scrip change        
	Jaypee groups flagship firm Jaiprakash Associates will replace Bajaj Auto in the sensex from March 14.

	New Delhi, May 4 (PTI): The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has unveiled a ten point agenda for the manufacturing sector to achieve and sustain a 25 per cent share of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020.        
	The agenda is aimed at increasing the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP from the current 15-17 per cent to 25 per cent over the next 12 years, the chamber said in a release here. Manufacturing had enjoyed a cost advantage because of labour arbitrage but that advantage did not exist anymore. The CII plans to meet this challenge through this roadmap, it said.        
	With imports becoming a crucial component in sectors such as capital goods, CII is of the view that a roadmap to strengthen the sector is imperative and CIIs manufacturing council is set to work towards that end.        
	The chamber would be working towards opening up of strategic sectors such as coal to meet energy requirements, it said.        
	CII would put into place an apex task force on coal to implement this report.        
	It also proposes that the steel and mining industry should work together to roll out the guidelines that would lead to a win-win solution.        
	CIIs national committee on chemicals would focus on opening opportunities and encouraging Indian industries to evaluate the options of entering new areas such as water purification, nanotechnology and bio-fuels.        
	The chamber would also have an apex task force on corrosion to bring into focus one of the biggest wastes in the manufacturing sector, it said

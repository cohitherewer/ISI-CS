	Calcutta, Aug. 27: Bengal is trying to engage the countrys largest iron ore miner NMDC Ltd to secure the supply of the raw material for the steel plants that are coming up in the state.        
	Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the state had initiated a dialogue with NMDC.        
	Despite a dearth of ore, the government has approved 14 proposals for steel plants, totalling 30 million tonne capacity.        
	The state has assured the promoters coal linkages, land, water and other infrastructure.        
	We have told the companies to arrange for iron ore on their own. It is not in our hand But, still the government is trying to arrange something, Sen said.        
	According to him, the states short-term requirement will be 16 million tonne of ore every year. The state wants to arrange a part of it through NMDC. A possible tie-up may take place with West Bengal Mineral Development and Trading Corporation (WBMDTC) and NMDC.        
	The state is not in favour of WBMDTC getting any captive iron ore block since it does not have the expertise.        
	NMDC chairman and managing director Rana Som confirmed that Bengal had requested for long-term linkage of iron ore. We will consider Bengals case when NMDC gets new iron ore mines, he told The Telegraph.        
	Som said all of NMDCs existing capacities were fully booked in terms of long-term contracts with existing industries.         
	He said the company would give iron ore linkage on a long-term basis to a state government-appointed company for distribution among private steel players. However, the state agency would not be allowed to make any trading profit.        
	Sen was speaking at the sidelines of an interactive session with Union minister of state for steel Jitin Prasad organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

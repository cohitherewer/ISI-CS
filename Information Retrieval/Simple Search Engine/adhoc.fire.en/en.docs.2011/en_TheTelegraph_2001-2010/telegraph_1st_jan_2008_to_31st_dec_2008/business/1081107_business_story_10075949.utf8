The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rate relief lacks pulling power
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rate relief lacks pulling power
          JAYATI GHOSE, GARIMA SINGH NEOGY AMP; VIVEK NAIR                                            
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Nov. 6: Banks have started cutting lending rates, making home and auto loans cheaper. But will new borrowers bite the bait?        
	Spooked by the global financial turmoil, banks have become cautious about the creditworthiness of borrowers. They are tightening eligibility criteria and demanding higher down payments on loans, which are likely to discourage loan aspirants.        
	Besides, car and property prices are still quite high to attract buyers in droves.        
	An ICICI Bank spokesperson said, The bank is taking stringent measures to ensure that only borrowers with sound repayment capacity are extended loans.         
	Banks have also increased the down payment on home loans to minimise their losses from a default.        
	We have increased the margin requirement (down payment) to secure our advances from any price fluctuation in the market. This will also ensure that only reasonably sound and creditworthy borrowers get access to loans, SBI officials said.        
	The other factor that worries senior bankers is the extent of money that will actually flow from banks to firms and consumers.        
	State Bank chairman . P. Bhatt and ICICI Bank joint MD Chanda Kochhar today jointly called for adequate liquidity in the system, while strongly hinting that funds in the system could again turn tight in the short-term.        
	In India we dont have the problem of a lack of trust between banks and financial institutions, but we do have a problem of a lack of liquidity. There is not enough liquidity in the system for money to flow from one bank to another or from one bank to a customer, Bhatt said.        
	He said there could be some pressure on liquidity next month as government borrowings would increase. However, for now, there is ample liquidity in the system.        
	The pressure on liquidity, according to Bhatt and Kochhar, is because of the withdrawal of dollars by foreign institutional investors and the decline in external commercial borrowings.        
	According to Abdul Majeeth, auto analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Current global uncertainty and credit crunch will not allow customers to enjoy the benefit of lower lending rates, since banks will now become cautious about lending.        
	Sanjeev Shukla, head of marketing, Ford India, said, US crisis has had an impact on us. Though interest rates are coming down, we will not be able to get back to the earlier levels of sales.        
	Moreover, analysts said, borrowers were unlikely to make a beeline for loans as property and car prices are high. Maruti Suzuki, Indias No. 1 car maker, raised the prices of most of its models last month.        
	It would take at least two to three months for credit demand to pick up. Property prices are still not realistic, auto prices are going up, liquidity is still a problem, said U.S. Bhargava, former general manager, Punjab National Bank.

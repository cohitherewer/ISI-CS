                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chamber for closer monitoring of funds
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cause for concern                                  
	New Delhi, April 20: The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) has sought increased surveillance of the financial system in a note to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It said such a measure should help avert any crisis such as the one in the US.        
	In a note submitted to RBI governor Y.V. Reddy, Assocham president Venugopal Dhoot said the central bank should increase surveillance of the entire financial system so that a crisis situation does not arise.         
	The chambers concern stems from the adverse impact the US sub-prime crisis has had all over the world, particularly on growing economies such as India.         
	In its note, the chamber said Indian companies should be permitted to hike their overseas investment limit by 250 per cent of their net worth from 200 per cent now.         
	Dhoot said capital inflows should be diverted towards infrastructure investment as this would help solve the problems of excess liquidity on account of the dollar deluge and remove infrastructure constraints.         
	The current investment boom in the Indian economy can be hampered because of high borrowing costs, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).         
	Therefore, interest cut has become essential to ensure that the SMEs can hike production and also contribute to exports, he said.        
	This can be possible with more loans to these enterprises, particularly at lower interest rates.         
	The industry also asked the RBI to consider increasing the ceiling on external commercial borrowing.         
	The end-use norms for funds raised through this route should also be eased, it said.         
	The chamber said adequate liquidity infusion at appropriate times during any unfolding crisis in the financial markets was the key to avoid major turbulences such as the ones witnessed by the stock markets in the last few months.         
	The RBI should relax the norms relating to market intermediaries to avoid a liquidity crunch, it said.         
	Dhoot, who was in Orissa today, asked the state government to adopt a flexible land acquisition policy to attract investors. Assocham today offered to bring investments worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore to the state in three years.

          OUR BUREAU                          Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Sept. 16: The Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today swung into action to prop up the reeling rupee, which has been badly roiled by the global currency turmoil in the past few weeks.        
	The RBI today effectively created a corpus of Rs 30,000 crore that banks could tap into to meet their immediate cash requirements and slake exporters thirst for dollars.        
	The craze for cash has triggered disruptions in the forex and money markets that have exacerbated since the Lehman collapse. The central bank also put out attractive baits to lure non-resident Indian money into the country in an attempt to head off a potential crisis from a widely anticipated outflow of dollars as foreign investors pare their exposures to India.        
	At the same time, the Centre said export incentives such as an interest subvention would be scrapped for everyone except the textile sector by the end of the month.        
	Export incentives for all sectors, except textiles, will lapse by the end of the month, commerce secretary G. K. Pillai said in the capital.        
	The concerted move was triggered by the 7.5 per cent fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar in the past month. On Tuesday, the rupee almost dipped to 47 before closing at a 27-month low at 46.90.        
	The rupee has obviously gone very low. It appears to be an aberration  It also means higher exports, commerce minister Kamal Nath said.        
	The weak rupee has helped exports grow 24.6 per cent in the April-July period to $59.19 billion. The export target for 2008-09 fiscal is set at $200 billion.        
	The RBI paved the way for a liquidity infusion into the banking system by permitting banks to draw additional funds under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).        
	LAF is an instrument through which the central bank manages liquidity in the system. It is undertaken through reverse repo and repo. In a reverse repo, the central bank sucks out liquidity from the system whereas it uses the repo to pump money into it.        
	Banks can obtain liquidity under LAF against collateral of government securities, which they hold in excess of their prescribed statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).         
	SLR is the percentage of a banks deposits that must be maintained in the form of government securities. It currently stands at 25 per cent.        
	The RBI said banks could avail themselves of additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to one per cent of their net demand and time liabilities or deposits.

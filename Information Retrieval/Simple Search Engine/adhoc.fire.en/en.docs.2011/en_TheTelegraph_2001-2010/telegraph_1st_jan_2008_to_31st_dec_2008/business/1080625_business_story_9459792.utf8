          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 24: India will be able to maintain 9 per cent growth in medium term despite soaring oil prices in the international market, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman, Planning Commission, here today.         
	He, however, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had a role to play in taming inflation.         
	On growth in gross domestic product (GDP), Ahluwalia said, I believe that the nine per cent growth rate that we are talking about for the Indian economy can be maintained even with the present level of oil prices.        
	However, he added, the task of achieving high growth becomes more difficult if oil prices rise. Stating that rising inflation was a serious problem, Ahluwalia said there is no reason to alter our medium-term objective.        
	India has achieved over nine per cent GDP growth rate in the past three years and policy-makers are predicting that there will be moderation in growth during the current fiscal. He said the oil price situation could be tackled without hurting the confidence of medium-term investors.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram had earlier said that growth would be in the range of 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent in this fiscal.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Khattar: Bold move                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Former Maruti managing director Jagdish Khattar today announced his plans to foray into multi-brand car sales and services.        
	Khattars newly formed company  Carnation Auto  plans to invest Rs 1,000 crore over the next five years. The company has already got an initial investment of over Rs 100 crore from Premji Invest and IFCI Ventures.        
	We will begin with providing services and will later sell cars of different models. We will become a one-stop-shop, not only for cars but also for auto needs, said Khattar, chairman and managing director of Carnation Auto.        
	The company plans to launch its service outlets at 100 locations in 65 cities across the country in the next five years.        
	It will open about six outlets in the National Capital Region, Hyderabad and Cochin by the end of the current fiscal. The number will be increased to 30 next year.        
	Carnation Auto also plans to form six to eight joint ventures in major cities with local partners and the company will own a majority stake in these entities.        
	It has set up a wholly owned infrastructure company, Carnation Realty, for buying key properties and leasing them to the parent firm.        
	The realty arm will also work on developing and executing new concepts for auto-solution hubs and multi-brand showrooms.        
	The realty company is in discussion with some real estate firms to jointly develop these concepts, Khattar said.        
	In the pipeline is an automotive training institute that will set up training centres and organise workshops along with the government, original equipment manufacturers and industry bodies.        
	There is a huge shortage of skilled manpower in the automobile industry. There is a need for an organised approach to train manpower for this industry, he said.        
	On whether the company expects resistance from single-brand dealers, Khattar said, We are becoming a neighbourhood workshop and not competing with them. Usually, after two years, 40-60 per cent of the people move away from their original dealers.        
	He said Carnation Auto was also open to the idea of partnering companies such as Bosch and Castrol, which have their own multi-brand service centres.

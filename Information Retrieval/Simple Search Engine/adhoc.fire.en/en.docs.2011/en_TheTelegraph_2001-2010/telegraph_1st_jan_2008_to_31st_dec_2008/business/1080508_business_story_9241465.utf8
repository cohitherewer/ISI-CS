          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cristiano Silei, director (commercial) of Ducati, in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, May 7: Italys Ducati Motor Holding today launched a range of premium bikes priced between Rs 21 lakh and Rs 47 lakh in India.        
	Suzukis Hayabusa bikes, to be launched soon, will be Ducatis competitor in the high-end segment. At present, Yamaha, which sells sports bike YZFRI and street bike MT01 for Rs 11.25 lakh (approximate price), is Ducatis closest rival.        
	Yamahas YZFR1 sports a 998cc engine and MT01 comes with a 1670cc engine. In comparison, the 850cc Ducati 848 is priced at around Rs 21 lakh, while the 1200cc 1098R costs Rs 47 lakh.        
	These bikes will be imported as completely built units. We pay an import duty of 114 per cent on premium bikes, making us niche players in the segment, said Ashish Chordia, chairman and CEO of Precision Motor India, the exclusive importer of Ducati bikes in the country.         
	According to Cristiano Silei, director of Ducati, the company will gradually launch its entire range, including its five other models, in the next one year. The cheapest model will be a Rs 15-lakh motorcycle. We want to be the market leader in the high-end segment, he added.         
	Ducati is looking to import 50 bikes this year and will ramp up sales depending on the demand.         
	If we are able to sell 50 units in the current year, then it will be more than enough. Depending on the demand we will gradually increase the sales, said Gabriele Del Torchi, CEO of Ducati Motor.        
	We are very impressed with the evolution of the Indian market. I am proud to officially announce our entry into the Indian market, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 29: The government is likely to take a call on raising fuel prices in two to three days, by which time it expects to win over all the members of the UPA as well as the Left.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was engaged in hectic parleys throughout the day. Meetings were held with senior cabinet ministers and with Congress party president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.        
	The meeting with Gandhi, where Congress party leaders were present, discussed the political implications of a fuel price hike.         
	Though the Left parties have expressed opposition to any increase in auto fuel prices, the government will try to persuade its allies to accept a marginal hike.        
	Both the Congress and the Left parties are concerned about the impact of the hike on the state assembly elections later this year. They feel a package has to emerge now before electioneering starts in earnest.         
	We discussed various options. Hopefully, by tomorrow or by day after tomorrow, we will have a solution. Some things have been agreed at todays meeting, but I cannot say what the cabinet will decide, petroleum minister Murli Deora said after a 75-minute meeting with the Prime Minister and other cabinet colleagues.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister P Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia were also present. They discussed the surge in crude prices since the last price hike in February and the options before them.        
	Sources said the UPA would be adopting a combination of measures to tackle the situation, which has affected the financial viability of the oil companies.

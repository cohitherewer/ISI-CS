                                I am 67 years old. I want to know what are the different products under reverse mortgage scheme? Is the money available in lump sum and which are the banks offering the same? Is prepayment allowed for such a loan? I plan to take a loan of Rs 25 lakh to buy a small property. I shall repay by selling one of my properties that have a minimum market price of Rs 70 lakh.           S. Dasgupta, Calcutta
                    A reverse mortgage works like this: You keep your house mortgaged with a bank and the bank gives you the loan amount, including the interest as a monthly payout, or extends you a line of credit which you can draw at the time of need. A reverse mortgage scheme can be up to a maximum of 15 years. Under the proposed guidelines of the National Housing Bank, the loan amount shall be extended as regular monthly or periodic cash advances or as a line of credit to be drawn at the time of need. A lump sum withdrawal of loan is permitted for restricted use, such as for renovation and extension of residential property. Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank, the State Bank of India are among those offering a reverse mortgage scheme. You can directly talk to a bank if you want the loan at one go.                                   Penalty call      What will be the penalty if a person furnishes wrong information in his income tax return? Can he deposit the balance amount with penalty by submitting a revised return?        S. Dutta, Purulia
                  Non-payment of tax and claiming deductions on the basis of wrong information is a criminal offence. The punishment could range from payment of a penalty and arrear tax to imprisonment. Whether you can submit a revised return will depend on your assessing income tax officer.                                       Share sale      I wanted to sell some shares which are kept in my demat account with Axis Bank. Should I ask my broker to give me a cheque drawn on Axis Bank as sale proceeds of those shares?        K.N. Guha Roy, Calcutta
                    Your broker will give you a cheque drawn on his bank. You should deposit it at your bank. Taking the payment from the broker against sale of shares is not always advisable. For example, after the stock market crash on Monday and Tuesday, brokers didnt allow investors to buy shares unless they had credit balances with brokerage houses.

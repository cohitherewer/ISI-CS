	Mumbai, Oct. 27: India Incs rights luck seems to be running out for the moment.         
	Suzlon Energy today announced that it is suspending plans to raise Rs 1,800 crore through a rights issue because of uncertain capital market conditions.         
	Hindalco and Tata Motors are two other companies that recently came out with rights offers. While the Rs 5,000-crore Hindalco rights devolved on the underwriters, the Tata offer, too, fell short of the target.        
	Suzlon, however, said the decision to shelve the rights offer would not affect the expansion of the company.         
	The wind turbine maker will also suspend negotiations on a domination agreement with Germanys REpower, in which the Indian company is the majority shareholder.        
	German laws make it mandatory for the majority shareholder of a company to sign a domination agreement with the management to have a say in the companys operations. Otherwise, the management and the ownership remain separate.

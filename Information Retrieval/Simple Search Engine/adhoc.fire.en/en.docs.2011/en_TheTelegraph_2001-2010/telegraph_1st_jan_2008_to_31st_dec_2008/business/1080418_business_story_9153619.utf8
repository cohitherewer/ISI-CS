          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 17: Inflation remained high at 7.14 per cent for the week ended April 5, on the back of a 10 per cent rise in vegetable prices.        
	However, this was lower than 7.41 per cent inflation reported for March 29. Economists said inflation was likely to remain at around 7 per cent for the next few weeks till the wheat crop sown in winter starts coming to the market in larger quantities.         
	D. Joshi, chief economist with rating agency Crisil, said, The new crop and after that the monsoon will play a critical role in price control. Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal had said yesterday that the rains were expected to be sufficient for good crops.         
	An analyst said the steps taken by the government, including a ban on the export of non-basmati rice and the withdrawal of incentives for steel exports, would help arrest a price spiral. But right now not even a further tightening of the monetary policy can totally halt the price rise.        
	The RBI today raised the cash reserve ratio the portion of their cash that banks must keep with the central bank  by 50 basis points in two phases. Analysts, however, say the main driver of inflation is food prices and unless they climb down, the high prices will remain. In a debate in Parliament on the issue, finance minister P. Chidambaram also admitted that inflation was being fuelled by increases in the international prices of crude oil, foodgrains, edible oils and other commodities.        
	The Congress-led government plans to import 1 million tonnes of edible oils to curb prices as demand rises amid a shortfall in the domestic crop, among other steps. But the battle against inflation is claiming another victim  economic growth. The finance ministry itself sees growth slowing to 8.8 per cent in 2007-08 from 9.6 per cent last year. Banks such as HSBC feel the growth rate can slip to 7-8 per cent.        
	If the ministry is correct in its forecast, it will be the first deceleration in three years as a result of the RBIs policy of raising interest rates to suck out excess money and check prices. Most economists feel the Centre will continue with this policy.

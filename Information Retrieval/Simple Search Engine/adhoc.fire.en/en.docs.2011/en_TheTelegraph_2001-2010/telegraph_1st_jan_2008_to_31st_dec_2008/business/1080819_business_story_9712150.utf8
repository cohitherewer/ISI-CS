                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apollo Tyres trips on Hungary hurdle
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Apollo Tyres will not set up a factory in Hungary because of administrative hurdles.         
	Apollo Tyres has decided to withdraw its application for setting up its manufacturing and technology centre at Gyongyos in Hungary. Unexpected delays in administrative processes required for the 200-million-euro (Rs 12,869 crore) project has prompted the decision, Neeraj Kanwar, vice-chairman and joint managing director of Apollo Tyres told The Telegraph.         
	A senior company official said Apollo was looking at other locations in eastern Europe, including Slovakia, adding that the move was likely to have a short-term financial and resource allocation impact.        
	In January this year, Apollo said it would invest in the Gyongyos plant with an annual capacity of 7 million tyres a year. The production was scheduled to begin from June.        
	According to Kanwar, the authorities were facing difficulties in acquiring land for the project following opposition from a section of the local community.         
	The company has asked the Hungarian Investment and Trade Development Agency to identify an alternative location where it would be able to showcase its technology in a more effective manner.        
	Kochi lock-out         
	In another development, the management of Apollo Tyres has announced a lock-out at its Kochi facility as a strike called by a section of the workers has slowed production in the unit.        
	The company had recently invested about Rs 15 crore to increase production at the Perambra unit in Kochi to 318 metric tonnes from 280 metric tonnes.        
	Despite negotiations with the union for the past few months, there has been no resolution either on capacity maximisation or fresh investments, the company said in a statement.        
	For some time now, Apollo Tyres has been looking to expand its operations at the Perambra facility to achieve capacity maximisation.

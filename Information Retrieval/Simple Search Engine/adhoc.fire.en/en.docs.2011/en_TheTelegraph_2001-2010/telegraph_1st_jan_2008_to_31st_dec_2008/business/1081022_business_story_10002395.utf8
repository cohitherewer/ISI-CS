          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Roongta: Good show                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) today reported a net profit of Rs 2,009 crore in the second quarter (July-September 2008) against Rs 1,700.2 crore a year ago, an increase of 18.2 per cent.        
	For the first half (April-September 2008), net profit rose 19.2 per cent to Rs 3,844 crore from Rs 3,225 crore.         
	SAIL chairman S. K. Roongta said the first-half show was the best ever for the company.         
	However, SAIL expects steel prices to decline in the future.         
	Turnover during the second quarter grew 30.6 per cent to Rs 13,544 crore from Rs 10,371 crore a year ago. For the first half, it rose 33 per cent to Rs 25,727 crore.        
	Though hit by an escalation in input costs, SAIL reported impressive growth because of the production of more value-added items, falling interest payments and higher interest earnings.         
	It also used resources more efficiently, with a three per cent reduction in coke use and seven per cent decline in specific energy consumption.         
	SAILs plants together produced 3.8 million tonnes of hot metal, 3.5 million tonnes of crude steel and 1.14 million tonnes of value-added steel in the second quarter. Hot metal output was up seven per cent, crude steel five per cent, and value-added steel 33 per cent.        
	Net worth of the company stood at Rs 27,000 crore.         
	Capital expenditure increased to Rs 1,900 crore in the first half against Rs 750 crore a year ago.        
	RNRL show        
	Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) has posted a net profit of Rs 20.10 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, a 4.91 per cent growth over the corresponding period a year ago.

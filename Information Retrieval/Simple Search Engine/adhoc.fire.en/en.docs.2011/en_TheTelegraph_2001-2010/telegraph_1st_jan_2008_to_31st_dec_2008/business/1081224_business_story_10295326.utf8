          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The World Bank has banned Satyam Computer from providing it software services for eight years because of chairman B. Ramalinga Rajus alleged malpractices, including bribery.        
	Sudip Majumdar, a spokesperson for World Bank has confirmed the move. According to the bank, improper benefits to bank staff and lack of documentation on invoices are the reasons behind the ban.         
	World Bank information security chief Robert Van Pulley admitted to the ban during a recent meeting with the officials of Government Accountability Project, an organisation which promotes government and corporate accountability in the US. The bank has handed over the case to the US justice department and the US treasury department.         
	When contacted, a Satyam spokesperson said, Satyam does not comment on individual clients. Satyam began providing IT services to the World Bank in 2003. The allegations of bribery surfaced two years later.         
	In 2007, an internal World Bank investigation found that its former vice-president Mohamed Muhsin had secured contracts and purchase orders worth $100 million for the Indian firm in return for Satyams stock options at preferential prices. However, Satyam was allowed to work for the bank till 2008.         
	Satyam has also been accused of illegally accessing the banks records containing sensitive financial information.         
	Satyam has been in the line of fire since its botched attempt to acquire two realty and infrastructure firms  partially owned by the promoters of Satyam  for $1.6 billion. UKs Upaid Systems has also sued Satyam for fraud, forgery and a breach of contract.        
	Stocks hammered        
	The shares of Satyam today plummeted nearly 14 per cent on the bourses as rumours of its chairman Ramalinga Rajus resignation enveloped the market.        
	At the end of trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Satyam settled down 13.55 per cent at Rs 140.40, after partially recovering from the days low.

                                                                                                               Push for FDI in retail
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, Feb 28: The economic survey today called for opening up retail trade to foreign direct investment.        
	Allow a share of foreign equity in all retail trade. Allow 100 per cent foreign equity in specialised retail chains like luxury brands and consumer durables, the survey said.        
	 It is a good policy to open up specialised retail chains to foreign equity as it will bring much required foreign investments to India. It will subsequently pave the way for foreign equity to be channelised to organised retail in India, said, Asitava Sen, vice-president of Technopak.         
	It will lead to the flow of foreign equity to modern Indian retail in a phased and calibrated manner thereby helping in its growth, he added.        
	Future group chairman Kishore Biyani said, I believe it is a very good and calibrated approach. He said the move could benefit the domestic companies as their business has become valuable.

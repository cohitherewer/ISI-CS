	Calcutta, April 22: Hindustan Paper Corporation (HPC) has reported an 11 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 133 crore for the financial year 2007-08.        
	According to company chairman Raji Philip, the combined production of writing paper, printing paper and newsprint was 3,27,857 tonnes, while sales turnover was Rs 1,137 crore.        
	For the current fiscal, the company has set a production target of 2,22,000-3,40,000 tonnes of printing and writing paper and 1,18,000 tonnes of newsprint. It expects a gross turnover of Rs 1,313 crore.        
	Philip said HPC was one of the few companies to reduce the price of paper after the excise duty was cut to eight per cent from 12 per cent in the Union budget. But I am not sure how long HPC will be able to maintain the current prices because of the continuous rise in input costs, he said.         
	Prices of coal have also risen 50 per cent over the last three months, Philip said.        
	The companys modernisation and upgradation programme at its various units is in progress. HPC will invest Rs 660 crore to ramp up the capacity of its Nagaon and Cachar mills in Assam to 1.3 lakh tonnes from one lakh tonne. The project will be completed by 2010. Its 66,000-tonne-per-annum Nagaland unit will resume operation from October 2009, after being closed for nearly a decade. The company will shell out Rs 552.44 crore for its revival.        
	The Rs 719-crore project of Hindustan Newsprint, a wholly owned subsidiary of HPC in Kerala, to step up capacity to 2.7 lakh tonnes will be completed by November next year.         
	However, Philip was unsure about completing the three-lakh-tonne-per-annum unit at Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh in time. HPC had planned to make the first phase of the unit operational by June 2010. It has already floated a special purpose vehicle, Jagdishpur Paper Mills Ltd, in which the promoter will hold a 51 per cent stake.         
	Philip admitted that the project might miss the target as the arrangements for the supply of fuel and other inputs such as pulp, bamboo and timber were yet to be finalised.

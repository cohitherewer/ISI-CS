The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairo tea centre plan gathers pace
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cairo tea centre plan gathers pace

	Calcutta, June 15: Al Misr, one of Egypts largest tea trading public sector company, is keen to invest in the India Tea Centre being set up in Cairo.         
	After facing delays over the search of a proper location, the centre is expected to start by August 15.         
	We have found a suitable location in downtown Cairo, not far from the Indian Cultural Centre. The centre will be spread across 5,000 sq ft. While the ground floor will house the caf selling Indian tea and snacks, the next floor will be used by Indian companies for marketing and other trading activities, said D.P. Maheshwari, president of the United Planters Association of Southern India (Upasi).         
	Maheshwari said Al Misr had expressed its willingness to invest in the centre as it believed that Indian tea would regain its lost glory in Egypt after the export duty cut.        
	After state-owned Al Naser, Al Misr is the largest tea buying company in Egypt.         
	Upasi is supervising the setting up of the centre.         
	The Upasi chief was part of the delegation that had recently visited the country, including Union minister of state for commerce and industry Jairam Ramesh and Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee.         
	Maheshwari said Al Misrs proposal and other issues regarding the cost of running the centre and industry participation would be discussed at a meeting of Upasi this week.         
	The commerce ministry has given its approval for the centre and the Tea Board will pay the rent for the premises initially.         
	The proposal for the centre was made in September 2005 and initially there were talks to use Air Indias premises in downtown Cairo for the project.         
	Ramesh had also written to the Oberoi group asking for space. However, none of these arrangements worked.        
	Indian tea was once very popular in Egypt.         
	However, after the introduction of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa in 1993, Kenya raced ahead with an export duty of two per cent vis--vis 27 per cent for India.         
	However, with the duty being reduced to two per cent, the exports have once again gathered momentum.         
	Around five million kg of tea was exported to Egypt last year.         
	This year it is expected to touch 15 million kg, with the bulk of it going from south India.         
	Output rises        
	Tea production and exports during April 2008 increased 17.32 million kg and 2.94 million kg, respectively, compared with the same period last year, according to Tea Board estimates.        
	While production was at 80.04 million kg in April 2008 against 62.72 million kg in the corresponding month last year, exports saw a marginal rise from 8.95 million kg in April 2007 to 11.89 million kg in April 2008.

	New Delhi, Jan. 10: General Motors plans to launch its Cadillac CTS and the Hummer H3 in India later this year. The company hopes to sell up to 400 Hummers here. It could be priced at Rs 75 lakh, say analysts.
    
	GM today showcased these two vehicles along with several concept vehicles, including the premium SUV Chevrolet T2X, the Chevrolet Sequel and the WTCC Ultra, a sports vehicle, at the auto show.
    
	Karl Slym, president and managing director of GM India, said, We are hoping to get a good response to the Hummer H3 at the auto show here. GM will initially import completely built units for the Hummer H3. 
    
	If the demand rises and we think it is viable we may start producing it at our Talegaon facility in Maharashtra, Slym added.
    
	With India being primarily a small car market and the segment occupying 72 per cent of the market, the Talegaon facility will be dedicated to the production of the Chevrolet Spark. The facility has production capacity of 1,40,000 units per annum. 
    
	P. Balendran, director and vice-president (corporate affairs), said: We are hoping to sell 300 to 400 units of the Hummer H3 in one year. 
    
	The size of the market in India for premium SUVs is 6,000 units. 
    
	Balendran added, We are expecting that the size of the market for this segment will go up to 25,000 units over the next five years. 
    
	Built in South Africa, the H3 adds its own unique styling features to the iconic Hummer brand. It follows in the tracks of the Hummer H1, the H2 and the H2 SUT. The H3 is 39 mm shorter in length, 171 mm shorter in height and 73 mm narrower than the H2. 
    
	This makes it about the same length as a large family sedan. As a result, the H3 can readily navigate city traffic without losing Hummers trademark climbing capability or style. 
    
	This premium SUV comes with a 244 bhp 3.7-litre Vortec inline five-cylinder engine.

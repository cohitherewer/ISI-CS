                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Crude slide fuels price-cut hope
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          WALK THE TIGHTROPE                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The latest dip in crude increased the pressure on the petroleum ministry to reduce fuel prices before some states go to the polls in the next two months. Crude today touched $88.89, the lowest level since early February.         
	According to sources, petroleum minister Murli Deora has apprised state-run oil companies of the growing political pressure within the ruling alliance to revise petrol and diesel prices in the wake of falling crude rates.        
	The cut in fuel prices will have a direct impact on inflation, which has now dipped below 12 per cent, and lead to a drop in the prices of essential commodities.         
	High commodity prices will top the agenda of opposition parties in their criticism of the Union government.        
	Deora, however, has been maintaining that the government could only re-visit fuel prices if crude falls below $68 a barrel, which is the rate at which the fuel is sold to consumers.        
	Assembly polls are due in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Mizoram and Jammu and Kashmir in November or December.        
	Sources said the ministry would be holding discussions in the coming days to seek a middle path that would find favour with both the political parties and the oil companies.        
	A possible solution could be to introduce dual pricing of diesel though there are serious doubts about its implementation.         
	The oil ministry is working on ways to increase diesel prices without hurting crucial sectors such as agriculture, railways, defence and public transport companies, who buy the fuel in bulk from the oil firms.        
	Oil companies are losing Rs 350 crore per day for selling fuels below cost.

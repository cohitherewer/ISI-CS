                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Investors slam Ranbaxy scrip
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, July 14: The Ranbaxy scrip sank 13 per cent today even as the company vigorously defended itself against charges of selling adulterated drugs in the US.        
	Indias No. 1 drug company also said its deal to sell a 34.8 per cent equity stake to Japans Daiichi Sankyo was binding and final, and remained on track.        
	In a statement, Ranbaxy said it would file a response later today at the US district court of Maryland. It maintained its business in the US market continued to be normal.         
	The Ranbaxy scrip tumbled 13 per cent during the days trade after touching an intra-day low of Rs 470.15.        
	However, it recovered some of the lost ground to settle at Rs 475.90, a decline of 10 per cent over the previous close of Rs 531.45. The sensex fell 139.34 points to 13330.51.        
	Denying the allegations raised by the US justice department, Ranbaxy said that no prosecution had been initiated.         
	An investigation has been underway for around three years and during this period, the company has been co-operating fully with the justice department.         
	The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has gathered over 200 random samples of various products marketed by the company in the US. These products, Ranbaxy said, have been independently tested by the FDA and were found to be complying with all the specifications as per the filing. Under these circumstances the company finds that the allegations are baseless.         
	Ranbaxy said, A motion has been filed (not granted) seeking certain documents. No legal proceedings in the sense of a prosecution have been started. Ranbaxy strongly denies the allegations contained in the motion. Meanwhile, we continue to co-operate with the US justice department. We remain committed to providing high quality generic medicines at affordable prices to our customers and patients in the US.         
	Charging Ranbaxy after a three-year investigation, the FDA believed that violations have resulted in the sales of adulterated and misbranded drugs.         
	Daiichi Sankyo said the company had not made any changes in its Ranbaxy stake acquisition plan. The Japanese company did not comment on the latest development and said that it would follow the matter closely.        
	The US drug regulator has taken Ranbaxy to court claiming that the Indian company used APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) from unapproved sources.         
	However, the FDA today refused to comment on the latest development. We do not comment on an ongoing litigation, an FDA spokesperson said, according to an agency report.

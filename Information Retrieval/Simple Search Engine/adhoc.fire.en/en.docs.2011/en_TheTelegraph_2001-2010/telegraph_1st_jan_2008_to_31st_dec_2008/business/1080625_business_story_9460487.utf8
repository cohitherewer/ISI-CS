          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ripple Effect                          
	Mumbai, June 24: Interest rates across various categories of loans are likely to rise by 50 basis points as banks are set to hike lending rates following the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) decision to hike the cash reserve ratio and the repo rate by 50 basis points each.        
	Though the RBI had raised the repo rate by 25 basis points on June 11, most banks, barring some private sector entities such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, did not alter their lending rates.        
	However, this time around, a revision in interest rates is imminent. Our bank will shortly take a decision, said an official from Punjab National Bank.        
	Another banker said that interest rates on loans were likely to turn dearer by at least 50 basis points and in some categories, the rise could even be to the tune of 75 basis points. He added that deposit rates could also be hiked in the coming days.        
	Many banks had not hiked their lending rates when the RBI last raised the repo rate. Therefore, if one were to take into account todays move, there could be at least half a percentage point increase in loans, he said.        
	Indian companies are likely to bear the brunt first as banks will be keen to raise their prime lending rates.        
	Though home loan rates are also expected to rise, it is felt that they will be increased only towards the end of this month and that the increase could be in the region of 25-50 basis points.        
	Stock market observers, stunned by RBIs late evening announcement, said the move would hit sentiments tomorrow and that interest rate sensitive scrips could be the worst hit. There are fears that the sensex will open lower over expectations of company earnings taking a hit because of the RBIs frequent rate manoeuvres.

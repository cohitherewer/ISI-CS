        With inflation soaring to new highs, investors need to look at the real rate of returns. Rishi Nathany offers ways to stay ahead of the rising tide                                            
	Inflation has reared its ugly head again. From around 4 per cent in January, the inflation rate is now ruling at over 7 per cent in the country.         
	However, this is a global phenomenon as rising commodity prices have led to runaway inflation across countries. In India the inflation rate is based on the wholesale price index and not the consumer price index. Therefore, the burden on the common man is much higher as he has to deal with retail and not wholesale prices.         
	The question is how do investors tackle the situation and get the better of it. Let us first understand what inflation is to understand the investment channels available.        
	What is inflation?        
	Inflation is a period of rising prices. During this time, the purchasing power of the buyer gets constantly diminished. It leads to a depletion in the value of money as one cannot buy the same goods or services as in the past with the same amount. For example, if the inflation rate is to rule at 6 per cent for the next 20 years, a purchase of Rs 100 today will cost Rs 321 in 20 years. Hence, it is necessary to consider the effects of inflation while planning ones investments.        
	The real rate        
	It is important to look at an investments real rate of return, which is the return after inflation, rather than the nominal or coupon rate. The goal of any investment should be to provide the investor a return which is higher than the inflation rate. This will not only ensure that the investment value will not get decreased but also help in wealth creation.         
	If the annual inflation rate is 6 per cent, then the investment should fetch a return of more than 6 per cent. For example, a bond bearing a nominal return of 8 per cent interest per annum will have a real rate of return of only 2 per cent if inflation is at 6 per cent.         
	However, if an individual falls in the highest tax slab, that is 30 per cent, the nominal bond return will be only 5.6 per cent and the real rate of return will be a negative 0.4 per cent! Thus, if the after-tax return on investments is less than the inflation rate, then ones assets will suffer a decline in real value.        
	Know your options        
	Let us now identify various investment avenues that have an edge over inflation and deliver positive returns.        
	 Equities: These are the preferred asset classes for long-term wealth creation.         
	Equities have consistently outperformed other asset categories over the long term. If one has a long-term plan, one can expect equities to deliver annual returns of around 15-20 per cent.         
	Moreover, with the tax benefits on long-term capital gains as well as dividends, the real rate of return to an investor can be substantial. However, while investing in equities, one should be prepared to face short-term volatility in prices.        
	 Real estate: With the Securities and Exchange Board of India clearing the decks for the launch of realty mutual funds, it will now be easier for common investors to try their hand at real estate.         
	Direct investments in real estate demand a large outlay of funds and it is not possible for small investors to shell out the big bucks required for the purpose.         
	Real estate as an asset class will always stay ahead of inflation with expected rental yields of 6-10 per cent per annum and a price appreciation of 5-10 per cent per annum over the long run.        
	 Commodities: This category will always outpace inflation as the latter is a result of rising commodity prices. While savvy investors can deal in commodity futures such as metals or crude on commodity exchanges, the average investor will do better with gold exchange traded funds, which are available for trading on the National Stock Exchange.         
	Gold as an asset is a natural hedge against inflation and its prices will always stay ahead of inflation. However, the disadvantage with gold is that it does not lead to wealth creation in the long run since its returns stay only marginally above inflation.        
	 Fixed income securities: These instruments are preferred by most who need a steady income flow with minimum risks. Fixed income plans will generally lead to an erosion of purchasing power if the interest is used to meet ones expenses.         
	Even if the interest were to be added back to the principal, fixed income securities will barely beat inflation with most instruments being taxable.        
	The right balance        
	So, how does one invest given the risk-return characteristics of various asset classes?         
	If investors bet big on equities, they will be exposed to increased levels of short-term risks in the quest for higher returns. On the other hand, if they invest in fixed income securities, they are susceptible to erosion in capital because of low or negative rate of real returns.         
	The solution lies in the creation of a proper asset allocation giving due weightage to various asset classes according to the investors risk-return profile.         
	The ideal situation will be to create a judicious mix of various asset classes that will give the investor a positive real rate of return while keeping the portfolio risk low .

	New Delhi, Aug. 31 (PTI): Union petroleum minister Murli Deora has proposed to Beijing a no-compete agreement in oil projects .        
	On the sidelines of a summit in Tajikistans capital Dushanbe, Deora suggested to Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi a collaborative approach for acquiring oil and gas projects so that their costs do not needlessly escalate, officials travelling with the minister said.        
	Yang is believed to have reciprocated the suggestion.        
	The suggestion came in the wake of the possibility of a price war over ONGC Videsh Ltds (OVL) 1.42-billion takeover bid of the UK-listed Imperial Energy, which has assets in Tomsk region in western Siberia in Russia.         
	Chinas Sinopec was initially interested in Imperial Energy and had made an offer but thought against a counter offer after OVLs proposal was accepted by Imperials board.

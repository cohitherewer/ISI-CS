The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New markets to get priority in trade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New markets to get priority in trade
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          INCENTIVES GALORE                                  
	New Delhi, April 9: The government is likely to provide incentives for exports to new markets in Africa and Latin America, along with promoting value-added items in one of Indias main export markets, the US.        
	India plans to implement the sops announced yesterday by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to African nations, such as preferential market access and a $5.4-billion aid package, in tandem with its push for newer markets and plans to develop infrastructure facilities in the continent. In addition to boosting imports to fight inflation, Fridays foreign trade policy may give incentives for venturing into new markets.        
	According to a study by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), exports are likely to touch the $500-billion mark within five years, with a focus on labour-oriented segments.         
	Exports for the April-February period increased 22.9 per cent to $138.42 billion but they were not sufficient to meet the target of $160 billion for 2007-08.        
	Africa and Latin America-Caribbean nations account for around 7 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, of exports in 2006-07.         
	Growth driver        
	Analysts said labour-intensive sectors, such as textile, leather, gems and jewellery, and engineering goods, which constitute about 55 per cent of exports, would be the drivers of growth.        
	The policy could also provide incentives to value-added products, as part of a strategy to help Indian products move up the global value-chain.        
	Sanjay Budhia, managing director of the Patton group, said those exports hit by rupee appreciation could recover partially if the government electronically linked the customs authorities at ports with other agencies. This can reduce transaction cost and save time and money, Budhia, who is the chairman of the CII National Committee on Trade Policy, said.        
	Refund strategy        
	He said the trade policy should lay down a road map for the refund of all taxes paid by exporters. The analysts said the policy should provide incentives for focusing on new markets in Eastern Europe, along with Africa and Latin America.        
	A study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said the government should enhance credit lines to African countries. The buoyant trade between India and Africa, reckoned at $25 billion in 2006-07, can be doubled to $50 billion in five years, it said.

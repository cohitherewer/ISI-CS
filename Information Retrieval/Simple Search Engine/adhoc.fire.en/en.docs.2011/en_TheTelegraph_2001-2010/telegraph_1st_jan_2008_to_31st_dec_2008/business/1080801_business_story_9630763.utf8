          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chain reaction                                  
	Mumbai, July 31: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and ICICI Bank today raised interest rates on floating rate home loans by 75 basis points. The revision will apply to both their existing and new customers.        
	HDFC  the countrys largest home loan provider  raised its retail prime lending rate, on which its adjustable rate home loans are benchmarked, by 0.75 per cent with effect from August 1 to 15 per cent. The corporation has, however, not revised its fixed rate home loans.        
	For every 75-basis-point increase in interest rate, the equated monthly instalment (EMI) of a borrower rises by Rs 51 per month per lakh for a loan with a 20-year tenure        
	Officials said the main reasons for the sharp increase in home loan rates were the 50-basis-point hike in the repo rate and the quarter percentage point increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR).        
	This is in line with the rates of interest in the economy, which have hardened due to rising inflation and shrinking liquidity in the domestic market, HDFC said in a press statement today.        
	According to HDFC, the increase in lending rates will affect existing borrowers whose loans come up for re-pricing on or after August 1.         
	HDFC follows a three-month reset cycle for its floating rate loans.        
	For new home loan customers, loans will now be priced at a minimum of 11.75 per cent, while the fixed rates will be at 14 per cent.        
	Simultaneously, ICICI Bank has raised its floating reference rate for consumer loans, including home loans, by three-quarters of a percentage point. The revised rate will now go up to 14.25 per cent from 13.50 per cent at present.        
	The countrys largest private sector bank clarified that existing fixed rate loan borrowers would not be impacted by the increase and their contracted rates would remain unchanged.        
	The Bank of Rajasthan has also raised its benchmark prime lending rate by 100 basis points from 15 per cent to 16 per cent with effect from August 1.        
	Deposit rates        
	ICICI Bank has raised interest rates for various tenors of fixed deposits by 75 to 100 basis points with effect from August 1.         
	The bank, however, did not disclose the new interest rate structure. It also increased the benchmark advance rate (I-Bar), to 17.25 per cent against 16.50 per cent now. This is the benchmark rate for the corporate sector.

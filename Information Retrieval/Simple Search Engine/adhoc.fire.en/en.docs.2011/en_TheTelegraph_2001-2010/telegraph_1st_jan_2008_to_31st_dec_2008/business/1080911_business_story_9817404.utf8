          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 10: Large pharmaceutical companies will shortly be allowed to conduct early stage clinical trials on humans in India  a facility that will substantially reduce drug development costs.         
	Clinical trials are regulated by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.        
	The relaxation in the rules will encourage multinational drug companies to tap Indias growing clinical research base.         
	At present, foreign drug companies are only allowed to conduct phase II and phase III clinical trials in India. Domestic companies are, however, allowed to conduct all the stages of trials.         
	These are certain areas that need to be addressed, drug controller general (India) Surinder Singh told participants here today at Pharma Summit 2008 organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	Phase 0 trials are designed to establish whether the drug behaves in human subjects as anticipated from pre-clinical studies, which are conducted on animals.         
	In phase I, a new drug is tested on a small group of people (20 to less than 100) to evaluate its safety and identify the side effects, if any. In a phase II clinical trial, the study is conducted on a larger group of people (100 to 300) to establish the efficacy of the drug and its safety.         
	Early clinical trials by foreign drug companies were not allowed because the authorities didnt want to turn Indians into human guinea pigs where the safety aspects were not clearly established. Industry circles reckon that if the regulator allows early stage trials, more overseas companies can contract their research work to India.

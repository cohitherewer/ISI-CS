          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The government may consider relaxing the external commercial borrowing (ECB) norms by the end of this month to help Indian companies access overseas funds amidst the global financial turmoil.         
	The ECB relaxation will be based on the credit requirement of productive sectors. We believe there is a strong case for easing the norms, a top finance ministry official said.        
	Officials of the RBI and the finance ministry were expected to meet by the month-end to take a view. The ECB policy was last revised in May, when the government allowed companies to bring home $50 million from the amount they raised overseas compared with $20 million earlier. The limit for infrastructure companies was set higher at $100 million.        
	This will have a positive impact on investments. The interest rate had hardened because of the RBIs measures to control inflation. ECBs are a major source of low-cost capital and its inflow will boost industrial production, according to N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, said, The changes in the ECB norms will provide an opportunity to companies to borrow at a low cost, which will help in strengthening the rupee. The RBI would not have to intervene periodically as a weak rupee also affects imports, especially oil.        
	The Prime Ministers economic advisory council has said in its economic outlook for 2008-09 that the time had come to relax the restrictions imposed on ECBs in August 2007.

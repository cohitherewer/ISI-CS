The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata sparks curiosity with electric car rollout idea 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tata sparks curiosity with electric car rollout idea

	Mumbai, July 24: After the Nano, Tata Motors will test its manufacturing ingenuity with electric cars.        
	At the 63rd annual general meeting today, company chairman Ratan Tata said Tata Motors was working on such a car as well as other fuel-efficient vehicles.        
	It is looking at an eco-car project and, according to reports, has been selected by Thailand for such a venture.         
	Besides, Tata Motors has signed a pact with Moteur Development International of France to use the French firms compressed air engines here.        
	These initiatives come at a time when the domestic automobile industry is grappling with rising input costs and a softening of demand.        
	Tata today told shareholders that the current fiscal would be a difficult one, with policy uncertainties further compounding problems.        
	For Tata Motors, there was limited manoeuvrability in the face of rising input costs such as that of steel. The company will have to either pass on the higher prices of inputs to its customers or absorb them, Tata said.        
	Depending on the strategy, the companys demand will shrink, or there will be pressure on its margins.        
	In such an environment, the company will focus on fuel efficiency and a reduction of costs. We have a difficult year ahead of us. But that does not mean a bad year, he told shareholders.         
	On the Nano, Tata said the company would look to price the base version of the car as promised. Though work on the Nano at Singur had slowed down because of rain, the company was confident of meeting the deadline, he added.        
	Tata allayed shareholder apprehension on the level of equity dilution following the proposed rights issue to part finance the acquisition of the Jaguar and the Land Rover.        
	He said it should be looked in the context of the value that the two marques would bring to the company.        
	Had we been able to consolidate Jaguar and Land Rover with our results in 2007, our consolidated turnover would have been Rs 97,000 crore instead of Rs 40,000 crore and the profit would have been Rs 5,000 crore instead of Rs 3,000 crore, Tata said.         
	We have acquired a very interesting and capable company which operates in 120 countries. We are now among the 17 largest auto companies in the world having two global brands, he added.

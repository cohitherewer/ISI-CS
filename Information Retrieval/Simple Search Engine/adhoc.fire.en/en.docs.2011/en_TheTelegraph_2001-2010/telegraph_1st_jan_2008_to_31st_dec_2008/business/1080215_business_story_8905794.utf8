          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Ian Thomas in New Delhi   on Thursday. (PTI)                            
	Mumbai, Feb.14: Tata Industries and Boeing Company are joining hands to make aerospace components.         
	They will form a joint venture that will make defence-related aerospace components in India to be exported to Boeing and its international customers. The joint venture will be set up by June and will start work soon after.         
	A Tata press statement did not dwell on how the equity would be structured in the joint venture. However, sources say Tata Industries may hold a majority stake.        
	This joint venture with Boeing is an important part of our strategy to build capabilities in defence and aerospace, Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, said. I look forward to the joint venture becoming a world class facility in India, he added.        
	Jim Albaugh, president and CEO of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, said, It represents another step in our commitment to India, in this case by linking the capabilities and heritages of these two companies, to bring real and lasting value to Indias aerospace industry, while making Boeing products more globally competitive.        
	Boeing also plans to make the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in Nagpur operational by 2009, president (India) Ian Thomas said in Delhi.         
	In December, Boeing had signed an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics, delivering the public sector firm commercial and defence aerospace work worth over $1 billion.

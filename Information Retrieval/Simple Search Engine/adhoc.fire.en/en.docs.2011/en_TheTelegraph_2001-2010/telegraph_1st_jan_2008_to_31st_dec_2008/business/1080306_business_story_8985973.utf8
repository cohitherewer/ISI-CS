The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi bid to keep IPO grey market in check
                                                                                                               Sebi bid to keep IPO grey market in check
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, March 5: Market regulator Sebi will try to shorten the time gap between the pricing of an initial public offering and its listing on the bourses to eliminate grey market speculation on public flotations.        
	This decision is aimed at making the process more efficient, Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave told journalists after the regulators board meet here today.        
	Bhave, who took over as Sebi chief in February, said, Between the pricing of an issue and the day of its listing there is a gap and people tend to speculate on the possible opening price. If you reduce the gap, automatically the need for grey market goes away.        
	There had been allegations that the February 11 listing of Reliance Power, the biggest ever IPO in India, was marred by a bear cartel.         
	The public issue of the company was oversubscribed 73 times. However, the share, which was priced at Rs 450, ended below Rs 350 on the day of listing. The sensex, too, fell by 834 points, or about 8 per cent, as panic-stricken investors rushed to dump shares on that day.        
	Filing charges        
	Sebi today decided to reduce the fee for filing offer documents for public issues, rights issues, buyback and mutual funds by 50 to 80 per cent.        
	Since the volume of transaction in the market is very high this year compared with what could have been expected, we felt there was a need to consider whether the fee charged to some intermediaries or some activities can be reduced, Bhave said.         
	This will directly benefit small investors investing in mutual funds, he added.         
	The reduction in fees will be effective from April 1.        
	The fee for filing offer documents for public issues and mutual funds will be reduced to 0.005 per cent from 0.03 per cent. The cap on the fee for a public issue is Rs 3 crore, while for a mutual fund it is Rs 50 lakh.        
	Sebi will also cut the registration fee for venture capital funds by 50 per cent to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.         
	The annual registration fee for the custodians of mutual funds will be reduced to 0.0005 per cent of assets under custody from 0.001 per cent now.        
	The fee for a rights issue offer document will be slashed to 0.005 per cent from 0.05 per cent, subject to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh.         
	Bhave, however, refused to answer queries on the possibility of a probe into market fluctuations and irregularities in the grey market for initial public offerings.         
	Independent panel        
	Sebi also announced an independent panel to oversee its investigation into National Securities Depository Ltd, earlier headed by Bhave.         
	The committee will be headed by Mohan Gopal, director of the National Judicial Academy and one of the independent members on the Sebi board.         
	The other two members are V. Leeladhar, deputy governor of the RBI, and Anurag Goel, secretary in the ministry of corporate affairs.         
	In April 2006, Sebi said it had unearthed depository participants and market operators who allegedly played a role in using 59,000 fictitious demat accounts to corner share allotments in IPOs.

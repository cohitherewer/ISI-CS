                                I bought gold coins from a bank. I am now in need of money and would like to sell them. I want to get full market valuation of the coins. Where can I sell these and will it attract any tax?          Sourav Hazra Choudhury, Burdwan
                    Banks sell gold coins, but once sold, they dont buy them. Youll have to check out with local jewellers to sell these. In any case, you wont get the full market valuation of the coins. The buyer will deduct a certain amount towards making charge and other expenses. If you sell the coins within 12 months of buying, you will have to pay short-term capital gains tax. If you sell them after 12 months from the date of purchase, you will have to pay long-term capital gains tax. The rate of short-term capital gains tax will be the same as your marginal income tax rate. You will have to pay tax at the rate of 20 per cent for long-term capital gains.                                    Gift for wife      If I give loan with interest to my wife and she invests the money in fixed deposits or mutual funds, will the interest/ dividend/capital gains be taxable in my hand?         Dhruba Roy, Calcutta
                    You can give your wife an interest-bearing loan and she can invest the money without attracting the provision of clubbing of income. However, you should be careful about the rate of interest she would pay. The rate should not be very low compared with the market rate of interest. The interest that she pays you would be added to your income and taxed in your hands. However, what she earns will be tax free if the income is less than Rs 1,80,000 in a financial year.                                   Taxing times      I am retired person. My bank is paying quarterly interest on fixed deposits after deducting TDS on each payment. Should I have to compute interest amounts thus credited to my account after TDS while deriving total annual income?         Bidhan Roy, Calcutta
                    Since you have invested in the SCSS before April, you cannot avail deduction under Section 80C. You will have to pay tax on the excess income. The tax rate will be 10.3 per cent, including educational cess. You will have to pay Rs 927 as income tax for the current financial year.

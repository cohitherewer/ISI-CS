          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Stringent measure		    
	Mumbai, June 17: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened norms governing non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).         
	The central bank today said those NBFCs which had net-owned funds (NOF) of less than Rs 2 crore should freeze their deposits at current levels. Net-owned funds comprise paid-up equity capital and free reserves.         
	Simultaneously, it slapped tough conditions on asset financing companies. In their case also, the ceiling applicable to public deposits has been tightened.        
	Earlier this month, the RBI had said non-deposit taking NBFCs, with asset size of Rs 100 crore and above, would have to maintain a capital-to- risk-weighted asset ratio of 12 per cent against the current 10 per cent. From April 1 next year, the capital adequacy ratio is proposed to be increased to 15 per cent. According to the central bank, the rules have been tightened to strengthen the financial system in general and deposit taking entities in particular.        
	Earlier, the central bank had ruled that the minimum NOF requirement for new companies should be Rs 2 crore. While there are certain NBFCs where the NOF is less than this requirement, the apex bank is of the opinion that there should be a uniform minimum NOF.        
	Market borrowings        
	The RBI today said the estimated gross market borrowings of state governments during the current fiscal at Rs 59,000 crore.        
	This takes into account the repayments of Rs 14,371 crore, the RBI said in a press release.        
	Up to June 17, 2008, six state governments have raised Rs 5,912 crore through the sale of their state development loans through the auction method.        
	The market borrowings of state governments will be raised in a phased manner depending upon their requirements, it said. The central bank also said the state governments or the RBI would have the flexibility to review the borrowing requirements and bring about modifications in the borrowings keeping in view the emerging requirements of the state governments, market conditions and other relevant factors.

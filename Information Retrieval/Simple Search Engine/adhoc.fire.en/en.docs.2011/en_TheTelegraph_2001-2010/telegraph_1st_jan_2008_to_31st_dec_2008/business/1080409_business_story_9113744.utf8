	Calcutta, April 8: Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments (TI) will shift its focus from research and development (R amp;D) to new business opportunities in India.         
	Outside Texas, the company has the largest R amp;D presence in India with 1,400 engineers.         
	We have started looking at India as a market and focus on business opportunities in the country. Till date, we have been focusing on creating state-of-the-art R amp;D and have generated 500 US patents from India. We will now be working in areas such as wireless communication, automotive, medical electronics, industrial (LED lighting, UPS, inverters) and digital cinema, said Bobby Mitra, managing director of Texas Instruments India Ltd.        
	The size for the semiconductor industry was $1.2 billion in 2006 and is set to reach $3.18 billion in 2009 at a compound annual growth rate of 36 per cent.        
	Mitra described the strength of the sales force in India would go up significantly in the next one to two years as the company increases its sales and marketing presence in the country.        
	The chip makers R amp;D centre in India was involved in developing LoCosto, the industrys first single-chip solution for wireless handsets. With the current boom in the mobile handset market and manufacturers looking to include more services in handsets, Texas Instruments is working with major players in wireless communication to design technologies for such services.        
	Globally, Texas Instruments is expected to remain the largest supplier of chips to Nokia. However, it suffered a setback when companies such as Sony Ericsson and Nokia sought other suppliers.        
	Texas Instruments has the advantage of designing chips for both low-end handsets used in emerging markets such as China and India and advanced, feature-laden models used in developed countries. The company has also formed a separate business unit for the medical electronics segment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Q amp;A      Identity crisis
                                My wife, a homemaker, had applied for a PAN in Form 49A. She had submitted a copy of her joint savings bank account passbook along with a colour photograph and a certificate from the branch manager. The UTITSL Centre had refused to accept the application and the accompanying documents as sufficient proof. Has the IT department stopped accepting a bank certificate as an identity proof?          V.S. Venkataraman, Calcutta
                    Your wife must be the second holder of the joint account. In the case of a joint bank account, the first holders name and address as appearing in the banks record is generally considered as a document for identity and residence proof. What you can do is to open a single account in your wifes name in the same bank and then send that as a supporting proof for her identity and residence.                                  Tax worry      I have a joint demat account where my wife is the first holder. Recently, we sold some shares purchased around three months ago. Is the profit earned against the sale of these shares taxable since the total earnings of my wife, including the profit from the sale of shares, is below the basic exemption limit?         Tapan Kr Chatterjee, Barrackpur
                    If your wife doesnt have any independent source of income, the onus of paying short-term capital gains tax will be on you. But if she has a separate income, she will not have to pay any tax on the short-term capital gains because her annual income is less than the basic exemption limit.                                  Repay right      I have invested in equity-linked saving schemes of mutual funds by taking a loan from my spouse who is a government employee. I would repay her the money after getting the arrear payment under Section 89 of the Income Tax Act from my employer. Should I get the benefit of deduction of income under Section 80C on investment through such borrowed fund?        Subrata Dey, North 24 Parganas
                    You can claim the benefit on the investment. However, make sure that you pay the market interest rate while repaying the loan to your spouse. Without the interest payment, the income tax department will not consider it as a loan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile players battle it out over tariff cut
                                                                                                            Mobile players battle it out over tariff cut
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cellular war                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 2: The mobile tariff war has erupted again.        
	Airtel today slashed its local outgoing call rates for its 40 million pre-paid customers to a flat Rs 1 per minute. Within minutes, Reliance Communications pared its outgoing call rate for for its pre-paid subscribers to 99 paise a minute in a battle of oneupmanship.        
	The Airtel rate cut comes into effect from tomorrow.        
	All outgoing calls made by Airtel prepaid mobile customers to any Airtel mobile, another mobile network in the same circle or a local landline will cost Re 1 a minute. Currently, Airtel prepaid subscribers are charged Rs 1.20 per minute for outgoing calls.        
	The benefit will be extended to post-paid customers by next week, said an Airtel spokesperson.        
	At present, Airtel post-paid customers under the Rs 99 and Rs 150 tariff plans are also billed at Rs 1.20 per minute for outgoing calls. Reliance slashed outgoing local call rates for pre-paid subscribers from Rs 1.99 and Rs 1.79 under two different plans to a uniform 99 paise per minute.         
	The company also announced the launch of special tariff vouchers of Rs 33 a month and Rs 49 a month, which would enable a subscriber to make local calls to Reliance numbers for 33 paise and other local calls for 49 paise per minute.         
	Pre-paid users form bulk of the Indian mobile market and account for over 80 per cent of the subscriber base of both the companies.         
	Bharti currently has a subscriber base of about 52 million, while Reliance has about 39 million subscribers.         
	Unveiling the new tariff, S.P. Shukla, president, personal business, Reliance Communications, said, We have always led the market in offering the best calling rates to our subscribers. Our new tariff structure is unique in the way that it appeals to all users. We will charge 99 paise to any phone within the circle; heavy users will get to pay as low as 33 paise a minute.         
	The Reliance call rates will come into effect in the next 48 hours. The Airtel tariff change, however, is not applicable to the Airtel 495 Lifetime pre-paid customers and other customers enjoying special benefits such as Happy Recharge.         
	This initiative marks our strategic intent to simplify tariff and differentiate ourselves in a market already cluttered with multiple tariff plans. Going forward, we will continue to explore innovative and affordable tariff options that are aimed to speed up growth, enhance customer value and significantly contribute towards increasing market and revenue share in the future, said Sanjay Kapoor, president  mobile services, Airtel.

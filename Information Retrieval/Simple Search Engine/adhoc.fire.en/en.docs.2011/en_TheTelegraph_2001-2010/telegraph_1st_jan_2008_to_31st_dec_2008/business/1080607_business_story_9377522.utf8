          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 6: The Agarwals of the Emami group can breathe a little easy.         
	The promoters of Zandu Pharmaceutical Works  a company in which the Agarwals recently bought a 24 per cent stake from one of the founding families  today dropped a proposal to issue preferential shares which might have been used to ward off the Emami group from grabbing control.        
	Emami had bought out the Vaidya family stake and raised their holding to 27.5 per cent.         
	It is now coming out with an open offer to acquire another 20 per cent from the minority shareholders.        
	It is not known if the Parikh family  which opposed the Vaidya stake sale and threatened to take legal recourse  also supported the boards move to drop the plan for a preferential issue of shares.        
	During the period ended March 31, the promoters held close to 42 per cent in Zandu.        
	Reports said the Parikh family had claimed the right of first refusal to any stake sale by the Vaidyas.        
	Had the preferential share proposal been cleared, Emami would have seen the Parikhs having greater say in the affairs of Zandu.        
	In a terse message to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the company said the board of directors in its meeting held on June 6, discussed and dropped the proposal.        
	The company did not say why the proposal had been dropped. Girish Parikh, managing director of Zandu Pharma, was not available for comment despite repeated attempts.

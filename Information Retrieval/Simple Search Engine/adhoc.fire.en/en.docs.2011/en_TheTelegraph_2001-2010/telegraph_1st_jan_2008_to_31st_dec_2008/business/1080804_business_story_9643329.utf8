The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry to grow by 10%: CMIE 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Industry to grow by 10%: CMIE 
                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 3 (PTI): The slowdown in industrial growth is a short-term phenomenon and the country is expected to record a 10 per cent growth rate in industrial production during 2008-09 against 8.3 per cent in the previous fiscal, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has said.        
	We expect growth in industrial production to accelerate to 10 per cent in 2008-09 compared with 8.3 per cent in 2007-08, the CMIE said in its latest report.         
	The key contributors to this growth will be sectors such as machinery, chemicals and transport.        
	The recent trends reflected in the index of industrial production have raised anxieties of a slowdown in industrial activity, the CMIE said.        
	This, combined with a simultaneous rise in inflation, implied that the country was facing some kind of stagflation. But this was not likely to occur, the report said.

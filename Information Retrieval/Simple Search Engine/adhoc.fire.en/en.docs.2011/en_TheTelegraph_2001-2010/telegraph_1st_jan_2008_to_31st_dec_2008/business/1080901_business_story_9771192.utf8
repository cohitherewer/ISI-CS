The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel price down, airlines mum on fare reduction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Jet fuel price down, airlines mum on fare reduction
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: State-run oil companies today slashed aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices by 16 per cent. However, travellers have little cause for cheer as airlines are unlikely to lower fares.         
	This is the first time in seven to eight months that the ATF prices have come down. We are not planning to reduce the prices in September. Only in October, if the ATF prices come down, we will take a call, Partha Sarathi Basu, chief financial officer of SpiceJet Airlines, told The Telegraph.         
	Fuel prices have to stabilise for us to consider any pass-on, a senior Air India official said. Previously, airlines have passed on just 40 per cent of the higher fuel cost to travellers, the official said.        
	For the time being, we dont want to change our pricing strategy, Jet Airways chief executive officer Wolfgang Prock-Schauer said. A Travel Agents Association of India official said the airlines should reduce fares.         
	Analysts feel airlines are unlikely to reduce fares as global fuel prices are fluctuating. Moreover, the airlines have been reporting losses because of a steep rise in prices in the past.         
	According to an Indian Oil official, the reduction in fuel prices was prompted by softening international prices. Jet fuel price in Delhi has been cut Rs 11,378.19 per kilolitre (kl) to Rs 59,650.07 per kl, with effect from midnight, tonight. The price in Calcutta has been reduced Rs 11,757.57 per kl to Rs 69,005.90 per kl.        
	State retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum revise ATF prices once a month based on the average price of jet fuel in the international market.         
	Most airlines had raised fares after the June 1 hike of over 18 per cent in the price of jet fuel. However, they did not lower their fares when oil companies cut prices by over Rs 3,000 per kl in June 5.         
	After the hike in fares, the airlines reported a 12 per cent drop in passenger traffic in July compared with the corresponding period last year.         
	Basu said, There had been a drop of only 7 to 8 per cent of discretionary passengers because of the continued hike in ATF prices, which were passed on to passengers from time to time. Now that we are entering the peak season, we hope that they will return to the aviation sector.        
	Analyst Sudatta Sen said most airlines suffered losses in the last quarter, and a 16 per cent fare hike was required to return to the green.         
	The peak season for air travel is expected to begin next month, and airlines see no reason for fare cuts at this juncture, Sen said.         
	Domestic airlines are facing an estimated loss of $2 billion in fiscal 2009. Globally, in the past couple of months, soaring ATF prices have led to 24 carriers going bankrupt.         
	Airlines in India pay the most for jet fuel compared with other Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka because of a higher tax levy.         
	Airlines pay an eight per cent excise duty in the country, besides a sales tax that varies from 20 per cent to 35 per cent. ATF accounts for 35 per cent of an airlines expense.         
	The Federation of Indian Airlines in a recent report had said that fuel prices in India were approximately seven times higher than in Singapore, leading to substantial additional costs.

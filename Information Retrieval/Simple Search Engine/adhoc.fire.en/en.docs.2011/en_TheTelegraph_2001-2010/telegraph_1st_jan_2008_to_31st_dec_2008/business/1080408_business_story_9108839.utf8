          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NEW NETWORK                                  
	New Delhi, April 7: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked for suggestions from mobile operators on how to roll out the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model in India.         
	New telecom companies and foreign firms  who have licence but no spectrum  are eager to offer services through the MVNO route.         
	An MVNO offers mobile voice and data services without actually owning radiowave or network infrastructure such as telecom towers or transmission equipment.        
	However, existing operators argue that a model, which allows a company to buy airtime in bulk and sell it to subscribers under its own brand, may not be successful under the current tariff environment.         
	As call tariffs are low in India, the industry plays with lower margins, which may not attract spectrum resellers, they said.         
	One cannot expect the MVNO model to succeed in India at the current tariffs, said Sunil Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises.         
	However, industry analysts said while revenues might not be as lucrative as in Europe, where user charges are high, MVNOs could innovate in their services to generate more revenues.        
	They added that instead of distributing radiowaves in small chunks to a large number of players, reselling it to MVNOs would lead to an optimum utilisation of spectrum.        
	The MVNO route should have been followed (instead of giving out new telecom licences) to create more competition in the sector and allow economy in the use of spectrum, said telecom analyst Mahesh Uppal.        
	Telecom service providers, however, feel that with the industry facing spectrum constraints, it would be difficult for a company to resell part of its spectrum to another player.         
	Tata Teleservices managing director Anil Sardana said considering the short band of spectrum some players have, it might not be possible to conveniently share parts of airtime.        
	However, department of telecom officials said the MVNO route would help solve the spectrum shortage in the industry.

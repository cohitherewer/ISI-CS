          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          On guard                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The government today re-imposed import duties on certain steel products and soyabean oil to protect the domestic industry from cheaper imports.        
	The finance ministry today announced a 5 per cent import duty on specified iron and steel items and a 20 per cent customs duty on crude soyabean oil. The duties will be effective from today.         
	Among the specified items that will attract import duty are pig iron, semi-finished, flat and long category products.        
	Earlier in April, the government had withdrawn the import duty on steel as part of its efforts to rein in inflation.        
	Ispat Industries vice-chairman and managing director Vinod Mittal said, In view of the present market conditions, the industry was expecting a higher import tariff of 20 per cent.        
	Once steel prices started nosediving as demand slumped on the back of global recession, the domestic industry became apprehensive of a possible dumping of the commodity by leading steel-making nations such as China, Ukraine and Thailand.        
	To keep cheaper imports at bay, the industry had sought a 15 per cent import duty on steel, besides a 14 per cent countervailing duty on imports of the commodity.        
	The government imposed a 20 per cent import duty on crude soyabean oil to prevent dumping of cheap products from overseas markets. The duty on refined oil remains unchanged at 7.5 per cent.         
	On March 31 this year, the Centre had abolished import duties on crude edible oil and reduced custom duties on refined edible oils to 7.5 per cent.

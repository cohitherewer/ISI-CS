     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: The telecom tribunal today directed Tata Teleservices to deposit Rs 71 crore to the government for clearing its dues before allocation of any spectrum.
    
	While hearing the petition filed by Tata Teleservices, which is in the race for spectrum under the dual-technology clause, the tribunal directed it to clear its dues by Monday. The company has already been granted letters of intent to provide GSM services.
    
	Tata Tele had filed a petition asking the government to clear its accounts. DoT counsel Vineet Malhotra contended that Tata Tele did not convey the exact date of start of operations. Tata Tele counsel Ramji Srinivasan said it would give the information soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti priority to research
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Maruti priority to research
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhargava: Road ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Maruti Suzuki India plans to scale up its level of research and development (R amp;D) for small car engines.         
	Engines below 1,200cc get excise benefit from the government. Currently, 60-70 per cent of R amp;D for these engines takes place in Japan, said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India.        
	Osamu Suzuki, chairman of Japans Suzuki Motor Corporation, wants 90 per cent of the research to be done in India, he said.        
	According to Bhargava, small car sales are going to rise, while that of big cars will drop because of the spike in global oil prices.        
	Maruti Suzuki owns the lions share of the domestic car market with models such as the best-selling Alto and the Swift hatchback. In the premium segment, it offers customers the Swift DZire, which is a sedan.        
	However, high input costs, surging inflation, rising interest rates and increasing fuel prices have affected demand in India.         
	Oil prices had risen from $60-70 per barrel to $140 a barrel, said Bhargava.        
	There is a need to develop more fuel efficient models such as multi-fuel, electric and hybrid cars, he said.        
	Maruti is working on developing vehicles that will use cheaper alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas.        
	The R amp;D efforts will enable our vehicles to meet new emission and safety regulations, which will come into force in 2010, said Bhargava.        
	However, the car maker has no plans to launch a low-cost small car.        
	Bhargava told shareholders that the company would stay out of the low-cost segment as it expected rising incomes and changing lifestyles to increase demand for well designed and feature-rich compacts in India.        
	Maruti sold 7,11,818 cars in India for the fiscal ended March 2008, and has set a target of selling 1 million units locally and exporting 2,00,000 vehicles by March 2011.        
	The car maker reported a net profit of Rs 465.9 crore in the first quarter of 2008-09 compared with Rs 499.6 crore during the same period of the last fiscal.         
	Net sales stood at Rs 4,731 crore, a growth rate of 20.9 per cent over the same period of the previous year. Domestic sales grew 12.1 per cent, led by the Swift, the Swift Dzire and the WagonR, at 180,093 units during the quarter.        
	The company exported 12,491 units in the first quarter of 2008-09 against 9,065 units in the first quarter of the previous year, a growth rate of 37.8 per cent.

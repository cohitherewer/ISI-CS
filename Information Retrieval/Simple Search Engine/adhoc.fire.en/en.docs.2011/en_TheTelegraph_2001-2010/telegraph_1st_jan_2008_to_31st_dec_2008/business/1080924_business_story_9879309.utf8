          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           BUILD THE FUTURE                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group will venture into cement manufacturing, shipping and exploration and production activities.        
	Anil Ambani said he was planning to set up 20-million-tonne cement capacities at select locations where the group had synergies with its energy business and the growing market around.        
	Coal, fly ash, limestone and power constitute over 40 per cent of the cost of cement manufacturing. Given our business interests, we already have these as by-products in abundance. This gives us a competitive head start, Ambani said at the annual general meeting of Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL).        
	The first cement plant will come up in Madhya Pradesh over the next five years. The plant will start off with five-million-tonne capacity, which will later be scaled up to 20 million tonnes, he said.        
	RNRL has got four licences for limestone deposits in the state and hopes to procure them at competitive prices.         
	The group will foray into shipping on a captive basis. We plan to buy up to six ships which will transport coal from Indonesia to Krishnapatnam, he said.        
	The group plans to widen its exploration and production business. We have secured five assets, which comprise four coal bed methane blocks and one oil and gas block. he said.         
	Power projects        
	Reliance Power has received government approval to raise Rs 9,000 crore for its Sasan and Krishnapatnam power projects. Anil Ambani said export credit agencies had committed Rs 9,000 crore and even after factoring in the hedging cost, it was more economical to borrow from these agencies.

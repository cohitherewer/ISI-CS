          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Testing times                                  
	Mumbai, June 12: Realty is bracing for slackening demand with the coming of the rains and the adverse impact of the repo rate hike that may see interest rates heading north.        
	According to Suman Memani, research analyst with Religare Securities Ltd, Monsoon sales are always slack. For the buyer, an interest rate hike means higher EMIs (equated monthly instalments) . At the same time, for the developer, its higher cost of borrowing. The developers already face a 16 to 17 per cent interest rate from banks and almost 22 per cent interest rates when it comes to other instruments such as inter-corporate deposits and so on.         
	A further hike in rates would mean that the execution time would go up. For buyers, it will mean that they will not get possession on time, he said.         
	Despite the high interest rates and slack demand, developers have not reduced prices. Instead they are trying to offer incentives. The situation calls for the developers to be more flexible. For first time buyers, all other expenditures remaining the same, a higher interest rate will mean higher EMI, so the developer will have to incentivise them in a way that they feel the pinch a little less, explained Amol Shimpi, national director (land sales), Colliers International.         
	The market believes that it is a wait-and-watch situation. The interest rates have been rising in the past two years and so have the prices. Despite the developers insisting that they are not reducing prices, a Credit Suisse report shows that all is not well with the sector.         
	Recent land auctions, discounts being offered by the developers and prices in the secondary market point to an impending price correction.

	Singapore/London, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Central banks are likely to launch new co-ordinated emergency action this week to calm panic in financial markets, which could be rocked further by data pointing to global recession.        
	The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates sharply following share sell-offs and currency collapses in developed economies and the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.        
	Advance third quarter US economic growth data due on Thursday is expected to show a 0.5 per cent contraction in gross domestic product after 2.8 per cent growth the previous quarter.         
	The signs point to a deep and synchronised global recession, JPMorgan economist Bruce Kasman said.         
	The likelihood of the Fed slashing interest rates by 50 basis points stood at 74 per cent on Sunday and at 26 per cent for a cut of 75 basis points to 0.75 per cent.        
	Japanese economics minister Kaoru Yosano said the government should increase its bank bailout scheme to around 10 trillion yen ($106 billion) from two trillion.        
	South Korea said it needed to take urgent action to prop up the economy. Some analysts said the central bank would cut interest rates on Monday.        
	Kuwaits central bank was forced to step in to support Gulf Bank, hit by derivatives trading losses, prompting the government to announce it would guarantee deposits at local banks.        
	Saudi Arabia unveiled plans to deposit 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion) into Saudi Credit Bank, established to extend interest-free loans to poor citizens.        
	Ukraine help        
	International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn today announced a $16.5-billion loan to help Ukraine maintain confidence and economic and financial stability.        
	Strauss-Kahn said the assistance would help shore up Ukraines economy following the collapse of steel prices and the global financial crisis.

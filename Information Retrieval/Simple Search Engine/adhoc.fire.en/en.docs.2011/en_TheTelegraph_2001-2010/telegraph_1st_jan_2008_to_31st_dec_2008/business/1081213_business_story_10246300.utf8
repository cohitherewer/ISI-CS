          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The state-run employees provident fund will continue to pay an 8.5 per cent interest rate to its four crore subscribers, at a time when the global financial turmoil has gored investors in stocks.        
	Labour minister Oscar Fernandes today said peoples savings were safe as the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had turned down the finance ministrys suggestion to park part of its funds in the stock markets.         
	We are investing in bonds and schemes of central and state governments and public sector companies. Our rate is steady, we will try to maintain our rate (of 8.5 per cent), Fernandes said.        
	The finance ministry had proposed that 5 per cent of the EPFOs money should be invested in stocks.         
	About 80 per cent of the EPFOs corpus are in a special deposit scheme of the government. The remaining 20 per cent is invested by the State Bank of India in the bonds of other government and state-run companies which fetch a slightly higher rate of interest.         
	The current average yield from EPFO investments is around 8.15 per cent.         
	The total corpus of the EPFO is around Rs 2,40,000 crore.

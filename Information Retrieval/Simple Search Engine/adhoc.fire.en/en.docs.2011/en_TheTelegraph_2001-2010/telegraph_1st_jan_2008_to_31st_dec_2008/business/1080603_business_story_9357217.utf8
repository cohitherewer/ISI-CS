The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | R-Com for share swap with MTN
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       R-Com for share swap with MTN
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New connection                                  
	Mumbai, June 2: The proposed alliance between Reliance Communications (R-Com) and MTN of South Africa will be cemented through a reverse takeover and not a merger  which essentially means that the two companies will retain their distinct identities, sources said.        
	Bankers close to the development said Anil Ambani, who owns over 66 per cent stake in R-Com, might trade a significant part of his holding for a 32-34 per cent stake in MTN.         
	This would make Ambani the single largest shareholder in MTN, while MTN would become R-Coms biggest shareholder. The share swap ratio will be decided at a later stage.        
	Officials said R-Com was not averse to becoming a subsidiary of MTN as long as Ambani ended up being MTNs largest shareholder.        
	Bharti had found MTNs offer unacceptable and called off talks in a huff.        
	In any case, a deal with Bharti would have breached the 74 per cent limit on foreign holding in a telecom company. Bharti has a substantial foreign holding.        
	It was also learnt that both companies would prefer to retain their individual entities after the takeover for the sake of their operational convenience and ease.        
	The reverse takeover is the first step which may or may not lead to a merger. In this case, a merger is not desirable since both companies have to keep their licences in their respective countries intact and do not want a foreign entity tag in the others country, said sources.        
	R-Com has an advantage over Bharti in the sense that Ambanis shareholding in his company is concentrated and foreign holding in the company is just above 12 per cent.        
	Both parties are currently involved in a due diligence of each others companies.

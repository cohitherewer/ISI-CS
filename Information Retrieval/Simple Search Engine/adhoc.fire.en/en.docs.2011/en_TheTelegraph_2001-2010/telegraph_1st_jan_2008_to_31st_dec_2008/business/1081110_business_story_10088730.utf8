The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Border trade gets facility boost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Border trade gets facility boost
          R.SURYAMURTHY                          BETOND CONFINES                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Indias border trade is set to double in five years with the setting up of 13 integrated check posts at an investment of Rs 635 crore.        
	The check posts will give a new thrust to Indias trade and economic co-operation with neighbouring countries, Jairam Ramesh, minister of state for commerce, told The Telegraph. It is a shame that the infrastructure in countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar is far superior to ours, he said.        
	Ramesh was, however, optimistic of border trade increasing substantially in the next five years. Already border trade with Bangladesh  at $3.5 billion last year  makes up 80 per cent of Indias bilateral trade with that country.         
	Four check posts will be set up in the first phase of the project  one each at Petrapole (Bengal), Moreh (Manipur), Raxaul (Bihar) and Wagah (Punjab). These posts will cater to land trade with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan, respectively.        
	In the second phase, posts will be set up at Hili and Chandrabangha (Bengal), Sutarkhandi (Assam), Dawki (Meghalaya), Akhaura (Tripura), Kawarpuchiah (Mizoram), Jogbani (Bihar), and Sunaull and Nepalganj (Uttar Pradesh).        
	Seven of the 13 posts are on the border with Bangladesh, four with Nepal and one each with Pakistan and Myanmar.        
	Ramesh said, For two years I had been underscoring the need to beef up the pathetic infrastructure in the countrys border areas to promote trade with our neighbours.        
	The check posts will have dedicated passenger and cargo terminals comprising customs and immigration facilities, security equipment, and health and quarantine facilities. They will also have passenger amenities such as waiting areas, restaurants, rest rooms, duty-free shops and fuel stations.        
	Officials said the posts would facilitate the entry of small traders, minimise cost and increase efficiency. These would boost the volume of trade and thereby the relations with the neighbouring countries.

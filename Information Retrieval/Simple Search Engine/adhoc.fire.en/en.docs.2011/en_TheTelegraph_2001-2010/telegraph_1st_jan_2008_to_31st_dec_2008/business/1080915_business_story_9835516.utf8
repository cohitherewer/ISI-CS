	Calcutta, Sept. 14: Indians are groaning under a huge debt burden as they splurge on homes, consumer durables and cars.        
	Their borrowings as a percentage of gross financial savings have shot up to 68.79 per cent by the end of March this year from 59.39 per cent a year ago.         
	According to preliminary estimates of the RBI, the gross financial savings of the household sector in 2007-08 was Rs 7,34,699 crore compared with Rs 7,68,967 crore in 2006-07.         
	On the other hand, outstanding retail loans of banks at the end of March stood at Rs 5,05,390 crore against Rs 4,56,734 crore in 2006-07.         
	Outstanding housing loans account for nearly 51 per cent of banks retail loans. A housing loan, though increasing the financial liability of a borrower, helps the borrower to create a physical asset, said a senior official in the retail banking division of Axis Bank.         
	However, since more than 90 per cent of housing and car loans are given on a floating rate basis, the continuous increase in lending rates from April last year will put pressure on the repayment capacity of borrowers, he said.         
	Amit Sinha, a graphic designer with an advertisement agency, has already started asking for a personal loan from various banks to repay the dues on his credit card.         
	I have a housing loan and EMI of the loan has increased by Rs 2,500 since June last year. I could not anticipate this sudden increase in monthly expenses. I am also paying premiums for a life insurance and a mediclaim. Now Im facing great difficulty in clearing the Rs 80,000 dues on my credit card. Revolving the credit every month is also adding to the interest burden, Sinha said.         
	The urge to splurge was very strong till the second half of the last fiscal. Banks over a period of seven-and-a-half years witnessed 25-30 per cent growth in retail lending, aided by a benign interest rate regime, as consumers stepped up their exposure to housing, consumer durables, car and credit card loans.         
	Since November-December last year, when interest rates started rising, growth in fresh borrowings declined, with incremental retail loan disbursement by banks in 2007-08 at Rs 48,656 crore compared with Rs 96,486 crore in the previous year. Consumer durable loans, in absolute terms, fell during the period.         
	However, advances against fixed deposits and credit card loans showed little impact of the increasing interest rate. While advances against fixed deposits and other securities grew Rs 4,792 crore compared with Rs 5,822 crore in 2006-07, fresh additions to credit card outstanding were Rs 5,843 crore vis--vis Rs 4,330 crore.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reliance gas scare for govt
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Pocket pinch                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government could lose over Rs 25,000 crore if Reliance Industries (RIL) agrees to supply gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin to Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at earlier contracted rates.        
	Anil Ambanis RNRL wants to buy the gas at $2.34 per million British thermal units (mBtu), much lower than the $4.20 per mBtu fixed by the empowered group of ministers (eGoM).        
	Officials said the government would get royalty and profit share on the price at which RIL sold gas. At $2.34 per mBtu, the government stands to lose Rs 25,000 crore over the 15-year period of the gas supply contract.        
	They said the government could oppose any price lower than what had been fixed by the eGoM, in case the courts decided on a lower rate.        
	RIL is likely to start production from its Krishna-Godavari block from next month. The legal dispute could affect the production schedule.        
	Judge change        
	RIL, which is locked in a legal tussle with ntpc over gas supply, is learnt to have objected to the case being heard by Justice Roshan Dalvi as she owns ntpc shares.        
	Justice Dalvi has expressed her willingness to withdraw from the case and referred the matter to the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court, sources said today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Visa raises $18 billion 
                                                                                                               Visa raises $18 billion 
                              Cash course                            
	New York, March 19 (Reuters): Visa Inc burned its name into the record books for US initial public offerings (IPO) on Tuesday, raising $17.9 billion as investors seized on its growth potential and a lack of direct exposure to the global credit crisis.        
	San Francisco-based Visa sold 406-million class A common stock for $44 per share, above the forecast range of $37 to $42. Visa will begin trading on the NYSE on Wednesday.        
	Anticipation for the IPO was high on the hopes that it would emulate the success of its rival MasterCard Inc, whose shares have more than quadrupled since its 2006 IPO.        
	Shares of Visa jumped more than 35 per cent on Wednesday.        
	Visas pricing and optimism about possible first-day gains were likely helped by Tuesdays rally, as the US stocks rang in their biggest one-day gains in more than five years.         
	Only days ago, the US stocks had plunged on the near-collapse of Bear Stearns Cos Inc.         
	Both MasterCard and Visa are seen as good bets to avoid the market turmoil.

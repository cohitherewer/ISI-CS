	New Delhi, May 13: State-owned GAIL (India) Ltd, which reported a six per cent increase in profit for the fourth quarter, plans to invest Rs 3,410 crore in financial year 2008-09.        
	GAIL plans to invest Rs 2,565 crore in core pipeline projects, Rs 500 crore in exploration and production and Rs 187 crore in petrochemical projects, company chairman U.D. Choubey said.        
	It posted a net profit before tax of Rs 1,098 crore in the fourth quarter of 2007-08 against Rs 546 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.        
	The profit before tax during the year 2007-08 rose 35 per cent to Rs 3,855 crore from Rs 2,860 crore in 2006-07.        
	Choubey said the company was diversifying into other businesses to ensure that losses from subsidy payment and price control in gas did not affect the companys bottomline.        
	On the issue of bonus shares, he said the company was considering the proposal and no decision had been taken yet.        
	The state-owned firm plans to buy five to six liquefied natural gas cargoes from the spot market in the last quarter of the current fiscal to fire its Dabhol power plant. Each cargo will have 135,000 cubic metres of gas.        
	A.K. Purvaha, GAILs director for business development, said Our 5-million-tonne LNG terminal will be mechanically ready by September or October, and it will be ready to receive LNG cargoes between January and March.

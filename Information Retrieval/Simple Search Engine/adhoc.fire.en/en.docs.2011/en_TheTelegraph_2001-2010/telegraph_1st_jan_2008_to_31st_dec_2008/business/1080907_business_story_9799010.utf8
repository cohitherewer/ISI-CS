	Mumbai, Sept. 6 (Reuters): The move to extend a trading ban in four commodity futures suggests that the government is still worried about inflation and may wait for further correction in prices, exchange and industry officials said.        
	In a bid to tame racing inflation, India had in May stopped futures trading in soyoil, rubber, potato and chickpea for four months. The suspension was scheduled to lapse on Saturday, but was extended till November 30 late on Friday.        
	The government is worried about inflation. It doesnt want to take any chance since it is heading for elections next year, Harish Galipelli, head of research, Karvy Comtrade Ltd, said.        
	Annual inflation has eased from a peak of 12.63 per cent in early August to 12.34 per cent later in the month, but is still at its highest levels since the current price series began in the mid-1990s.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatt: Lending help                                  
	Mumbai, May 20: The State Bank of India (SBI) today said it would resume lending for tractors and farm equipment as and when its non-performing assets in the segment came down.        
	We have pockets in the country where there are large overdues in tractor loans, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said.         
	However, he emphasised that the bank was trying to sell a government scheme that provided a waiver of 25 per cent on farm equipment loan.        
	It is our attempt to sensitise our branches across the country to help farmers take advantage of the governments scheme and reduce NPAs for the bank, he said.        
	As and when this happens, the farmer would be eligible (for loans) and the bank is willing to lend them again.        
	The bank has ambitious plans to strengthen its agriculture and rural loan portfolios and has targeted 33 per cent growth in farm advances, amounting to Rs 13,400 crore during 2008-09.        
	The State Bank wishes to assure the farming community that its commitment to agriculture remains undiminished, Bhatt said.         
	The chairman said the SBIs commitment to strengthen its agri portfolio is evident from the fact that for the first time in 2007-08, it surpassed the 18 per cent benchmark set by the Reserve Bank of India for agricultural advances.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The government has referred the insurance bill to a parliamentary standing committee.        
	As the panel prepared to review the bill, tabled on Monday in the Rajya Sabha, the government said it had an open mind on the issue.         
	A proposal in the bill is to raise FDI to 49 per cent from 26 per cent in insurance.         
	Opposition parties such as the CPM, and its new allies, the AIADMK and the TDP, have opposed the bill.         
	The government has been trying to raise the FDI limit in insurance for more than four years. It was announced by the then finance minister P. Chidambaram in the 2004 budget but was kept in abeyance because of the resistance from the Left whose support was crucial to the survival of the UPA government.         
	Following the Left resentment, the government had referred the matter to a group of ministers headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Minister of state for parliamentary affairs P. K. Bansal today said the government had an open mind on the insurance bill.         
	On the protest that followed the introduction of the LIC amendment bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said the Left parties had mistook the bill for the insurance reform bill.        
	The LIC bill, he said, was aimed at raising the capital of the state-owned company to Rs 100 crore from Rs 5 crore to make it more strong to implement welfare schemes.        
	Insurance reforms could only gather pace after the Left withdrew its support to the government in July. The trade unions went on a strike yesterday to protest the FDI proposal.        
	One of the provisions of the bill is allowing foreign reinsurers to set up shop here.

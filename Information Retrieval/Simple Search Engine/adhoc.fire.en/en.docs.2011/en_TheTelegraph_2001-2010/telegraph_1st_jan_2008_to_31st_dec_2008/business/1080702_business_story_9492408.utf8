          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, July 1: High crude oil prices continued to squash equities today as resultant worries about rising inflation and high interest rates saw the Bombay Stock Exchange sensex slipping below the 13000-mark for the first time since April 2007 and ending nearly 500 points lower at 12961.68.        
	The rupee also slumped to a 15-month low of 43.33 against the dollar, a drop of nearly 31 paise over its last close on rising crude oil prices and the fall in equity values.        
	Foreign exchange market circles said the high crude oil price, which was today trading at over $143 per barrel, had led to apprehensions that Indian oil companies would demand more dollars to buy the feedstock from overseas.        
	On the stock markets, the benchmark sensex opened on a better note at 13480.02 and traded in a tight range, but the situation changed in the afternoon when selling again emerged.        
	The selling intensified towards the last hour of trading, and the sensex ended below the key psychological level of 13000, a drop of 499.92 points, or 3.71 per cent.         
	Brokers said while firm crude oil prices weighed on investors minds, redemption pressures on some hedge added to the selling pressure.        
	Fear factor        
	An analyst with a foreign brokerage said though valuations appeared reasonable at this point of time, investors were not in a hurry to buy as they expected more pressure ahead. Simultaneously, the rupee falling is also not good as foreign institutional investors are affected, he said.        
	Despite the large fall in equity values in the recent past, market experts averred that investors should be prepared for more losses in the near term. I dont see any improvement. The current levels are not the bottom for the market, said V. K. Sharma, head (research) at Anagram Stock Broking.        
	Although all the sectoral indices at the BSE finished in the red, real estate and banking stocks continued to feel the heat over the possibility of high interest rates.        
	Some heavyweights also witnessed intense selling pressure. Shares of Reliance Communication plummeted 10.5 per cent to Rs 396 on worries that the deal with the MTN group might not go through.        
	Others such as Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India saw their values eroding 2.3 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively. On the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee resumed lower at Rs 43.06 per dollar from its previous close of 43.03 and later dropped because of firm crude prices.        
	Treasury circles feel the rupee is expected to remain weak due to political uncertainty and rising oil prices. Some feel that the Indian unit can even breach the 44 mark to the dollar.

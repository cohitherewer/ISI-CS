	New Delhi, June 26: The proposed Jharkhand plant of ArcelorMittal at Torpa Kamdara will start steel production in five years.         
	The plant will have an initial capacity of 6 million tonnes. This will be doubled later as the company gets leases for more iron ore.         
	The Luxembourg-based giant will negotiate for a prospecting licence for iron ore at Ankua. It has recently got a lease at Meghataburu.         
	ArcelorMittals investment is one of the largest in the state. It will be the first greenfield plant of the company after several decades.        
	Work on the project report and the mining project has started and will be completed shortly. Some 18,000 acres of land will be acquired, of which 30 per cent is owned by the state government.        
	ArcelorMittals plans for a steel plant at Keonjhar in Orissa will be in two phases of 6 million tonnes each. It is still to get an iron ore concession in the state.         
	The steel maker has received provisional approval from the Orissa government to acquire 7,500 acres of land at Keonjhar. Some 6,000 acres will be used for the steel plant, 1,000 acres for a 1,500 mega watt power plant and the rest for a township. It is expecting mining concessions in nearby areas, which will help to create synergies.        
	The company has managed to tie up for just 10 per cent of its iron ore requirements for the two steel plants and is banking heavily on Ankua.         
	Ankua, which borders Chiria, is believed to have ore as rich in iron content as Chiria, attracting Indias top steel makers.         
	Located in Singhbhum district, both Chiria and Ankua have iron ore at shallow levels, with iron contents of over 62 per cent.        
	Tata Steel has been recommended for a prospecting lease of over 1,827 hectares at Ankua, while the Centre has already given a prospecting lease to JSW Steel, of the Jindal group, for 1,388.5 hectares at Ankua, adjacent to SAILs Dobhil lease in Chiria.        
	Sesa Goa, too, has a prospecting licence for another part of Ankua, adjacent to Dobhil.         
	Jharkhand is looking for alternatives to Chiria for ArcelorMittal. This follows its attempt to cancel part of Steel Authority of India Limiteds leases at Chiria and give some of them to ArcelorMittal getting caught in a legal jam.

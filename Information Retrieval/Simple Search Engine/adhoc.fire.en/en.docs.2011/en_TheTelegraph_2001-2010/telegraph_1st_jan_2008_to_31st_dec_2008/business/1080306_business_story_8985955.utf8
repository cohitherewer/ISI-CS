The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel favours review of airport pacts
                                                                                                               Panel favours review of airport pacts
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Yechury: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, March 5: The government needs to renegotiate pacts with the private developers of the new airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore so that existing airports are not shut down, a committee has said.         
	The parliamentary standing committee on transport and tourism recommends unanimously and unequivocally that the existing Hyderabad and Bangalore airports should not be closed for commercial operations, a report tabled in both houses of Parliament said.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, who heads the committee, said, The government still has time to renegotiate the issue with the concessionaire and can modify or scrap the clause which calls for the closure of the existing airports.         
	The greenfield Hyderabad airport is scheduled to open on March 14 and the new Bangalore airport sometime later this month. The existing airports in the two cities are to be closed to commercial traffic after the new airports start operating.        
	Yechury said, The possible revenue implications of such a renegotiation must not stop the government. Increased air traffic in the two metros and the commercial viability of having more than one airport in a city are enough reasons to renegotiate the concession agreements, even if there is a cost involved.        
	The committee has kept in mind traffic growth, which has increased more than three times since the projections for the two airports were made and the agreements with the private parties were signed, he said.        
	The GMR group, which has developed the new airport in Hyderabad, however, feels it will not be economically viable to run two airports.        
	We do have challenges. There is a commitment from the government that they will provide us with all assistance. It (having two airports) is not in economic interest as the operational cost will go up, GMR group chairman (airports) Kiran Kumar Grandhi said.        
	The parliamentary committee has reacted strongly to the governments move to reject an AAI proposal to levy a user development fee for the Ahmedabad and Trivandrum airports, while allowing private operators of the Hyderabad and Bangalore airports to do so.         
	The government, which turned down the AAI proposal, is happily agreeing to the demands of the private operators, the committee said.

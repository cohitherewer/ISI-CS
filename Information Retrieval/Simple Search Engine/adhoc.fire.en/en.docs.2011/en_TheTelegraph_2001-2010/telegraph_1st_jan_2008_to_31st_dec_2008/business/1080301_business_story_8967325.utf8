          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 29: As P. Chidambaram began his budget speech, investors were not expecting much in an election year.        
	But already shaken by negative global developments, they were badly let down with the Union finance minister raising the tax on short-term capital gains from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.        
	The increase, which could hit liquidity in the stock markets, was the prime reason behind the BSE sensex ending lower by 245.76 points, or 1.38 per cent. On a day the countrys farmers walked away with a Rs 60,000-crore relief, investor wealth was slashed by nearly Rs 48,000 crore.        
	Capital market circles said the damage could have been worse were it not for some post-budget clarifications from Chidambaram and the excise duty cuts announced in his speech.        
	Since hopes had been low, the benchmark index had begun on a negative note. It stayed in the red as Chidambaram reaffirmed the governments commitments towards various sectors.        
	The dive came when it was announced that farmers would get relief on their loans. Worried about the possible impact on bank balance sheets, investors pressed heavy sales across several PSU banking counters.        
	Although Chidambaram later announced excise duty cuts on two-wheelers, cars, pharmaceuticals and other products, the investors received another shock when the short-term capital gains tax was raised.

	Calcutta, March 6: Adhunik Metaliks is in talks with private equity players to offload a 10-12 per cent stake in Orissa Manganese and Minerals Ltd, its wholly owned mining subsidiary.        
	Many people are interested. We will decide on the stake sale in a month, Adhunik managing director Manoj Agarwal said after the companys board meeting here today.        
	Adhunik bought Orissa Manganese a year back for Rs 60 crore. Orissa Manganese has an iron ore mine with a deposit of 80 million tonnes and six manganese mines.        
	Agarwal said the iron ore mine, located at Ghatkuri in Orissa, could be brought to production by the middle of this year.        
	Adhunik will produce ferro manganese using the ore from the mines of Orissa Manganese. However, iron ore from the Ghatkuri mine is likely to be sold in the market.        
	Ore produced from Adhuniks Kulum mine in Keonjhar district of Orissa will be used for captive consumption.         
	The companys board, which approved the share sale in Orissa Manganese, also okayed an investment of Rs 433 crore for value addition in different projects.        
	This will enable Adhunik to improve its EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation) margin from 18 to 26 per cent.        
	The projects will include increasing sponge iron capacity by 165,000 tonnes, setting up a captive power plant of 17 mega watt, building a sinter plant of 267,000 tonnes and raising the ferro alloy capacity by 19,300 tonnes.        
	Agarwal said these value-addition projects would halve raw material costs, thus improving profitability.        
	It has tied up loans worth Rs 274 crore from various banks to fund the projects, which will be completed in 18 months.         
	Adhunik Metaliks hopes to close the current financial year with an after-tax profit of Rs 96 crore.

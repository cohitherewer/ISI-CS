	Mumbai, Jan. 31: The Tata groups tryst with overseas acquisitions continues.
    
	Group company Tata Chemicals Ltd is acquiring US-based soda ash producer General Chemical Industrial Products for over $1 billion (almost Rs 4,000 crore). This is Tata Chemicals second major international acquisition after Brunner Mond Group in December 2005 for which it paid over Rs 508 crore.
    
	Tata Chemicals acquisition of General Chemical could make it the worlds second largest soda ash producer. The company is now the worlds third largest producer of this raw material which is used in the making of glass, soaps and detergents. 
    
	General Chemicals subsidiary, General Chemical (Soda Ash) Partners, is a major soda ash producer in the US with a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes of natural soda ash.
    
	The subsidiary has mining and manufacturing facilities at Green River Basin in Wyoming, USA, which gives it access to trona ore deposits. 
    
	Trona, a mineral in the sodium bicarbonate family, is converted into soda ash. 
    
	Tata Chemicals currently has a capacity of around 3 million tonnes of soda ash.
    
	Company managing director Homi Khusrokhan told reporters here today that the acquisition would increase Tata Chemicals soda ash capacity. The company makes 50 per cent of its soda ash through the natural route, much cheaper than manufacturing via the synthetic route.
    
	After the acquisition, Tata Chemicals will have access to markets in North America, South America and the Far East. General Chemicals revenues are at around $400 million. Khusrokhan said the acquisition would be funded through a mix of debt and equity. Though TCL has not yet decided on the funding plan, the Tata Chemicals managing director hinted that the acquisition could be completed within the next two months. 
    
	Harbinger Capital Partners, a private equity firm, holds the majority stake in General Chemical. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.
    
	The deal comes at a time when the soda ash sector is passing through a robust phase. The soda ash market is growing and the demand is good. The industry will remain buoyant for some more time, Khusrokhan said.
    
	Tata Chemicals has four soda ash facilities located at Mithapur (Gujarat), Northwich (UK), the Netherlands and Lake Magadi (Kenya).

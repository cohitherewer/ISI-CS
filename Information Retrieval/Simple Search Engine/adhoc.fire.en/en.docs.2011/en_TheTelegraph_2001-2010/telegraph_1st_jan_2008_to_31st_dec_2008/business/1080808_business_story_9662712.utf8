          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Ready for the race                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Motorcycle companies are revving up to launch an array of superbikes.         
	While Suzuki is expected to launch its famed 1340cc Hayabusa, GSX-R 1000 and Bandit 1250 bikes in September, Honda will introduce two models  the CBR 1000 and the GLX 1  in October.         
	There was always a demand for superbikes, or high performance, costly motorcycles. With an increase in disposable income among the youth, companies are keen to tap this niche segment, said automobile analyst Ranojoy Mukherji. This is a trend. It may not yield much money but it is high on the image it gives to these companies.         
	According to N.K. Rattan, divisional head, sales and marketing, Honda Motorcycles Scooters India, There will be one or two more launches in this financial year. We also expect to launch our bikes above the 800cc category in this fiscal, which will be priced above Rs 10 lakh. Honda will import these bikes as completely built units, he said.        
	Kawasaki, too, is preparing for a rollout, with plans to sell through Bajaj Autos network. It will import knocked down kits from Japan starting with the heavier Ninja 250.        
	While Bajaj declined to reveal the price of the Ninja 250 in India, it costs around $3,000 (Rs 1.2 lakh) outside the country.         
	Suzukis Hayabusa is expected to cost up to Rs 11 lakh. The bike will be launched in the first week of September but its retail price will be high because of its high 105 per cent import duty.         
	The demand for big bikes is actually more of a hype. Cumulatively, these bikes sell only about 400 units per annum and we dont expect volumes as well. Along with the GSX, we will probably do 150 units per annum, said Atul Gupta, vice-president, sales and marketing, Suzuki Motorcycle India.        
	India is not the place for these bikes. We dont have the roads like they have in developed countries for them and it is not fun to ride them at say 70 km per hour, Gupta said.         
	We are, nevertheless, launching the Hayabusa because it will showcase our strength as a bike manufacturer. Moreover these are already available in the grey market so we might as well legalise them, he said.        
	Other bike manufacturers such as Yamaha and Ducati have made their presence felt in the sports model segment.

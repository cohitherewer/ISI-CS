	New York, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Recession worries pushed US stocks lower on Tuesday, but the decline was shallower than feared at first as an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve helped to ease investor fears and stabilise global markets.
    
	The US central banks move followed two days of steep losses in Asian equities on worries that a deteriorating US economy would drag other regions down with it.
    
	Were not out of woods yet... Were still down on day...(but) clearly the Fed rate-cut move was well received by traders this morning, said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. 
    
	At the time of going to press, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 117.95 points, or 0.97 per cent, at 11981.35. The Standard amp; Poors 500 Index was down 14.74 points, or 1.11 per cent, at 1310.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 39.53 points, or 1.69 per cent, at 2300.49.
    
	These moves followed mounting losses overseas. Hong Kongs Hang Seng index lost $321 billion of its value in the past two days. Developing countries stock markets were also experiencing dramatic declines.
    
	Theres so much panic out there right now, Im not sure it (the Fed rate cut) will help, Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed-income at Action Economics in San Francisco.
    
	Traders expect the Fed to cut rates even further at its next scheduled policy meeting next week. Tuesdays cut brought the benchmark federal funds rate down to 3.50 per cent.
    
	These expectations led to a big drop in the dollar against the euro, as the prospect of much lower rates in the United States made European assets look even more attractive.
    
	Current events remain solidly dollar-negative, said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.
    
	However, European equities recovered ground following the Feds decision. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.3 per cent at 1283.52, while Londons FTSE 100 was up 1 per cent.

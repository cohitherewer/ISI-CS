                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hoteliers brace for hard times
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          GLOOMY FUTURE                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: The hospitality and travel industries  already mauled by the loss of patrons after the recession in the West  now face the prospect of losing business travellers as countries around the world started sending out travel advisories asking their citizens not to go to Mumbai unless unavoidable.        
	We advise against all non-essential travel to Mumbai until further notice, said a note put out by the UKs Foreign amp; Commonwealth Office.        
	Similar advisories were put out by the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian authorities.         
	The Mumbai attacks show terrorists in India are deliberately targeting Westerners. Further attacks cannot be ruled out, said the advisory issued by the Australian High Commission.        
	It is believed that the US Embassy in New Delhi also issued a similar advisory but this could not be independently confirmed.        
	The mood among hoteliers, already shaken by the global financial crisis, has gone from bad to worse.        
	Observers said the attack took place just before the peak season and would drive a hole through both the business and leisure travel segments. The industry that grew 22 per cent last fiscal is likely to register a flat growth or even negative growth this year.         
	The hotels, travel and aviation sectors are not expected to do well when the global economy is going through a slowdown. The Mumbai episode will have a much more serious impact on the industry, said P. Phani Sekhar, fund manager, Angel Broking.        
	According to Gautam Anand, vice-president, ITC Welcom, We are obviously expecting massive cancellation. The situation looks very bleak for the next quarter. He said hotels would now install extra security devices.        
	Oberoi group chairman P.R.S. Oberoi told The Telegraph, It is too early to give any details at this point of time. The entire industry will suffer for some time.        
	R.K. Krishna Kumar, vice-chairman of Indian Hotels, which own the Taj brand, said, We want to restore The Taj hotel to its fullest glory. It might take us a couple of months or even a year.         
	He said the hotel industry would bounce back soon, though we expect to see lower occupancies for the next 2-3 month.        
	Daiichi concern        
	Daiichi Sankyo, the Japanese drug maker, will not send any of its officials to India now.        
	We are suspending all trips to India until safety is assured, Masaya Tamae, a spokesperson for Tokyo-based Daiichi Sankyo, said.

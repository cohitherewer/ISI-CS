          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RELIEF IN SIGHT                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Congress-led government today said it would cut petrol and diesel prices after the current round of state elections ends on December 24.         
	The BJP accused the government of violating the model code of conduct for polls and said it would file a complaint with the Election Commission.         
	International prices have fallen and there is an expectation that the (fuel) prices will be reduced. I am also of the opinion that they should be reduced and that will happen after December 24, petroleum minister Murli Deora said today.        
	The extent of the cut will depend on global crude prices at that time, he said.         
	The government had increased the price of petrol by Rs 5 a litre and diesel by Rs 3 in June this year.         
	State-owned oil companies, however, are likely to ask for minor price cuts to avoid being back in the red. The three firms  IOC, HPCL and BPCL  had reached break even in diesel this week. They are making a profit of 70 paise per litre from the sale of diesel and Rs 9.86 from petrol.        
	Though the Opposition parties have been demanding a cut in prices, the BJP today attacked Deora.        
	The announcement (by Deora) will benefit the ruling coalition and we will file a complaint with the Election Commission, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, BJPs chief ministerial candidate in Delhi, said.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said his ministry would send a proposal for the price cuts to the cabinet before December 24.         
	With fuel sales turning profitable, Pandey said Reliance was keen to resume sales at some of its closed outlets, while Essar had reopened 500 outlets.

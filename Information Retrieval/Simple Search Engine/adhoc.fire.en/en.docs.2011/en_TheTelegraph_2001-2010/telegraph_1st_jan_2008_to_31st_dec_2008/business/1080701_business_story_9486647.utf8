          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Big fight        
	Mumbai, June 30: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (Sun Pharma) today initiated a bid to buy all the outstanding shares of Israels Taro Pharmaceutical Industries for $7.75 per share in cash. Sun Pharma has a 33.4 per cent stake in Taro.        
	Sun Pharma subsidiary Alkaloida Chemical Company Exclusive Group Ltd has made the offer to buy the shares.        
	Last week, Sun Pharma had said it would exercise an option, under an agreement, to acquire all the shares held by the controlling shareholders of the Israeli company.        
	This came after Taro had terminated the merger agreement with Sun Pharma.         
	The Indian company said the agreement required it to commence its offer for shares at a price of $ 7.75 per share.        
	On May 18, 2007, Taro and the Sun Pharma subsidiary, Alkaloida, entered into an agreement for Alkaloida to acquire Taro in an all-cash deal of $455 million. This was unanimously approved by the Taro board of directors.        
	If the merger does not occur, Taros controlling shareholders, led by chairman Barrie Levitt, granted Sun Pharma the option to acquire all their shares.         
	In May 2008, Sun Pharma said Taro improperly terminated the merger agreement, which Sun Pharma challenged in a US supreme court.        
	On June 25, Alkaloida exercised its option under the agreement to acquire all the shares held by the controlling shareholders of Taro.        
	As required by the option agreement, Alkaloida has commenced a tender offer for all ordinary shares. The option agreement required that the tender offer be at $7.75 per share, a statement from Sun Pharma said today. The offer is scheduled to expire on July 28, unless extended.         
	In May and June this year, Taro had file two lawsuits against Sun Pharma after the merger deal fell apart.        
	In a letter to its shareholders, Taro had said it had filed a lawsuit against Sun Pharma in an Israeli court seeking to protect minority shareholders. The other suit was aimed at stopping Sun Pharma from engaging in practices that we deemed detrimental to our ability to maximise the value of Taros Irish operations.

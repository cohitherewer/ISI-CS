	New Delhi, Feb. 27 (PTI): Malaysian auto firm Proton, which is planning to enter India, is in talks with Argentum Motors, the new owner of the plant of defunct Daewoo Motors, for utilising the facility at Surajpur in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Industry sources said officials from Proton had talks with their counterparts from Argentum Motors for utilising the latters plant either for contract manufacturing for the sourcing of components.        
	When contacted, Argentum promoter Ajay Singh confirmed the development but said talks were at an exploratory stage. Yes, we have had talks with many global auto firms, including Daimler and Proton, to utilise our facility, Singh said.         
	Asked whether the talks with Proton were for contract manufacturing, he said the Malaysian firm was aiming to bring down production costs as and when it decided to enter the Indian market. It could be for utilising the facility for manufacturing or for the sourcing of components, he added.

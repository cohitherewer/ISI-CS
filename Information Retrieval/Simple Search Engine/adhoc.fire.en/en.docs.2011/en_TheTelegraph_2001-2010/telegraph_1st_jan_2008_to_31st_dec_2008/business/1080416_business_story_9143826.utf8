                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ITC finalises plot for food unit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta, April 15: ITC is close to acquiring land for its food processing plant in Bengal.        
	ITC chairman Y. C. Deveshwar today said a plot had been identified for the unit.        
	The city-based conglomerate with interests in tobacco, hotel and paper was looking for land in Bengal for the last two years.        
	I am hopeful that we would be able to start work this year, he said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region) here today.        
	A company official later clarified that a 40-acre plot had been finalised in Howrah.        
	We hope to get it in the next three months, the official added.        
	This project could involve an investment of Rs 300 crore.         
	This would be ITCs first foray into food processing in the state.        
	The demand for our snack food brand Bingo has gone up many times. We need a manufacturing base in the east, the official said.        
	Till now, the company relied on third-party manufacturing. The plant will initially manufacture Bingo. Later, it may also add biscuits to the list. The company, however, is not moving ahead with its farm retail venture in Bengal as yet.        
	Political agitation to Reliances farm retail project in the state has deterred other companies from going ahead with their plans.        
	Deveshwar, however, said ITCs farm retail project was still in a pilot stage.

          OUR BUREAU AGENCIES                          Sibal: Booster dose                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: India today relaxed imports from other Saarc countries by pruning its sensitive list by 264 items to 480. Sensitive list comprises commodities which do not enjoy concessional duties.        
	The decision, taken at a meeting of the Union cabinet today, will lead to imports of a large number of products from Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives at zero tariff. In addition to these four countries, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are part of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (Saarc).        
	Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said after the cabinet meeting that the reduction in the sensitive list was in pursuance of Indias announcement during the 14th Saarc Summit regarding its readiness to accept asymmetrical responsibilities, including opening her markets to her South Asian neighbours without insisting on reciprocity.        
	For the 264 items, the government proposes to bring down tariffs to zero in a phased manner.        
	Some items that will enter India at zero rates are frozen hilsa, tomato concentrate, hair oil, tooth powder, sportswear, air conditioner and ayurvedic medicines.        
	Trade relations among the Saarc countries are based on the principles of the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (Safta), which was signed in 2004, with the trade agreement coming into force in 2006 in a limited way. Full trade liberalisation on the basis of Safta is expected by 2016.        
	According to a study by the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, India will nearly double its exports to South Asia, when Safta is implemented fully, though the gains will be limited to a few agriculture commodities and automobiles. In agriculture, there will be significant gains in poultry and sugar.        
	Asean breakthrough        
	India and Southeast Asian trading bloc Asean have reached a free trade deal in goods, ending three years of talks aimed at creating a European Union-style single market, only much larger in terms of population  over 1.5 billion.        
	The two trading partners are expected to sign an agreement in December in New Delhi marking the conclusion of the deal.        
	All modalities for the free trade agreement are concluded, commerce secretary Gopal Pillai said.        
	Pillai, who returned from talks in Brunei yesterday, said trade ministers would meet around August 28 for the Asean economic ministers and India conference where they would formally announce the agreement.        
	Talks in Brunei yesterday removed the remaining obstacles to the pact.        
	The agreement was supposed to have been wrapped up last year, but got bogged down over differences on products which India wanted excluded from tariff cuts.

	Calcutta, May 19: Sun Microsystems India Pvt Ltd is aiming for the top slot in domestic storage solution, estimated to be a $315 million market in India.        
	The $13.8-billion firm ranks No. 3 in the Indian storage market.        
	Along with China, India is one of the fastest growing storage markets in the Asia Pacific, excluding Japan.        
	Our revenues grew to 16.8 per cent in the last calendar year from 11.4 per cent in 2006. The storage market in India grew at about 22.3 per cent. We expect to maintain a similar growth momentum for our storage business in the country if not better. We would want to become the market leader as soon as possible, said Sivasankaran Lakshminarayanan, director (storage practice) of Sun Microsystems India.        
	According to the IDCs Asia Pacific disk storage system tracker 2007, HPs market share fell to 16.7 per cent in calendar year 2007 from 20.6 per cent in calendar year 2006, while that of IBM rose to 24 per cent from 22.2 per cent and EMCs to 20 per cent (18.6 per cent).        
	Computer data storage refers to components and devices that retain digital data used for computing for a certain time interval.        
	Lakshminarayanan said depending on the nature and requirement of data storage, companies could save 25-50 per cent by using Sun Microsystemss storage solutions.

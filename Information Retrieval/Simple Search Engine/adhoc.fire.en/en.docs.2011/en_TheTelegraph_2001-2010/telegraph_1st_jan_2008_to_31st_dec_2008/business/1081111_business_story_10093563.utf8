          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 10: Goldman Sachs today cut the GDP growth forecast for India to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal from 7.5 per cent and to 5.8 per cent for fiscal 2009-10 from 7 per cent, citing knock-on effects of the global financial crisis.        
	Goldman Sachs lower forecasts follow a series of similar projections made by other houses.         
	Recently, a study put out by Citigroup said the countrys GDP growth could plummet to 5.8 per cent for the year ended March 2010 in a worst-case scenario if liquidity problems intensify and investments slow down. This could be the lowest growth rate since 2002-03 when it dipped to 3.8 per cent.        
	Earlier, Morgan Stanley had forecast a growth rate of 6.4 per cent this fiscal.        
	The Reserve Bank of India has also scaled back its GDP growth forecast for this year to a range between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent from a level of 8 per cent earlier.        
	The larger-than-expected shock to the financial sector over the past couple of months, and its knock-on effects on both domestic and external demand are responsible for our lower growth projections, said Tushar Poddar, vice-president for Asia Economics Research at Goldman Sachs.        
	Goldman Sachs added that growth would drop to a quarterly rate of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2009-10, before recovering to 6.6 per cent by the end of that year.

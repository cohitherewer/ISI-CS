	London, Jan. 23 (Reuters): US and European stocks slid on Wednesday, hammered by persistent worries about a US recession, one day after the Federal Reserves surprise interest rate cut boosted the global markets.
    
	Safe-haven government bonds and the yen, which tend to rise as investors pare risky trades, gained ground. Commodities, including oil, sagged on nagging fears of slower global growth hurting demand.
    
	European stocks closed at their lowest level in 1-1/2 years on Wednesday, as fears of more mortgage-related write-downs again hit bank shares.
    
	In the US, all three major stock indices fell more than 1 per cent as disappointing outlooks from technology leaders Apple and Motorola added to recession fears.
    
	When the Fed cuts 75 basis points, stocks are supposed to go up, said T.J. Marta of RBC Capital Markets. Thats not happening. Theres a lot of dread out there.
    
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 186.15 points, or 1.55 per cent, at 11785.04. The S amp;P 500 Index was down 23.78 points, or 1.81 per cent, at 1286.72. The Nasdaq Composite was down 62.46 points, or 2.72 per cent, at 2229.81.
    
	In Europe, investors relief after a surprise hefty US interest rate cut quickly vanished and fears of more mortgage-related write-downs hit banks again. 
    
	Shares of energy companies were among the biggest losers, sinking along with crude oil prices on persistent worries over a US recession. Royal Dutch Shell shed 5.2 per cent, Total fell 5.8 per cent and Repsol lost 4.3 per cent.
    
	The FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 3.2 per cent at 1,262.40 points, above lows during the session that saw it go down more than 4 per cent.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Balsillie in Mumbai on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 18: BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) is planning India-specific devices, for which its is planning to set up operations in the country.        
	Were looking at specialised solutions for the Indian market, where the pricing will be tailored to cater to the local market. We want to create a less expensive supply chain, Jim Balsillie, co-chief executive of RIM, said at the launch of the BlackBerry Bold in Mumbai.        
	Priced at Rs 34,990, the BlackBerry Bold supports downlink speeds of 3.5 megabits per second. The smartphone has a lustrous black exterior with a satin chrome finished frame, while its colour LCD screen has a 480x320 resolution at 217 ppi (pixel per inch).        
	The Canadian company has 16 million subscribers across 140 countries with 375 carriers. It is trying hard to shed its corporate tag and is incorporating features such as MySpace, Facebook and iTunes into its devices. Only half of our growth came from enterprise customers last year, while the other half comprised the non-enterprise segment, said Balsillie. He said the recession in the US would not dampen BlackBerry sales.        
	Mobile phone sales in the US have been flat in the last five years, but the smart phone market has grown 58 per cent. Macro-economic factors would impact large assets such as home and car sales, but not mobile phones, he said.         
	RIM is closely working with Indias department of telecommunications (DoT) on the security features of BlackBerry. Balsille had met senior DoT officials in New Delhi yesterday. He said RIM doesnt see any threat from Apples iPhone.

	New Delhi, July 4 (pti): India is likely to overtake the US as the second largest emitter of carbon from energy use by 2050 after China, a study by consulting and research firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said.        
	Together, these two emerging giants are projected to account for around 45 per cent of global carbon emissions from energy by 2050 compared with only around 20 per cent of the global total for the US and the European Union combined, PwC said in its report on World in 2050.        
	Power generation and transport sectors in these two countries would contribute to more carbon emissions than from building and other industries, it said.         
	The rise in the ownership of cars in these two emerging economies would lead to a high growth rate of emissions, it added.

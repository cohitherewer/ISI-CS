The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni gloves illegal: ICC
                                                   Dhoni gloves illegal: ICC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has agreed not to use the keeping gloves he wore at the start of the innings against Australia in Sydney on Sunday after they were found to be illegal. The two on-field umpires, Daryl Harper and Tony Hill, third umpire Bruce Oxenford and Match Referee Jeff Crowe gave the ruling after inspecting Dhonis gloves following Australias 18-run victory, according to information received here.         
	The officials found Dhonis gloves had extra webbing between the thumb and the forefinger which was a violation of Law 40.2, which relates to gloves.         
	Crowe said: After I raised my concern in the India dressing room, Dhoni immediately changed his gloves.         
	The gloves were then inspected after the match by the third umpire, myself and later by the two on-field umpires. The three umpires ruled that the gloves were in breach of Laws of Cricket.         
	Dhoni has not been penalised on this occasion but he has been advised that if he uses the gloves again before they have been modified, inspected and cleared, he could be charged for a breach of Clause C1 of the Code of Conduct, said Crowe.         
	Law 40.2         
	The keepers gloves shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. If used, the webbing shall be          
	a) A single piece of non-stretch material, which, although it may have material attached, shall have no reinforcement or tucks         
	b) Such that the top edge of the webbing          
	i) Does not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb         
	ii) Is taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended.

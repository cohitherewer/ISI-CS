                                                   25 for 2nd auction
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Seven New Zealanders, six Australians, six Pakistanis, three Bangladeshis, two South Africans and one Sri Lankan will be up for grabs in the second DLF IPL auction to be held in Mumbai on Tuesday.         
	There will be no reserve price for these 25 centrally contracted players and bidding will start at US $ 50,000. Franchisees can however, choose to contract these players on a one-year basis.         
	Sixteen Under-19 players, including the members of the Indian squad who won the World Cup earlier this month, will be picked by the eight IPL franchises based on the draft system, according to an IPL release.         
	That means Bengal wicketkeeper-batsman Sreevats Goswami will be among others who will go under the hammer.         
	The auction will be held in BCCIs Cricket Center at 1pm.         
	THE LIST         
	Australia: Brad Hodge, Shane Watson, James Hopes, Brett Geeves, Phil Jaques and Luke Pomersbach.         
	Bangladesh: Mohammed Ashraful, Mashrafe Mortaza and Abdur Razzak.         
	New Zealand: Kyle Mills, Jeetan Patel, James Franklin, Chris Martin, Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Jamie How.         
	Pakistan: Misbah-ul Haq, Salman Butt, Mohammed Yousuf, Yasir Hameed, Mohammed Hafeez and Sohail Tanvir.         
	Sri Lanka: Prasanna Jayawardene.         
	South Africa: Morne Morkel and Ashwell Prince.

  - PREMIER LEAGUE
  -   REDS HOLD ON TO FOURTH SPOT, CHELSEA MOVE INTO SECOND PLACE                    Arsenals Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner scores the equaliser against Liverpool on Saturday. (AFP)                     
	London: Arsenal and Liverpool drew 1-1 for the third time this season on Saturday in a further blow to the London sides Premier League title hopes.         
	Peter Crouch fired Liverpool ahead shortly before halftime and, although Nicklas Bendtner headed in an equaliser after the break, Arsenals chase after league leaders Manchester United now looks forlorn.         
	Chelsea are more realistic challengers to Uniteds crown after moving three points clear of Arsenal into second place with a comfortable 2-0 win at Manchester City.         
	A Richard Dunne own goal and Salomon Kalous second-half effort were enough for Avram Grants side to notch their 11th away league win of the season and put them two points behind United who play at Middlesbrough on Sunday.         
	Arsenal and Liverpool both made changes to their starting line-ups after Wednesdays 1-1 draw in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg at the Emirates, a result that made Liverpool slight favourites to go through.         
	Peter Crouch was given a rare start by Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez who opted to leave Fernando Torres on the bench and the tall England striker had an impressive game.         
	He forced Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia into an athletic save in the opening exchanges and then played in John Arne Riise but the Norwegian failed to hit the target.         
	Bendtner, who played for Arsenal in place of top scorer Emmanuel Adebayor, wasted a good chance for Arsenal before Crouch struck to put Liverpool in front after escaping the attention of William Gallas and driving a shot past Almunia.         
	Cesc Fabregas was the provider for Arsenals equaliser eight minutes after the break. His flighted free-kick was met by Bendtners well-timed run and he thudded a header past Reina.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sent on Adebayor in a desperate attempt to snatch the points but Liverpool could have won it when Andriy Voronin shot over the bar after being picked out in the area by Crouch.         
	Alexander Hleb should have done better when he failed to control a pass in the area as Arsenal tried in vain to claw a victory that would have kept them in touch.         
	Their best chance of silverware now this season is the Champions League but Liverpool will start favourites to reach the semi-finals in Tuesdays second leg at Anfield.         
	We are disappointed because we dominated the second half and I believe we had a penalty again not given, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said. With our situation in the table a victory was needed.         
	At the other end of the table Fulham look like joining Derby County through the relegation trapdoor after losing 3-1 at home to Sunderland while Bolton Wanderers were hammered 4-0 at Aston Villa to diminish their own survival chances.         
	Birmingham City remain just above the bottom three after losing 2-0 at fellow strugglers Wigan Athletic. Newcastle United picked up a third consecutive win to end their relegation worries, beating Reading 3-0, while Blackburn Rovers drew 1-1 at home with Tottenham Hotspur.         
	Fulham have 24 points from 33 games with Bolton on 26.

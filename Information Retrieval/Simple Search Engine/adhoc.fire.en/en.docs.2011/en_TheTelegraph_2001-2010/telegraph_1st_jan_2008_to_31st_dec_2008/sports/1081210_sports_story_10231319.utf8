The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nasim Ashraf tried to ruin my career, says Shoaib Akhtar 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nasim Ashraf tried to ruin my career, says Shoaib Akhtar 
                      
	Karachi: Back to his old ways, controversial Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf, accusing him of trying to ruin his career.         
	Shoaib said on a television show that Ashraf, who resigned in acrimonious circumstances in August, had ruined the game in Pakistan and was bent on destroying his career.         
	The previous board ruined cricket and spent board money like kings.         
	And at the same time cricketers were treated unfairly and without respect... I dont know what problem the former Chairman had with me, he said.         
	Shoaib said Ashraf had tried to insult him by offering a monthly retainer of Rs 75,000 whereas players who were much junior to him were given central contracts with monthly retainers of Rs 2,50,000.         
	What was he trying to prove after all the years of service I had behind me for Pakistan cricket?         
	I have been representing Pakistan and performing for the last 10 years.         
	What contribution has he (Nasim Ashraf) made to Pakistan cricket which gave him the right to come and decide about my career? Shoaib questioned.         
	Shoaib, however, admitted that he had had more fitness issues before the start or in the middle of series in his career than any other fast bowler but insisted whenever he did play for Pakistan he gave quality performances and won them matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fireworks on the cards
                                                                                                                                                                                             Fireworks on the cards
            PRATIK BANDYOPADHYAY                              
	Calcutta: There were clouds of uncertainty over the current edition of the Federation Cup before it was shifted to Calcutta. And after it was, there were very few people in the stands or in front of the TV sets to watch the action. But thanks to the Bengal versus Goa angle, and the keenly-contested semi-final between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, when Bagan take on Dempo Sports Club in the final at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, there will be spectators in the stands and in front of the TV sets.         
	This became clear when the two teams practised at the venue of the final on Saturday. While Dempos practice attracted a handful, not a small thing on a chilly December morning, the red-and-maroon brigade practised in the afternoon in front of a crowd, which shouted, whistled and chanted slogans.         
	There are tired muscles in both teams and enthusiastic fans would surely help in bringing the best out of the players. However, there is enough motivation even without public interest. The Federation Cup has definitely lost some of the glamour of being the premier tournament of the country since the inception of the national league but the clubs still regard the Fed Cup winners as the best in India. That is why Bagan and Dempo have made no attempt to hide the fact that they want to win this tournament badly even though both the coaches have repeatedly said that their players are tired playing day in and day out.                   
	A gruelling season is bound to tire the players down. The absence of Bhaichung Bhutia and Anand Vasan on top of that will hurt the home team badly. Both of them attended the teams practice session, albeit from the sidelines. This show of solidarity is something that would boost the morale of those who take the field on Sunday.         
	While P.C. Lalawmpuiya will replace Bhaichung, the practice suggested coach Karim Bencharifa is mulling different options to make up for the absence of Vasan. One of those would be playing with three men at the back and having five midfielders. Whatever be the formation and the strategy, the man who Bagan will depend on is Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	He has been Bagans saviour on numerous occasions. The coach and the supporters will again expect one of those vintage performances from him. The Brazilian was all concentration at practice. The signature smile was missing. Dempo will hope that it doesnt return till the final is over.         
	Fellow Brazilian Marcos Pereira has been instrumental in taking Bagan to the final and his fight against Dempos Roberto Mendes Silva for control of the midfield will have a bearing on the match.         
	While Bagan will miss their most prolific scorer in Bhaichung, Dempo are a happy lot as Ranty Martins is fully fit now. With him, Joaquim Abranches and Clifford Miranda in form, scoring has not been a problem for the Goan side. They have scored 11 goals so far in the tournament. The Bagan defence, led by Deepak Mondal, will be under pressure. However, the presence of the towering figure called Sangram Mukherjee is something that Bagan can boast of. If it boils down to a penalty shootout, Bagan will be the more confident lot after Sangrams heroics in the semi-final.         
	If it repeats the inconsistent performance, Ranty and Co. will not spare them.   
	key men  
	Mohun Bagan  Jose Ramirez Barreto   The magician has slowed down with age but has not lost his touch. The equaliser against East Bengal in the hard-fought semi-final on Thursday proved Barreto still reserves his best for the big match. He has been in form right from the start of this Federation Cup. If there is one man in Mohun Bagan who can change the match single-handedly, he is Barreto.    Sangram Mukherjee   It is said that goals win matches but when it comes down to the tie-breaker, there are few goalkeepers who can do better than this lanky Bagan goalie. He also saved his team on more than one occasion during the 120 minutes of play in the semi-final. His form will be a key factor in the final, too.   
	dempo  Ranty Martins 
    Ranty is the most clinical marskman in Indian football at the moment. He has been dogged by injury problems this season but is fully fit now. An in-form Ranty is a nightmare for any defence..  Roberto Mendes Silva (Beto)  This Brazilian has played for the Calcutta giants and knows their strengths and weaknesses. He has been the mainstay of the Dempo midfield and his combination with the men upfront will hold the key to Dempo rsquo;s fortunes.

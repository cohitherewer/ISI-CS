	New Delhi: All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Thursday appointed a three-member inquiry committee to look into any instance of match-fixing in the game.         
	Former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali, Sarabjit Singh of Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association and Delhi Lawn Tennis Association secretary V. K. Batra are the members.         
	The committee was formed after Mahesh Bhupathi said in an interview that he received an offer to lose a Davis Cup World Group tie against The Netherlands in Jaipur in 1996.

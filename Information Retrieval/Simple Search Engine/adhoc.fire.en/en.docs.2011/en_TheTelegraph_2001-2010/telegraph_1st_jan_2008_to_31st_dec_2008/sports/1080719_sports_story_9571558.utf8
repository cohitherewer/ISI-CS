	ANECDOTES  
	Sweet revenge  
	Finnish legend Paavo Nurmi had the honour of running into the arena with the Olympic torch. Banned by the IOC on the eve of the Games in Los Angeles 20 years earlier (for accusations of professionalism), Nurmi made a triumphant return to the stage on which he made his name as one of the all-time greats of long-distance running.         
	Longevity         
	Finnish gymnast Heikki Savolainen who recited the Olympic oath won a bronze medal in the team event  24 years after his first medal, a bronze in the pommel horse in Amsterdam in 1928. In 1932 and 1936, he won five other medals  one silver and four bronze.         
	Sky-high         
	Humorous American minister Bob Richards, who won the pole vault title, was quick to remark: I am the only priest in the world who is using his own means to get to heaven.                       
	EXPLOIT  
	Emil Zatopek arrived in Helsinki with an already established reputation  making him one of the firm favourites in his class. In this particular Olympiad, Zatopek exceeded all expectations by winning three titles  the 5000m, 10,000m and the marathon  an unheard of feat that will likely never be repeated.  
	On July 20, the Czech, who already held the 10,000m Olympic title and a silver medal from the Games four years previously, brought his account up to date by retaining his 10,000m title.         
	Two days later, Zatopek and Mimoun squared up again in the 5000m - again the Czech imposed his superiority by taking the gold and setting a new Olympic record (14:06.6)  only eight-tenths of a second ahead of Mimoun, who ran an impressive last lap to catch up with his rival.         
	A few hours after the race, both Zatopek and his wife Dana were able to congratulate each other after she won a gold and set a new Olympic record in the womens javelin event with a throw of 50.47m.         
	One thing was clear  the Czechoslovakian army soldier perfected a method of training which saw him combine daily runs of 30km with sprint work and muscle-training. The only challenge remaining for Zatopek was the marathon  the pinnacle of his success.         
	Racing for the first time at this distance  at least officially  Zatopek took up the lead at the midway point, slipping past the two athletes who, until then, had been able to keep up with him.         
	He set himself up for an unforgettable victory in a time of 2 hour 23:03.02. As proof that he was at ease during the race, Zatopek was seen waving to the crowd, and even chatted with roadside spectators. Thanks to this memorable week in Finland, Zatopek added true Olympic glory to what was an already highly successful career.                       
	Summary   
	The 15th Olympic Games was hosted by an instantly-recognisable sporting nation, and a real flurry of excitement descended upon Finland as it welcomed nearly 5,000 athletes from 69 countries. The effort to guarantee success being made easier by works undertaken in 1938 following Tokyos forfeit of the 1940 Games, competition was of high standard and the Helsinki Games were generally held in high esteem.  
	In the political arena, the return of the Russians  absent since the decisive outbreak of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917  proved a diplomatic and sporting success for the IOC. Also making its return to the Olympic fold, following an absence of 20 years due to accusations of professionalism, was 56-year-old Finnish legend Paavo Nurmi. He carried the Olympic flame, passing it to his compatriot Hannes Kolehmainen, who lit the Olympic bowl.         
	Meanwhile, Swedish IOC president Sigfrid Edstrom stood down at the end of the Games and was replaced by a rather more stout defender of amateurism, American Avery Brundage.         
	In the sports arena, the United States dominated athletics and swimming events, and also began their epic duel with the Soviets.         
	Even if the issue of the Cold War was apparent, for the most part, sport remained on top of the agenda. The diplomatic Finns set up home for the Soviet Union and her satellite countries in an Olympic village a little further removed from their western rivals. Ukraine and Belarus competed under the Soviet flag, despite being regarded as independent nations by the United Nations.         
	Meanwhile, the Americans proudly expanded their existing account with an additional 76 medals (40 gold, 19 silver, and 17 bronze), coming first overall. The Soviet Union finished in second place with a total of 71 medals, (22 gold, 30 silver, and 19 bronze).

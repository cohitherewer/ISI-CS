The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal in drivers seat
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal in drivers seat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Riding on Sourav Sarkars five-wicket haul, Bengal bundled out Services for 107 to end Day I in a commanding position in their Ranji Trophy plate group B match at the Eden on Sunday.         
	Then an unbeaten 109-run opening partnership, between debutant Rohan Banerjee (48 batting) and Anustup Majumdar (42 batting), earned the hosts a lead of two runs, before bad light forced the umpires to end proceedings early.         
	Sarkar, playing as the third pacer alongside Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda, bowled immaculately in the right channel to lead Bengals attack after Dinda gave the hosts an early breakthrough in the very second over of the match.         
	Captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla bagged three wickets in his nine-over spell while Avik Chowdhury picked one in a tidy spell of six overs. Ranadeb Bose went wicketless.         
	Bengal put Services into bat after winning the toss on a typical Eden wicket, which provided a lot of assistance to the fast bowlers.         
	The visitors batting looked amateurish with both openers  Sumit Tomar and Tohir Khan  failing to stand up to the Bengal attack.         
	Dinda, operating from the high court end, was bang on target in his first over and caught Tohir plumb in front with the visitors yet to open up their account. After Tohirs dismissal, Tomar (23) along with Jasvir Singh put up a 42-run second-wicket partnership before Laxmi introduced Sourav in place of Ranadeb into the attack.         
	The move immediately paid dividend. Tomar nicked an incoming delivery from Sarkar only to reach the safe hands of wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. Jasvir (27) also followed soon.         
	Services then showed why Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee called them the weakest team of the lot. Facing Bengals fiery bowling, backed by some classic fielding by Manoj Tiwary, the visitors batsmen threw away their wickets in no time.         
	A superb catch by Tiwary at cover off the bowling of Avik Chowdhury removed Soomik Chatterjee (5). The Bengal captain brought himself into the attack just before lunch and reduced the visitors to six wickets for only 82 runs.         
	Laxmi trapped Yashpal Singh (13) lbw, and then induced an edge off Devendra Israni that Dinda accepted gleefully.

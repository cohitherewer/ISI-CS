	 On 15, Sachin Tendulkar became the highest scorer in Test cricket. He surpassed Brian Lara (11,953), who had been holding the record for two years and 11 months.         
	 On 50, Tendulkar brought up his 50th Test half-century. He became the fourth player to score 50 half-centuries after Allan Border, Rahul Dravid and Steve Waugh.         
	 On 61, he became the first player to score 12,000 runs in Test cricket.         
	 On 88, he completed 2,500 runs against Australia in Tests. He is the ninth cricketer to do so.         
	 By becoming Peter Siddles first Test victim, Tendulkar has now been the first Test victim of bowlers on nine occasions. Incidentally, Ganguly, too, has been the first Test victim of nine bowlers. However, Colin Cowdrey and Herbert Sutcliffe have been dismissed 10 times (the maximum) by bowlers claiming their first Test wicket.         
	 On 39, Sourav Ganguly became the 33rd cricketer overall and only fourth Indian to score 7000 runs in Test cricket. He is also the 12th left-hander and the first Indian left hander to score 7000 runs.         
	 When they put on 81, Ganguly and Tendulkar bettered the previous highest fifth-wicket partnership at this ground, which was incidentally set by the same duo versus England in 2001-02.         
	 Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir put up their sixth 50-plus stand in the last seven Test innings. By doing so, they brought up their 11th 50-plus stand. Sehwag and Gambhir now have the most 50-plus stands by any Indian opening pair, bettering the 10 stands which Sunil Gavaskar and Chetan Chauhan had.

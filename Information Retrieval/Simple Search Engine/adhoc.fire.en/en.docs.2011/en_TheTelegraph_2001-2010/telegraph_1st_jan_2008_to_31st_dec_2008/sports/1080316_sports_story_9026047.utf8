	New Delhi: World No. 11 Vijai Singh returned from India with a flu and stomach virus, resulting in his losing almost 20 pounds in weight in a week.         
	The former world No. 1 played the Johnnie Walker Classic in Gurgaon two weeks back and returned to Florida unwell, which forced him to skip practice for four days.         
	Tried to eat clean and drink bottled water, and it didnt work, Singh said .         
	I got the flu and a stomach virus, so both things were not very good. I came back on Monday and just never left the bathroom for four days. It was almost a forced rest.         
	He had even contemplated withdrawing from the tournament but had a remarkable recovery as he tries to successfully defend his title.           (PTI)

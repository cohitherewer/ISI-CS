	Birmingham: Sania Mirzas comeback from injury ended in agony but Sunitha Raos dream run continued as she advanced to the pre-quarter finals of the $200,000 WTA DFS classic here on Wednesday.         
	Sania, seeded sixth, went down 3-6, 0-6 to New Zealands Marina Erakovic.         
	The sixth seeded Indian, who had been laid low by a wrist injury that needed to be operated upon in US, went down in just an hour.         
	However, Sunitha, a qualifier, continued her winning run as she rallied to beat local challenger Naomi Cavaday 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. The US-based Indian will take on the winner of the match between sixth seed Ukraines Alona Bondarenko and Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual in the last-16 stage.         
	But it was heartbreak for Sania, who was handed a bye in the first round here, as she never found her footing in the match and was outplayed by her opponent in all departments of the game, marking a disappointing start to her build-up for the Wimbledon Grand Slam championship later this month.         
	Sania has teamed up with American Bethanie Mattek in the doubles, and the fourth-seeded pair will be up against Natalie Grandin of South Africa and American Raquel Kops-jones in the opening round.

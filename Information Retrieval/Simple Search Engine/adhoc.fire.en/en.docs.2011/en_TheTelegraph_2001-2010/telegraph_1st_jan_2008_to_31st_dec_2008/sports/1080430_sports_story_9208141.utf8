The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary: Sachins tips helped
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tiwary: Sachins tips helped
                      
	Chandigarh: Delhi DareDevils batsman Manoj Tiwary said valuable tips from Sachin Tendulkar helped improve his batting.         
	Sachin gave me a lot of tips which had a positive effect on my batting, right-handed 22-year-old Tiwary said. He said during the recent tri-series in Australia, Tendulkar had told him how to improve his technique.         
	It has helped me and I am hoping to perform well for the DareDevils, he said.         
	Tiwary, who has played just one ODI so far, said he wanted to be a permanent member of the Indian squad and strengthen the middle-order, where he faces stiff competition from players like Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa and Rohit Sharma.         
	He also praised DareDevils skipper Virender Sehwag, saying he was leading the side well. He is a great leader and we all enjoy playing under him, he said.         
	The Calcutta lad said he would not lack motivation when his side clash with Kolkata Knight Riders on May 13.         
	The Bengal batsman in the DareDevils jersey made it clear that he would like to make a statement with the bat after being snubbed by the Calcutta franchise during the landmark auction.         
	Im looking forward to playing that game against the Kolkata Knight Riders. I expected them to go for me in the auction, which they did not. I hope to do well in that match and make a statement with my performance that Im good enough, said the attacking batsman.         
	Tiwary, however, claimed he was happy being one of the DareDevils.         
	Im more than happy being part of the Delhi squad, he said.         
	Dwelling on IPL, Tiwary did not agree with the notion that foreigners have stolen the thunder over Indian players so far in the tournament. (PTI)

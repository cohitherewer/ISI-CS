                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gary: No worries for us
  - Its going to be a different Pakistan out there, says Team India coach       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Umar Gul (left) and Shahid Afridi warm up at the Sher-e Bangla Stadium in Dhaka on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Dhaka: Team India coach Gary Kirsten is not expecting a cakewalk on Saturday. He knows Pakistan will come hard and says the team is prepared to deal with any eventuality.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His thoughts on an India-Pakistan final         
	Anticipating great clash We know it is not going to be as easy as the other night. We will see a different Pakistan. They are going to be motivated and determined and we know they can play good cricket. We like to try and stay away from worrying about the opposition too much apart from expecting them to play at their best. We feel if we can execute our plans the way we want to, we are going to be difficult to beat.         
	Having an optional net session on the eve of the final         
	There are no issues... The teams playing well at the moment. Weve had to remain focused on our preparation and at the same time give the guys rest. Weve tried to balance the two and everyones feeling good about tomorrow (Saturday).         
	On how optimistic he is about the opening partnership         
	It is important but were not expecting things It might happen such that we dont get that partnership. It will obviously be nice to have it because they score at a good rate and it sets our innings up. Weve also got to be willing to know that we might lose a wicket early on. But weve got quality batsmen who can apply themselves in that situation.         
	The toss         
	The wicket seems to be holding quite well for both the sessions. So the toss is not going to be an important factor.         
	If an India-Pakistan tie has lost its previous intensity         
	Im not experienced enough to comment on that I can say that the guys are motivated They are eager to win it for the country.         
	The swing bowlers and Praveen Kumars performance         
	Ive seen a lot of swing bowlers, but not many very recently. Among the Indians, Manoj Prabhakar in the Nineties comes to mind and even Venkatesh Prasad         
	Areas that need attention         
	Fielding and fitness are certainly areas that were working very hard on... Its nice to have a lot of youth because theres energy and enthusiasm, which is great. They are very keen to prepare well physically. Were placing a lot of emphasis on that..         
	If India have found a replacement for Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar in Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag         
	Were looking for replacements for a lot of players Its been good to see Gautam perform He has the talent and has done well.

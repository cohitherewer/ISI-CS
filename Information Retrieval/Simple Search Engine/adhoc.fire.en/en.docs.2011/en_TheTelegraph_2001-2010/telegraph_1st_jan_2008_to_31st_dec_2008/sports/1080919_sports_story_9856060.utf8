	Louisville: Loud chants of USA USA reverberated around the ninth green at Valhalla Golf Club on Wednesday, early signs of the 13th man US captain Paul Azinger is banking on to influence this weeks Ryder Cup.         
	The Americans are under intense pressure to reverse a run of three successive defeats at the hands of Europe, the last two by thumping margins, and Azinger has targeted the Kentucky crowd to lift his 12-man team.         
	Four years ago at Oakland Hills, the US were outsmarted by Bernhard Langers Europeans who shrewdly won over the home fans with a charm offensive in the build-up to the three days of competition.         
	Meticulous Langer told his players at the start of the week to make every effort to sign autographs and interact with the galleries. The ploy succeeded and Europe went on to crush their hosts by a record-equalling margin of 18-1/2 points to 9-1/2.         
	The highly competitive Azinger, a veteran of four Ryder Cups as player, is eager for that advantage to be reversed at Valhalla if at all possible. So far, his efforts are succeeding.         
	He has requested his players and caddies to engage the fans at every opportunity this week by signing autographs, posing for photographs and handing out US Ryder Cup lapel pins.         
	Around 40,000 fans have attended each of the first two practice days in sun-drenched conditions. Although they have given the European team a warm reception, their biggest roars have been reserved for the Americans.         
	By the time Kentucky natives Kenny Perry and J.B. Holmes reached the ninth green on Wednesday in the company of Jim Furyk and Boo Weekley, the spectators were ready to raise the decibel level.         
	Chants of USA USA built to a crescendo after the American quartet had putted out and slowly made their way up the incline towards the clubhouse, signing banners and Ryder Cup programmes and tossing lapel pins into the crowd like confetti.         
	Its awesome, Cup rookie Weekley said. This whole crowd thing could be a turning point for us.         
	Ive never ever signed so many autographs. I must have signed at least a hundred by the ninth green.         
	Furyk, making his sixth Cup appearance this week, has vivid memories of Europes cunning ploy with the fans at Oakland Hills and believes Louisville will be very different.         
	That certainly didnt do us any favours at all in Detroit, he said of the 2004 Ryder Cup.I loved the fans in Detroit and I love the fans here.         
	Louisville fans dont get a lot of golf here but, when they do, they step it up a notch. Its important for us to play well to give the fans something to cheer about.         
	Azinger, who has appeared to be in more relaxed mood than his opposite number Nick Faldo so far this week, believes the crowd have fully embraced the American team.         
	We are loving our gallery, he said. I want to treat them like theyre going to be our 13th man. Theyre screaming for more (lapel) pins and I dont think we have enough. We only have 10,000.         
	We really want to embrace this crowd. We dont want what happened in 04 to happen again. The Europeans are already requesting sharpies (marker pens) on the tees and stuff like that, so I know what theyre trying to do.         
	Its like The K Club, he added, referring to the fans in Ireland two years when Europe again hammered the Americans by a nine-point margin.         
	The crowd was so energised there. It was hard to watch as an American player but it was the way it should be. I think what youre going to see here is the same kind of energy, maybe even a greater energy.

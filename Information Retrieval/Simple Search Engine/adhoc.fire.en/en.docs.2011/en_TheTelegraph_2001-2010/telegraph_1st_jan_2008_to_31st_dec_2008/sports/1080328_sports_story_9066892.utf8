The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well try to bat for 2 days,   says Sehwag 
                                                     Well try to bat for 2 days,   says Sehwag 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag in action in Chennai on Thursday                                 
	Chennai: Virender Sehwag along with Wasim Jaffer ensured that India got off to a solid start at close on the second day of the first Test. At a news conference, Sehwag said that India were hoping to take a lead of around 50-100 runs to put pressure on the visitors in their second innings.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Indias approach after South Africa amassed 540         
	I got 52 in 21 overs... What do you think? Was I defensive or playing my natural game? My approach was clear, if there is a ball to be hit, I will hit it...         
	If the wicket will break         
	It will crack maybe on the fifth day         
	The game plan         
	We will try to bat for around two days and then look to put them in on the final day. We will aim to get a lead of around 50-100 runs and apply pressure. If we get close to their first innings total, then it will be difficult for them because batting will not be easy on the fifth day. Everyone knows that the Chennai wicket affords spin and bounce So it will be difficult to bat against Harbhajan and Kumble.         
	If misfields showed a lack of intensity         
	I think it was because of the heat and the flat wicket. There was nothing for the bowlers, but still they worked hard for the wickets. It happens sometimes but we will work on it in the second innings.         
	The bowling         
	I think the bowlers worked hard to get the wickets because it was not an easy wicket to bowl on. We planned to be patient because whenever you play in India you always expect to bowl out the opposition quickly because of Kumble and Harbhajan. But it is not always easy especially when the pitch is so flat. I think both Harbhajan and Kumble deserve special praise for their efforts with the ball. We tried our best but they also batted well.         
	The sloppy fielding         
	We will try and improve. Everybody didnt field well... We all want to do well but sometimes the intensity level drops.         
	If the heat will be a problem         
	I dont think so. All the players are used to playing in India. And in India wherever you play after March it is hot. We go to Ahmedabad next which is also hot and after that Kanpur, where you find dry heat in April. So we are pretty used to the heat.         
	Wasim Jaffers batting after his recent bad form in Australia         
	I dont think you should judge a player on the basis of one bad series. If you see his record, out of his five hundreds two are double centuries.         
	Hashim Amlas innings         
	Of course he batted well. We were not expecting that kind of knock from Amla but he did well. He showed great patience and proved to everyone that is here to score runs. I am sure he will improve with experience.

	Indian Wells: Sania Mirza put up a spirited fight back to get past Israels Shahar Peer to move into the pre-quarter finals of the $2,100,000 Pacific Life Open on Sunday.         
	After losing the first set in the tie-break, the Indian ace brilliantly rallied to beat her former doubles partner 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 6-3 in the third round match.         
	Sanias job becomes tougher from here as she faces world No. 8 Slovak Daniela Hantuchova, who beat Chinese Jie Zhang 6-4, 6-2 in another third-round match.         
	Sania is seeded 21st in singles in the tier I event while Hantuchova is the fifth seed.         
	Personally, this is a good achievement to be playing the way I am playing and to be beating these players who are at the top, because Im dealing with a lot of things off the court, which a lot of people are not dealing with, Sania later said.         
	The 21-year-old Hyderabadi has found herself entangled in one or the other controversy and ultimately decided not to play any event in India this year.         
	In the latest incident, a lawsuit was filed against her for showing disrespect to the National Flag during the Hopman Cup in Perth. The suit however was dropped later.         
	You know, Im fine. We all go through ups and downs. Sometimes you feel like why do you want to do this? and sometimes you feel like oh, Im going to show everyone and oppose all the odds and come out of this. The Indian said she had to inspire herself to beat a tough opponent in Peer.         
	We always play tough matches, but its about finding the way to win. I was a bit irritated with myself, because I was fighting, fighting, the whole time, coming back all the time levelling up and then not going up or finishing it.         
	Finally, I did go up one point and one set point, and I sprayed the ball off my backhand. You have to inspire yourself to fight all over again, because youve done everything right except win that set, she said after the match.         
	In the $3,589,000 mens Masters Series event being held at the same venue, Leander Paes and his Australian partner Paul Hanley warded off the challenge of David Nalbandian and Gullermo Canas to storm into the doubles quarter finals.         
	The eighth seed Indo-Australian pair beat the Argentine duo 7-5, 2-6, 10-5 in the second round.         
	Meanwhile, sixth seeded Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles of Bahamas won their opening encounter against the combine of German Christopher Kas and Dutch Rogier Wassen 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to move into the second round.

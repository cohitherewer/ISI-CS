	Kazan (Russia): India suffered a huge setback in their quest to book a spot for Beijing when they went down 1-2 to Netherlands Antilles in their second match of the womens hockey Olympic qualifiers here on Sunday.         
	The loss dealt a severe blow to Indias chances of making it to Beijing and now they have to win all their remaining matches.         
	Claire Vissers solo effort following Indias abortive penalty corner gave Netherlands Antilles the lead in the 31st minute.         
	Rani Devi equalised eight minutes into the second half, but even as India went in search of the winning goal and wasted three penalty corners, another counter-attack got the tiny nation their proud moment.         
	Maria Hinskens got the winner in the 55th minute, converting a quick free-hit.         
	Never a moment we thought we could win this match, said their elated captain Ernestina Schreuder.         
	This was the best match since I took over the team in 2005, said Bas Swildens, the coach of the winning team.         
	Meanwhile, the players are finding it difficult to cope with the bone-chilling weather here with coach M K Kaushik wondering why an important tournament like the Olympic qualifier is being held in such extreme climate.         
	With the dipping temperature and occasional rain, the players are facing a big hurdle to practice and play the matches.         
	We cannot cope with the cold weather. Sometimes our players are even unable to hold the stick properly, Kaushik said. (PTI)

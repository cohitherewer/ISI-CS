The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hair wont officiate in Pak matches: ICC
                                                     Hair wont officiate in Pak matches: ICC
                  Darrell Hair                     
	London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering not to appoint Darrell Hair for the matches involving Pakistan, a top ICC official has said.         
	ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson said those matches would not be on Hairs immediate agenda.         
	We would have to take a sensible approach. We will probably keep him away from matches involving Pakistan where we can, Richardson told a radio channel on Wednesday.         
	We dont want to put umpires in an almost impossible position where any mistake they may make would be under such scrutiny that the pressure becomes unbearable, he said.         
	But Richardson indicated that the Australian would not be barred from officiating in all matches involving Asian teams.         
	Its pointless having an umpire on the Elite Panel who is excluded from umpiring certain teams. There are always going to be stages in an umpires career when he is not the flavour of the month, but he will come up against an Asian team at some stage, he said.         
	Inzamam-ul Haq-led Pakistan team had refused to continue playing after tea on Day IV of the Oval Test in August 2006 after Hair and fellow umpire Billy Doctrove penalised them on charges of ball tampering.         
	Hair and Doctrove then called off the match, leading to the first-ever forfeiture in the history of Test cricket.         
	Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday welcomed Hairs reinstatement as a Test umpire, saying the controversial official should be able to oversee matches in any Test nation, including Pakistan.         
	Spokesman Peter Young said Hair remained one of the games most technically proficient officials and welcomed the ICC decision to reinstate him.         
	Were pleased to see Darrell back, Young said.         
	CA has always had a view that he is, in a technical sense, an excellent umpire, one of the best two or three in the world.         
	World cricket needs good umpires, its got good umpires but it needs more rather than less, so its pleasing to see him back and we look forward to seeing him back on the circuit.         
	Young said CA believed Hairs reinstatement meant he was eligible to umpire in all Test-playing nations.         
	Its an ICC issue but we would support the notion that the ICC should be able to send him wherever it wants to send him, he said. (AGENCIES)

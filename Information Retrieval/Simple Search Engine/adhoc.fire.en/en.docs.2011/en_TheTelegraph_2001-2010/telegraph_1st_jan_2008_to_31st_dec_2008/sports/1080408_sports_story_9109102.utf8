The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak not missing Shoaib
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pak not missing Shoaib

	Lahore: Pakistan have a strong pace attack for the one-day series against Bangladesh even without banned strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar, captain Shoaib Malik said on Monday.         
	Our pace attack even without Shoaib is good, Malik said on the eve of the opening game of the one-day series.         
	(Mohammed) Asif is recovering and played a domestic game today, Umer Gul is back and even Sohail Tanvir and Iftikhar Rao are experienced bowlers now, he told a news conference.         
	Bangladesh are touring Pakistan after Australia postponed their Test tour last month over security concerns.         
	Malik said his players were professionals and would not let themselves be distracted by the controversy generated by Shoaibs five-year suspension, handed down last week for repeated indiscipline.         
	One-day cricket is a game where any side can win on its day. Bangladesh cant be taken lightly and we will try our hardest to win the series, Malik said. If we win the first game that will set the pace and standard for the rest of the series and we can think ahead.         
	Bangladesh have won only one of their 18 one-day matches against Pakistan but captain Mohammed Ashraful said his team were going into the series confident and well prepared.         
	We have come here after hard series against South Africa and we also beat Ireland. So we are well prepared but we just have to play with discipline, he said.           (REUTERS)

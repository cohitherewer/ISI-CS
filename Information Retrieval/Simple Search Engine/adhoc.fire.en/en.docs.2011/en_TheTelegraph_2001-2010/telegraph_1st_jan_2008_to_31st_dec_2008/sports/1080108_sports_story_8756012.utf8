                                                    Sourav rues bad decisions

         Sourav Ganguly leaves the SCG after being dismissed controversially on Sunday 
          
	Sydney: Sourav Ganguly believes his dismissal and that of Rahul Dravids  both umpiring howlers  cost India the Sydney Test against Australia. 
    
	India needed to bat out a little more than the last two sessions to secure a draw but the top order crumbled and slumped to 54 for three before Sourav (51) and Dravid (38) joined to steady the boat. 
    
	But just when they seemed to have put India back on track, Dravid was ruled caught out by Bucknor despite the ball brushing his knee-roll and then Sourav was given marching orders even though Michael Clarke took a bump catch, also grounding it while rolling over. 
    
	Though he fell short of criticising the umpires, Sourav has no doubt that the crucial dismissals cost India the match. 
    
	We had the possibility of saving the game. Obviously if Rahul and I had carried on, things would have been easier for the team. But once you are given out, you are out, the dejected left-hander told a news channel. 
    
	Asked to comment about his dismissal, the former captain said: I was in a different angle so I could not see it properly. But Im sure the replay must have shown what it was.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Surya set to retain title
                                                   Surya set to retain title
                      
	Chennai: Thirteen-year-old Vidit Santosh Gujrathi obtained his first International Master norm and M.S. Thejkumar of Karnataka his second GM norm in the ninth round of the Velammal 45th National A chess meet.         
	Thejkumar had got his first GM norm at the Commonwealth chess championship two months ago in Delhi.         
	National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly increased his lead to 1.5 points and is likely to retain his title. S.P. Sethuraman lost rather tamely with white pieces against Suryas French defence. Surya played a new move and Sethuraman did not know how to continue. The game was over in the 36th move.         
	Thejkumar was held to a draw by GM Dibyendu Barua in an opposite colour bishop ending in 46 moves. Thejkumar remained undefeated so far.         
	M.R. Venkatesh outwitted K. Rathnakaran of Kerala with dynamic play on both sides of the chess board. After his knights and bishops had laid the foundation for an active position, he won utilising his rooks and queens imaginatively.         
	Abhijit Kunte was held to a draw by Kerala GM G.N. Gopal in 16 moves. Indias youngest GM, Parimarjan Negi from Delhi was unable to get more than a draw against T. Bandyopadhyay.

	New Delhi: Bob Houghton is all set to continue as the national football coach till Asian Cup final rounds in Doha in 2011.         
	According to sources, the finance committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), which had been asked to review the British coachs contract, has also approved a salary hike for Houghton.         
	The 61-year-old is likely to sign the contract in the next few days.         
	Sources said that though Houghtons three-year contract with the AIFF was to end next June, he insisted for a renewal before he could start preparing for the Asian Cup final rounds.         
	The finance committee, which is headed by the AIFF vice-president Praful Patel, is believed to have given the coach a salary hike of around 50 per cent, the sources added.

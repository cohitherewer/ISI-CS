	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne on Saturday described as huge loss the non-availability of opener Graeme Smith for Sundays Indian Premier League summit clash owing to a hamstring injury.         
	Its unfortunate Graeme Smith has got injured. Its a huge loss for us. Hes been in good form and one of the reasons for us being in the final. Hes formed a successful opening combination with Swapnil Asnodkar, the leg spin legend said ahead of the tie.         
	We have not yet decided who will open the innings on Sunday. We expect that person (either Kamran Akmal or Younis Khan) to step on to the plate and do well, he said.         
	Warne said his boys had always focused on their strengths rather than the oppositions and thus were not concerned who would line up against them at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to fight for the top prize of $1.2 million.         
	Both Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab are excellent teams and whoever comes through will give us a tough fight. We dont believe in focusing on the opposition and prefer to focus on our strengths.         
	If we play like we have done so far in the tournament, including against Delhi DareDevils) on Friday then the result will be in our favour, said the former Australia Test and ODI player.         
	Warne said the support he and his team got from the Mumbai crowd on Friday night against Virender Sehwags Delhi was fantastic and probably had something to do with the fact that Sachin Tendulkar is his close friend.         
	The support we got was fantastic. It was a wonderful feeling that the crowd was behind us. Yes, Sachin is a very good friend of mine and this is Mumbai. I hope the crowd would continue to support us, he said.         
	Warne said that the wicket at DY Patil would favour the pacers more than the track he encountered at the Wankhede in the semi-final.         
	The wicket on Friday helped spinners a lot. The ball was turning square. But the wicket at the DY Patil has helped seamers more. (PTI)

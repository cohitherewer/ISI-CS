                                                   Becks closer to 100th cap
            HENRY WINTER                                      David Beckham       
	Fabio Capello has been convinced that David Beckham is fit enough to return to the England fold, and will now decide whether the LA Galaxy midfielders form is good enough to justify inclusion in the 30-man squad to be announced on Thursday for next weeks friendly with France in Paris.         
	Gabriel Agbonlahor, Aston Villas exciting striker, is expected to make his senior debut after being omitted from the England Under-21 squad named on Tuesday.         
	Capellos general manager, Franco Baldini, watched Beckham complete 90 minutes in Dallas at the weekend and the England camp has been reassured by the LA manager, Ruud Gullit, that Beckhams stamina levels are fine.         
	Yet Capello must decide whether the competition Beckham faces in America is any real preparation for the rigours of international combat, particularly against opponents as good as French left-backs like Patrice Evra in Paris on March 26.         
	Englands head coach must also weigh up whether he would upset members of the squad by recalling the former captain, particularly in the light of the promising display by David Bentley in Capellos first game, the victory over Switzerland.         
	Capello recently promised England supporters that Beckham would receive his 100th cap, depending on form and fitness.         
	The ideal opportunity for an emotional farewell for Beckham would be the May friendly with the United States at Wembley, although Capello insists he will not be handing out caps for sentimental reasons.         
	Beckham must be fit and in form.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

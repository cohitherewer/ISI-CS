The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Emotions wont get the better of team: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Emotions wont get the better of team: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a practice session in Nagpur on Wednesday                           
	Nagpur: The media and the fans might think there is a huge difference between being a stand-in captain and a permanent one. Not Mahendra Singh Dhoni. But then, he has been the skipper of the one-day International side for quite some time now and was expected to take over from Anil Kumble, whenever he hung up his boots. Dhoni displayed the nonchalance which his batting shows, when he spoke to the media on the eve of the series deciding fourth Test.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q You have been the stand-in captain before and now you have become a permanent one. What difference does it make?         
	A No difference to me. Whether one Test or a full series, it is of not much difference to me.         
	Who will open the batting?         
	Right now, M. Vijay will open.         
	Was Dravid considered as an option for opening?         
	We looked at the options we have and have gone for the best available option. It is a tentative thing. We can have a last-minute change. But as of now, Vijay will open the innings.         
	Wont it be putting pressure on a debutant to open the innings in a crucial match?         
	Seniors will have a chat with him but we will not put him under any sort of pressure by talking about what his responsibilities are. We will ask him to play his normal game. Whenever one makes his debut, now or later, international cricket is tough. The opposition will try to put pressure. He has done well for India A and also in domestic cricket. It was the same with Amit Mishra in Mohali.         
	How much will the team miss Gautam Gambhir?         
	He has been the man in form. So far our openers have provided us with good starts which we have capitalised on and set up big scores. But you cant keep thinking about it. We have confidence in Vijay.         
	Have you had a look at the new wicket?         
	It looks very much a regular Indian track. There is no grass on it and looks very dry. It is not going to help fast bowlers much but may assist reverse swing when the ball gets old. So the fast bowlers might come in to play later.         
	How crucial will reverse swing be?         
	Very crucial. In all the three Tests we have played, the new ball has not swung much. But we have looked after the ball very well which has helped us get the reverse swing going. Thats one area we have been consistently good at.         
	Given the emotions involved, because of Kumble and Ganguly retiring and Laxmans 100th Test, will it be a problem for the team to keep the focus on the game?         
	There are always positives to everything. Laxman is playing his 100th match, the positive side of that is that he has played 99 matches. The same way, Sourav Ganguly brings in loads of experience. For the team, it is all the same, there is no distraction. Zeroing in wont be a problem.

After being 0-2 down at the breather, Pakistan made a spirited fightback to take a 3-2 lead three minutes from the final hooter but failed to stop Lee Yong Kuk of South Korea to convert a penalty corner in the last minute.

	PCB stand  Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday ruled out allowing its players to take part in next year rsquo;s Indian Premier League if it clashes with their rescheduled home series against Australia. ldquo;We don rsquo;t see any confrontation with the players over the clash of dates of the IPL with the Australian tour. International commitments take precedence over the domestic tournaments, rdquo; PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said.

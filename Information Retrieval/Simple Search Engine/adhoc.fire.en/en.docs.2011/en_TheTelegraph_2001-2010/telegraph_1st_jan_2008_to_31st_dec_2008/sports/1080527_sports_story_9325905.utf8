The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City gears up for tryst with Kahn
                                                                                                                                                                                                     City gears up for tryst with Kahn
            JAYDEEP BASU                                Oliver Kahn with trainees during a football clinic for children at   the CC amp;FC on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh    
	Calcutta: You simply cannot take the passion out of Oliver Kahn.         
	Whether the legendary goalkeeper is doing duty for Germany or for Bayern Munich or playing a friendly with kids in Calcutta, Kahn remains as enthusiastic and keen as ever. And even after decades of football, scoring in the fields of Calcutta still gives him a kick!         
	On Monday, Kahns gusto for the game was once again evident when along with Bayern colleagues, he came down to the CCFC to hold a clinic for budding talent. While most of his teammates strolled around, the superstar was in no mood to take things lightly.         
	When Kahn was finally asked to play an eight-minute tie with kids, he was so keen to get to the ball that he kept shouting. When a mispass occurred, the legendary goalie simply shook his head in disgust.         
	The photojournalists, however, got Kahns most candid and quite possibly the best expression when the German threw his hands in the air after scoring.         
	For the young boys, it was such a delightful experience to see the three-time Fifa World Goalkeeper of the Year in such spirit. If Kahn was so serious with even the kids, Mohun Bagan beware. Bayern Munich play the green and maroons at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday in what will be his farewell game.         
	The Germans holiday mood is hardly going to hamper the enthusiasm of the city fans though. If the demand for tickets is any indication, a full house awaits the Bavarians on Tuesday.         
	The very fact that one of worlds greatest ever goalkeepers would play his last match in a country that stands 151st in the Fifa rankings is enough reason to be there hours before the match kicks off.         
	The mood in the Mohun Bagan camp, however, is that of desperation. With a depleted side, coach Satyajit Chatterjee is apprehensive of an embarrassing defeat. The former international midfielder, however, is putting up a brave front.         
	This is a match we should play mainly through the mind. We cannot match them in skill. After all, they have some of worlds best footballers. We have to run, chase and stop them in the midfield.         
	But who is going to bell the cat remains the unanswered question. From Indian footballs point of view, the match has been scheduled at the wrong time. Unlike in Europe, Indian clubs turn into disjointed units at the end of the season. Caught in the off-season, Mohun Bagan have lost some of their key players to the national team.         
	They were distinctly lucky to get permission from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to use players registered with the Jharkhand Football Association for the exhibition tie.         
	The move, however, hasnt made the green and maroon side any richer. With a bunch of highly inexperienced players such as Anand Vasan, Rahul Kumar or Henry in their ranks, it would be too much to expect the boys to match the skill of an Oliver Kahn, Mark van Bommel or Ze Roberto.         
	To the average fan, it doesnt matter really. All that he is interested in is seeing Oliver Kahn walk out of the tunnel for the last time. And if he is really lucky, watch the legendary custodian fetch the ball from the nylons after a Mohun Bagan player has put it beyond his reach.         
	Without Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Barreto it may remain just a dream. But the Habiburs, Lalkamals and their likes have already started dreaming.         
	Each side will be allowed to make six substitutions.

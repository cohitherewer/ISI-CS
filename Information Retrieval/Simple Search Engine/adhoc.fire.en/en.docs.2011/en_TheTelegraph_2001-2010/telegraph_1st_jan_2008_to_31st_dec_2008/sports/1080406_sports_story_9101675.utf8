The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal to meet Davydenko 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal to meet Davydenko 
                  Rafael Nadal after his semi-final win on Friday                     
	Miami: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will face fourth-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko in the Sony Ericsson Open final after semi-final victories on Friday.         
	The Spaniard, who reeled off the last 12 points of the match, beat Czech Tomas Berdych 7-6, 6-2 in windy conditions, while Davydenko beat Andy Roddick of the US by the same scoreline.         
	Roddick looked a shade of the player who beat world No. 1 Roger Federer on Thursday and gave Davydenko his first victory in their six career matches.         
	Nadal holds a 2-0 record against Davydenko in their career meetings. For me (its) going to be very important because to play a final in a Masters Series event, up against the big players, I know I need to play at my best level, Nadal said. He took 70 minutes to snatch a close-fought opening set, winning the tie-break 8-6 on his seventh set point after 10th seed Berdych double-faulted for the first time.         
	The second seed then breezed through the next set.         
	I think I am playing this tournament very well and today was a great match too, said Nadal. The first set was tough, especially at the end, because I had a lot of chances.         
	The beginning of the set was very important. I had to be very concentrated with my serve because it was very tough in the wind.         
	Roddick and Davydenko produced a high quality first set, but the Russian was the only player able to maintain the intensity in the second.         
	Roddick took a 2-1 advantage with a service break in the second set, but surrendered the advantage in the next game when he dropped serve.         
	Davydenko broke again, on his fourth opportunity, with a forehand crosscourt in the sixth game and sealed victory in the eighth when a Roddick forehand dropped into the net. Thats probably the best hes played against me, and I think probably the thing you normally dont see about him is the way he served, said Roddick.         
	To not play your best early on and get through matches and then have a win like I did over Roger was big for me.

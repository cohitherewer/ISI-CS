The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee puts in extra effort
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Brett Lee puts in extra effort
                      
	New Delhi: Told by captain Ricky Ponting to crank up the same searing pace which made him one of the most lethal bowlers around, beleaguered Australian speedster Brett Lee turned up at the Kotla Friday to get a hang of the ground which hosts the third Test against India from October 29.         
	Lee has been off-colour in the series, so much so that captain Ricky Ponting preferred change bowler Mitchell Johnson, debutant Peter Siddle and rookie spinner Cameron White over him in the morning session on day four of the Mohali Test, which led to a public argument between the captain and his pace spearhead.         
	Lee spent a couple of hours at the Kotla during which he rolled his arms in the nets before leaving the ground without any interaction with anyone.         
	The pressure is mounting on Lee after Ponting said that the pacer would have to be at his fiery best if the visitors, trailing the four-match series 0-1, are to bounce back.         
	Because hes been a bit underdone hes been bowling a bit at half-and three-quarter pace at training, concentrating on his technique trying to do everything right, Ponting told an Australian daily.         
	While his teammates were relaxing in the comfort of their hotel rooms, Lee headed for Kotla to get a hang of things.         
	Meanwhile, Stuart Clark will take a fitness test on Saturday to determine whether he will play in the New Delhi Test and stay with the Australian squad or return home. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied third 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied third 
                      
	Belfry: Jeev Milkha Singh kept himself in contention at the British Masters with yet another solid show, carding a three-under 69 in the weather-interrupted penultimate round here.         
	The seasoned Indian pro, who completed his final two holes on Sunday after being left stranded at the 16th due to darkness, has a total of seven-under 209 and shares the third spot with Spaniard Gonzalo Fdez-Castano (68).         
	Jeev is just three strokes off the pace of leaders New Zealands Michael Campbell (65) and English Ryder Cup star Lee Westwood (68).         
	In a roller-coaster front nine, Jeev hit a birdie on the third, stumbled to a bogey on the fourth but made amends with a birdie on the fifth.         
	A bogey-birdie to his first nine holes meant that Jeev started his backward journey one-under.         
	The other nine turned out to be a flawless affair and Jeev picked up birdies on the 14th and 17th to round off another steady show.         
	In contrast, it was a horrendous day for the other Indian in fray, Shiv Kapur, who returned a six-over 78 to slide to the tied 56th spot with a total of five-over 221.         
	The 10th tee starter, managed just two birdies against two double bogeys and four bogeys. (PTI)

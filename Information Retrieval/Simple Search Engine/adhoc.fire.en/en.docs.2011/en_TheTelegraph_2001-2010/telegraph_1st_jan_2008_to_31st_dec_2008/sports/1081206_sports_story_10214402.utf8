The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACC urges India to tour Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ACC urges India to tour Pakistan
                      
	Karachi: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has urged India to go ahead with its tour of Pakistan next year, saying that cancelling the series would be disastrous for the game in the sub-continent.         
	The ACC, which met in Colombo on Thursday, also scrapped the Asian Test Championship claiming that it was a loss-making exercise.         
	ACC chief executive Syed Ashraful Haque said the council wants to see India touring Pakistan but admitted that it cant get involved in the issue as it was a matter between the two governments.         
	The uncertainty surrounding Indias tour to Pakistan is a matter of great concern for ACC, Haque told a television channel.         
	But the ACC is helpless as the matter is not in hands of cricket boards, it is to be decided by both governments. As far as we know, both boards are willing to play the series, Haque said.         
	He said security situation was same everywhere in the world and political policies should not be allowed to spoil the game.         
	The India and Pakistan series is awaited by everyone not only in the subcontinent but everyone who likes to watch the game of cricket, he said.         
	The ACC was holding its finance and development committee meeting on Friday in which the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt will be elected president.         
	Although the Pakistan and Indian cricket chiefs are in Colombo for the meeting, Butt said that due to prevailing political tensions between the two countries no talks on Indias tour have been scheduled. The discussions would be held in Chennai on December 12 when he goes there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bravo, Sarwan defy Lanka 
                                                   Bravo, Sarwan defy Lanka 
                      
	Georgetown: West Indies were 170 for two at lunch on the final day of the first Test chasing 437 for victory after some fine batting by Dwayne Bravo and Ramnaresh Sarwan.         
	Sarwan continued his form from the first innings, by adding an unbeaten 51 from 138 balls on Wednes- day.         
	Marlon Samuels reached the break on nine after joining Sarwan to try to keep West Indies hopes alive.         
	The only casualty of the first session was Dwayne Bravo, West Indies stand-in opener for out-of-form Chris Gayle, who was caught and bowled by Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Bravo scored 83, hitting 10 fours and a six, after resuming on 46 not out at the start of play.           (REUTERS)

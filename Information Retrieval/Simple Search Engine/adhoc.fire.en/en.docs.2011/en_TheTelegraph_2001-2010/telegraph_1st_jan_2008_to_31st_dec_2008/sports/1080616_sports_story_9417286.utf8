            A STAFF REPORTER            Nayeem                           
	Calcutta: Former India coach and captain Syed Nayeemuddin has called for the ouster of Bob Houghton following Indias 0-1 loss to Maldives in the SAFF Cup final in Colombo.         
	Nayeem, under whom India last claimed the title in Karachi beating Bangladesh 2-0, felt Houghton has simply wasted the amount of time and money that the All India Football Federation has conferred on him.         
	Houghton has simply failed in his task, Nayeem said on Sunday.         
	In spite of getting so much money, such a cushy contract and infrastructural help by way of five-star accommodation and the works, what have we got in return? the Dronacharya award winner asked.         
	The boys lacked motivation and were totally despirited. The coach has failed to inspire them , he fumed.         
	Nayeemuddin, who is among the very few coaches in India to boast of an AFC Professional Licence, said he is ready to take up the job if offered to him.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jyoti Randhawa in the lead 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jyoti Randhawa took a two-stroke lead over Gaganjeet Bhullar and Shamim Khan to emerge as the leader after the third round of the DLF Masters 2008 on Saturday.         
	Randhawas total now stands at seven-under 209 after his round of three-under 69. Arjun Singh ended the day at fourth place at three-under 213.         
	Randhawa (72, 68, 69) shot into the lead on the third day despite a shaky start. He dropped a couple of strokes after making bogeys on the first and fourth. However, he fought back with a birdie on the sixth and eagle-birdie-birdie on the ninth, 10th, 11th. The reigning Indian Open champion then made pars all the way till the 18th.         
	Randhawa said: I didnt play as well as yesterday (Friday) but still managed a round of three-under. I think I was not focusing well at the start of my round but then seemed to get my focus back from the sixth hole onwards. I guess its better to manage a bad round than fall on a good one. A two-shot lead is a good cushion heading into the final round.         
	Khan (72, 70, 69) also shot 69 to record the best round of the day along with Randhawa. He finished the day in tied second place along with Gaganjeet Bhullar at five-under 211.         
	Shamim Khan made birdies on the second, sixth, eighth, ninth, 15th, 18th and dropped bogeys on the seventh, 12th and 13th.         
	Bhullar fired his second consecutive 72 to end the day in tied second. He birdied the sixth, 10th, 18th, made bogey on the 13th and double bogeyed the 17th.

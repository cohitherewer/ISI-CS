	New Delhi: Ace marksman Gagan Narang has underlined the fact that he missed an Olympic medal just by sheer bad luck, as he once again shot a perfect score  this time in the ongoing German League.         
	Narang, who had missed the finals of Beijing Olympics by a whisker, scored a perfect 400/400 in the 10 rifle event in Bundesliga Sunday.         
	He had earlier this month set a world record of 600/600 in the World Cup finals at Bangkok, Thailand.         
	I feel happy to shoot perfect scores of 600 and 400, said Narang.         
	His team manager Knut Boettig said it was the first time that an international shooter had fired a perfect score in the League. (agencies)

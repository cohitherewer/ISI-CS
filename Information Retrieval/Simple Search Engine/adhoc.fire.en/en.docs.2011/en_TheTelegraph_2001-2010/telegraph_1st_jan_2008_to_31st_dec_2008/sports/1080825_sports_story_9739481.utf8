The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injuries worry both teams
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Injuries worry both teams
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sunil Chhetri                                 
	Calcutta: After a brief hiatus, the Sahara CFL Premier Division returns with East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting locking horns on Monday in a crucial re-match at the Salt Lake Stadium. The tie between the two sides was washed out last week.         
	Both Manoranjan Bhattacharjee and Shabbir Ali seemed to have their plates full with injury problems. Speaking after their practice session on Sunday, the East Bengal coach said his focus was much more on the I-League.         
	He said: The local league is not out of our reach, so its important to win every match. Also it is important for us to win tomorrow (Monday) to honour the sentiments of our fans.         
	Manoranjan claimed that lack of motivation would not be a problem for his side. But he must be worried with the left-back position, as Soumik Dey has been ruled out. The red-and-gold brigade will still miss the services of Dharamjit Singh, Mehtab Hossain, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Sanju Pradhan and Surkumar Singh due to injury.         
	Injury woes have befallen Shabbir Alis side, too. Sheikh Azim and Francis Nova are likely to miss out. Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday missed practice because of personal reasons.         
	The half-hour that was played last week before the heavens opened, saw enterprising football from both sides. All eyes would be again on the striking duo of Sunday-Okoro and Sunil Chhetri-Ashim. Mohammedan Sporting have announced an incentive of one lakh rupees if they win.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sbragia named Sunderland manager
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sbragia named Sunderland manager

	Sunderland have appointed Ricky Sbragia as permanent manager after his successful spell as caretaker. The 52-year-old has been handed an 18-month contract by chairman Niall Quinn as reward for his four games in charge as caretaker, which have brought two victories, a draw and a single defeat, and that away to Manchester United.         
	Sbragia succeeds Roy Keane, who resigned earlier this month, after 27 months, in the belief he had taken the club as far as he could. Ricky Sbragia is a thoroughly professional football person, said Quinn. We have been taken aback by how easily he has slotted into the managerial role and are really heartened by his intelligent approach in dealing with the players and the day-to-day rigours of the job.         
	Ricky took up the reins when we were at a low ebb and has without doubt revitalised the club. He is the unanimous choice of the executive board and will receive every support in his new role.         
	I am sure all our fans, and the players too, will give Ricky their full backing in his first senior management position.         
	Ahead of Sunderlands match against Everton on Sunday, Sbragia released a statement on the clubs website in which he said: Im delighted to have been offered the opportunity to manage a club as big as Sunderland, and am relishing the challenge ahead.         
	My main priority is moving up the Premier League table and ensuring we have unity and stability at the club. Ive been extremely pleased by the commitment shown by the players to date and the support we have all received from the fans.

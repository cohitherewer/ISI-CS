The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ghei struggles, Lahiri tied 16th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ghei struggles, Lahiri tied 16th
                      
	Koh Samui (Thailand): Gaurav Ghei found the going tough at the Santiburi Samui course, stuttering to a four over 75 even as Anirban Lahiri carded a two-under 69 to be tied 16th after the opening round of the $ 300,000 Bangkok Airways Open.         
	Gheis return to action after missing the cut at Beijing Open last month was disastrous at best, as he is tied for the 78th spot and in danger of missing the weekend action yet again.         
	Meanwhile, after Lahiri, Arjun Singh and Rahil Gangjees identical cards of one-under 70 were the next best among the Indians and had the duo tied for the 29th position.         
	Further down, Amandeep Johl grabbed a share of the 42nd spot after turning in an even-par 71.         
	In the bottom-half of the leader board, Gaganjeet Bhullar was tied 91st after carding 77. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pressure on PCB to change stance
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pressure on PCB to change stance
                      
	Karachi: The PCB and its players may insist that they have no problems playing in India despite the growing tensions between the two countries after the Mumbai terror strikes, but pressure is building up on the board to change its soft stance on cricketing ties.         
	There has been a huge public response to the suggestion by former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif that Pakistani players must boycott the IPL and ICL events to protest the Indian allegation of use of Pakistan territory in the Mumbai attacks.         
	PCB sources admitted there was now a feeling that if India refuse to tour Pakistan early next year, the board should rethink its strategy of allowing players to play in India.         
	There is a pressure group building up in the cricket circles with the support of some fundamentalist political parties who believe there is no need for the PCB to insist on having cricket ties with India after the way the Indian media and authorities have blamed Pakistan for the Mumbai attacks,a source said.         
	There is pressure that if the Indian government does not send its national team to Pakistan because of the Mumbai attacks then Pakistan should also not allow the Sialkot Stallions or other players to play in the Indian Premier League, the source said.         
	The source said since the board does not recognise the unofficial ICL, it had no say in that matter, but unofficially they could pressurise the players not to go to India.         
	The growing feeling is that Pakistan need to adopt a aggressive posture since Indian media is highlighting the fact that some of the Indian players also do not want to play in Pakistan, the source said.         
	He said the board officials had already been told that they should stop their players from giving out statements about wanting to play in India and about insisting on India touring Pakistan.

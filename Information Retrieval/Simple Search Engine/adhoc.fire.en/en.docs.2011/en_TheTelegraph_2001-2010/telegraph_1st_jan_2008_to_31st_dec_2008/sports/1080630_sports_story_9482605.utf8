The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra soars to lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chopra soars to lead
                      
	Grand Blanc (US): Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra set himself up for a second PGA tour title this year, grabbing a two-stroke lead with a four-under 68 in the penultimate round of $5 million Buick Open here.         
	Chopra, who was tied second overnight, closed the round with a total of 16-under 200, two strokes ahead of American trio of Dudley Hart (70), Bubba Watson (68) and Woody Austin (69).         
	Its been great. Today I was fairly surprised that the scores didnt run away.         
	I got up to 16 and that kept me with a two-shot lead. I dont know how. I cant explain it, said Chopra, who won the season opening Mercedes Benz championship earlier this year.         
	A bogey on the first may not have been the ideal start, but Chopra made sure that there were no further lapses as he reeled off birdies on the second, sixth, seventh, 10th and 18th holes to round off yet another phenomenal performance.

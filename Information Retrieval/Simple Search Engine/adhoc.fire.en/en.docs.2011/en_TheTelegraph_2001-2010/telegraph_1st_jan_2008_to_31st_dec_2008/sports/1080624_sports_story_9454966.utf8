The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont write off Federer, says Becker
                                                                                                                                                                                             Dont write off Federer, says Becker
                  Boris Becker                     
	London: Triple Wimbledon champion Boris Becker believes fellow All England Club legend Bjorn Borg is wrong to write off Roger Federers chances of a record sixth successive title here.         
	Borg has hinted that world number two Rafael Nadal, who demolished Federer to win a fourth successive French Open trophy, is poised to dethrone the Swiss great and become the first Spanish mens champion since 1966.         
	I was surprised to hear Bjorn Borg say Roger Federer was not his favourite to win Wimbledon this year, because in my mind it is very tough to go against a five-time champion, Becker told in his column in The Daily Telegraph.         
	It might be true that the competition is closer  Rafael Nadal has clearly improved greatly on grass, while Novak Djokovic is the third player in the group  but I feel that with the history Roger has at Wimbledon, you dont bet against him in the same way that you dont bet against Nadal on clay.         
	Becker refused to believe that Federer, who won just four games in his stunning Roland Garros defeat to Nadal, will be damaged by the loss.         
	I dont believe it can have affected him psychologically. He always arrives at that tournament knowing that, on clay, Nadal is a little bit better, so I dont imagine mentally he is really hurt by it, said the German.         
	As we have seen, Federer went to Halle to adapt to the grass and he won convincingly  not losing his serve once  so how can you argue with that? If anything, I think that he is more motivated this year because he knows that if he doesnt win Wimbledon, his No. 1 ranking is at stake.         
	Djokovic won the Australian Open, Nadal won the French, so in order for him to be recognised as the top player at the end of the year, Federer needs to win Wimbledon. That will be very much in his mind.         
	Becker also said that the world No. 1 needs to re-focus on his strength.         
	He needs to re-focus on what has made him No. 1 for so many years: winning Wimbledon. He also sees the Olympics as a priority, winning a gold medal for Switzerland. That could take up some of his time in the build-up to the US Open, encouraging the competition again, but at this point I think that he is still ahead, Becker said.         
	The former-Wimbledon champion was also ready to give credit to the Spaniard.         
	 You have to give Nadal credit: he keeps coming to Wimbledon after the perfect clay-court season and pushing Federer to his limits. Nadal is going to be playing better on grass and on hard courts in the second half of this season, so Roger needs to consider carefully what made him so good because Rafa is knocking very loudly on his door, he said.

                                                   Im lost for words: Kumble
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India on Tuesday felicitated one of its dearest sons, Anil Kumble, for taking 600 wickets, at a warm and overwhelming gathering at the Taj Coromandel.         
	The Team India Test captain, who was accompanied by his family, was presented with a trophy studded with 1500 Belgium diamonds by president Sharad Pawar.         
	Speaking on the occasion, Kumble admitted to being overcome by emotions and lost for words. He said he was merely carrying on the baton from Indias legends of spin bowling.         
	He asked youngsters to enjoy the physical and mental aspects of the game to sustain their zeal and passion. Kumble thanked fellow players who have played a role in his long career  starting with his first captain and coach Mohammed Azharuddin and Bishan Singh Bedi, respectively.         
	He also did not forget to mention Kapil Dev and his first roommate, Ravi Shastri, who has been a constant source of inspiration.         
	To play alongside legends like Sachin Tendulkar has been a cherished memory for him along with taking his 600th wicket as captain for a winning cause.         
	He thanked Pawar for backing the team during the recent controversy in Australia.         
	He rounded off by saying: With so much Test cricket coming up, I hope well assemble again shortly to celebrate 700 wickets.         
	Shastri hailed Kumbles fighting spirit and commitment.         
	Hes a competitor to the core. Hes achieved what other only dream of, and yet hes so humble! If I am asked to choose three model cricketers, Kumble will be on top of the list, he said.         
	Several former captains were present along with the South African team at the hour-long function.         
	The BCCI obviously needs to keep in mind that they will require a much bigger banquet than the one booked for this evening for a function of this stature.         
	Some of the special invitees didnt even get a place to seat. Vijay Mallya left after arriving a little late. He made another appearance in the closing stages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bose puts Bengal in drivers seat
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bose puts Bengal in drivers seat
            G. RAJARAMAN            Ranadeb Bose in action at the Karnail Singh Stadium in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: Ranadeb Bose made intelligent use of the little puff of wind that blew across the Karnail Singh Stadium on Friday afternoon to claim five wickets in an eight-over spell with the new ball to put Bengal in the drivers seat in their Ranji Trophy Plate Division semi-final against Goa here.         
	Bose helped Bengal overcome the early fall of Sourav Ganguly on resumption on Friday morning and post a first innings score of 337. The six-foot two inch tall giant of the Bengal attack got down to business by trapping Sagun Kamat with the third delivery of the innings to ensure that the two dressing rooms presented a study in contrast at the lunch break itself.         
	With Sourav constantly goading the bowlers from his position at mid-on, Bose struck again as soon as play resumed, castling the dangerous Goa captain Swapnil Asnodkar. Less than half an hour later, the experienced J. Arun Kumar, the stodgy Advait Katkar and Ajay Ratra were back in the hut as well. Bose had bowled but six and a half overs and Goa were brought to their knees at 31 for five.         
	Goa fought back to be 95 for five when play was called off due to bad light 20 minutes after the tea break. As many as 28 overs remained to be bowled for the day but Bengal would be happy to come back on Saturday with their fast bowlers fresh and eager to break the enterprising 61-run sixth-wicket stand between Aniket Dessai and Ryan Ninan.         
	It did not seem to matter to Bose that he had spent a good part of an hour and a quarter at the crease, sharing an effective partnership with Sourav Sarkar (60, 119 minutes, 98 balls, eight fours, one six). Ashok Dinda generated pace and some bounce and Bose was quite charged up, using the gentle breeze to his advantage.         
	Earlier, Sourav was unable to continue the good work from last evening and fell to the second delivery of the day, edging a drive off Harshad Gadekar. Ritam Kundu followed suit and became Saurabh Bandekars fifth victim. But when Dibyendu Chakarabarty fell for 82 and Dinda was dismissed for two, Bengal would have been happy to pass the 300-run mark.         
	But a gritty last-wicket partnership between Sarkar and Bose delayed the end of the innings by as much as an hour and a quarter. Sarkar played some delectable cover drives and flicks, combining his aggression with nip and tuck batting, to ensure that Bengal would finish with a respectable total.         
	By all accounts, Bengal will be happy to bowl Goa out and bat again, consolidating their lead and shutting the door on Elite Division dreams that the team from the West Coast have nursed.

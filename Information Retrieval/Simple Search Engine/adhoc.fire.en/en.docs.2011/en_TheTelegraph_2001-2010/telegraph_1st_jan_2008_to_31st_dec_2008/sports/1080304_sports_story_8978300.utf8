	Bangalore: Austrian Sybille Bammer rallied to beat Japans Akiko Morigami 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a tense first-round match of the Sony Ericsson Bangalore Open tennis tournament Monday. 
    
	In another first round singles, Aiko Nakamura of Japan dropped the first set tie-break but fought gallantly to beat Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2. 
    
	Nakamura runs into fourth seeded Patty Schnyder of Switzerland in the second round, while Bammer awaits the winner of the match between Anatasia Rodionova of Russia and a qualifier. 
    
	Top seeded Jelena Jankovic, who will be seen in action Tuesday, had an unforgettable incident at the courts. She was allotted one of the three courts for practice. As she was practising, fourth seeded Schnyder of Switzerland and her compatriot Emmnuelle Gagliardi requested for practice court as they had their doubles match later in the evening. Jankovic was asked to practice at court three but the match which was scheduled at court one was shifted to court three. 
    
	A disturbed Jankovic lost her cool and yelled at the support staff. Meanwhile, she was escorted to the lounge where Vijay Amritraj chipped in to resolve the issue. 
    
	Later, Jankovic had her practice for 80 minutes on the centre court. In the final qualifying event, US-based Indian Sunitha Rao went down 2-6, 1-6 to Tiantian Sun of China.

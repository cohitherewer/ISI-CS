The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trescothick reveals all
                                                                                                                                                                                             Trescothick reveals all
    - Former batsman talks about depression that has plagued him since childhood           Alison Kervin            Marcus Trescothick                                 
	He exuded such confidence as he went striding out on to the field; blue eyes focused, shoulders back. His game was relaxed and controlled, his shots combining elegance and effectiveness to make him one of the finest batsmen of his generation: eleventh on the all-time list of Englands leading exponents with the bat. By the time he was 24, he was being heralded as the nations new cricketing star.         
	But even as Marcus Trescothick held his bat aloft after every century, absorbing the praise of a grateful nation, the man sheltering nervously within the powerful cricketer was in agony  tortured by a depression that gripped him with such fury and intensity that it robbed him of his power to think rationally, behave logically or even keep himself safe.         
	No one knew, he says, sitting back into his chair and recalling those days when his illness was a deeply held secret. I guess I never told anyone about the pain I was going through because I didnt understand it myself. It made no sense to me that I felt so bad. How could I explain something I couldnt understand?         
	So, he continued to dazzle us with his play, while inside the depression clawed away, reducing him to a trembling wreck  relying on sleeping tablets to get him through the nights, and the distractions of cricket to get him through the day. I could always play, he says. Even when the depression was at its worst, Id get out on to the field and play. The trouble is, Id come off the field and collapse.         
	This was not a case of him feeling a little bit low, or under the weather. Trescothicks depression left him cowering, mumbling and sobbing in the corner of a shop at Heathrow, too terrified to get on a plane; desperate not to have to leave his family behind. It left him in tears in the changing room after matches, and then, at his lowest, filled with suicidal thoughts as he lay trembling and shaking on the floor of his mothers house having had to return early from tour in 2006.         
	There were times when I didnt know how I was going to go on. I didnt know how I was going to come through the pain. Getting through the night seemed so difficult; getting through the rest of my life, impossible.         
	Trescothick got through by telling people about his problem; admitting what he feared people would consider a weakness helped him talk through his anguish and fears. His depression forced him to retire from international cricket aged 32, after 76 Tests, but he is a survivor in every sense of the word  hes kept his family together, his marriage is strong and he still plays cricket for Somerset. Im one of the lucky ones, he concedes. I spoke out and got help before it got too late.         
	He has catalogued the story of a lifetime struggling under the black wings of depression in a searingly honest book. He says he never set out to create a self-help book, or to be someone to whom others could reach out for help but, inadvertently or not, thats what hes done. The book is a stark reminder of how much we expect from sportsmen, how much we expect them to perform for us and, perhaps, how little we know about the pains, insecurities and horrors they face when fans leave the stadium and the floodlights dim.         
	It is no surprise that charities helping those with depression have been in touch with him and proposed that he work with them. Fund-raising, a centre for sportsmen suffering from depression, talks and visits have all been mooted. Its something Im seriously considering, he says. His mail box has been bursting at the seams since he revealed that he suffers from depression.         
	Some of them are just pleased that there is someone else out there with the same condition as them. They dont feel so alone.         
	The response to Trescothicks illness from within the sport has been overwhelmingly positive. He feared theyd think him weak. Hes eager to point out that its an illness, not a weakness. He says that people would understand if he had an illness such as cancer, but they dont understand depression in the same way.         
	He gets asked a lot of questions  most of them springing from blind naivety about his condition. Questions like  why Trescothick? He was fulfilling a boyhood dream. What did someone so talented and admired have to be depressed about? This wasnt a man whose life was skewed by his sport; hed managed to do the important things as well as wield a bat with great distinction. He had formed great friendships, fallen in love, got married and had children. Why him?         
	People ask that  but they wouldnt say why him if I had a brain tumour or cancer. Its just an illness. Its indiscriminate. It doesnt matter how much money youve got or how clever, talented or grounded you appear to be.         
	Today Trescothick plays for Somerset and has his depression under control. He is on medication, has seen counsellors and talks openly about the illness that he believes has been with him since he was a schoolboy.         
	The depressions not over. Im not cured. I have good days and bad days, but when the bad days come, I feel them coming and I know how to act.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

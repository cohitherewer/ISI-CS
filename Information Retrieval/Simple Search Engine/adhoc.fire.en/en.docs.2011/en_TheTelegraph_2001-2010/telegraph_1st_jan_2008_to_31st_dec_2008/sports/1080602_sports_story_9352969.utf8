	 MacGill to retire after 2nd Test  
	Calcutta: Australian leg-spinner Stuart MacGill will retire from international cricket at the end of the ongoing second Test against the West Indies, Cricket Australia said in a statement on Sunday, says A Staff Reporter.  
	MacGill has played 43 Tests for Australia, prior to this Test, and has taken 207 wickets. The 37-year-old suggested that his inability to perform to his best after a wrist injury was the main factor behind the decision.         
	There is no way I will ever walk on to a cricket field unless I can guarantee that I can dismiss top order batsmen consistently, he said in the statement. The prospect of letting myself and the team down is simply not an option. I have worked way too hard for too long to sabotage my achievements by playing Test cricket for the wrong reasons, he added.                 
	Hayden plans to carry on  
	Sydney: Injured Aussie opener Matthew Hayden said on Sunday that he has no intention of retiring from one-day cricket to ensure he plays on to next years Ashes in England.  
	The 36-year-old left-hander returned home from the West Indies tour with an Achilles tendon problem. There has been speculation that Hayden will give up limited-overs cricket to nurse himself through to next years Ashes. I always maintain the best players play all forms of game and that includes T20 cricket. Theres a workload issue that you have to manage on a daily basis but the thing you have to understand is my one-day game drives my Test game as well, Hayden said.                 
	Morgan all praise for IPL  
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has attracted new audiences to the game with its action-packed Twenty20 format and the spectators would embrace Test and one-day cricket as well, hopes International Cricket Council (ICC) president-elect David Morgan. Speaking at the closing ceremony before the commencement of the IPL final on Sunday, Morgan said: The IPL has changed the face of domestic cricket around the world and has provided opportunities for other cricket playing nations (to take it forward).    
	Sachin rsquo;s view  
	New Delhi: Downplaying issues like the Sydney fracas and Harbhajans slapgate controversy, batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar said with so much of attention on cricket these days, things do get blown out of proportion. I know they were very unfortunate. But there were certain things which were blown out of proportion, Sachin said in a TV interview.     
	England squad  
	London: England selectors on Sunday named an unchanged 12-man squad for the final Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge starting on Thursday. England have a 1-0 lead in the series.  
	THE SQUAD         
	Michael Vaughan (Captain), Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Tim Ambrose, Ryan Sidebottom, Stuart Broad, Monty Panesar, James Anderson, Chris Tremlett.

                                                The Debu Mitra factor in Saurashtras success
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal may have failed to stay in the Super League this season, but a former player and coach from the state has worked wonders with Saurashtra. Debu Mitra, who took over as coach in 2004-05, has helped Saurashtra qualify for the Ranji semi-finals with 23 points from seven matches (three wins, four draws).         
	It has been an eventful tenure for Mitra, the guiding force behind Saurashtras ascendancy. After making the Super League from Plate in 2005-06, Saurashtra lived with the fear of relegation last season.         
	Things have changed dramatically this season and they surprised the big guns. More creditable as they have played all their matches away.         
	I always believed they had the talent It was a matter of channelling it in the right direction. That way you can say I have been successful. But there is still a long way to go, Mitra, who was in the city for a few days, told The Telegraph.         
	What has been the secret behind the success?         
	 We beat Bengal in the Moin-ud Dowlah Gold Cup at the start of the season. It gave the boys self-belief and confidence We got down to the basics and worked hard. Theres no one reason for this success. The joint efforts of the players and support staff has played a huge role, Mitra explained.         
	When I took charge I was surprised by their lack of local structure. Every individual gets to play only two/three matches that involve the districts they represent before being thrust into the Ranji fold. There is no concept of club cricket here. It is mainly due to their hard work and the desire to succeed that, he said.         
	Cheteshwar Pujara and Sitanshu Kotak along with pacer Sandeep Jobanputra have been the stars of their campaign. Pujara, a natural opener, has batted down to strengthen the middle-order and has scored 796 runs, the highest by any batsman this season. With 32 wickets, Jobanputra has been their bowling spearhead.         
	Pujara is good and ideal for the longer version of the game. He has the patience, the technique He is also a good fielder. A keen learner, he has the ability to make it big, Mitra pointed out.         
	Has he been surprised by Bengals decline? I feel bad to see their plight Besides playing, I have coached Bengal for seven years, he said.         
	Is he optimistic of Bengal making the Super League next season?         
	Railways were demoted the season after they finished champions. They have been struggling to move up since. There is very little difference between Plate and Elite divisions. It is very tough to move into Super League once youre relegated. That is why I was very worried about Saurashtras plight last season, Mitra said.         
	Asked if he would consider returning to Bengal next season, he evaded a direct reply: Im very well off here.         
	Saurashtra play Uttar Pradesh in the semi-final in Vadodara from Saturday. Will they be able to continue the dream run? Im just keeping fingers crossed. Lets see how it goes

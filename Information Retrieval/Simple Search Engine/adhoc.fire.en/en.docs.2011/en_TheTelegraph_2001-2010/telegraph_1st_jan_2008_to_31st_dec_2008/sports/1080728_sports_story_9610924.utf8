	Moscow: A horrible back-nine crushed Shiv Kapurs hope of a top-10 finish as he carded one under 71 in the fourth round of the Inteco Russian Open to finish tied 23rd here today. The Delhi based golfer ended the tournament with a total of 11 under 277 and finished ten strokes behind the winner, Swedens Mikael Lundberg.         
	Kapur sank four birdies in the frontnine -- fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth -- to remain in contention for a top-10 finish but then three bogeys in the back-nine dented his chances heavily. He dropped shots on 10th, 12th and 16th to share the 23rd spot with four others. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans are mentally stronger
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Germans are mentally stronger
  - If Spain play the way they did against Russia, no team can stop them

	After weeks of gripping action, tears of joy and sadness, we are now eagerly waiting for the summit clash between Germany and Spain to determine the champions. Given Spains current form, I would have called them the favourites but I refuse to take the risk since they have an adversary called Germany in the title round.        
	Before I proceed, I must admit that the semi-final between Spain and Russia came as an eye opener for me. I have been associated with the game for nearly 60 years now  both as a player and a coach. But never before did I see a side operate in such furious pace in so small an area as Spain did that day.        
	The Russians were hardly allowing their opponents any time and space but that failed to deter Spain from playing dozens of passes in quick succession through the jungle of boots in the second half. If Spain can repeat their performance, no team in the world would be able to bear the burnt for 90 minutes.        
	But then Germany have an uncanny knack of rising to the occasion, especially in the final. So far, they havent done anything extraordinary in this tournament and their team is not exactly a highly talented one but they have the ability to make it up through hard work and team combination. Spain, on the other hand, have always been vulnerable in major tournaments.        
	In a close game, from a mental standpoint, it is always extremely difficult to compete with Germany. They have the power to come back and win in any scenario.        
	This time, I am sincerely want Spain to prove their detractors wrong. So far, they have looked the best team, scoring frequently and controlling the pace of the game. While Spain are the masters of short, controlling passes, Germany have a frontline that is capable of scoring any time and more so from set pieces.        
	Sundays clash will feature some big names including Cesc Fabregas, Fernando Torres, Micheal Ballack, Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Among them, Fabregas will be the most keenly watched since he came up with a fabulous performance in the last match against Russia.                    
	The Arsenal midfielder, I believe, will feature in the starting XI as there is a huge question mark around the fitness of David Villa, who picked up an injury during the Russian duel and is unlikely to play.        
	Interestingly, it was a forced coaching move that allowed Fabregas to make all the differences in the semi-final. Had Villa not got injured in the 34th minute, Spanish coach Luis Aragones would not have thought of putting Fabregas in so early and switch to a 4-5-1 formation. It proved to be a masterstroke.        
	With David Silva, Xavi, Marcos Senna, Fabregas and Andres Iniesta operating out of the midfield, Spain have more versatility, can play to their strengths and are a complete team. They attack with quality and are likely to cause big problems for Germanys back four.        
	Like his Spanish counterpart, Germany coach Joachim Loew has also shifted to a 4-5-1 formation. It was a wise move as it allowed Miroslav Klose to play freely as a lone striker helped by the dangerous combination of Lukas Podolski and Bastian Schweinsteiger on the wings.        
	In the final, behind them will be Michael Ballack, the live wire of the team. Germans can sit back and soak in the pressure and then wait for an opportunity to gain in a breakaway move.        
	After a month of creative soccer, stunning comebacks and upsets, we have been able to solve quite a few riddles on the football pitch. Yet, the final question remains unanswered. On Sunday night, we will know who are going to wear the European crown for the next four years.

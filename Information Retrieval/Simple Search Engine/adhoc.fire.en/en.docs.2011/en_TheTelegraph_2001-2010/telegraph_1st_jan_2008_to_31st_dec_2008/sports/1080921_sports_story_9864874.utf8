The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jaques ready for India test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jaques ready for India test
                      
	Melbourne: Set for a tough tour to India for the first time in his 11-Test old career, Australia opener Phil Jaques says he will not be overawed by the home team spinners coming hard at him on slow and low pitches.         
	Jaques said he was gearing up to adjust to Indian conditions and deal with the crowd there, which, he said, will be completely different from Australia.         
	Ive been to Bangladesh and Pakistan, but Ive never been to India. So Im really looking forward to it. Ive spoken to a few of the players who have been over there and theyve all told me its a really good place to bat, especially if youre at the top of the order, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	There will be a lot of spin, but I wont mind because I played at Northamptonshire, which is conducive to spin, and growing up in Sydney and playing at the SCG will also help.         
	Anticipating a hard-fought series, he said, The Indians know their conditions well. They really came at us last summer and, even though there was niggling here and there, they really gave us a shake.         
	The opener spent some time on Friday, honing his batting skills during a practice match.         
	I was keen to blow out the cobwebs and get some match practice, which is what Ive been able to do, said Jaques, after spending nearly an hour at the crease for the Sydney Gold team in the State Cup.         
	My wife and I went to New York after the West Indies tour, which was great. And Ive been able to enjoy my time at home the past few months, which I havent been able to do the past few years. I feel like the batteries have really been recharged.           (PTI)

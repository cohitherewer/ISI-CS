The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo vows to end title race at Stamford Bridge
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo vows to end title race at Stamford Bridge
  - It will be a tough game but we have a great chance, says United winger                                 John Terry will make   his 350th appearance   for Chelsea                Cristiano Ronaldo is   Uniteds leading scorer   in all competitions        
	London: Cristiano Ronaldo has warned Chelsea that Manchester United are determined to end the Premier League title race by winning their decisive showdown tomorrow.         
	Sir Alex Fergusons league leaders can effectively wrap up their 17th English title by beating second-placed Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.         
	A victory for the reigning champions would open up a six-point gap over Avram Grants team with only two games to play and Uniteds vastly superior goal difference makes it impossible for Chelsea to overhaul them.         
	If United do retain the crown they will owe a huge debt of gratitude to Ronaldo. The Portugal winger has an incredible 28 league goals this season and even his penalty miss against Barcelona in midweek couldnt shake his confidence ahead of the trip to West London.         
	It will be a tough game but we have a great chance as the team is very confident, he said. We do not want to drop any points at Chelsea, so it is important we go for the victory.         
	Even a defeat wouldnt be a disaster for United as they would stay top thanks to their goal difference, but Chelsea deserve credit for keeping up the pressure after trailing by eight points earlier this year.         
	But manager Alex Ferguson could be forgiven for downplaying expectations ahead of the Saturdays match.         
	What we have had to do is get the players recovered from Barcelona, Ferguson said Friday. Weve had the disadvantage of a days less rest than Chelsea and then there is the travelling of course. We will do our best.                   
	When the Blues were beaten 0-2 at Old Trafford in Grants first match back in September, they looked anything but a title contender. Now they have one last chance to make United sweat and Petr Cech is relishing the challenge.         
	Every game now is like a final. Personally I play football to play in the big games and this is an exciting time for everyone, Cech said.         
	The Premier League is getting towards the end and after Saturday we can be neck-and-neck with Manchester United.         
	Of course, United score the most goals in the League  they have got the attacking threat. But we have got a pretty good record at Stamford Bridge, so we hope to keep that going.         
	The death of Frank Lampards mother Pat after a short battle with pneumonia on Thursday cast a shadow over Chelseas preparations. Lampard could be missing but United also have a worry over Nemanja Vidic, who is struggling to recover from a stomach bug.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj Singh needs to be consistent: Dilip
                                                     Yuvraj Singh needs to be consistent: Dilip

	New Delhi: India might have won the tri-series in Australia without much fireworks from Yuvraj Singh, but chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar says the dashing Punjab batsman will have to perform consistently if the team has to reach the top. Vengsarkar said Yuvraj had to blame himself for his failures. I am disappointed as I always had expectations from him. Yuvraj needs to be more consistent. He is a great talent but he has to perform to his potential, said Vengsarkar of the middle-order batsman who scored 202 runs from nine matches in the tri-series.         
	His non performance is something that he has to address himself. He has been in the team for about eight years and if he has not established himself as a Test player he has no one but himself to blame, he said in an interview to a magazine.         
	Vengsarkar was all praise for ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who led the team to the historic win in Australia.         
	Dhoni has really matured as a skipper, he handled the situation very well. Most important, he believes in his players, said Vengsarkar.         
	The former captain, however, refused to comment when asked whether the tri-series victory had strengthened Dhonis claim to Test captaincy. I do not wish to comment on the Test captaincy now. Vengsarkar also supported Dhoni on the frequent changes in batting order as long as the team was winning.         
	I do not think there is any reason to worry over the changed batting order in ODIs. When you deliver your best always, it does not matter when and where you are used. In 50-over or 20-over games, the batting order and selection is on the basis of match situations. In Test matches, a settled batting is essential.

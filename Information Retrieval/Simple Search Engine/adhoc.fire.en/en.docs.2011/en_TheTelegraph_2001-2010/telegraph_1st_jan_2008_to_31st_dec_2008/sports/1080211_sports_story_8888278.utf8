The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | KUDOS FROM SOURAV
                                                KUDOS FROM SOURAV
                            
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, easily the biggest sporting icon of the present times in the city, had this to say about S.S.P. Chowrasias win when contacted by The Telegraph: I dont follow golf very closely, but I am delighted to learn that a Calcuttan distinguished himself in the Indian Open. I am sure Chowrasias success is going to increase the average Calcuttans interest in the sport. He deserves all the kudos coming his way and I would like to add my own heartiest congratulations.

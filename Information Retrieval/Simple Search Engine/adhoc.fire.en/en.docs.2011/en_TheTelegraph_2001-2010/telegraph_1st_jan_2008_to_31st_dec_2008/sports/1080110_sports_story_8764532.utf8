                                                    Sporting beat Bagan

         Sangram Mukherjee failed to intercept Elijah Obagbemiros header 
          
	Margao: A late goal by Elijah Obagbemiro steered Sporting Clube de Goa to a 1-0 victory over Mohun Bagan in the 10th round of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday. 
    
	The all-important goal came in the 85th minute when custodian Sangram Mukherjee failed to intercept a Obagbemiro header. 
    
	A cross from the right off Denzil Franco was headed by substitute Harmanjot Khabra. Though it was well saved by N. S. Manju near the goal line but he could keep it close and Obagbemiro did not let go the opportunity in hand. 
    
	The third successive win took Sportings point tally to 12 points from 10 matches. 
    
	Mohun Bagan played an organised game in the first half but lost plot in the second half to remain on 14 points from as many matches. 
    
	Joseph Pereira of Sporting Clube de Goa got the Man of the Match award. 
    
	Mohun Bagan probed more often into the rival half as they held more of the exchanges. 
    
	Sporting defence did a commendable job with zonal marking depriving Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Barreto scoring opportunities. 
    
	Bhaichung Bhutia had one opportunity in the first half but he failed to direct his header. 
    
	Sporting got into their grooves in the later part of the first half and had the best chance on an attempt by Adjei Lawrence off a pass from Obagbemiro, but rival custodian did well in negating the danger. 
    
	Mohun Bagan had the only opportunity when Jonathan Bobo headed off a flag-kick by James Singh, in the 61st minute but was well saved by sporting keeper Luis Barreto. 
    
	Sporting made a counter move and nearly scored but defender Peter Odafe made a goalline clearance off a Obagbemiro shot. 
    
	Sporting then intensified their attack raided the rival territory quite often and even came close to scoring on couple of occasions, but finally broke the deadlock at the 85th minute. 
    
	Meanwhile, in Mumbai, JCT Mills, Phagwara, would go all out for victory when it takes on former champions Mahindra United of Mumbai in another 10th round match at the Cooperage football ground on Thursday.

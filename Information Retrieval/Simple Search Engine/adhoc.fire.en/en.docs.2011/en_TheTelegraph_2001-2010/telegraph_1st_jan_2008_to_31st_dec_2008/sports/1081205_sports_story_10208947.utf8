            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A spirited Dempo thrashed qualifiers SBT 3-0 in the inaugural group A match of the 30th Federation Cup at Barasat Stadium on Thursday.         
	Clifford Miranda headed the first goal in the 11th minute, followed by Clifton Gonsalves scoring the second a minute later in a match that witnessed total domination by the Goans throughout. Anthony Pereira completed the rout in the 48th minute by slotting in the third.         
	Three back to back attacks and the Goans went into the lead in the 11th minute when Clifford Miranda headed in a deflected ball off the cross-piece. It was a move that saw Joaquim Abranches dribble through a hapless SBT defence and cross for an unmarked Miranda. Miranda headed it home on the rebound after his first header was deflected off the post.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We dominated the Test from the beginning, says Ricky Ponting
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We dominated the Test from the beginning, says Ricky Ponting
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Ricky Ponting was satisfied with the performance of his young and inexperienced side in the first Test. At the post-match press conference, he said they would only get better from here.               
	The following are excerpts:                 
	If he was happy with the draw         
	It was a pretty good game of Test cricket actually. I was very excited by the end of the days play last night I thought we had a real good contest on our hands today. We gave it our best shot with the ball, but we just didnt create enough opportunities. We needed to take a couple of wickets with the new ball, we got that Then Sachin and Laxman got together and we just couldnt break that partnership.         
	The performance         
	We played good cricket, theres no doubt about that. We dominated this Test match pretty much from the second or third over of the first day. Weve had our nose in front in the game, and unfortunately we have not been quite good enough to win it. But its a really good start to the series for us.         
	Does he rue not being able to finish India off quickly in the first innings?         
	In the course of this game, thats been one of the big turning points. Till Harbhajan and Zaheer got that partnership going, we were a long way ahead... We just couldnt break their stand. The lower-order put on runs and our lead went from being around 180-200 to 70 as it was. So, theres no doubt they took a bit of momentum from those partnerships.         
	Missing a quality spinner         
	Yes probably, but I thought Cameron White did an exceptional job today. I thought he bowled very well. Its a positive sign for us. But yes, a quality spinner might have made things a little different. Weve got a couple of days to recover from this game now and hope to play hard cricket in Mohali as well.         
	The performance of the youngsters         
	Its been a pretty good game for all those guys. Haddins batting was terrific, Watson bowled very well in the first innings and batted well in the second. It was a pretty tough wicket to keep on and Haddin dropped only one catch, which didnt cost us much. Cameron didnt have much of an opportunity to bat, but I think hes coming along in leaps and bounds with his bowling. I think he has met my expectations with what hes done today. The more exposure you give these guys, the better they are going to be. There was a lot of talk about our inexperience coming here and I think these guys have done a pretty good job. They will be better off after this for sure.         
	The Indians approach         
	I am not surprised with how the Indians played today, they play a lot of drawn matches.

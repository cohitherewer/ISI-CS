                                                     Gary Kirsten aims to win everything
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten                           
	Chennai: Gary Kirsten, Team Indias newest coach, has set goals for the entire year.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Kirsten has asked the Anil Kumbles and Mahendra Singh Dhonis to aim at winning everything.         
	The first target is South Africa, a team whose colours Kirsten wore with distinction for a number of years.         
	The series against South Africa, featuring three Tests, begins here on Wednesday.         
	Kirsten, one understands, is a one-on-one specialist and so nobody need feel neglected in any manner.         
	Its no surprise that Kirsten is looking to Paddy Upton, the mental conditioning coach hand-picked by him, for help in quickly settling down         
	The Kirstens, by the way, intend doing what Greg Chappell did  making Bangalore their base in India. Kirsten and his wife, Deborah, have two kids and the family is in Chennai right now.         
	Many are, of course, hoping that theres nothing more in common between Chappell and his full-time successor.

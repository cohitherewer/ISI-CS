	Dubai: With detained pacer Mohammed Asifs fate in limbo, senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Nadeem Akram, rushed here to bail out the detained cricketer, will return home on Tuesday night leaving behind a mission unaccomplished.         
	I am returning home on Tuesday night, but I am hopeful of an early release (for Asif), Akram said, adding that an official of the Pakistan embassy in Abu Dhabi will now follow the case.         
	Akram said there was no word from the Dubai attorney general and public prosecutors office on whether to trial Asif or deport him.         
	Asif remains detained at the Dubai airport since June 1 for allegedly possessing contraband drugs. The pacer was on his way back home after playing in the Indian Premier League when the airport officials intercepted him.

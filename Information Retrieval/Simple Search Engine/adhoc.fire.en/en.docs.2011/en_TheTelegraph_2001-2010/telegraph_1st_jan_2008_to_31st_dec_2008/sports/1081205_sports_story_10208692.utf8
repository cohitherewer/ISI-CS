	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings foreign recruits  Mike Okoro and Adewusi Adebayo  along with Imran Khan, Anit Ghosh and V. Prem Kumar are likely to be suspended after they manhandled a group of journalists at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Thursday.         
	Pradip Chatterjee, joint commissioner of police (administration), said that a case was registered at Lake police station on the basis of a complaint lodged by a journalist of a news channel against Okoro. The journalist was admitted to a hospital after Okoro hit him on his chest.         
	Police, however, did not arrest Okoro till late on Thursday night.         
	The Ghanaian, along with other players, refused to attend practice on the eve of their Federation Cup match against Churchill Brothers on Friday and were demanding their dues from the club.         
	A jostling started between the two groups of players over pending payments. During the course of the scuffle, Okoro allegedly thrashed the journalist, said an officer of the Lake police station.         
	Incidentally, Mohammedan Sporting players, along with coach Shabbir Ali, have not received their salaries for the past five months.         
	The journalist was among many waiting for the pre-match press meet. He asked Okoro whether he would play on Friday to which the Ghanaian unexpectedly threw a punch.         
	The blow left the journalist unconscious as he collapsed to the ground. Other players present at the spot also started hurling abuses at the journalists.         
	We will play on Friday But there wont be any foreigners, club secretary Sultan Ahmed said after a meeting with club officials. Everything has been settled after we assured them of clearing all their dues by Wednesday, said Ahmed.         
	Some players have maligned the clubs image. We will take severe action against all of them They will all be punished, assured Ahmed.         
	In another match, Mahindra United will face Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Friday.

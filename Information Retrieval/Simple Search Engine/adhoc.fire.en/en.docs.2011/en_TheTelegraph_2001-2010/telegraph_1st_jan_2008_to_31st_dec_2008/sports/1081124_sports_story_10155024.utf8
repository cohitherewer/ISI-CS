                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mohun Bagan cautious vs Mahindra
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Lowly placed Mahindra United will have to play out of their skins to garner any hope of snatching a point when they take on Mohun Bagan in I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.         
	With four wins on the trot, Bagan will be high on confidence against a depleted Mahindra United in their 10th round match.         
	Mohun Bagan are currently on 15 points from nine matches. The visitors have managed only nine from the same number of outings.         
	The Mumbai side will miss mid-fielder Ajayan Krishan Nair, who is down with chicken pox. Defender Dharmaraj Ravanan is ruled out due to a double booking.         
	Mohun Bagan will miss the services of winger Ishfaq Ahmed, who is nursing a muscle strain. James Singh (Sr), who had to be admitted to a hospital due to high fever, will also miss Mondays match.         
	Lalkamal Bhowmick is likely to replace Ishfaq while Rahul Kumar is expected to replace James Singh.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa has warned his boys against complacency.         
	We must not get overboard with our four back-to-back wins. There can be ups and downs at any point of time. We must play match by match, Bencherifa said.         
	The Moroccan added that the team have fought hard to reach the current position. We have worked hard for it. Winning four matches in a row is not easy... Since we have done all the hard work, we must not give it away by playing one bad match. We are keen to get three points.         
	Fresh from the goalless draw against Sporting Clube de Goa, Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira is confident. We drew our last three matches  an indication that we are not short on confidence. We will try to stop the Mohun Bagan juggernaut, Pereira said.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengal take on Dempo SC in Mondays other I-League encounter in Margao. East Bengal, who lost at JCT in their last match, are on 12 points from their nine matches while Dempo have 14 from the same number of outings.

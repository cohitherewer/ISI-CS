                                                   Dola rues lack of financial support

           
	New Delhi: Ace archer Dola Banerjee on Sunday rued the lack of financial support to help her compete with the best even after winning the World Cup final in the recurve event last year. 
    
	Dola, who was here to take part in the 1000-day countdown run for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, said archers suffered due to insufficient funds for buying the best equipment, not to speak of the lack of state-of-the-art facilities for the sport. The bow which I am using cost Rs 90,000 and I have to use the best equipment to be on top. But where is the money? lamented Dola. 
    
	The Union government has announced an award of Rs 10 lakh in recognition of her feat, but Dola said she needs more financial support, preferably sponsorship by the private sector to sustain her top ranking.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kings XI up next for Delhi DareDevils

	Mohali: Having tasted their first victory in the tournament, hosts Kings XI Punjab would like to carry forward the momentum when they take on the formidable Delhi DareDevils in their IPL clash here Sunday.         
	The unsavoury incident involving Harbhajan Singh and hosts pacer Sreesanth on Friday is likely to occupy the minds of Punjab players, especially the fast bowler himself and captain Yuvraj Singh.         
	However, they have to shrug off the whole controversy to put up a good show against the Virender Sehwag-led team, who have a clean record in the tournament with two wins so far.         
	Kings XI are a good side and they did well in couple of games. For us, every match is challenging and we will have to put up a better performance, Sehwag said at a joint news conference along with rival skipper Yuvraj.         
	Yuvraj said, We have some plans for Sehwag. Whosoever manage to execute the plans at the right time finish on top. (PTI)

	Bilbao: World champion Viswanathan Anand settled for a draw with Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk after finding himself in time trouble in the first round of the Bilbao Grand Slam final chess tournament.         
	Anand, playing white, faced considerable difficulties before salvaging a draw against Ivanchuk, who played the Marshall attack by sacrificing a pawn against the Indians Spanish opening.         
	Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen shot into the lead with a victory over GM Levon Aronian of Armenia.         
	The game between Topalov and Radjabov was headed for a draw from the opening itself. Radjabov played the Scotch opening and queens were exchanged on the 12th move resulting in a level endgame.

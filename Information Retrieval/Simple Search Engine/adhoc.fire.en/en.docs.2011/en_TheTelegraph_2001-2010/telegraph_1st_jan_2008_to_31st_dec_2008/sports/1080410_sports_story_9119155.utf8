The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev: Second time my dream has come true
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev: Second time my dream has come true
                                  
	Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singh has been handed a dream draw at the US Masters which will see him play alongside British Open champion Padraig Harrington and 2003 Masters winner Mike Weir in the first two rounds.         
	Im really excited. In Padraig and Mike, they are two nice guys. Ive played with them often enough and Im looking forward to it, said a beaming Jeev.         
	The Indian is making his second successive appearance in the years opening major after receiving a special invitation from the Augusta National Golf Club. Last year he finished tied 37th, after briefly being in the lead on Day I, and hopes to improve on his record.         
	Its a great feeling, the second time my dream has come true. I qualified for the Masters last year and now I couldnt have asked for a better invite in my life. Im really excited to be here. The golf course is in excellent condition and Im looking forward to a good week, Jeev said.         
	The Indian is showing signs of reproducing his best form once again after a magical 2006 season which saw him win four titles world-wide and the Asian Tours Order of Merit.         
	He endured a frustrating and winless season last year but Jeev has already come close twice this season, finishing runner-up at the Indonesia Open and the Ballantines Championship in South Korea.         
	Im happy with my game, its in good shape right now. I like this golf course as it suits my style. Hopefully Ill have a good week. Ill just go out there and give it a good shot. Last year, I learnt quite a bit and Ive made a few changes. Hopefully Ive learnt enough, said Jeev, who finished tied 39th in the Houston Open on Sunday.         
	This is my favourite major championship. When I was growing up, we used to get the video tapes three weeks after the Masters and whoever who got the tapes, it was the ultimate in those days, we didnt have live television.         
	Jeev is also aware that another good show by him at Augusta National will go a long way in encouraging young Indians to emulate and better his feats.         
	They see me play in a tournament like this, they start believing in themselves too. Its happening now as golf is the fastest growing sport in our country. A lot more youngsters are coming up, he said.           (PTI)

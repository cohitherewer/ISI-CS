	Glasgow: Jeev Milkha Singh kept himself in contention for a British Open berth after rising to the tied third spot with an eventful two-under 69 in the penultimate round of $5.92 million Barclays Scottish Open here.         
	Jeev, who needs to finish among the top five here for a berth in the British Open, has a three-round total of eight-under 205, just two strokes off the pace of leaders Englands Simon Khan (68) and Northern Irelands Graeme Mcdowell (66).         
	After an opening bogey and two more dropped strokes on the fourth and seventh holes, Jeev saved his front-nine by sinking in a couple of birdies before charging back with a bogey-free back-nine.         
	One-over at the turn, Jeev picked up birdies on the 10th, 14th and 15th holes to round off another strong card.         
	The Indian pro is in a four-way tie for third place with Australias Richard Green (70), Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez (68), and Englands Ross Fisher (68). (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Young Croat fan collapses and dies 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Young Croat fan collapses and dies 
                      
	 Klagenfurt: A young Croatian football fan, in Austria for the Euro 2008, died Thursday of an apparent heart attack just hours before his team beat Germany 2-1. Police did not identify him in keeping with Austrian practice but said he appeared to be about 20 years old. He collapsed in a fan zone in the southern Austrian city of Klagenfurt, the venue for the Germany-Croatia match. The Austria Press Agency said that a police officer trained in first-aid revived the victim at the scene but he died later in the hospital, shortly before the opening whistle.         
	Pavlyuchenko injured         
	 Leogang (Austria): Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko is in doubt for his teams crucial match against Greece after injuring a leg muscle in training on Thursday. Russia coach Guus Hiddink did not immediately say if Pavlyuchenko, who scored Russias only goal in the 1-4 loss to Spain, would be fit for the Greece match in Salzburg on Saturday. He is not fit at this moment. We will see how he will perform tomorrow and we will see on Saturday, Hiddink said.         
	Concern over Ukraine         
	 Kiev: Ukraine could lose the right to co-host Euro 2012 due to delays in the renovation of Kievs Olympic Stadium, an official from the Ukrainian soccer federation was quoted as saying on Thursday. President Viktor Yushchenko has grown increasingly concerned in recent weeks over the slow progress of preparations and has given the organising committee until June 18 to resolve key issues. Uefa president Michel Platini has criticised preparations in Ukraine and is to make another visit on July 1-2. Poland are the other co-hosts.         
	Niclas out         
	 Lugano: Sweden fullback Niclas Alexandersson has ruled himself out of Saturdays match against Spain because of a right calf injury, further depleting the teams right flank. Alexandersson said on Thursday he would not be able to play against Spain, but could make Swedens final match against Russia.         
	Uefa wish         
	 Regensdorf (Switzerland): Uefas head of refereeing wants the sports rules-making body to adopt the controversial offside interpretation that allowed The Netherlands to score their first goal in the 3-0 victory over Italy at Euro 2008. Yvan Cornu, Uefas head of refereeing, said the interpretation should be included in the rules when the International Football Association Board meets next year.

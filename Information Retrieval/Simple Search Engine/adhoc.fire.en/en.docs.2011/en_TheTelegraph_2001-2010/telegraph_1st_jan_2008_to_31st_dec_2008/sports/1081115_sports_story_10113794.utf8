	London: Spin legend Shane Warne feels the Aussies are still the worlds No. 1 team, despite the series loss in India.         
	There has been a huge amount of talk this week about dynasties toppling after Indias win in the Test series. The aura of invincibility that we carried in the eyes of the opposition has probably gone, Warne said.         
	But to me, Australia are still the best side in the world, he wrote in his column in The Times, London. (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Privatise Indian hockey, says Ric
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ric Charlesworth, who resigned as the technical advisor of Indian hockey a few weeks ago under controversial circumstances, on Tuesday accused the Sports Authority of India (SAI) for engineering his ouster.         
	The legendary Aussie coach, currently in the capital to try and recover his dues, said that SAI never wanted him to work for Indian hockey.         
	The SAI, Charlesworth claimed, is yet to pay him his dues. He was also not sure about getting it as the officials in the body were not responding to his requests. ... The IOA is talking with the SAI people in this matter. I wont submit my assessment unless I am paid my dues.         
	Privatising the game, the Australian coach felt, could be the only solution for improving the standard of hockey in India. Thats the best way to put in place a professional structure. The planning and training programme of the game should not be left to some bureaucrats, he said. Three years ago I submitted a comprehensive programme to KPS Gill. It would have taken Indian hockey to a much higher position, but he never took my words seriously. said Charlesworth.

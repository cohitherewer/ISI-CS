The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CSA chief, Arthur trade charges
                                                CSA chief, Arthur trade charges
                      
	Durban: Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Norman Arendse and national team coach Mickey Arthur have laid disciplinary charges against each other in an escalating row over the squad to tour Bangladesh.         
	Arthur was part of a selection panel that, according to media reports, failed to meet CSA guidelines by picking at least seven coloured players in the squad for the Bangladesh tour.         
	The squad was due to be finalised on Tuesday but Arendse refused to approve the selectors choice in a teleconference that ended in acrimony.         
	Another teleconference on Thursday, during which the selectors presented the same squad, also ended inconclusively. Arendse said on Thursday that Arthur had behaved in a disrespectful and abusive fashion, and suggested that he had ignored CSAs racial transformation policy.         
	If a coach says, theres no transformation policy (among selectors), if he says, sorry, Im not prepared to implement CSAs policies, then his position is untenable, Arendse told reporters. He added that he had laid disciplinary charges against Arthur, who reacted by filing his own complaint against Arendse.         
	Unfortunately I felt I had no choice but to do likewise, Arthur said. The president accused me of all sorts of things apart from failing, or even refusing to implement CSAs transformation policies. That is simply untrue.         
	The presidents implication would appear to be that I prefer to select white players over black players, which is deeply insulting and hurtful. (Black players) Hashim Amla, Charl Langeveldt and JP Duminy have all established themselves in the national squad in my time as coach while Ashwell Prince became the countrys first black captain.

                                                    Spain GPs in jeopardy

	London: The Spanish motorsports federation Monday issued a stinging condemnation of fans who racially abused McLarens Lewis Hamilton at the weekend and declared its absolute repulsion at the incidents in Barcelona. 
    
	The RFEdeA responded after the FIA demanded a full report and a source close to Formula Ones governing body warned that Spains two GPs could be at risk. 
    
	Hamilton, the sports first black driver and championship runner-up in a sensational rookie season last year, was taunted and insulted during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya. 
    
	The 23-year-old has become a hate figure in Spain because of his rivalry with former McLaren team mate and double world champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso, who now drives for Renault. 
    
	The Federation wants to show its absolute repulsion at these incomprehensible incidents and demonstrate its support and solidarity for the McLaren team and especially their driver Lewis Hamilton, the Spanish statement said. 
    
	This type of idiots that are confusing sporting rivalry with violence should be aware that the Federation has a zero-tolerance approach to this issue. 
    
	The Circuit de Catalunya said in a separate statement that it would not allow even the smallest incident to repeat itself within its facilities. 
    
	It said new measures would be in place for tests at the circuit in late February and the Spanish GP in April, and threatened legal action against any offenders in the event of sanctions being imposed. 
    
	Hamiltons next will be at Jerez in southern Spain from February 12-14. 
    
	Spanish papers reported Sunday that Hamilton, whose paternal grandfather comes from the Caribbean island of Grenada, was booed and insulted by spectators. A British tabloid splashed the story on its front page Monday under the headline Vile Taunts at Circuit. 
    
	The paper also published a photograph of a group of spectators dancing in the grandstands while blacked up and wearing wigs and T-shirts with Hamiltons Familly (sic) on the front. The back declared Alonsos number one fan. 
    
	British Sports Minister Gerry Sutcliffe said he would write to the FIA and his Spanish counterpart to express his concern about the sickening images. 
    
	Spain is the only country to have two GPs this year, one at the Circuit de Catalunya in April and the European Grand Prix in Valencia at the end of August. (Reuters)

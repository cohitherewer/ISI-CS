	Honolulu: David Beckham had a hand in both Los Angeles Galaxy goals as his Major League Soccer side clinched third place in the Pan Pacific Championship with a 2-1 victory over Sydney FC on Saturday.         
	With three minutes gone, the England midfielders long cross was met by Ely Allen, who scored with a crisp left-foot volley.         
	Sydney FC equalised three minutes before half-time through Brendan Renaud, who let fly with a left-foot strike from 30 yards to beat goalkeeper Steve Cronin.         
	It is always good at pre-season to get games in, said Beckham. You can do all the training you want but your match fitness that comes from games is important.         
	Beckham provided the spark for what would be the Galaxys winner just before half-time. His low cross was fumbled by Sydney goalkeeper Ivan Necevski, and Josh Tudela was on hand to turn the ball into the net.         
	The right foot seems to be working, Beckham added. That is what I do, I get into positions and deliver balls that can help my team mates and the strikers.         
	I like having assists and tonight I was lucky enough to get two so it was a good night.         
	Beckham took a stray boot in the chest 18 minutes into the second-half but, after pacing around for a few seconds, decided to stay on, much to the delight of the Hawaii crowd who cheered his every touch.         
	Its been a really good stay in Hawaii, its just great that people enjoy watching me play, and watching the team play, Beckham said.         
	Thats always important, that the people, kids and everybody that comes to the game has fun and enjoys themselves.         
	Japanese side Gamba Osaka won the inaugural competition with an emphatic 6-1 win over MLS side Houston Dynamo.         
	Brazilian striker Bare scored four goals, with Lucas and Masato Yamazaki also getting on the scoresheet. Ricardo Clark managed Houstons only goal.           (REUTERS)

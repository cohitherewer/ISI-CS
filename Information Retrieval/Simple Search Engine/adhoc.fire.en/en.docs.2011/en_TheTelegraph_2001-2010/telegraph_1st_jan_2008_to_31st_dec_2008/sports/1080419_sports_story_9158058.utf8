The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Essien goal keeps Chelsea in hunt 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Essien goal keeps Chelsea in hunt 
            TIM RICH            Evertons Steven Pienaar vies with Chelseas Michael Essien on Thursday. (AFP)                           
	The Winslow Hotel opposite Goodison Park is the kind of place that specialises in beer and banter rather than spa treatments and Egyptian cotton sheets but on Thursday night it was advertising a psychic evening.         
	Avram Grant might have been tempted to remain on Merseyside just to ask what kind of future he has at Stamford Bridge. On Friday morning it is still unclear.         
	Chelsea, two points behind Manchester United with the champions still to come to Stamford Bridge, are still contenders for the title. Sir Alex Ferguson would not concede the championship under these circumstances and nor would Jose Mourinho.         
	When the final whistle sounded, Chelseas sense of grievance at having this game moved to a Thursday because of television commitments would have been considerably less acute. Three points can do a lot to cure outrage.         
	This was a similar game to the one that had appeared to have undone them on Monday night against Wigan. Chelsea scored first and spent most of the second half attempting to nurse that lead through.         
	But here there was no sting in the tail. Manchester United, you felt, would have tried to kill off an Everton side that aside from Manuel Fernandess free-kicks, looked chronically short of inspiration or ideas.         
	Everton may have cranked up the pressure considerably in the second half with David Moyes throwing Joleon Lescott from left-back to centre forward and with John Terry forced into a bruising contest with Yakubu. Even Michael Essien, whose goal separated the teams, appeared to faint in the middle of the pitch but there was seldom any real prospect of a breakthrough.         
	While the title will be alive when United go to Stamford Bridge on April 26, another contest has been settled. Five points ahead of Everton and with a game in hand, Liverpool are destined for another season of Champions League football.         
	When the teams ran out, it was past an honour guard formed by the Harlem Globetrotters, a team that Roman Abramovich would admire as they exist purely to entertain. Most of their matches are exhibition games that run to a strict script, and they are also not required to win  the kind of luxury that football never allows.         
	When Grant last took Chelsea to Goodison in January, it appeared that a remarkable script was being forged; the one about how a shy, quietly humorous Israeli took over from the most flamboyant manager the game had seen since Brian Clough and won everything.         
	Then, a goal from Joe Cole took Chelsea to the Carling Cup final in the middle of a sequence of games that saw 10 out of 11 games won. The one that was not won was drawn 4-4 with Aston Villa on an afternoon of pure adrenalin the Harlem Globetrotters would have recognised.         
	Returning to Goodison, Grant stood on the touchline, his figure starkly framed by the floodlights, his future apparently measured in weeks even though his season might end with the European Cup in Moscow.         
	He could have argued that he was without Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Michael Ballack. The Chelsea supporters whom the club had bussed up to Merseyside at their own expense did not, as they had done against Wigan, chant that he did not know what he was doing. He could, if he had checked the record books, have pointed out that it took Dave Mackay, the man who succeeded Clough, 18 months to win the title with Derby.         
	At least he started with Joe Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips, something he had not done at home on Monday and with a single, fabulously timed pass, he ought to have justified his selection with a goal 10 minutes before the interval. The pass was from Salomon Kalou and sent Wright-Phillips clear on goal.         
	Had Wright-Phillips shot first time, it might have been more difficult to miss but in trying to shift the ball from his left to his right boot, he allowed Phil Jagielka time to make an interception.         
	And that ought to have summed up the game  Chelsea had hitherto had plenty of possession and done very little with it, while Jagielkas anticipation and positioning had been outstanding.         
	It was the height of irony that a few minutes later Jagielka should unintentionally have flicked on a ball from Wright-Phillips straight into Essiens path who, unlike his teammate, did not hesitate and drove his shot emphatically past Tim Howard, who moments later tipped over instinctively from Jon Obi Mikel. Within the space of five minutes, Chelsea had emerged from a dull contest of attrition to take complete charge.         
	And, frankly, this was no more than they had deserved. Everton had not beaten them at Goodison in eight years and with Chelsea supposedly demoralised and with their championship credentials apparently wrecked by Emile Heskeys late goal, they would never have a better chance.         
	And yet all they produced in the first half was a single free-kick from Fernandes that bounced awkwardly in front of Petr Cech, who palmed the ball out for a corner. From a side supposedly still competing for a place in the Champions League, it was all rather flat, although you suspect that their manager, David Moyes, would probably settle for fifth this morning.

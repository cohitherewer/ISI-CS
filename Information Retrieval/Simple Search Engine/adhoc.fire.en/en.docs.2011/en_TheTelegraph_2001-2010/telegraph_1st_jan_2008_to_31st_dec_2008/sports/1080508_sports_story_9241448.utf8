	Rome: Rafael Nadal lost on clay for only the second time in 105 matches, falling to Juan Carlos Ferrero 5-7, 1-6 on Wednesday in the second round of the Rome Masters. Nadal appeared bothered by a blister on his right foot, calling for the trainer late in the second set.         
	The second-ranked Nadal, the three-time defending champion in Rome, had never lost at the Foro Italico. The 23rd-ranked Ferrero won the Rome tournament in 2001.         
	Nadal also won the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open the past two weeks, but he appeared slightly off his game Wednesday.         
	Ferrero connected on a cross-court backhand winner to break Nadal and win the first set, then broke again to take a 3-1 lead in the second when Nadal netted a forehand.         
	With Ferrero ahead 4-1 in the second set, Nadal called for a trainer and had his foot re-taped.         
	After deciding to play on, he was broken again, then Ferrero served the match out at love.         
	Nadals last loss on clay came against top-ranked Roger Federer in the Hamburg Masters last year.         
	Earlier, third-ranked Novak Djokovic showed no signs of illness on Wednesday when he cruised past Steve Darcis 6-4, 6-0 in his opening match.         
	In the Monte Carlo Masters, Djokovic pulled out of his semi-final match against top-ranked Roger Federer after falling behind 3-6, 2-3. Tests afterward revealed he had strep throat.         
	Against the 49th-ranked Darcis, Djokovic broke at love in the final game of the first set, then rolled through the second.         
	Two seeded players were upset in the second round. Coming off a final appearance at the Barcelona Open, fifth-seeded David Ferrer lost to Radek Stepanek 6-4, 2-6, 1-6. Spanish clay court specialist Nicolas Almagro upset seventh-seeded David Nalbandian 4-6, 5-7.         
	Fourth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko beat Croatian wild card Mario Ancic 6-2, 6-2; No. 8 James Blake held off Andreas Seppi of Italy 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-1; and No. 12 Fernando Gonzalez  last years finalist  defeated Russian qualifier Evgeny Korolev 6-3, 6-2.         
	The top eight seeded players had first-round byes at the clay court warm-up for the French Open, which begins May 25. (AP)

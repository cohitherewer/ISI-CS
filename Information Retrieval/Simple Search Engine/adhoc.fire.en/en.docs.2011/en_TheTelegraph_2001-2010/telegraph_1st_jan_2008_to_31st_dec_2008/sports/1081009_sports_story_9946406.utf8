The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ramiz: India will feel Souravs absence
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ramiz: India will feel Souravs absence
                  Ramiz Raja                     
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja on Wednesday supported Sourav Gangulys decision to retire at the end of the home series against Australia and said that retiring now would mean the former India captain will go out gracefully, earning the respect and admiration of his fans and fellow players.         
	He has made the right decision, as he will go out gracefully now and be remembered with respect and admiration. Indian cricket will miss his strong will, character and presence in the dressing room, he said.         
	Following Tuesdays announcement to retire, the former India captain was highly praised by Pakistani cricketers past and present for what many felt was a timely decision to call it a day after the upcoming four-Test series against Australia.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)         
	Shoaib Akhtar: I found him to be a very good captain while playing under him and he understood how to use his bowlers. Even as a rival I respected his strong character and his pride in playing for India as he never gave up. I hope he continues playing in the IPL because his retirement will definitely leave a big void in Indian cricket.         
	Shoaib Malik: He was a big asset to Indian cricket and he had lot of leadership qualities. But if he has decided to retire I think he knows what is right for him now.         
	Haroon Rasheed: The good thing is that despite his strong presence and influence he had the courage to take the correct decision. His decision to retire at this stage would set a good precedent for other senior players, who struggle to know when it is time to step down. He brought a lot of fighting spirit to the Indian team and he made them believe they are world beaters. He backed his players to the hilt and that is the sign of a great captain.         
	Aamer Sohail: He has left his mark on Indian cricket and he will be remembered as a very successful and astute captain.         
	Mohammed Yousuf: It is not easy for a senior player to decide when it is time to retire. I feel he has done the right thing and he has set an example for other players of the region. He was very aggressive on the field and had a lot of confidence and belief in himself and he brought those very qualities to the Indian team. I think his biggest contribution is that he lifted Indian cricket at a very crucial time and made it a very strong side.

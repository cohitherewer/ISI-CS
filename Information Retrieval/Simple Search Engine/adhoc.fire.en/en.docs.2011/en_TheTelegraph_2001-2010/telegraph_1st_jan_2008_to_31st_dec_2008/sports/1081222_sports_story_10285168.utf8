The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary: Switch hit unfair on bowlers 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gary: Switch hit unfair on bowlers 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: India coach Gary Kirsten feels that laws should be made to stop batsmen from playing switch hits.         
	On Sunday, England captain Kevin Pietersen executed the shot to hit Harbhajan Singh for a six. On another occasion, he took a boundary off Amit Mishra in a similar fashion.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Pietersen has called Yuvraj Singh a pie-chucker. Your comments         
	He (Pietersen) may call him a pie-chucker but Yuvi got him out a couple of times. He is an interesting bowler. One can now see in international cricket how slider has become an important delivery. It often hits you on the line.         
	Was Dhonis decision right to call Yuvraj to bowl in the third over?         
	Trust me, MS (Dhoni) comes up with something unique at times. I think it was a nice bit of thinking by the captain.         
	What are your comments on Pietersens switch shots?         
	Its unbelievable. He is a master of the shot. I think he hits it harder than my sweep. But I think we have to do something about the law of the game, because its a big advantage for the batsman and a disadvantage for the bowlers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Portugal set to experiment
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Portugal set to experiment
                      
	Neuchatel (Switzerland): A very different Portugal team could take the field in the Euro 2008 quarter finalists last group game against Switzerland in Basel on Sunday.         
	Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose side won group A before their match against the eliminated co-hosts, could make several changes to rest a majority of first-choice players with a potential quarter final against Germany looming on June 19.         
	Germany, the team that most impressed Scolari tactically after the first batch of matches, cannot win group B and avoid Portugal after their shock loss to Croatia on Thursday.         
	Utility player Fernando Meira and goalkeeper Ricardo could shed no light on Scolaris plans at Fridays news conference.         
	We all have to be ready to play. The coach can count on me at any time in any position, said Meira.         
	Ricardo, likely to be one of four players retained from the first-choice starting line-up, said: We are fully confident in the coachs decisions.After injury ruled understudy Quim out of the tournament, Ricardo has two uncapped reserves in 34-year-old Nuno Espirito Santo and 20-year-old Rui Patricio.         
	Meira said Portugal would go all out for victory whoever was picked by Scolari, who could also give starts to wingers Nani and Ricardo Quaresma and midfielder Raul Meireles while Cristiano Ronaldo, Simao Sabrosa and Deco are rested.         
	Having failed in their bid to reach the quarter finals, Switzerland are setting their sights on a first-ever victory at a European Championship.         
	Even before we went out I had already thought that it would be a great achievement to get the countrys first win at a Euro, said coach Koebi Kuhn.           (REUTERS)

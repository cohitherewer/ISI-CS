            A STAFF REPORTER            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar is fit to play against Australia in the upcoming Test series, according to a BCCI release on Friday.         
	A report submitted by Paul Close, who assessed Tendulkars fitness at the National Cricket Academy, stated that the player has recovered fully from his elbow injury that has kept him out of action since the end of the Test series in Sri Lanka.         
	Tendulkar will join the camp prior to the series, said the release.         
	Tendulkar hurt his elbow during the last Test against Sri Lanka at the P. Sara Stadium and missed the one-day International series that followed.         
	The master batsman had initially planned to play for the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy, but decided to sit out as India cannot afford to miss him in the crucial Test series.         
	The Mumbai maestro is less than 100 runs away from West Indies great Brian Laras (Test) world record of 11,953 runs.

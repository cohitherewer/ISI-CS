	Guwahati: Bengal stormed into the knockout stages of the East Zone National One-dayers with a comprehensive 80-run win over Orissa at the Nehru Stadium on Monday. 
    
	Their third straight win with a bonus point came despite an unimpressive show by former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. Bengal have 15 points with a match still remaining. They play Jharkhand on Wednesday. 
    
	Put in to bat, Bengal posted a challenging 269 for six. Orissa were bundled out for 189 in 38.1 overs. Off-spinner Priyankar Mukherjee was the chief wrecker with five wickets. 
    
	Sourav (5) disappointed the handsome turnout after failing to negotiate a slower one from Alok Mangaraj in the latters first over. 
    
	The promising Anustup Majumdar scored a breezy 101 (120 balls, 10x4, 1x6) before being bowled by Debashish Mohanty. 
    
	 Arindam was dropped by Pritamjeet Das at deep square leg soon after Souravs dismissal while glovesman Haladhar Das too slipped on at least two occasions. 
    
	 With two wickets down for 27 in 8.2 overs, skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla (53, 7x4) put on a solid 140-run third wicket partnership with Majumdar. 
    
	Bengal spinners ran through the Orissa lower order. From 173 for three they folded up for 189. Priyankar claimed five for 26 while Iresh Saxena took three.

    I-League

	Kozhikode: Star-studded Mohun Bagan defeated Viva Kerala in the 11th round of the ONGC I-League tie at the Corporation Stadium here on Sunday. The Calcutta giants scored a goal in each half to avenge their first-leg defeat, at the Salt Lake Stadium. 
    
	Dominating the proceedings right from the inception, the visitors seized the opportunity in the 35th minute when captain Bhaichung Bhutia scored off a brilliant pass from Habibur Rehman Mondal. 
    
	Although Viva strikers Baba Tunde (Nigeria) and Wisdom Abbey (Ghana) tried their best to bring in the equaliser, the Calcutta outfit, including custodian Sangram Mukherjee, played extremely well to deny any scoring opportunities. Substitute Ishfaq Ahmed increased the margin for the visitors just before the final whistle. 
    
	Brazilian stars Douglas da Silva and Jose Ramirez Baretto put up an excellent show and the former was adjudged the Man of the Match. 
    
	With this win, the green-and-maroons have increased their points tally to 17 to remain in the fourth spot behind runaway leaders Dempo. JCT and Churchil Brothers, while Viva with 12 points are left way behind in the seventh position in the 10-team league. 
    
	Viva Kerala will take on Mahindra in their next match here on January 24.

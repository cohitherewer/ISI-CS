                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bryans give Chennai a miss
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bob and Mike Bryan, the world No.2 American doubles pair, have withdrawn from Chennai Open 2009 due to an injury to Bob Bryan, according to a media release.         
	Chennai Open is Indias oldest ATP event. The tournament will be held form January 5 to 11.         
	This is really unfortunate. We were keenly looking forward to our participation at the Chennai Open 2009. However, Bobs injury has spoilt our plans. We were eagerly looking forward to playing in India but things have not worked out, said the Bryans in a statement.         
	The Bryans, as they are known, have won 49 tour titles (including 13 ATP Masters Series titles), completing a career Grand Slam with victories at the French Open (2003), US Open (2005, 2008), Australian Open (2006 and 2007), and Wimbledon (2006). They also won the Tennis Masters Cup Doubles tournament twice (2003 and 2004).         
	Fernando Soler, the tournament director, said: While the Bryans will be missed, tennis enthusiasts of Chennai can eagerly look forward to some good tennis action with the presence of international stars like Davydenko, Wawrinka, Cilic, Karlovic, Schuettler in Singles and Indian stars Mahesh and Leander in the doubles draw.         
	The 14th edition of Chennai Open will be held from January 5-11 in Chennai.

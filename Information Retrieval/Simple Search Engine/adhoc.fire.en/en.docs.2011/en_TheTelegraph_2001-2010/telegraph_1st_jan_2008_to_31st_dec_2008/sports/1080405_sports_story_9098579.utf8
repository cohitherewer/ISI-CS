                                                     Once in a lifetime win, says Aloke
  - This triumph was important in more ways than one: Alvito       A STAFF REPORTER            Alvito DCunha and Ibe Ike Gift on their arrival in the city on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Coach Aloke Mukherjee on Friday refused to take any credit for East Bengals historic 2-0 triumph over Jordanian powerhouse Al Wihdat, which placed them on top of group B in the AFC Cup.         
	Shortly after landing in the city on Friday morning, the red and golds interim coach said: Its an achievement that cant be put in words. The entire credit for this once in a lifetime win goes to the boys.         
	What makes this victory more special is that Al Wihdat are placed second on the Jordanian league (two points behind the leaders) and according to Mukherjee, are a much better outfit than Safa FC of Lebanon who had defeated East Bengal in Beirut on March 11.         
	I had almost no idea about them (Al Wihdat). Internet research yielded very little information so my specific instruction to the boys was that they should observe the opponents for the first 20 minutes, he said. And that made all the difference.         
	You wouldnt believe the kind of attacking football the Jordanian club is capable of. For the first 20 minutes, we withstood a barrage of attacks and our defence stood like a rock.         
	For the unassuming Mukherjee, architect of an Indian clubs first win on West Asian soil, goalie Subrata Pauls nine-minute save was probably the turning point of the match.         
	It was an unbelievable save. Our body language changed drastically after that. In the second half, we took the game to our opponents and even bettered them, an ecstatic East Bengal coach said. Both goals, of course, were scored in the second half with Alvito DCunha (59th) and Ibe Ike Gift (69) doing the job.         
	With six points now from three outings and the return leg match at the Salt Lake Stadium on April 16, East Bengal are in sight of reaching the quarter finals and emulate the feat of their 2004 counterparts.         
	Goalkeeper Subrata, however, didnt think so. The India goalie has already put the win well behind him.         
	For me, its history, he said. I dont agree that we are close to reaching the last eight stage. We still have a long, long way to go. We have to put this behind us and start afresh.         
	For Subrata, the victory, however historic, was achieved partly because there was no pressure on them.         
	We were the definite underdogs. In fact, the Al Wihdat coach had said the day earlier (April 1) that we (Indians) dont know how to play football. So there were no expectations on us. But it is a fact that this was probably the best we played in the last one and a half years.         
	The East Bengal goalie agreed with his coach that his save was an outstanding one.         
	It was probably the best save of my life. The ball had taken a deflection and I had to dive in the opposite direction after committing to the left.         
	The red and golds, who have been losing almost everything of late after their Federation Cup success, are sure to carry forward a lot of confidence from this win, something which found expression in Alvito DCunhas words.         
	It was a do or die match for us, the East Bengal midfielder said.         
	Our entire season after Fed Cup was bad. The win perhaps atones for our bad form. There has been a sea change in our mentality. It has been a very important win in more ways than one, Alvito said.

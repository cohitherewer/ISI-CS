  - Hammond, Kulothungan score in Mumbai FCs 2-1 win       A STAFF REPORTER            Mumbai FCs Abel Hammond (right) tries to get past Peter Odafe in Barasat on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The Calcutta League champions Mohun Bagan got a rude awakening on Saturday evening at Barasat stadium, against Mumbai FC, their first opponents in the second edition of the I-League. Bagan went down 1-2.         
	The persistent day-long rain rendered the turf at Barasat pretty much unplayable, and as the players took the field, pundits believed the advantage was with the local outfit. Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa had at his disposal the lethal strike force of Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto  operating together for the first time this season. But it was the Mumbai based side, coached by shrewd tactician David Booth, who adapted to the conditions from the word go.         
	Bagan custodian Shilton Paul was called into action as early as the 3rd minute, keeping out double strikes from Felix Aboage and Subhas Chakraborty. The green-and-maroon brigade were stunned minutes later when Ghanaian striker Abel Hammond latched on to a loose ball and left defenders floundering in the muck. Abel steamed ahead and unleashed an unstoppable effort from the right  the home side were down by a goal in the 9th minute.         
	Mumbai FCs foreign strike force of Abel and Felix got the better of the likes of N.S. Manju, Rino Anto and Peter Odafe time and again. The two Ghanaians surprisingly kept their feet and displayed moments of magic  Felixs take down and shot on the turn in the 18th minute was a treat to watch. On the other hand, the experienced pair of Barreto and Bhaichung struggled to keep their footing on soft underfoot conditions.         
	Kulothungan, no stranger to conditions in Calcutta, added to Bagans woes, finishing a beautifully constructed move in the 23rd minute. Abels run down the right touch line, left Manju for dead and the Ghanaians flighted cross was met with Kulothungans diving header.         
	Bagan continued to lack purpose and creation in the middle third, spraying square passes instead of making forays into the Mumbai FC citadel. Apart from an early Bhaichung effort that went wide off the mark and a Barreto toe-poke in the 31st minute, that Kalyan Choubey tipped over with his finger tips, Bagan didnt even come close to making the scorers work, in the first period.         
	In an effort to shore up his nervy back four, Bencharifa threw on Mohan Raj in place of Rino Anto. P.C. Lalawmpuiya also came on attempting to link up with the front two. Winger Ishfaq Ahmed who was reined in both by the Mumbai sides defence and the slush in the first half, began to make a difference, supplying long balls for the men upfront to latch on to.         
	David Booths sides shape was immaculate, cutting out attempted through balls easily. With Bhaichung and Barreto looking shadows of themselves, Lalawmpuiya pulled one back for his side in the 76th minute.         
	His shot from inside the six-yard box, crept through a melee of legs. A deflection didnt help Kalyan Choubeys cause. Bhaichung next wasted a golden opportunity, firing his header wide from an Ishfaq throw-in. Bagan predictably heaped pressure on their relatively inexperienced opponents. It certainly wasnt the Indian skippers day as a left-footed effort late in the match found the left upright before being cleared off the goal line.         
	Bagans hopes of any dramatic last gasp equaliser were washed away with the rains, as the heavens opened up, making ball control impossible. David Booths ploy of coming down to the city early to acclimatise with the conditions paid off as his boys held on and mastered the demon of a pitch.

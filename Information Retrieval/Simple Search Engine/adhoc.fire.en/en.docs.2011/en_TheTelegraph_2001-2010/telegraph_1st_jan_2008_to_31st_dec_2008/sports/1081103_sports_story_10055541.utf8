The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | World junior title for Saina Nehwal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       World junior title for Saina Nehwal

	Pune: Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal Sunday became the first Indian to clinch the World Junior badminton Championship with a straight-game win in the finals here.         
	Top seed Saina got the better of her ninth-seeded Japanese rival Sayaka Sato 21-9, 21-18 in a lopsided match that lasted just 25 minutes.         
	It is a great feeling to win it this time. The last time in 2006, I had lost in the finals but I am happy that I clinched the title this time, Saina, who reached the quarter finals of the Beijing Olympics, said after the match.         
	I never thought that I would play so well. The first game was easier but in the second game she was playing good smashes, but I was successful in catching her on the nets. I played my backhands well and so overall I am satisfied with my performance. It was an okay sort of match.         
	However, I reckon my semi-final match against Chinese Shixian Wang was the toughest in the tournament, she added.         
	With the Commonwealth youth gold and the World Junior badminton title in her kitty, the world No. 11 has now set her eyes on China and Hong Kong Open later this month.         
	I am next playing China Open and Hong Kong Open this month and I am confident of doing well there as well, the national champion said.         
	National coach Pullela Gopichand said Saina played like a champion all through the tournament. She played like a champion. It is good to see her winning convincingly throughout the tournament. She has really done well, hats off to her, Gopichand said. (PTI)

  -   Visitors grab full points from 2 away matches         A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Edmilson jumps over a Mumbai FC player at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: A spirited Mumbai FC proved that their win against Mohun Bagan was no fluke, beating a lacklustre East Bengal by a solitary goal on Tuesday at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The Mumbai-based club thus picked up full six points from their two away matches against the big two of Indian football. The red-and-gold brigade were left to rue missed opportunities as Mumbai FC managed to hold on to their lead which came through a strike from Ghanaian Felix Aboage.         
	The match never reached great heights and the red-and-gold brigade lacked penetration. The strikers seemed to lose composure once inside the rival box.         
	Also, a bit of selflessness from Rahim Nabi would have been better for East Bengal. Nabi, on at least two occasions, could have done better by passing the ball to somebody else rather than trying to score on his own.         
	Both teams played listless football for the first 20 minutes, probably trying to gauge the opponent.         
	East Bengal earned their first corner in the 21st minute of the match. An array of exciting moments followed the corner. First, Sunil Chhetris header was saved off the goalline by Subhas Chakraborty.         
	Edmilson Marques got hold of the clearance, but his left-footed grounder hit Mumbai FC custodian Kalyan Chaubey and reached Mehrajuddin Wadoo. Mehraj made a mess of the chance, shooting the ball over the bar from six yards out.         
	East Bengal conceded the goal against the run of play in the 23rd minute.         
	Felix quickly turned towards the goal after chesting down Riston Rodrigues free-kick, and then placed the ball past East Bengal custodian Subrata Paul, who had no chance of saving it.         
	The home side missed a sitter in the 30th minute when an unmarked Sunil shot into the hands of the goalkeeper after chest-trapping a Rahim Nabi cross.         
	Second-half was no different with East Bengal coming close to scoring on more than one occasion but failing to utilise the chances.         
	Teams         
	Mumbai FC: Anas Edathodika, James Dissiramah, Selwyn Fernandes, Felix Aboage (Abhishek Yadav, 77), Abel Hammond, Kalyan Chaubey, K. Kulothungan (Noel Wilson, 60), Sanjay Parte, Riston Rodrigues, Aseem K. (S. Kuttymani, 64), Subhas Chakraborty         
	East Bengal: Nirmal Chhetri, Suley Musah, Khelemba Singh, Rennedy Singh (Mehtab Hossain, 70, Goutam Kujur, 87), Sunil Chhetri, Yusif Yakubu, Syed Rahim Nabi, Subrata Paul, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Saumik Dey, Edmilson Marques (Ashim Biswas, 46)         
	Referee: A. Arjunan         
	MoM: Selwyn Fernandes

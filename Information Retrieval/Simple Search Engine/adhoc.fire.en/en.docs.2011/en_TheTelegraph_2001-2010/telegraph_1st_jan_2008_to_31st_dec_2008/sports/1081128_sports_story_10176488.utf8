	Its getting closer. I remember watching on TV a few weeks ago as the lorry-full of bombs went off at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad, where England were due to stay for the Champions Trophy, and thinking crikey, its getting close.         
	Now its Mumbai, where the Middlesex players were due to stay on Thursday night. There seem to be these triggers, or warnings, that it is getting closer to cricket.         
	All our white Test kit is in one of the rooms at the Taj Mahal (hotel) where one of the sieges has been going on: all our pads and clothes for the Test series, and our blazers and caps and ties. All the stuff was deposited there after Englands two practice games in Mumbai at the start of this tour. Thats how close the danger is.         
	I was on the England tour of India towards the end of 2001, less than a couple of months after 9/11. We had a couple of SAS guys with us, and police escorts even if two or three of us went out to dinner. There were metal detectors at the hotel entrance and on the players corridors. Our last two tours of Sri Lanka have seen some pretty intense security too. But nothing happened, nothing on the scale of the tragedy in Mumbai.         
	This week I was due to be in Mumbai with the rest of Englands high performance squad. It was only at the last minute that our training camp was switched to Bangalore. I dont know why it was switched but we could have been there in one of those hotels when they were attacked.         
	Instead, on Wednesday morning, I woke up in my room at the stadium in Bangalore where the performance squad were staying. We were going to have four or five hours of middle practice, but it was a Headingley-style day of overcast drizzle.         
	All I had was a 15-minute net against some local Indian spinners, all of them very like Harbhajan and Kumble and Mishra, so it was very useful and enjoyable.         
	In the afternoon we watched the international at Cuttack on TV and Kevin Pietersens hundred. We tried to work out how to bowl at Sehwag and talked about game-plans, but there werent too many plans offered for bowling at him, not on these wickets.         
	At 11.15 that night our head coach David Parsons called me to his room in the stadium. England wanted a replacement for Stuart Broad who had pulled up with a hamstring, and someone else in case Fred (Andrew Flintoff) was rested from one of the last two ODIs.         
	We came up with Sajid Mahmood and Amjad Khan, although it might have been a chance for Adil Rashid, because hes young and exciting and at 5-0 down you have to try and find some positives. Then a few minutes into this meeting the phone rang in David Parsons room and it was our liaison man Sachin ringing to say Mumbai has been bombed. We stuck the TV on, and saw the Taj where Ive spent so many nights and the Oberoi where Ive spent so many evenings.         
	In the morning I woke up to a number of texts from people back home who thought I was in Mumbai, and I wanted to go home and get back to my two kids. I didnt think we were under threat in Bangalore, and history to date says cricketers are safe.         
	But our security man said we couldnt go in our England kit to the hotel where we eat 60 yards across the road from the stadium, and wed have to go in cars, we couldnt walk. We were told we couldnt go to any of the hotels in Bangalore that westerners use.         
	 I can imagine the England squad in Bhubaneshwar must have been going through some really tough meetings. I just hope the decision is taken out of the players hands, and that it is not a financial decision but is made with their wellbeing  and the supporters and media  first and foremost.

	Colombo: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will not compel the eight participating countries to field their best teams in Septembers Champions Trophy.         
	We cant do that We assume that all countries will send their best players to Pakistan, but if thats not done, we cant do anything, a very senior ICC official told The Telegraph.         
	He added: You must remember that nobody, not even the ICC, can force anybody to play in a tournament if the person himself doesnt want to Its something we just cant get into.         
	There are concerns that top players from Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa wont make themselves available owing to strong reservations over security.         
	That the Champions Trophy would stay in Pakistan was confirmed by the ICC on Thursday evening.         
	The very senior ICC official, by the way, maintained that only Sri Lanka had been listed as an alternative. According to him, South Africa and England havent been in the picture.

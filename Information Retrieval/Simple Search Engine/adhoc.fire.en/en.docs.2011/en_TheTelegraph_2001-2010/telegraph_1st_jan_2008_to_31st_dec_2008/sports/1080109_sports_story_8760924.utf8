The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania: Got to improve a few things
                                                Sania: Got to improve a few things
                      
	Hobart: As one of the most recognisable faces in India, Sania Mirza is already something of an expert when it comes to dealing with pressure.         
	The eyes of a sporting nation will again be upon her at next weeks Australian Open but Sania believes her relaxed nature, as much as her ability, will be a key factor in helping her to have a strong run at Melbourne Park.         
	Having broken into the top 30 last year, Sania, one of the hardest hitters on the WTA Tour, has been tipped as one of the players to watch in 2008.         
	However, she said she was in no hurry to prove herself.         
	Its getting better, and it will come  if not next week then by Melbourne and if not by Melbourne then in Fed Cup, the world No. 31 said in an interview. I am obviously not completely happy because I still feel like I have a few things to improve, but its coming together.         
	Sania missed two months in early 2007 after knee surgery and struggled with right wrist and abdominal injuries late last year, causing an early end to her season.         
	Staying fit, Sania said, was her immediate priority. At this point I would just like to stay healthy. Last year I said I wanted to be (in the) top 30, I said it to myself  I didnt really tell anyone else. When I did get injured, it seemed like everything was going out the window, I really dont want to look too far ahead of myself.         
	Sania suffered from soreness in her first outing of the year, at the Hopman Cup in Perth, and admitted that every time she feels some pain, she worries it might be a long-term injury.         
	You dont freak out but it is a bit concerning, she said. But you just have to live with the injuries, its part of sport. You just have to keep taking care of yourself but I think its only early season soreness.         
	Sanias best Grand Slam showing was a fourth round appearance at the US Open in 2005 and she has never been beyond round three in three visits to Melbourne Park. Most probably I will be seeded, which is a good thing. You dont meet one of the big players in the first or second rounds which is obviously good, she said.

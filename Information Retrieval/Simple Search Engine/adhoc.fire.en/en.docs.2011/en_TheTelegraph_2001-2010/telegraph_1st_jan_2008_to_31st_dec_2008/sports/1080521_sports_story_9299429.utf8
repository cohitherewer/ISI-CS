            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian football received a boost on Tuesday when the AFC decided to include an Indian club side for the revamped AFC Champions League in 2009. According to the AIFF sources, the I-League champions in the 2008-09 season are likely to play in the prestigious competition.         
	The AFC Pro-League committee, which met in Kuala Lumpur, has included India in the first list of 11 countries it has recommended for the 2009 AFC champions League, Asias richest meet for elite clubs.         
	Japan, Korea Republic, Australia, China, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Iran and India have been confirmed as participants, after a thorough assessment of their eligibility, in the 2009 edition to be re-launched on completely professional lines, AFC sources said.         
	There is however, apprehension in some quarters that the AFC move may show Indian clubs in poorer light in continental meets.         
	Given the current standard, Indian clubs would find it hard to compete against Japan or Australian clubs, said an official. In the present AFC Club championships format, two Indian teams get a chance to play against clubs whose rankings are almost similar to Indian clubs.         
	Even Bob Houghton (national coach) doesnt like exposing the national team to far superior opponents and wants the team to grow gradually. What was the need for the AIFF to accept this offer? the official wondered.

                                                   Celtics Messi ending 
                      
	Glasgow: Argentine striker Lionel Messi hit a double as Barcelona beat Celtic 3-2 in the first leg of their Champions League first knockout round tie at Parkhead on Wednesday.         
	The Spanish side came back twice from behind to eventually sink Celtic with Messis winner 11 minutes from the end of a thrilling match that marked their 100th win in the European Cup.         
	Celtic had led after 16 minutes through Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink before Messi levelled two minutes later. Midfielder Barry Robson put the home side in front again before the break but Thierry Henry pulled one back early in the second half.         
	Celtic keeper Artur Boruc pulled off a fine, parrying save after 12 minutes, diving to his left to turn away a rasping shot from Andres Iniesta.         
	Three minutes later, the home side went ahead with a fabulous diving header by striker Dutch striker Vennegoor of Hesselink.         
	Barcelona levelled on 18 minutes via a Messi goal.         
	Barcelona hit back again when Henry moved just inside the penalty area on the left before curling a rising shot around Boruc and just inside the right post on 52 minutes.         
	Messi pounced to put Barcelona ahead for the first time when Celtic failed to clear in the box. (Reuters)

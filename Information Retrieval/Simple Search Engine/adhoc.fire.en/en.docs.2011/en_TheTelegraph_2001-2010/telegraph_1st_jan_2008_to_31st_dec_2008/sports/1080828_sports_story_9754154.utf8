The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kuznetsova shrugs off early jitters to go past Cirstea
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kuznetsova shrugs off early jitters to go past Cirstea
    - Federer teaches Gonzalez a lesson
  -   Paes-Dlouhy through to second round                   Svetlana Kuznetsova after her victory over Sorana Cirstea at Flushing Meadows on Wednesday                           
	New York: Svetlana Kuznetsova shook off an early break and rallied to a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 victory over Sorana Cirstea on Wednesday in the second round of the US Open.         
	Kuznetsova, the 2004 champion and No. 3 seed this year, trailed 4-2 in the opening set before getting back on serve and eventually forcing a tiebreak that she dominated against her 18-year-old opponent. She cruised to a 5-0 lead in the second and closed out the match in 1 hour, 13 minutes at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Olympic champion Elena Dementieva stepped up a gear to reach the third round with a 6-2, 6-1 demolition of Pauline Parmentier of France.         
	Having been pushed hard by Uzbekistans Akgul Amanmuradova in her opening match, the Russian fifth seed was never in trouble and cruised past the world number 49 in 58 minutes.         
	Parmentier, 22, who has never been beyond round two at a Grand Slam, broke Dementieva twice but did not hold her own serve in the opening set. An early break put Dementieva ahead in the second set and she cruised through to a meeting with unseeded Briton Anne Keothavong.         
	No. 15 seed Patty Schnyder also moved into the third round with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the US Open girls champion two years ago.         
	In just her fourth career Grand Slam event, Cirstea is forging a bit of a bad habit. Cirstea, who made her debut at a major in this years Australian Open, led there by a break three times in the opening set against current world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, only to fall 5-7, 3-6 in the first-round match.         
	She reached the second round at the French Open and Wimbledon.         
	Roger Federer had a stellar showing under the lights Tuesday as he played the unfamiliar role of No. 2 seed.         
	For a while in the first set, Federer couldnt shake Maximo Gonzalez, who was making his Flushing Meadows debut. No easy task any time, but way worse to get your feet wet against the man that had been ranked first in the world for 4 1/2 years until last week.         
	One or 2 is always pretty much the same thing, the 27-year-old Federer said of his seeding. The change I feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me Im still No. 1 and still the best.         
	Federer ran off wins in 10 straight games over three sets to turn a competitive match into the rout everyone expected. It took only 1 hour, 22 minutes for Federer to look familiarly fearsome in a dominating 6-3, 6-0, 6-3 win.         
	French Open runner-up Safina, who has a 16-1 win-loss record since Wimbledon, was joined by her hot-headed brother Marat Safin in the last 64.         
	Safin raged and ranted at umpire Carlos Bernades after he was controversially foot-faulted on a second serve late in the fourth set against Vince Spadea but he eventually put a lid on his emotions to carve out a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 win.         
	Fourth seed Serena Williams began her title charge with a 6-1, 6-4 thumping of Kateryna Bondarenko and her sister Venus protected the family reputation with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Samantha Stosur.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy advanced to the second round beating the Spanish pair of Oscar Hernandez and Albert Montanes 6-7 (2-7), 6-1, 6-4.

 - Third Test 

 - 
 Dravid dismissed for 93; Sachin falls to debatable decision

	Perth: Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar and former skipper Rahul Dravid made half-centuries before Australia fought back with a flurry of wickets on an absorbing opening day of the third Test on Wednesday.
 
	Dravid top scored with 93 while Tendulkar made 71 after steering India out of trouble early on to reach stumps on 297 for six in their first innings. 
 
	The Australians captured four wickets in the last session to earn a share of the honours on Day I but still need to run through the Indian tail quickly on Thursday to enhance their chances of a world record 17th consecutive Test win.
 
	Ricky Pontings team, who were on their best behaviour after being condemned for their on-field conduct in the last test in Sydney, removed Indian openers in the morning session but needed three hours to break the Tendulkar-Dravid partnership.
 
	The pair had little trouble coping with Australias four-prong pace attack on a Waca pitch that failed to live up to its reputation as the worlds fastest and bounciest wicket.
 
	They added 139 runs for the third wicket and were unlucky not to have piled on a few more when Tendulkar was the victim of a dubious umpiring decision from Pakistan official Asad Rauf.
 
	Tendulkar, who made an unbeaten century in Sydney, looked to be on his way to another hundred after striking nine boundaries when he was given out lbw to Brett Lee to a ball that appeared to be sailing over the top of the bails.
 
	Dravid, back in his preferred batting position at number three after opening in the first two Tests, threw his wicket away in sight of a hundred with a reckless shot.
 
	The former skipper had a let off on 11 when he was dropped by Michael Clarke at first slip but batted sensibly after that, hitting 15 boundaries and occupying the crease for four and a half hours.
 
	But he blew his chance of making a ton while smacking spinner Andrew Symonds out of the ground but mistimed the shot and skied a simple catch to Ponting at mid-off.
 
	Australia had captured two wickets before lunch to put the brakes on Indias best start to the series, with Mitchell Johnson dismissing Virender Sehwag for 29 and Lee removing Wasim Jaffer for 16.
 
	Both batsmen fell to regulation catches behind the stumps to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist just after the first drinks break after putting on 57 for the opening wicket.
 
	Sehwag, making his first Test appearance in over a year, was first to go. The dashing righthander had played and missed several times but struck six boundaries before his luck ran out and he got a thick edge off left-arm paceman Johnson.
 
	Jaffer, who kept his place in the side despite failing to make a big score in the first two Tests, adopted a more cautious approach, batting for over an hour and a half and striking two fours, before Lee found the edge.
 
	Dravid and Tendulkar batted through the entire middle session but Tendulkars departure after tea triggered a minor collapse.
 
	Saurav Ganguly made just nine when he was brilliantly caught at gully by Mike Hussey off Johnson, and V.V.S. Laxman went for 27 when he skied a shot off Lee to Shaun Tait, who was making his first appearance in over two years.
 
	The opening day was played in good spirits after both teams promised to be on their best behaviour after the ugly fallout to the last match in Sydney.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Perfect Test, says Smith
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Perfect Test, says Smith
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: South African captain Graeme Smith on Saturday described the comprehensive win over India as a perfect one, saying he would now aim for a 2-0 finish in the series.         
	.It was a perfect Test for us from start to finish We performed according to our plans and took wickets at the right time. A terrific experience, Smith told a news conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Indias decision to bat first         
	The wicket was pretty good and I would have done the same thing if I had won the toss.         
	The victory         
	It was a perfect Test for us from start to finish. Once the bowlers gave us the advantage in the first session of the match, we dominated throughout. We performed according to our plans and took wickets at the right time. A terrific experience. Weve been really focused around this series and the things we want to achieve. We have worked towards this day for a long time. Its the start of a big season for us.         
	Success in the subcontinent         
	As a captain, probably this is the first time I feel I have a bowling attack that can be successful in the subcontinent. All the batters have been comfortable in their roles and have performed well right thorough the series in Pakistan, Bangladesh and here.         
	Batting         
	It has been an exceptional batting display. Jacquess 30th hundred was terrific for South Africa. AB (de Villiers) is a such young guy and his double hundred has come at the right time for us. I believe this is a big stepping stone for his career. Overall, it was a terrific team performance. Everyone showed their mettle.         
	Plans for the final Test         
	We have a couple of days at our disposal. We want to be focused and win the series. My primary focus will be on how to keep the team in the right frame of mind We will repeat our Ahmedabad performance in Kanpur. We want to win the series 2-0.         
	Makhaya Ntinis role         
	This is a big transition for Ntini He needed to make as the leader of the (bowling) pack and he has led by example. (Dale) Steyn and (Morne) Morkel are still young and Ntini has shown good leadership t was hard work for the bowlers today (Saturday) on a heavy outfield but he stuck to it. Im proud of him.

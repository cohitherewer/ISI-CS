                                                   Krkic leads Barcelona to 4-1 victory
                      
	Madrid: A second-half double from forward Bojan Krkic helped Barcelona to their first league victory in four outings as they overcame a nervous spell to beat Valladolid 4-1 at home on Sunday.         
	The victory left the Catalans four points behind leaders Real Madrid, who have a game in hand against Valencia.         
	Barcelona headed into the match under heavy pressure after taking just one point from their previous three league games and losing to Valencia in the semi-finals of the Kings Cup.         
	They looked edgy after Valladolid midfielder Jonathan Sesma cancelled out a Samuel Eto goal with a penalty on the half hour, but Andres Iniesta settled their nerves when he restored their lead at the start of the second half.         
	Krkic made it 3-1. Clipping in from a tight angle just after the hour, and capped an outstanding display when he poked home from a metre after Eto had swerved round the keeper and slid a pass across the face of the goal.         
	Villarreal remain two points behind Barcelona in third spot after goals from Matias Fernandez and Guillermo Franco earned them a 2-1 win at basement side Levante.         
	Relegation-threatened Real Murcia claimed their first win since Javier Clemente took charge as coach at the start of the month with an emphatic 4-0 win at home to Espanyol.

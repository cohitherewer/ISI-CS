	London: Manchester United needed a late equaliser from Carlos Tevez to draw 1-1 at Blackburn Rovers on Saturday and stay on track to win the Premier League title.         
	The reigning champions were trailing to Roque Santa Cruzs 21st minute opener for Rovers before Tevez flicked in a header three minutes from time after a long spell of United pressure.         
	The point leaves United three points above second-placed Chelsea with three games remaining, starting with next weekends clash between the sides at Stamford Bridge, although United also have a superior goal difference.         
	United have 81 points, Chelsea are on 78 and Arsenal, who beat Reading 2-0, are third with 74. Liverpool are in fourth place with 69 points after a 2-0 victory at Fulham.         
	Bolton Wanderers won 1-0 at Middlesbrough to move out of the bottom three, Wigan Athletic drew 1-1 with Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United beat Derby County 2-1.         
	Reading could find themselves in the relegation zone on Sunday should Birmingham beat Aston Villa.         
	While Bolton earned a second consecutive 1-0 victory to claw themselves towards safety, things were looking grim for Fulham.         
	Jermaine Pennant and Peter Crouch, both of whom are unlikely to start in Liverpools Champions League semi-final, first leg against Chelsea next week, were on target to leave Fulham five points from the safety zone with three games to play.         
	Liverpool are now eight points clear of fifth-placed Everton and on target for a Champions League qualifying place next season.         
	Arsenals title hopes disintegrated in the last few weeks but they gave their fans some cheer with just their second win in nine league games to keep themselves in the hunt for second place, although they must bridge a four-point gap on Chelsea.         
	Reading held out for 30 minutes before Emmanuel Adebayor showed a delightful touch to make space in the area and side-foot a shot past American keeper Marcus Hahnemann for his 21st league goal of the season.         
	Eight minutes later Steve Coppells side had a mountain to climb when Gilberto Silvas shot brushed off the forehead of Andre Bikey and beyond the diving Hahnemann.         
	In Italy, AS Roma failed to put full pressure on Serie A leaders Inter Milan after Alessandro Diamantis late free kick snatched a 1-1 draw for strugglers Livorno on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shah Rukh Khan promises amicable solution to Eden ticket impasse
                                                   Shah Rukh Khan promises amicable solution to Eden ticket impasse
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan has promised to sort out the ticket distribution impasse at the Eden amicably.         
	I and my company have not come to this city to create any kind of stress. We are going to sit down and sort this out amicably. We hope to carry the true spirit of cricket forward We will talk with the CAB till a solution is arrived at, he said.         
	We are all part of a team and will make sure everyone remains happy. This is the first thing we will work on. Even the CAB is part of our team. We want to spread the message of love. And the rates will be affordable, the star added.         
	Shah Rukhs Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd are the franchise owners of Kolkata Knight Riders and are entitled to keep 80 per cent of the total seats in each block. This has caused a furore and president Prasun Mukherjee, who was present at the launch, has been given the responsibility of finding a solution.         
	A meeting between Red Chillies Entertainment and the CAB officials remained inconclusive on Tuesday and Mukherjee is likely to have another round of meeting in Mumbai on Thursday.         
	Shah Rukh said he would be present in person for every match at the Eden during the April 18-June 1 extravaganza.         
	Would he be interested in investing in other sport? Ive done a movie to help hockey. Cricket will help me leverage some money, hopefully, which I can spend in other streams I want this to be a platform for other sport, be it football, kho kho, gili danda         
	John Buchanan felt the Indian Premier League (IPL) provides cricket in India one big opportunity.         
	There are players from different backgrounds with varying skill. And there will be long term benefits, the coach said.         
	Is he a bit apprehensive about the presence of Sourav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting and Shoaib Akhtar in the same team?         
	Its nice to have a few hot heads in the side It will lend to the spirit of the side and Im sure the team will benefit from their knowledge and experience, Buchanan said.         
	For Shah Rukh, there are no favourites.         
	Twenty20 is a format that depends on the players performance on the given day And as John said, its not just about the ones who makes runs but also about the guys who stop them. Thats excitement, he said.         
	Sourav was cautious too. Twenty20 format reduces the gap between the players abilities. We will need quality as the games get longer. All teams are well balanced.         
	Buchanan said that the players, except from India and the West Indies who will be busy with national commitments, are likely to assemble in the city on April 12. Kolkata Knight Riders open versus Bangalore Royal Challengers on April 18.         
	Kunal Dasgupta, CEO, Sony Entertainment Television was among others present at the launch.

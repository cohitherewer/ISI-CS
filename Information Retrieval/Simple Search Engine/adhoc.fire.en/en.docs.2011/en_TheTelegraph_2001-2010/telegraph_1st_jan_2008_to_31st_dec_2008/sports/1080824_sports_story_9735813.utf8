            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: Team India coach Gary Kirsten lauded the performance of youngsters Virat Kohli and Subramaniam Badrinath and said it was very important for Indian cricket that there is competition for places.         
	The following are excerpts:         
	On the Premadasa pitch         
	I havent had a look at it yet today (Saturday). Yesterday (Friday) it looked like it had a fair amount of grass on but we will wait and see it at half past one tomorrow (Sunday). Thats when it is going to be important. We are going to have a look at the conditions tomorrow. They are obviously leaving a fair amount of grass on it now to keep it together because there will be three games here. We will wait till tomorrow to see what it looks like.         
	On Indias team combination         
	We havent decided on our combination yet.         
	On Gautam Gambhirs availability         
	He is fit to play, yes.         
	If Virat Kohli will open the batting         
	Gambhir is going to be back, so we will more than likely look at the two of them.We are discussing our various combinations at the moment.         
	On the new faces         
	Obviously, with the injuries that we have had, we have got a couple of new faces which is good to see.We would like to be pretty flexible in our combinations and we will take it game by game.         
	On the performance of the youngsters         
	Both the young players did play well. Kohli and Badrinath played really well. I am obviously very happy with that, to see young players coming in and making a claim for further honours. I was very happy with their performances.

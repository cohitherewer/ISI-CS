	Calcutta: Yusif Yakubu believes East Bengal have the potential to bag this years I-League title and a good start will definitely help them in the process.         
	I believe this is a good team with the potential to win the I-League this year, the Ghanaian told The Telegraph after the practice session at Barasat stadium on Monday.         
	East Bengal will face city rivals United SC in their opening I-League match on Friday here.         
	According to Yakubu, who will sign for East Bengal in a day or two, the first match for a team is not only important but also a difficult one.         
	A win in the first match would be a great result and will surely be a boost for the red-and-gold brigade for the marathon national league, he said.         
	We need to build up the spirit the winning spirit. The first match is important and a win will surely be a great boost for us, Yakubu said.         
	Hailing East Bengals newly appointed coach Stanley Rozario, he said: He is a great coach. He was with national coach Bob Houghton and knows the tricks very well.         
	Asked if he was facing any problems after shifting from his regular position of a forward to the mid-field, Yakubu quipped: Its completely okay for me. The coach is the best man to place his players I am a professional player and I should follow his instructions.

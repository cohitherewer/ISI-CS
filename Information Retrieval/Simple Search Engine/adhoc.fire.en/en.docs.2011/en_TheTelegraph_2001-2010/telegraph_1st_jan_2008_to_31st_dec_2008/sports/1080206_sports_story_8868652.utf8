The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee may get a break
                                                Lee may get a break
                      
	Melbourne: After Shaun Taits sudden withdrawal, Australian selectors have realised the need to rest their other speedster, Brett Lee, who will be used sparingly during the ongoing tri-series.         
	Lee said he might get a rest at any time after the match against Sri Lanka in Sydney on Friday in the wake of Taits surprise indefinite break to deal with physical and mental stress.         
	I have bowled a lot of balls this summer and my workload has increased a fair bit. Well have to wait and see (about a rest). Im looking forward to playing in Sydney in front of my home crowd, and well see what happens after that.         
	Coach Tim Nielsen said that even though Lee was the leader of the bowling attack, he needed to be kept fresh.         
	His resilience has been outstanding, he is in such a great vein of form. That is why it is critical that we do give him a spell at some stage in order to increase his longevity for as long as possible, Nielsen said.

	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman became Indias number one singles player after achieving a career best ranking of 201, eclipsing Prakash Amritraj, who follows him next at 214.         
	Somdevs giant-killing spree at the Nashville Challenger, where he beat a couple of top-100 players, helped him leapfrog 40 places to get past Prakash.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes hung on to their sixth and 10th places, respectively, in the doubles rankings.         
	Out of action Sania Mirza remained at number 99 in womens singles ranking.           (AGENCIES)

	Nassers father no more   
	London: Jawad Hussain, father of former England captain Nasser Hussain, died of heart and lung failure following a bout of pneumonia, his family said on Monday. He was 68. His funeral is likely to be held on Friday. Jawad, better known as Joe, passed away on Saturday after being in the ICU for nearly 45 days.  
	Joe played only one first-class match for the erstwhile Madras State against Andhra Pradesh in the 1964-65 Ranji Trophy  a game that Madras won.         
	After obtaining a science degree from Loyola College in Chennai, Joe immigrated to England in 1963 where he met and married his English wife Patricia. He returned to Chennai two years later where Nasser was born in 1968.         
	The family went back to England in 1975 where Joe ran a successful indoor cricket school where Nassers skills were honed.         
	Srinath role

	Shoaib case         
	 Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar on Monday recorded his statement before the three-man appellate tribunal which is hearing his appeal against the five-year ban imposed on him by the PCBs disciplinary committee. Fans were present outside the National Cricket Academy in Lahore when Shoaib arrived for the first session of the tribunals regular hearing that is expected to be completed in a weeks time.         
	The fans carried placards and banners against the ban and proclaiming the fast bowler as the hero of Pakistan cricket. They also raised slogans against PCB chairman Naseem Ashraf before being removed by the police and dispersed peacefully.         
	Speed theory         
	 Karachi: The Asian bloc  along with the cricket boards of South Africa and Zimbabwe  combined to force ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed out of his job prematurely as they felt the Australian was biased against them. Sources in the PCB revealed that the PCB ganged up with its Asian counterparts in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka  apart from the South Africans and Zimbabweans  to force Speed out.

	Istanbul: Ferraris Felipe Massa won the Turkish Grand Prix from pole position for the third year in a row on Sunday after tyre concerns slowed Lewis Hamiltons challenge.         
	The Brazilian took the chequered flag 3.7 seconds ahead of the 23-year-old McLaren driver, who ran most of the race on the harder tyres and had to make three pitstops compared to his rivals two.         
	It was Massas seventh win in Formula One, at the anti-clockwise track where he took his first in 2006, and his second in five races this season.         
	Ferraris world champion Kimi Raikkonen saw his overall lead trimmed to seven points from nine after finishing a close third. The Finn, the only driver to score points in every race this season, now has 35 to Massa and Hamiltons 28.         
	Massas win was champions Ferraris fourth in a row and meant that the Turkish Grand Prix, which made its debut in 2005, has still only ever been won by the driver on pole position.         
	Three of his wins have come in Turkey, prompting a suggestion that the Brazilian should change nationality: I think I can get a passport here already, he grinned.         
	Polands Robert Kubica was fourth, ahead of BMW Sauber teammate Nick Heidfeld.         
	Double world champion Fernando Alonso put Renault back in the points with sixth place while Australian Mark Webber was seventh to score for the fourth race in a row. Germanys Nico Rosberg took the final point for Williams.         
	Massa led from the start while Hamilton, winner of the season-opener in Australia, accelerated past his McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen from third on the grid with Kubica close behind.         
	The safety car came out at the end of the opening lap when Italian Giancarlo Fisichellas Force India slammed into the back of Kazuki Nakajimas Williams at the first corner, leaving debris on the track.         
	Kovalainen, coming back from a big accident two weeks ago and making his first start on the front row, went to the back of the field when he pitted at the end of the second lap with a puncture after banging wheels with Raikkonen. He finished 12th.         
	Hamilton pitted after 16 laps and then brilliantly overtook Massa, who had come in three laps later, for the lead on lap 24.

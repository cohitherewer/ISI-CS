                                                                                                                                                                                                     Not going to pay fine: Churchill
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Churchill Brothers official Churchill Alemao on Friday refused to pay the fine of Rs 50,000 imposed on him by the AIFF for abusing and threatening the match officials during the I-League match against Dempo last Wednesday.         
	Churchill, who was fined by the disciplinary committee because of his irresponsible behaviour in the match, said: I am not going to pay the fine. I will appeal against the verdict, but even if they decide to uphold the penalty, I will not pay anything. The AIFF is free to take any action they deem fit.         
	Accusing the federation of promoting inept referees, Churchill claimed that his team was not able to win the National League (now I-League) at least five times in the past 12 years because of poor supervision.         
	Commenting on Churchills outburst, an AIFF official said the federation was aware of the situation. Let Churchill give it in writing . He has been given time till November 20 to appeal against the verdict.

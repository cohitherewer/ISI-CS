The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka looking to wrap it up today
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lanka looking to wrap it up today
  - FINAL TEST
  -   Mendis, not Sachin, creates crickets newest record         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ajantha Mendis celebrates the dismissal of Parthiv Patel in Colombo on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Colombo: It was assumed that a world record would be rewritten during the ongoing three-Test series. One has been broken, all right, but not the one thought of.         
	So, the newest world record-holder in cricket is young mystery-spinner Ajantha Mendis and not Sachin Tendulkar. Somewhat ironically, its the icons wicket which gave Mendis the record.         
	Sachin landed in Sri Lanka 172 runs short of overtaking Brian Laras tally of 11,953. The series (for the Idea Cup) has ended for the senior-most pro and all he has to show in six innings is 95.         
	Its only the fourth time in a career spanning nearly 19 years that Sachin couldnt get into three-figures in a series.         
	Armyman Mendis, on the other hand, began as a rookie and in five-and-a-half innings has already taken 25 wickets, one more than Alec Bedser, who held the record for a three-Test series.         
	That one too, set in the summer of 1946, had been against India. Clearly, Anil Kumbles team has maintained the tradition of being generous towards debutants.         
	Coupled with another awful batting display  for the fifth time in this short series  it has landed India on the doorstep of defeat in the decider at the P. Sara Stadium.         
	At stumps on Day III, the Indians were 14 ahead, but had lost five wickets in the second innings. At the crease were Rahul Dravid (46), finally doing justice to The Wall label, and a hobbling V.V.S. Laxman on 17.         
	Cricket is known to produce strange results, but most reckon that the series will end on Monday itself. If it does, it can only result in another thumping win for Sri Lanka.         
	Of course, were looking to wrap it up... Wrap it up in the best manner, a supremely confident Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan captain, told The Telegraph on returning to the Taj Samudra.         
	The Sri Lankans began Sunday two runs in front on the first innings and eventually stretched that lead to a very significant 147.         
	Both overnighters, centurion Kumar Sangakkara and Prasanna Jayawardene, were in the consolidation-mode. Later, debutant Dammika Prasad showed hes no bunny and got 36 at No. 9. Mendis, who bats in the lower middle-order on the domestic circuit, helped himself to 17.         
	Crucial runs all.         
	The Sri Lankan innings went beyond the first hour after lunch and the Indian openers, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, had to again take guard under pressure.         
	Both attacked, as comes naturally, and paid the price for being in a rush. Sehwag perished (actually, to a superb Thilan Samaraweera catch) while cutting Prasad and Gambhir played on in pulling the same bowler.         
	Debutants looking to make an impact could draw much inspiration from Prasad.         
	With Sachin and Laxman far from fit, the Indian batting order had to be recast and Sourav Ganguly came at No. 4. Despite a reprieve, he didnt stay long, falling to a Muttiah Muralidharan doosra.         
	Instead of sweeping, Sourav should have played straight. He didnt and ended the series with as few as 96 runs.         
	At 36, Souravs not getting any younger and, no matter how outstanding 2007 was, questions are bound to be asked before the next Test series  at home versus Australia.         
	Parthiv Patel, who was pretty good behind the stumps, too got promoted, but couldnt survive more than a few minutes. His dismissal made it 109 for four.         
	In walked Sachin, with the injured left elbow reinforced. He survived two referrals, but fell to a Mendis googly and only earned kudos for disregarding pain and attempting to halt Sri Lankas march.         
	Watching the procession from the other end was Dravid. Laxman, batting with a runner, kept him company with sensible cricket. They have featured in epic partnerships, but few are willing to lay a wager on a repeat here.         
	The (left ankle) pain is quite a bit... Im on pain-killers... Im doing the best I can, said Laxman, speaking exclusively.         
	Ishant Sharma is better, but theres no guarantee that hell bowl again on the tour. Hes been rested for the ODIs and, so, wont be staying back after this Test.         
	The Sri Lankans, incidentally, have exhausted the three referrals allowed in an innings. Its not a worry... Were back to (Test) cricket the way it was a month ago, quipped Sangakkara.         
	That two of the referrals were used against Sachin (Sourav was the target of the first) indicated that getting him was an absolute priority for Sri Lanka.         
	In form or not, Sachins remains the biggest wicket.

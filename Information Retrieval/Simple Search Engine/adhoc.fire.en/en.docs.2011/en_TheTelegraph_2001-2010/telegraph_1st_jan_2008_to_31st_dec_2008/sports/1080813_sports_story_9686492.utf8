	Gaziantep (Turkey): International Master D Harika survived a scare before signing peace with compatriot Soumya Swaminathan in the ninth round of the World Junior Girls Chess Championship here on Tuesday.         
	Harika took her tally to 7.5 points out of a possible nine and remained a half point adrift of nearest rivals Mariya Muzychuk of Ukraine and Miranda Mikadze of Georgia.         
	Sharing the fourth place is Soumya who now has 6.5 points in her bag along with Guliskhan Nakhbayeva of Kazakhstan.         
	Playing the white side of a queen pawn opening, Harika handed the initiative to Soumya after giving a pawn. Playing the middle game energetically Soumya even refused a peace proposal but latter agreed to the draw once she missed out on finding the best continuation after trading of queens.         
	For the first time in the event, none of the Indian girls managed to score a full as all games involving Indians ended in draws.         
	The other all Indian duel was fought between Kruttika Nadig and R Preethi and the peace was signed after fortunes fluctuated both ways at different points in this Sicilian Sveshnikov game.         
	Mary Ann Gomess hunt for an elusive victory continued as she was forced to split the point with Khayala Isgandarova of Azerbaijan. (PTI)

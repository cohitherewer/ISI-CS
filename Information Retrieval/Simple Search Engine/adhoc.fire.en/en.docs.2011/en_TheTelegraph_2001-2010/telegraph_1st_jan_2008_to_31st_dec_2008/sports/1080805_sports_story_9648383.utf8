The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Resurgent EB face Mohun Bagan test
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Resurgent EB face Mohun Bagan test
  - Edmilson return to boost red-and-golds karim talks tough         A STAFF REPORTER            Suley Musah and Edmilson Marques share a light moment during East Bengals practice at the club ground on Monday                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengal have a history of making comebacks whenever they start underdogs. The red-and-golds believe that they will repeat their history when they take on archrivals Mohun Bagan in the Sahara CFL Premier Division clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The red-and-gold brigade, and coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, believe they will make a strong show on Tuesday and prove their critics wrong.         
	Bhattarcharjee, however, didnt sound that convincing with a shadow of uncertainty looming large over key players Alvito D Cunha, Sanju Pradhan and Dharamjit Singh. While Alvito is suffering from a groin injury, Dharamjit and Sanju are not yet match fit. And with the absence of several key players  representing the country in the ongoing AFC Challenge Cup  things are not going to be easy for East Bengal when they take on the green-and-maroons.

	However, the juniors  Chhangte Malsawmkima, Khangebam Jibon Singh, Nirmal Chhetri, Saikat Saha Roy  have gelled well and according to coach Bhattacharjee it might prove crucial in Tuesdays match.         
	After a lacklustre start in the CFL, followed by a 1-3 drubbing at the hands of Mohammedan Sporting, Manoranjans men have put up a good show in their last two outings. But, in a match against Mohun Bagan, a players form, class and name hardly matters.         
	East Bengal, though, will breathe a sigh of relief with Edmilson Marques (still unfit) ready to share space with Ashim Biswas.         
	Much depends on back-to-form striker Ashim and the support he garners from the midfield from Jayanta Sen, Mehtab Hossain, Malsawmkima and Dipankar Roy. With Ghanaian Suley Musah as the mentor, the East Bengal citadel is likely to be guarded by Anupam Sarkar, captain M. Suresh and Nirmal Chhetri.                     
	This will be a turnaround match. We are a much-balanced side now The last two wins have helped us regain confidence, Bhattacharjee quipped.                   
	Speaking about Mohun Bagan, he said: They are a much better-placed team But you know Instances are there when East Bengal came back strongly and tomorrow (Tuesday) will be such a day. The Calcutta Football League is tougher than the National League and there can be ups and downs and I am confident of turning things around.         
	He, however, declined to divulge whether he has any specific plans to stop the combination of Jose Ramirez Barreto and P.C. Lalawmpuiya combination. A confident Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencherifa is sure of bagging full points. The green-and-maroon brigade are raring to unleash an attacking game to fetch their sixth victory on trot at the Salt Lake Stadium. Karim is confident of extending their two points lead in the CFL.         
	Clearly Mohun Bagan have an edge over East Bengal with the presence of S. Malsawmtluanga and Lalawmpuiya (4 goals each) and Barreto (3), Karim too is keeping his cards close to his chest.         
	Aware of the loopholes in his opponents armour, the Moroccan feels that if his boys stick to their attacking plan, they will clinch victory on Tuesday.         
	We would be a better side on the field tomorrow and certainly confident of winning it. We are committed and worked hard to be in that confident position, Karim said.         
	With no injuries to worry about, Karim is expected to field Barreto and Lalawmpuiya in the striking zone. Lalkamal Bhowmick, S. Malsawmtluanga, L. James Singh (junior) and S. James Singh are likely be in the midfield. Habibur Rehman Mondal, Peter Odafe, J. Anand Vasan and N. Mohan Raj will patrol the defence. Sangram Mukherjee is likely to don the custodians jersey.         
	So, tighten your seat belts and wait for the action to begin.

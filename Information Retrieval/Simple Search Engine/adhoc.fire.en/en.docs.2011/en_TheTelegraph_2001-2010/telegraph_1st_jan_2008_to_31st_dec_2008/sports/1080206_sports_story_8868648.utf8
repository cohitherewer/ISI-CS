  - DULEEP TROPHY 
  -   East manage 163 in 2nd innings                      Anustup hit 44                
	Mumbai: The four-day Duleep Trophy league match between South Zone and East Zone was evenly poised at stumps on Tuesday with both teams placed with an equal chance to force a win on the final day on Wednesday.         
	South bowled out East for a modest 163 in the second innings after having conceded a handy lead of 109 to their rivals and then advanced to 113 for three wickets by close, chasing 273 for victory in a minimum of 120 overs.         
	The hopes of South Zone mainly rested on their captain and most accomplished batsman Subramaniam Badrinath who was unconquered on 42 after a stay of 130 minutes.         
	The other not out batsman was wicketkeeper Prasad Reddy (0) and South required 160 more runs for a win with seven wickets intact on a pitch that still did not show signs of wear and tear.         
	South owed this position mainly to their bowlers, especially spinners R. Ashwin (three for 33) and Pragyan Ojha (two for 54). The duo sliced through the East Zone middle-order after the early breakthroughs provided by medium-pacers N. C. Aiyappa and P. Vijay Kumar. East Zone resumed at the overnight five for no loss on Tuesday.         
	The medium-pacers ended up with two wickets apiece after accounting for openers Shiv Sundar Das and Arindam Das cheaply.         
	East recovered, like in their first innings, through the efforts of wicketkeeper Haladhar Das and his 47-run stand with Tushar Saha (28).           (PTI)

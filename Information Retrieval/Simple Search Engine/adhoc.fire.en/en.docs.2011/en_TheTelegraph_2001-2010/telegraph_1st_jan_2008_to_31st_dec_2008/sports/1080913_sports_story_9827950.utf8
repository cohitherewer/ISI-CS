The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Draw enough for Bagan

    - Brazilians Barreto and Edmilson score in either half for their teams           A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan claimed their 28th local league title on Friday, drawing 1-1 against archrivals East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium and picking up the required point that took them out of second placed Mohammedan Sportings reach in the Sahara CFL Premier Division.         
	The afternoon sun was beating down, the usually vacant stands were brimming with colour  equal measures of red, gold, green and maroon, of course  and the roads leading to the stadium were choc-a-bloc.         
	The mood was perfect for the derby, one that had a lot riding on it. With Mohun Bagan under tremendous pressure, starting with a back four who have never played together, East Bengal expectedly made a brisk start. Rino Anto, Anand Vasan, N.S. Manju and Mohan Raj (who has been no stranger to defensive lapses this season) were tested by Sunil Chhetri and Ashim Biswas within the first ten minutes.         
	In the seventh minute Mohan Raj brought down Ashim inside the box, but referee Mrinanshu Bhattacharya snubbed penalty claims. A blatant shirt tug by Mohan on Ashim saw the referee brandish the first yellow card of the afternoon.         
	He went on to book eight players in a match that saw a generous measure of dissent from players and coaches, as well as sly fouls from both sets of players. Both teams took time to settle, mostly playing square passes with East Bengal making occasional forays down the wings.         
	In the 22nd minute Bagan took the lead, completely against the run of play after a Nirmal Chhetri mistimed tackle on Malswamtluanga won them a just penalty. With the league title at stake, Jose Ramirez Barreto stepped up and scored from the spot, sending home an unstoppable shot that found the top left hand corner.         
	The goal took the wind out of East Bengal as the creativity in the midfield evaporated. Alvito DCunha, Sanju Pradhan and Syed Rahim Nabis crosses from the flanks were being cut off comfortably before they could reach Sunil or Ashim upfront.         
	It was a similar story for Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side in the second period, playing without Nabi (taken off after a kick in the face from S. James Singh) and Mehrajuddin Wadoo and substitute C. Malsawmkima being outthought by young Rakesh Masih and S. James Singh. Sangram Mukherjee under the bars for Bagan went largely untested, protected well by his back four and the defensive midfielders. Barreto too was seen falling back, helping out his side.         
	A wonder strike from substitute Edmilson Marques in the 83rd minute put the celebrations on hold for Bagan, temporarily. The Brazilians powerful right-footed freekick flew past Sangram into the goal bringing a fresh spark in East Bengals play. But it came a little too late for the red-and-gold brigade as Bagan hung on for the draw, buoyed by Bhaichung Bhutias presence on field for the last few minutes.

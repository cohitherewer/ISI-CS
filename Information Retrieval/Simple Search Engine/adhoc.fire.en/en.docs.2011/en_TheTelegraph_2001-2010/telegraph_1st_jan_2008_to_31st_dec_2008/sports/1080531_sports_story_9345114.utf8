            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda                            
	Calcutta: Bengals Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda, who caught the eye during the Kolkata Knight Riders campaign in the Indian Premier League, stand a good chance of making it to the India A squad.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar and Co. are to meet in Mumbai on Saturday and select the A squads for an Emerging tournament in Australia and the tour of Israel.         
	Saha and Dinda have a good chance... Id even go to the extent of saying they are as good as certain to be chosen, one of the selectors told The Tele-graph.         
	While Saha often caught the eye both behind and in front of the stumps, Dinda produced some excellent wicket-taking spells.         
	Saha is 23, Dindas 24.

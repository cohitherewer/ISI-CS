Not content with three, Phelps stalks Spitz | Beijing 2008 | Sports | The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata)

	Beijing: Three finals, three gold medals, three world records. Michael Phelps is not just gunning for Mark Spitzs record of seven golds, he seems intent on winning all his races in world-record time, as Spitz did in 1972.         
	In the 200-meter freestyle Tuesday at the Water Cube, Phelps obliterated the field and his year-old world record. Sixteen months after becoming the first swimmer to crack the 1:44 barrier in the event, he was the first to go under 1:43. Phelps finished in 1 minute 42.96 seconds, nine-tenths a second better than his previous best.         
	The 23-year-old Phelps is famous for not revealing his target times, but by the surprised expression on his face it appeared he exceeded his expectations. Asked if he anticipated going under 1:43, Phelps laughed and said, No, not at all.         
	Park Tae-hwan of South Korea was second, in 1:44.85, and Phelpss teammate, Peter Vanderkaay, the top qualifier in the semi-finals, was third in 1:45.14. Almost two body lengths separated Phelps and Park, who set an Asian record.         
	I knew Tae-hwan was going to have a good last 50, Phelps said, so I tried to start as far ahead as I could in the first 100.         
	Less than an hour after the 200 freestyle, Phelps returned to the pool for the semifinals of the 200 butterfly. He qualified first in 1:53.70, which equalled his Olympic record from the previous night.         
	I didnt have much warm down after the 200 free, but I wanted just to get through the 200 fly race, Phelps said. His victory in the 200 freestyle was his 17th in 19 finals in the event since his third-place showing at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. One of Phelpss two defeats came to Vanderkaay in April, but the world was not watching then.                   
	When the pressure is on, Phelps seems to turn it on. He smashed his world record in the 400-meter individual medley on Sunday and set an American record on his leadoff 100 in the Americans record-setting 4x100 freestyle relay on Monday.         
	 After Phelps took his seat at the interview podium Tuesday, the man moderating the news conference said: So I have nothing to say. Michael Phelps is here now.         
	During the question and answer session that followed, one man asked Phelps, On this planet is there anybody who can defeat you?         
	With a shrug of his broad shoulders, Phelps said, I dont know. He added, I couldnt ask for anything else so far over my first three medal races. I think weve done everything that Ive wanted to do so far. Im very happy with how things are going. Im really happy with how this morning went. I actually watched the 200 free on T.V. and we were just commenting or talking about how my underwaters were pretty good during the race. After Spitz won his sixth gold in 1972, he approached his coach, Sherm Chavoor, and floated the idea of forgoing his final event, the 100-meter freestyle.         
	His target in the Munich Games had been Don Schollanders record of five golds. And having surpassed that, Spitz wondered aloud if it was not better to rest on his laurels than risk seeing his unbeaten streak snapped by Jerry Heidenreich, the other American in the 100, who was also swimming very well.         
	Chavoor talked Spitz into racing in the event, and the rest, as they say, is history. Spitz finished 0.41 of a second ahead of Heidenreich to establish the bulls-eye that Phelps now has in his sights.         
	The comparisons with Spitz are like waves, one rolling in after another, but in one respect, they are distinctly different. Phelps does not just respond to challenges, he seeks them out. He has been that way since he was a goggle-throwing 8-year-old. Growing up, even though breaststroke was my worst stroke, I wanted to swim it, Phelps said. I wanted to race in it. I didnt care. I like challenges. Three down. Five to go.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

            Pak take 
    3-0 lead
    Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 23 runs in the third one-day International at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore on Sunday Tamim Iqbal (63) and Shakib Al Hasan (75) gave Bangladesh hope after centuries from Kamran Akmal and Salman Butt had propelled Pakistan to 308 for eight. 
    Bangladesh kept themselves in the hunt but an asking rate of 113 runs in the final 10 overs proved too much and they were restricted to 285 for seven. Fawad Alam, playing his first match in the series, produced moments of brilliance to derail the run chase.
    Alam was responsible for the run outs of Iqbal and captain Mohammad Ashraful.
    The following is the scorecard:

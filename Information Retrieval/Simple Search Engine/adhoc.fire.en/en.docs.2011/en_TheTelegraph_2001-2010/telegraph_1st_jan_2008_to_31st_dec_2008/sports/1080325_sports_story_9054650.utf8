                                                     SA even have non-playing XI 
  - Visitors ahead in support staff numbers       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Coach Mickey Arthur heads the non-playing XI                                 
	Chennai: The South Africans arent just aiming big, theyre travelling with a truly jumbo party!         
	Believe it or not, the 14-man squad (14th member Robin Peterson arrives early on Wednesday) has 11 non-playing members for company!         
	No wonder somebody from the tour management told The Telegraph, not exactly very light-heartedly, that managing the support staff could often become as demanding as managing the players.         
	The visitors non-playing line-up is: Coach: Mickey Arthur; Assistant coach: Vincent Barnes; Manager: L.G.Naidoo; Logistics manager: Goolam Rajah; Video analyst: Hendrik Coertzen; Physio: Shane Jabbar; Trainer: Grant Compton; Doctor: M.A.S. Moosajee; Masseur: Riaan Muller; Media officer: Michael Owen-Smith; Security (close protection) officer: Zunaid Wadee.         
	Rajah is, of course, a veteran. Players and coaches have come and gone, but he has survived the many shake-ups. In the non-playing 11, therefore, hes the senior-most pro.         
	Compton, by the way, has worked with Pakistan. Hed been hand-picked by the late Bob Woolmer.         
	Team Indias support staff is 8 in number, including part-time physio Paul Close.         
	Incidentally, left-arm spinner Peterson didnt come with the rest of the squad, on Saturday, as his partner recently gave birth to their first child. He wont be in contention for the series-launching Test, which will begin within hours of his arrival here.         
	Footnote: The Indians, meanwhile, could consider fielding five bowlers. If that happens, then specialist Wasim Jaffer wont open with Virender Sehwag.

            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Yakubu is challenged by a Sporting Clube de Goa player at the Barasat Stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Defending champions East Bengal completed a hattrick of wins, beating Sporting Clube de Goa 1-0 at the Barasat Stadium on Monday evening and qualified for the semi-finals of the ongoing 30th Federation Cup.         
	Sanju Pradhan pumped in the winner in the 79th minute after the city giants had missed a flurry of chances earned in the final twenty minutes of the match.         
	It was a Syed Rahim Nabi cross from the left that Sunil Chetri collected on the top box and passed to Sanju, who in turn placed it in the far corner after dodging Bisheshwar Singh.         
	However, East Bengals inability to hit the back of the net would be a matter of worry for coach Stanley Rozario.         
	Not only did Sunil miss a couple of chances, his colleagues Yusif Yakubu and Nabi too were responsible for profligate finishing.         
	Earlier, both East Bengal and Sporting Clube de Goa had started on an optimistic note.         
	Attack followed counter-attack as the teams wrestled for control.         
	With Bisheshwar Singh and Gerard Mellow on the flanks tormenting the East Bengal defence early on, Freddy Mascarenhas tested goalkeeper Abhra Mondal in the third minute, with a low shot that missed the target by a whisker.         
	Moments later Steven Fernandess effort  a long ranger  was brilliantly blocked by Abhra.         
	After the nervy opening, East Bengal quickly regained composure and started threatening the Goan goal.         
	Sunil Chetri looked dangerous at times. Sportings defence responded to his trickery with some calculated tackles.         
	In the 27th minute, Sanju Pradhan floated a cross from the right for Sunil on the edge of the 18-yard box, only to see the Delhi boy nod it over the crossbar.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi found himself in the thick of things five minutes from half-time. Sporting defenders were caught napping as Nabi went one-on-one with goalkeeper Gerard Mellow. But his shot went wide.         
	Nabi looked like regaining his touch, and in the second half moved upfront to Sunils aid.         
	In the second half, which started after a twenty-minute delay due to a power cut at the Barasat Stadium, Sporting nearly scored but a Steven Fernandes left-footer went on to hit the upright.         
	East Bengals defence without Suley Musah looked a bit tentative. Nirmal Chetri and Mehrajuddin Wadoo did a fine job but they need to be a bit more cautious when they face a potentially tougher challenge in the semi-final.

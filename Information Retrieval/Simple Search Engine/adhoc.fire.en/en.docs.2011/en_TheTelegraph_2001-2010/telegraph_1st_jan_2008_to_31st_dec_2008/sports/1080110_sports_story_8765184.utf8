                                                   ICC advice to CA

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: ICC chief Malcolm Speed has asked Cricket Australia to rein in Ricky Ponting and Co. in the light of the recent criticisms of their on-field behaviour. 
    
	In a report published in the Australian daily Herald Sun, Speed said he had spoken to CA boss James Sutherland about the on-field attitude of the Australian team which has come under attack from media commentators and members of the public. 
    
	The team is being criticised, members of the team are being criticised and they need to be aware of that  they need to respond to that, Speed said. 
    
	The ICC chief said he wanted all national teams to play the game in the right spirit. 
    
	We need to be clear what that means, he said. 
    
	Speed said Bucknors removal has defused what could have been an international crisis. We could have gone in banging the table and playing who blinks first, we could have turned what is already an international incident into an international crisis.

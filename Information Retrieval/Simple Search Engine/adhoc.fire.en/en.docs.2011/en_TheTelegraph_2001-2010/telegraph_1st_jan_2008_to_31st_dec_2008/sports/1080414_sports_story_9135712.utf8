The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Immelman stays in lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Immelman stays in lead
                      
	Augusta: South African Trevor Immelman held steady through the front nine and surged ahead with an impeccable homeward half on Saturday to seize a two-shot lead with one round to play at the US Masters.         
	Immelman, the overnight leader at eight under par, posted a three-under-par 69 at rain-softened Augusta National for an 11-under 205 total.         
	The 28-year-old South African stood 18 holes from his first major tournament title, though 13-time major winner Tiger Woods was lurking in fifth place, six shots back.         
	In second place on 207 was American Brandt Snedeker, who overcame three successive bogeys from the 11th with birdies at 14, 15 and 18.         
	American Steve Flesch shot 69 for 208, one better than Briton Paul Casey, who also registered a three-under 69.         
	Four-time champion Woods posted 68 for five-under 211.         
	Immelman pulled ahead of the pack with birdies at the par-five 13th and par-four 14th and then escaped danger at 15.         
	The South Africans third shot to the par-five hole spun off the green and appeared to be headed down the front bank and into the pond before somehow stopping on the steep slope.         
	The ball came out on a lower trajectory than what I was looking for and it just had so much spin on it, Immelman said. I have no clue how that ball stayed up there, but obviously Im thankful.         
	Immelman chipped back up to the green and holed a four-foot putt to save par and held his nerve through the finish. (Reuters)

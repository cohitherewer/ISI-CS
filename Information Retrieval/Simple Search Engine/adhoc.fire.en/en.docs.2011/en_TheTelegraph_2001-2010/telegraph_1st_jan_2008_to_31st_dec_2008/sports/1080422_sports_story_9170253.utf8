	Madrid: Real Madrid moved closer to retaining their Primera Liga title with a 2-0 win away at Racing Santander on Sunday.         
	Raul tapped in Robinhos cross early on and Bernd Schusters men withstood some sustained pressure from Champions League-chasing Racing, before Gonzalo Higuain stroked in a second in injury time.         
	Reals players swamped the Argentine to celebrate as the victory put them 10 points clear at the top of the standings with five matches left to play.         
	Its not in the bag yet, but this was another important step forward in a difficult stadium, Real coach Bernd Schuster said. This advantage should give us confidence for the remaining games.         
	Villarreal are now their closest challengers on 62 points after they leap-frogged Barcelona with a 2-0 win over struggling Valladolid at the Madrigal.         
	Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci sprinted on to Santi Cazorlas pass to open the scoring against the run of play in the first half and returned the favour for Cazorla to add the second just after the break.         
	Champions League semi-finalists Barca are third with 61 points, after being held 0-0 at home by city rivals Espanyol on Saturday. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, on 54, slipped to a 3-1 home defeat against Real Betis on Saturday.         
	Kings Cup winners Valencia put off celebrating the title they won on Wednesday night to focus on the trip to face Athletic Bilbao in Sundays late game, but it was to little avail as they were torn apart 5-1 at San Mames.         
	The defeat piles the pressure on under-fire coach Ronald Koeman, whose side are left two points above the bottom three.         
	At the foot of the table, new Levante coach Jose Angel Moreno got off to a winning start with a 3-1 home win over Kings Cup finalists Getafe, but his team remain 12 points from safety.         
	A Daniel Guiza hattrick helped condemn second-bottom Real Murcia to a 4-1 home defeat against Real Mallorca that leaves them eight points adrift.         
	Recreativo Huelva are 18th, level on 37 points with 17th-placed Real Zaragoza, who have the edge over them in head-to-heads after Saturdays 3-0 home win.         
	In Serie A, Inter Milan took a big step towards retaining their title when Julio Cruzs header sealed a nervous 1-0 win at Torino on Sunday. Roberto Mancinis side have moved six points clear of second-placed AS Roma, who drew 1-1 at home to lowly Livorno on Saturday and lost Francesco Totti to a serious knee injury.         
	With four matches left, Inter would have to completely lose their way to lose the Scudetto now, although they meet rivals AC Milan in two weeks time.         
	Gianni De Biasi, starting his third stint in charge of Torino, saw his struggling side put the visitors under severe pressure but Cruzs near-post diving header from a corner on half an hour was just enough for Inter in the driving rain.         
	Mario Balotelli hit the post in the first half for Inter but otherwise Torino were on top and had a strong shout for a penalty turned down.

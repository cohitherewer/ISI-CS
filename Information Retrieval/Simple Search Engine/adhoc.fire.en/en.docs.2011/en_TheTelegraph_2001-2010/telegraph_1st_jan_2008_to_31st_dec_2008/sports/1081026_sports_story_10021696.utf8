	London: Hull Citys remarkable start to life in the top flight continued with a 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion that put them level on 20 points at the top with leaders Chelsea and Liverpool who face each other at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Hull made it four league wins in a row thanks to second half goals from Kamil Zayette, Geovanni and Marlon King.         
	Sunderland beat Newcastle United 2-1 at the Stadium of Light  Kieran Richardsons thunderous free-kick 15 minutes from time earning Sunderland a first home victory against their north east rivals for 28 years. Djibril Cisses 20th minute strike had earlier been cancelled out by Newcastles Shola Ameobi who scored in the 30th minute.         
	The end of the match, which left Newcastle second from bottom, was marred by skirmishes between the rival sets of fans and riot police moved in to restore order.         
	Fans celebrating Sunderlands first home win in a derby for 28 years spilt onto the pitch, prompting an angry response from Newcastle supporters.         
	A melee developed, but was swiftly contained by stewards and police.         
	Im sure the FA will look into it, Sunderland manager Roy Keane said. Footballs an emotional game. Well look at it over the next one or two days and find out if any of them are out of line.         
	But youve got to enjoy it. If you think Im going to criticise this clubs supporters youre wrong. The clubs support has been fantastic in terms of getting behind us.         
	Im not saying its acceptable, but weve got security and police to look after that.           (AGENCIES)

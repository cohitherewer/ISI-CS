The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not youth or experience, its all about fitness: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Not youth or experience, its all about fitness: Dhoni
  - Do not mix Twenty20 cricket with other formats, says India ODI captain         A STAFF REPORTER            Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the Eden on Saturday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: His team may be under pressure after a sudden reversal of fortunes but Mahendra Singh Dhonis demeanour revealed little during the pre match news conference on Saturday. The Chennai Super Kings captain steered clear of controversial questions but did say that its not age or experience that matters in Twenty20 cricket but fitness.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The impact of Fridays humiliating defeat on Kolkata Knight Riders         
	They are not the only team to do badly In Twenty20 cricket you win some and you lose some. But what is important is to maintain a level of performance. Its important to come back. All teams in IPL have suffered bad defeats at some point or the other. I do not expect Fridays defeat to have a major impact on Knight Riders performance Sunday.         
	The senior players are the ones to have performed so far. So is it youth or experience that matters in this format?         
	The question is not about experience or inexperience. Its about fitness. I have always stressed on fitness. The ones who are doing well in the IPL are the ones who are fit enough to do so.         
	How do you rate Souravs performance?         
	Im sorry Im not in a position to rate anybodys performance.         
	On Sachin Tendulkar         
	No comments.         
	Harbhajan-Sreesanth controversy         
	No comments please.         
	On the hectic schedule         
	Twenty20 is all about that. Its true that we have been playing back-to-back matches and it is difficult. But if you stretch the matches or the tournament too far it will lose momentum and spectator interest.         
	Whether India will have a better bench strength after the IPL         
	Please do not mix Twenty20 cricket with Tests or ODIs. Some of the youngsters have performed well. They need to maintain their good work.         
	On captaining India and Chennai Super Kings         
	Ive found captaining Chennai Super Kings to be a tougher proposition than leading India. Ive got such a talented bunch of performers with me I perhaps would have liked to have a few more options in the bowling department But no complaints.         
	Makhaya Nitni being dropped in the last match         
	Till now there has been no problems. He has taken the decision in the right spirit.         
	On whether his team is desperate to win         
	All teams are desperate to emerge victorious.         
	Sundays game plan         
	Its important to perform on a given day. The bowlers can do nothing special They need to keep the ball in the right areas and not let the batsmen take liberties.

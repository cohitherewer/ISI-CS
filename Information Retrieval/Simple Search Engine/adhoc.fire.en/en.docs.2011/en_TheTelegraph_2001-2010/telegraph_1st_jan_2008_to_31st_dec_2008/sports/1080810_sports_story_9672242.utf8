The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harika in lead
                                                                                                                                                                                           Harika in lead
                      
	Gaziantep (Turkey): Top- seeded International Master, Indias Dronavalli Harika scored a clinical victory over Guliskhan Nakhbayeva of Kazakhstan to emerge as the sole leader after the 7th round of ongoing world junior girls chess championship on Saturday.         
	Playing the white side of a Nimzo Indian defense, Harika attained a slight advantage out of the opening and nurtured her position well enough to knock down one black pawn before tightening the noose. Guliskhan did not have answers of the precise technical display and called it a day when she was about to lose the second pawn too.         
	The victory helped Harika take her tally to 6 points out of a possible 7 and she now enjoys a half point lead over nearest rivals Adriana Nikolova of Bulgaria and Mariya Muzychuk of Ukraine.         
	Amongst the other Indian girls in the fray, only Soumya Swaminathan scored a victory and inched herself up to 5 points at the expense of compatriot Kruttika Nadig. Soumya won with black pieces.         
	Also reaching 5 points with her cool display was R. Preethi, who held erstwhile sole leader Tatev Abrahamyan to a draw in a rook and pawns endgame.           (PTI)

	United substitute Wayne Rooney scored twice moments after coming on, getting his first goal seconds after Gamba striker Masato Yamazaki had pegged the score back to 2-1 in the 74th minute.         
	Darren Fletcher also got on the scoresheet after coming off the bench as the game exploded into life after Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo headers had given United a 2-0 halftime lead.         
	Ferguson angrily rejected the latest speculation linking Ronaldo with a move to Real Madrid, with Spanish media reporting that there was an agreement between the clubs.

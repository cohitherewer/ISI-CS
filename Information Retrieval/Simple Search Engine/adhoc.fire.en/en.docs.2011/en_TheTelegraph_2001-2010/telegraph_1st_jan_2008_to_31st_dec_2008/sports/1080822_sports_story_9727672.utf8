	Unbelievable! What else can you say about Usain Bolt? He ran an absolutely incredible race, even more so than the 100 metres on Saturday night. This time he ran the complete race, and was really going for it. He wanted to break that world record and he did it.         
	Although I always said he could do it, I honestly didnt believe he could do it so soon.         
	His training has not been geared to speed endurance and thats what you need for the 200m. But he was phenomenal Wednesday night. And I congratulate him on lowering my record to 19.30 seconds.         
	He got a great start and he made gains from the very beginning. He was the last one out of the blocks in the 100m, but this time he was out of the blocks well and was away.         
	His drive phase was incredible. He made up the stagger very quickly and his transition from the bend on to the straight was excellent. He put a huge gap between himself and the rest of the field and after that it was just a case of working as hard as he could all the way to the finish line.         
	I made it clear from the beginning, and people find this hard to believe, that I dont feel anything about my world record being broken. World records are not like children where you have this relationship and you dont want to let go of them.         
	The way I see it is its an accomplishment I have a connection to. I am proud I achieved them and worked so hard to go out and break them. That is whats special for me.         
	But I havent woken up every day for the last 12 years and thought I am the world record holder. There is no accomplishment in that. If I was still competing that would be a different story because I could raise my game and get it back.         
	The strange thing about the 200m world record compared to the 100m is that it has traditionally stood for much longer periods. The 100m progressions have been much more consistent, but with the 200m it tends to stand for long, long periods.         
	When I broke it in 1996 it had stood since 1979 and prior to that Tommie Smith ran 19.8 seconds to win in Mexico City in 1968. I always felt that the time I set is where it should have been. I think there is a psychological element to it and also there is less focus on the 200m record compared to the 100m.         
	But then every now and again along comes an athlete for the times and I believe Usain Bolt is that athlete. It happened for me in 1996, it happened with Carl Lewis in 1996 and Jesse Owens in 1936 and now it is happening for Usain.         
	He doesnt just want to win races and medals, he wants to test the limits of human ability. I am happy for him and I congratulate him on breaking my record.         
	And yet, despite all he has achieved in Beijing, I still believe he can run faster and take both records even lower. There is still much more to come from Usain Bolt.

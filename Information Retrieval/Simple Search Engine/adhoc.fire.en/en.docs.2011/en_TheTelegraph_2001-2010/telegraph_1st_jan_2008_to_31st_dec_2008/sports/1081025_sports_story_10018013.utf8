The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin doesnt need any certificate, says Vengsarkar
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin doesnt need any certificate, says Vengsarkar
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former national selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar feels Adam Gilchrists questioning of Sachin Tendulkars honesty is part of a marketing strategy for his soon to be released autobiography.         
	You have to write something sensational to sell a book, Vengsarkar said on Friday.         
	I think its a marketing strategy that Gilchrist has adopted for his autobiography. Its very unfortunate, but a fact, the former Indian captain said.         
	Sachin doesnt need a certificate from Gilchrist on his honesty. Ive known him from a very young age Hes extremely honest, modest, humble said Vengsarkar.         
	Gilchrist in his autobiography True Colours, scheduled to be released next week, questioned Sachins honesty in the Monkeygate controversy during the Sydney Test.         
	The former wicketkeeper-batsman said Sachin had initially told the hearing that he could not hear what was said, he was certain he was telling the truth because he was a fair way away.         
	But during the appeal which followed, Sachin said that Harbhajan used a Hindi term that sounded like monkey to Australian ears.         
	Niranjan Shah, who was the BCCI secretary during the Sydney episode, also felt Gilchrist was looking for cheap publicity for his book.         
	First of all, the matter is over now, Shah said. Since I was actively involved in the whole matter as the BCCI secretary, I have seen how neutrally the ICC conducted the hearing.         
	He wants to sensationalise the incidents to sell his book. As everyone knows, everything was properly handled by the authorities with the appointment of proper men to conduct the hearing after a proper procedure was put in place, said Shah.         
	It was like a court hearing and the matter was settled properly. Everything was fine. It is nothing but mere foolishness.         
	If Gilchrist feels otherwise, then rather than him questioning someone elses credentials, we should examine his credentials. By doing all this, he is doing nothing but tarnishing his own image, the former secretary said.

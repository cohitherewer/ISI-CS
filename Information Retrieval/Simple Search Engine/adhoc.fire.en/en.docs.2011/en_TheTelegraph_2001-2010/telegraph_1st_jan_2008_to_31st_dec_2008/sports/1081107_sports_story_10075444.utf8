The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Much depends on Yakubu fitness
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Much depends on Yakubu fitness
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For East Bengal, all seems to depend on the availability of striker Yusif Yakubu for their seventh round match of the ongoing ONGC I-League against Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	Coach Stanley Rozario is hopeful that the Ghanaian (who was down with fever) will play and repeat for them what Mike Okoro did for Mohammedan Sporting. Okoro scored to help Mohammedan Sporting beat the Mumbai outfit 1-0 in their fifth round match. Yakubu is in better shape I met him today and he looked fresh and confident, Stanley told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	But I will take the final call tomorrow morning only He may start or may come in the second half Lets wait and see, the coach added.         
	Keen to break the jinx and return to winning ways, East Bengal, however, will miss Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D Cunha and M. Suresh on Friday. If Yakubu does not make it to the first XI, Sunil Chetri will have Parveen Kumar as his partner up front.         
	The coach is yet to decide whether Jayanta Sen or Chhanghte Malsawmkima will accompany Mehrajuddin Wadoo in the middle. That Syed Rahim Nabi and Rennedy Singh will be operating along the right and left flanks, respectively, is almost confirmed. In the defence, Rozario will be sticking to his winning combination of Suley Musah and M. Suresh. A fit Subrata Paul is all set to make a comeback.         
	Meanwhile, Mahindra United, who beat Vasco 2-0 in their last encounter, are looking to keep up their winning-momentum. Not bothered by Yakubus role, they want to build on their positive planning with Chidi Edeh and Douhou Sey D. Pierre up front. Steven Dias will be a key man in the middle alongside N.P. Pradeep, K.N. Ajayan and Sukhwinder Singh.         
	Ravanan Dharmaraj, Sushanth Mathew, Justine Stephen and Manjit Singh will bring up the defence-line while Subhasish Roy Chowdhury will be the custodian.         
	Yakubu is not a big factor We will focus on East Bengal as a whole. They have a few players from the national side and that can be a factor for us. Moreover they will be playing at home.So we need to be cautious, Mahindra coach Derek Pereira said .

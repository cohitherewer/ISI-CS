The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | How Gabbar inspired Amarnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                       How Gabbar inspired Amarnath
                  Mohinder Amarnath                     
	New Delhi: Hero of Indias momentous World Cup victory in 1983, Mohinder Amarnath said that he drew inspiration from a dialogue of Bollywood blockbuster Sholay to get over the jitters of playing against two-time champions West Indies in the finals.         
	I remembered the famous dialogue of Sholay that jo dar gaya so mar gaya. I told myself that it is my day and I have nothing to loose, said Amarnath, who was adjudged Man of the Match in both the semi-final and the final of the World Cup.         
	Twenty five years after the historic triumph, Amarnath described the Indian dressing rooms ambience before the big match as calm and said his underdog team was in high spirits as it had nothing to lose.         
	We were very relaxed on the final day. Not a single player was panicky. We were playing together for quiet some time hence there was mutual understanding and confidence of winning, the allrounder said.         
	In the final, played at the Lords, Amarnath scored 26 runs and took three important wickets for just 12 runs in seven overs as the Caribbean team collapsed to 140 chasing a 183-run target.         
	Amarnath said he did not fear the dangerous trio of pacers Joel Garner, Michel Holding and Andy Roberts. Neither did explosive batsman Vivian Richards intimidate him.         
	Amarnath, who has played 69 Tests and 85 one-day Internationals for India, said the triumph was something out of the world for the Indians and seemed like a dream.         
	We used to watch World Cup finals sitting beyond the boundary line. It was a dream to play a final and hold the trophy. We literally lived that dream on June 25, 1983, the veteran cricketer said.         
	It has been 25 years since then, but I can still feel the thrill as if we have won the Cup yesterday only. It was an unexpected win and we are proud of it, he added.         
	Amarnath said despite the odds, the Indians were determined to win, as it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to be at the top.         
	We were all determined to win. You have to be numero uno as nobody remembers the runner-ups, he said.         
	He rated the Man of the Match award in that game as the biggest achievement of his life.           (PTI)

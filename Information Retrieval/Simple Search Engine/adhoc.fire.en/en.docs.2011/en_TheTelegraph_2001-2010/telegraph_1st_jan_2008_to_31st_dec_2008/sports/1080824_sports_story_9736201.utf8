	Beijing: Power-packed Germany won the Olympic mens hockey gold medal after 16 years with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Spain in the final on Saturday.         
	Christopher Zeller netted the winner in the 16th minute with a ferocious penalty corner before the Germans warded off repeated Spanish attacks to strike gold in field hockeys 100th year at the Olympics.         
	Germany added the Olympic title to the World Cup triumph two years ago, reinforcing their credentials as the sports foremost nation despite losing the No. 1 ranking to Australia in June.         
	Germany improved upon their bronze medal finish at Athens four years ago, when they beat Spain 4-3 in the play-off, to win their first gold since the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.         
	It was two-in-a-row for coach Markus Weise, who had led the German womens team to their maiden Olympic title in Athens before taking up the mens job after Bernhard Peters switched to football.         
	Spain lived up to their billing as the best team never to have won the Olympic gold as they faltered for the third time after losing finals to India in 1980 and The Netherlands in 1996.         
	The Spanish strikers, led by the seasoned Santi Freixa, raided the rivals half through 70 minutes of gripping hockey, but could not get past the sturdy German defence that packed a powerful punch.         
	Freixa, who had scored five goals in the competition, failed to convert three penalty corners as Germany built on their 1-0 win over Spain in the preliminary league.         
	Meanwhile, Athens Olympic champions Australia won the bronze medal with a spectacular 6-2 win over The Netherlands earlier on the day.         
	The world No. 1 kookaburras, smarting from Thursdays semi-final loss to Spain, took their frustration out on the Dutch by scoring three goals in the first nine minutes.         
	The win bettered Australias 6-3 triumph over Pakistan in a similar play-off for the bronze at their home Olympics in Sydney in 2000. (AFP)

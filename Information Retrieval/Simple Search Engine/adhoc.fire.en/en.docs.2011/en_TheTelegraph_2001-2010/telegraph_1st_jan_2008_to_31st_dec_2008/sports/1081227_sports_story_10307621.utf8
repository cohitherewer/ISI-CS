The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir: Owe   it to Kirsten 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gambhir: Owe   it to Kirsten 
                  Gambhir                           
	New Delhi: A more relaxed approach to batting has been the success mantra for Indian opener Gautam Gambhir who Friday acknowledged that coach Gary Kirsten played a vital role in making 2008 the best year of his cricketing career so far.         
	The diminutive Gambhir, who had a phenomenal year aggregating 1134 runs from eight Tests at an average of 70.88, said Kirsten had helped him understand his game better.         
	I was too hard on myself. I wasnt too relaxed and it used to tie me up in knots on occasion. Gary helped me be at ease with myself. I now take it as it comes. Gary has helped me understand my game a lot better, Gambhir said.         
	It was the best year of my cricketing career. When the year began, I never thought itd turn out to be like that, he added.         
	The 27-year-old Gambhir is not prepared to rest on his laurels and promised to maintain consistency in the coming years.         
	Consistency will be my goal. Its not as if I have any specific target in mind. However, I am aware I need to keep working on my batting, said Gambhir.         
	Gambhir has learnt to curb his aggression when needed and says he can be both ultra-aggressive and painfully patient in order to suit the team.         
	An example of it was the fourth afternoon of the recent Mohali Test against England where Gambhir batted 50 overs scoring a mere 41 runs.         
	It mainly is a matter of confidence. I have played several big knocks in Ranji Trophy (he has 27 centuries from 104 games) where I alternated between aggression and defence, Gambhir explained.         
	When you are confident, you can switch your game according to the situation. You can slip into different roles with ease, he added         
	Anxiety was costing Gambhir his wicket early in his career. There were number of occasions when he used to cross 50 and then get dismissed.         
	A case in point was the disastrous series in Sri Lanka in September-October when Gambhir scored three half centuries from his six stands at the crease but didnt manage to get a hundred.         
	This anomaly was brilliantly rectified in the final four Tests of the year in which Gambhir scored a stupendous 774, that included three centuries, capped by one double century against world champions Australia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis takes pole on rich list
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lewis takes pole on rich list
    - F1 driver moves past beckham as highest-paid british sportsman           Edward Gorman            Lewis Hamilton                                 
	He has not won the Formula One world championship yet  and his sternest critics say that he may never achieve that  but Lewis Hamilton is Britains highest paid sportsman. In addition to his 75m basic salary from McLaren Mercedes over the next five years,         
	Hamilton is about to a sign personal sponsorship deal with Reebok, the sports equipment manufacturer, that is thought to be worth 10m spread over a minimum of three years.         
	Taking this into account, Hamiltons combined earnings take him just past David Beckham, whose salary with the Los Angeles Galaxy football franchise, plus lucrative commercial endorsements, is estimated to be a little more than 16m a year.         
	However, Hamilton looks set to leave Beckham in his rear-view mirror in the near future, if negotiations on a separate personal sponsorship deal thought to be with Pepsi, the drinks manufacturer, reach agreement. This could be worth the same as the Reebok contract, or substantially more.         
	Those close to Hamilton and his father, Anthony, who manages him, believe that the five-time Grand Prix winner could command career earnings of more than 500m.         
	To date, the richest Formula One driver in history is Michael Schumacher who is thought to have earned in the region of 500m during a 17-year career in the sport.         
	The Reebok deal will make Hamilton, 23, one of the companys global brand ambassadors in a similar arrangement to its contracts with Thierry Henry and Andriy Shevchenko, the footballers, and Amir Khan, the boxer.         
	 In return for the money, Hamilton will be expected to fulfil appearance commitments and other duties, in addition to the work he undertakes on behalf of McLaren and the teams principal sponsors.         
	An intriguing element in the leak of the Reebok deal to a website on Tuesday was how quickly McLaren confirmed its existence. A spokesman for the team said: We can confirm that Lewis Hamiltons father and manager Anthony has been in discussions with Reebok with regard to a personal sponsorship for Lewis.

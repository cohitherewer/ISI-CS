	Pensacola (Florida): Banned American sprinter Justin Gatlin must go to Switzerland if he wants to compete at the Beijing Olympics.         
	The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Gatlin, whose four-year doping ban recently was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), is not eligible to compete in the Beijing Olympics regardless of any ruling by a US judge here.         
	Should he wish to appeal this CAS decision, he must do so before the Swiss federal court, wrote the IOC director of legal affairs, Howard Stupp in the letter dated June 23.         
	Last Friday, US district judge Lacey A. Collier issued a temporary restraining order that would allow the defending Olympic 100-meter champion to compete in the 100-meter rounds at the US Olympic athletics trials, which begin Friday in Eugene, Oregon.         
	If allowed to run at the trials, Gatlin would have to finish in the top three of his event to make the US Olympic team.         
	On Monday, lawyers for the US Olympic Committee, USA track amp; field and the US Anti-Doping Agency gathered here to persuade the judge that he had no jurisdiction in the matter.         
	Gatlin had sought the courts relief to compete, contending the punishment violated the Americans with disabilities act. Two weeks ago, CAS upheld a four-year doping ban against the former world 100 and 200-meter champion. Gatlin asked CAS to rescind the 2001 doping violation, his first of two, which he had hoped would reduce his penalty to a two-year ban, allowing him to compete at trials. Gatlins second doping offence stems from a positive test at the Kansas relays in 2006.

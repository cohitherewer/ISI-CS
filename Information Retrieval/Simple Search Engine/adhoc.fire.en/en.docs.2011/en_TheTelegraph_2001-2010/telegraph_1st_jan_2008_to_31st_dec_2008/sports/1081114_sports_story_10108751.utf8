  - England keen to overcome Stanford blues

	Rajkot: Move over Test cricket, its time to focus on the shorter version of the game. Both India and England have hardly managed to catch their breath in the lead-up to this one-day series.         
	While England have been criss-crossing the globe, India have been fighting it out against the world champions. Englands has been a failed campaign in the Stanford Twenty20, but the reverberations of Indias triumph over Australia are still being felt.         
	Even in the absence of Sachin Tendulkar, who has been rested for the first three games, and injured pace sensation Ishant Sharma, the hosts carry too much firepower for the liking of England.         
	The return of Virender Sehwag, who missed the ODI series in Sri Lanka in August, will mean good news for the hosts. With Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag forms one of the most destructive opening pairs today.         
	The in-form Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina not only bring a daring approach to batting, but also fresh legs on the field, which should be welcome news for the India captain.         
	A concern for the home team is with Yuvraj Singhs form. With the hard-hitting Yusuf Pathan available to liven up the slog-overs along with Dhoni, the batting looks formidable.         
	Both teams would be looking to make a good start. A bad one cost England the series in 2006 when they lost 1-5. The return of Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison has been vital but England will need to fire on all cylinders if they are to overcome India on their own turf.         
	It will also be the first time that the new Power Play rules, where the batting side decides five overs that will be part of the fielding restrictions, will come into effect.         
	Curator Dhiraj Parsana said the pitch would be sporting.         
	We have left some grass on it and there would be some sweating under the covers before the 9am start, he said. It would be good for the strokeplayers, too, as more shots can be played on the back foot rather than when they are forced to play on the front foot on wickets that afford only knee-high bounce.         
	Stuart Broad has been declared fit after recovering from a knee injury picked up during a warm-up match in Mumbai. Ravi Bopara earned a recall to the 12-member side with Luke Wright missing out following a poor summer.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli/Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, R.P. Singh.         
	England (likely): Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Owais Shah, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood, Samit Patel, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Steve Harmison, James Anderson.         
	Umpires: Russel Tiffin and Suresh Shastri. TV: Amish Saheba.         
	Match Referee: Roshan Mahanama.         
	Match starts: 9am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sporting need a turnaround
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Md. Sporting need a turnaround
    - I-LEAGUE 
  -  Race for title and survival hots up             A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: When a team fighting to avoid relegation takes on the fourth-placed side in the league, the match is expected to be a one-sided affair.         
	But the current edition of the I-League has so far been an exhibition of all the unexpected things, and with the teams being talked about  Mohammedan Sporting and Churchill Brothers respectively  separated by just five points, only a fool will anticipate a lopsided encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	After playing nine matches each, Churchill are on 14 points while Mohammedan Sporting are stuck on nine points. The fact that proves there is not much difference between the two is their number of victories. Mohammedan have won only two of their matches while Churchill have won a match more.         
	One should also keep in mind that Mohammedan Sporting have often missed the services of their strike pair of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday. The impact the foreigners have had on this I-League cannot be overrated.         
	 Every team is relying on them to deliver the goods. While Churchill have found a consistent marksman in Odafe Okolie (the top-scorer at the moment with 10 goals), league toppers Sporting Clube de Goa have thrived on the striking prowess of Obagbemiro Junior.         
	Injuries to Okoro and Sunday have pegged Mohammedan Sporting back as coach Shabbir Ali admitted the other day after losing to Dempo. Although Sunday has been declared fit to play, Okoro is still recovering.         
	Theos doctor thinks he has had enough rest and can play now. But cant tell about Okoro. Hes still not 100 per cent, Shabbir said on match eve.         
	In case Okoro sits out, Shabbir will depend on the likes of Goutam Thakur, Satyajit Bose and Jyothi Kumar to score. I dont have too many options. Satya, Goutam, Jyothi are all good players. Ill use them if needed, the coach said.         
	The foreigners, including Adewusi Adebayo, were absent from the teams practice on Saturday, giving rise to speculation over their availability for Sundays match. However, Shabbir said all of them were available subject to fitness.         
	Talking about Churchill, Shabbir said: Theyre a very good team. They have more firepower than us on paper. But the way my boys fought against Dempo, I feel we can beat Churchill.         
	For Churchill, anything except a loss would be acceptable as this has been a hard-fought league so far and a point from an away match is not termed a bad performance anywhere in the world. However, they should believe that they can win. Mohammedan Sportings vulnerability is no secret.

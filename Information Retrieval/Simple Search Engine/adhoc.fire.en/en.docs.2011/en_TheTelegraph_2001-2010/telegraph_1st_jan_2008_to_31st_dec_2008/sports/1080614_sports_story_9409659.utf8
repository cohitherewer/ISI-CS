The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadals show eclipsed even Borg
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadals show eclipsed even Borg

	A galaxy of past champions saw Rafael Nadal win his fourth consecutive French Open at Roland Garros with an awesome display. In just one hour and 48 minutes Nadal demolished Federer 6-1, 6-3, 6-0  an unbelievable score. Nadals performance eclipsed all the greats of the past, including Borg who won the title six times. Such was his domination that from 2-1 in the first set to 2-0 in the second set Federer could win only 3 points!         
	Nadal was enthusiastically hailed by all as the greatest clay court player of all time. His intensity and focus led Djokovic to say he plays every point like a match point!         
	Federer said that Nadal has improved both his defence and attack since last year. His torque-loaded forehand is easily the best shot in tennis but with it now he has developed a lethal double-handed backhand of amazing power and accuracy.         
	Being right-handed, Nadal can generate tremendous power and control by merely swivelling at the waist and not turning sideways for his two-handed backhand. The attacks by Federer and Djokovic on Nadals backhand were repulsed by an incredible short cross court angle of amazing speed or a searing flat down the line shot. It was like playing against someone who had two forehands.         
	Adjusting to the grass courts at Wimbledon is a difficult task. But with a good draw and a couple of easy matches in the early rounds, Nadal would be a good bet for Wimbledon. A high bouncing ball and dry courts will make him unbeatable in the later stages of the tournament.                   Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal      
	It was sad to see Federer, head bowed and shorn of his majesty, trudging about the court like a common foot soldier. According to Borg, If Federer was victorious in Paris he would be the greatest player who ever played! Alas, Federer fell just one match away from undisputed immortality.         
	The symptoms of decline were evident in Federers earlier matches. He had spells when he missed easy shots and wasnt his usual confident self. Instead of peaking for the final, Federer plummeted to even lower levels. Climbing out of this trough will not be an easy task. The strain and exhaustion of staying No.1 for 235 weeks with Nadal and Djokovic breathing down his neck must have been crushing. Glandular fever earlier in the year must have further depleted Federers physical reserves.         
	Considering all these factors, Federers performance in the French Open was commendable. His inability to aggressively handle the high ball on his backhand is a shortcoming Nadal exploits on clay. Players with double-handed backhands are able to punish the high ball while Federer merely keeps the ball in play.         
	Wimbledon will show if Federer is able to get over his traumatic experience at the French Open. If he can recover his self-belief and pull him self together, he may well be able to meet the challenges of Nadal and Djokovic. Federers behaviour was exemplary. Lavish in his praise for Nadal he maintained a level of dignity worthy of an all-time great.         
	While Nadal may reign supreme on slow clay, Djokovic will be a serious challenger on faster courts. The third set of the semi-final clash between Nadal and Djokovic was surely the best of the whole fortnight. Up two sets and 3-0 in the third, Nadal looked to be home and dry but Djokovic went for broke and launched a spirited counterattack spraying winners off both flanks. He got to set point on Nadals service at 5-6 but failed to convert.         
	The breathtaking display by Djokovic was indicative of his great potential. He is not cowed down by Nadal and said that nobody is unbeatable. The rivalry between Federer, Nadal and Djokovic will enrich the game and push tennis to higher levels of play and sportsmanship.         
	Earnests Gulbis, a 19 year old from Latvia, was the most impressive young talent in the championships. Ranked No. 80 he ploughed his way through a seasoned highly ranked field consisting of James Blake, Nicolas Lapentti and Michael Llodra to reach the quarter finals. Gulbis is a smooth free mover with an all-court game, which will be effective on all surfaces, and seems to be headed for stardom.

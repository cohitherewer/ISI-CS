The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballesteros stable after operation
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ballesteros stable after operation
                      
	Madrid: Seve Ballesteros was in a stable condition after an operation on Tuesday to remove a brain tumour, the Spanish golfers doctors said on Wednesday.         
	The operation, with the objective of a resection of the detected brain tumour, started at 9am and concluded without complications, a statement from Madrids La Paz hospital said.         
	A resection refers to a procedure to remove as much of a brain tumour as possible before radio- or chemotherapy.         
	The statement added that Ballesteros was conscious, in a stable condition and had been transferred to intensive care.         
	The 51-year-old was taken to the hospital last week after suffering dizziness and a brief loss of consciousness. On Sunday the five-time major winner said he had a brain tumour.         
	A Spanish sports daily on Wednesday reported that the operation had lasted 12 hours but did not say if the tumour was malignant or benign.         
	Ballesteross office in his native Santander declined to comment and the spokeswoman for his family was not immediately available.         
	Ballesteros is one of the most gifted and charismatic players to grace the game. When he won the British Open in 1979, he was the youngest player to do so in the 20th century. He won the title again in 1984 and 1988 and twice captured the US Masters.

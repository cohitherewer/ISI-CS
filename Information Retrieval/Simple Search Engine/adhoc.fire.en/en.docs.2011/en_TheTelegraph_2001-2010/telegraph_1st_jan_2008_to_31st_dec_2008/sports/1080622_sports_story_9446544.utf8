                                                                                                                                                                                                     Euro 2008 Diary
                      
	Klose still one-up on Luca Toni  
	Tenero: Italys Luca Toni will have extra motivation to score in Sundays Euro 2008 quarter final against Spain as he tries to win a bet with club mate Miroslav Klose.  
	The two strikers, colleagues at Bayern Munich, have a private contest to see who can grab most goals at the tournament and after the German got off the mark in the 3-2 win over Portugal on Thursday the pressure is on Toni in Vienna.         
	I scored my goal so now its up to Luca to equalise, Klose told a news conference on Saturday. I texted him and he messaged back saying hes having a few problems with his best friend, the ball. He said at the moment its doing what it wants, not what he wants.         
	Between them Toni and Klose claimed 34 Bundesliga goals for Bayern Munich last season.         
	Fan violence         
	Vienna: Austrian police said they made only 12 arrests in Vienna on Friday, despite the tense finale to the Euro 2008 quarter final which saw Turkey beat Croatia on penalties after a stoppage-time equaliser.         
	Police reported minor scuffles after the game which slightly injured one supporter and one police officer. In one street, fans threw bottles, requiring Croatian and Turkish fans to be separated. But the trouble was fuelled by drunkenness and pent-up emotion rather than by deliberate violent intent, Vienna police spokesman Christian Stella said.         
	Sing along         
	Basel: The late Luciano Pavarotti did it at Italia 90 with Puccinis Nessun Dorma, The Lightning Seeds triumphed at Euro 96 in England with Three Lions and The White Stripes are number one among fans at Euro 2008 with Seven Nation Army.         
	The songs catchy guitar riff is everywhere: accompanying the teams from the tunnel before matches, bellowed by fans on the streets of the Swiss and Austrian host cities, on radio and television and in shops and supermarkets. It has easily eclipsed the official song, Can You Hear Me? by Enrique Iglesias.         
	German worry         
	Tenero: Germany can scarcely wait for Wednesdays semi-final but after watching Turkeys latest great escape against Croatia no one is underestimating how hard it will be to finish them off.         
	 quot;Turkey just never give up, quot; Germany defender Arne Friedrich said on Saturday. quot;In terms of skill and the quality of their build-up play, Croatia were the better team but you can never write Turkey off.

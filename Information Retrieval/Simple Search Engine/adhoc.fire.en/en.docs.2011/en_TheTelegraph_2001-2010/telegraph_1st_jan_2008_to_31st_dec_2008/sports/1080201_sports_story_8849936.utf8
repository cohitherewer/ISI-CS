                                                   Indian motor sports on a roll: Chandhok

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	New Delhi: Karun Chandhok, who recently had a podium finish in a GP2 race in Dubai, was confident the day he would be driving a Formula One car was not far off. 
    
	The former Red Bull test driver, now with the iSports International, is excited by the fact that a second Indian team could be seen on the F1 grid after Spice Group announced its intention to buy out cash-strapped Super Aguri in the elite circuit. 
    
	Bangalore-based business tycoon Vijay Mallya has already bought Spyker and renamed it Force India. The newly floated team, however, doesnt have an Indian driver on board. 
    
	Motor sport in India is certainly on a roll, Chandhok said. I have been told that Spice Group is keen to have Narain Karthikeyan as their driver. I am not sure where the deal stands at the moment but to have two Indian teams in the Formula One circuit would be a great boost for our national prestige. 
    
	Chandhok and Armaan Ibrahim were in the capital for the launch of the 11th JK Tyre National Championships. Chandhok has reason be optimistic. During the Force India launch, Mallya, who didnt select Karthikeyan for his team, promised to consider Chandhok as a test driver next season. 
    
	Meanwhile, the ING Group on Thursday welcomed the launch of the 2008 Renault F1 car, the R28, and the new driver line-up of double world champion Fernando Alonso and Nelson Piquet Jr, adds a Staff Reporter.

	Barcelona: Force India maintained their impressive show in the pre-Spanish Grand Prix testing with Adrian Sutil recording the third quickest time  after Fernando Alonso and former world champion Michael Schumacher  on the final day here.         
	The Germans best lap, 1:19.424, was set on slick tyres with 2008 Aero and was just one tenth of a second slower than the second best time set by Schumacher.         
	As with Tonio Liuzzi and Giancarlo Fisichella on the previous two days, Sutil ran with 2008 tyres and Aero configuration in the morning to test settings for next weeks Spanish Grand Prix.         
	I am quite happy with the result. We did a lot of running, which wasnt bad considering the small problem we had in the morning (Thursday), and the car has improved a lot since the last time we were here in February, he said.         
	He also tried slick tyres in preparation for their reintroduction in 2009.         
	The German completed 475km over the day, bringing the teams total mileage to over 1200km in this test.         
	I think it looks good for the race. I also tried out slicks, which was my first time this year, and was really impressed. The grip is just amazing, especially in the last sector but it is also very physical on your neck muscles. Im looking forward to it already! Sutil said.         
	The test team will now return to the Force India factory in Silverstone to integrate this weeks findings into race team preparations for the Spanish Grand Prix in just over a weeks time.         
	A useful day to finish what has been a very productive test. We had a minor clutch problem in the morning that caused a small delay in running, but we nevertheless completed the days programme, Force Indias chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne said.         
	Adrian tested the 2008 configuration in the morning in preparation for next weeks race and also ran on a couple of sets of 2009 tyres. Overall, the test has been very useful, weve finished our scheduled work and we look in good shape for the Grand Prix, he added.

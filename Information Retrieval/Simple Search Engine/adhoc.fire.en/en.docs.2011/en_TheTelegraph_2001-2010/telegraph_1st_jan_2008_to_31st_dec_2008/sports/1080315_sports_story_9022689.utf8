The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haile Gebrselassie told to obey Ethiopian rules for Beijing 
                                                     Haile Gebrselassie told to obey Ethiopian rules for Beijing

	Addis Ababa: World record holder Haile Gebrselassie cannot opt out of the Beijing Olympics marathon and must follow Ethiopian sports rules, the countrys athletics federation said on Friday. Gebrselassie, who suffers from exercise-related asthma, told Reuters this week he would not run the 42.195-km event because he feared Beijings air pollution was a threat to his health.         
	The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said his withdrawal was fully justified and that no one could force him to compete but the Ethiopian Athletics Federation (EAF) said the decision was not his to make.         
	It is not up to Haile Gebrselassie to decide on participation in the marathon event in Beijing, EAF technical director Dube Jillo said.         
	It is the Ethiopian Athletics Federation, representing the nation, that determines whether Haile is fit to compete in the marathon event in Beijings Olympics or not.         
	The twice Olympic 10,000 metres champion is one of a long list of athletes and officials to have voiced concern over pollution in the city.         
	IOC President Jacques Rogge has said the long-distance events could be rescheduled if conditions were too bad. A BBC report quoted Gebrselassie as saying he would consider running the marathon if the venue were changed.         
	Meanwhile, Australian athletes hoping to compete at the Olympics have had their medical records secretly investigated by doping authorities. (Reuters)

	 Jason Krejza also became the first bowler in Test history to take five wickets and concede 200 or more runs in his debut innings. The closest to this was Sri Lankas Upul Chandana, who took 6-179 vs Pakistan in Dhaka (Asian Test Championships) in 1998-99.         
	 Krejzas bowling figures are the worst (in terms of runs conceded) by any bowler in his debut innings. This dubious record was earlier held by West Indian Omari Banks, who had figures of 3-204 vs Australia at Bridgetown in 2002-03.         
	 Krejza also became the third Australian bowler to concede 200 or more runs in a Test innings. The others being L.. Fleetwood-Smith vs England at The Oval 1938, who conceded 298 runs for one wicket and Brett Lee, who conceded 201 runs for four wickets vs India in Sydney in 2003-04.         
	 Krejza became the 14th Australian to take five wickets in his debut Innings. He is the second Australian bowler to pick five wickets on debut vs India. Brett Lee had taken 5-47 vs India in Melbourne in 1999-00. Coincidentally, the last Australian to take five wickets on debut was Stuart Clark (5-55 vs SA, Cape Town, 2005-06) who was replaced by Krejza in this Test.         
	 Krejza has also conceded the most runs by any bowler on Indian soil. South Africas Paul Harris had conceded 203 runs for 3 wickets at Chepauk in 2007-08.         
	 Jason Krejza became the fourth bowler to take eight wickets in the first innings of his Test debut. Following is the list of others who have done the same:         
	A.L. Valentine 8-104 WI vs Eng in Manchester 1950         
	R.A.L. Massie 8-84 Aus vs Eng at Lords 1972         
	N.D. Hirwani 8-61 Ind vs WI at Chepauk 1987-88         
	J.J. Krejza 8-215 Aus vs Eng in Nagpur 2008-09         
	 Jason Krejzas figures are also the best by a debutant bowler vs India in a Test. The previous best was 7-46 by Englands John Lever in Delhi in 1976-77.Krejza also became the eighth bowler to take eight wickets in an innings vs India in Tests. He is the first Australian to do so.         
	 Sourav Ganguly (324 runs), when on 61, went past 300 runs in this series. It is the first time Ganguly has scored more than 300 in a series against Australia. His previous best performance in a series against them was 284 runs in the 2003-04 series played in Australia.         
	 Harbhajan Singh dismissed Ricky Ponting for the 10th time in his career. With the wicket of Ponting, he claimed his 300th Test wicket and also his 200th on Indian soil.         
	 Harbhajan Singh became the 22nd bowler overall, third Indian  after Anil Kumble (619) and Kapil Dev (434)  and third off-spinner  after Lance Gibbs (309) and Muttiah Muralitharan (756)  to take 300 wickets.

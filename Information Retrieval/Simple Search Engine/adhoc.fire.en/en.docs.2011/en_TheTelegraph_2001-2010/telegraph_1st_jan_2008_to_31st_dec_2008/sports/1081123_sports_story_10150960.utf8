The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aura, performance makes difference
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aura, performance makes difference
    - It should never get to a stage where it becomes captain vs selectors: Vengsarkar           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Imran Khan                                 
	Calcutta: An Imran Khan would dictate his team and leave the Wise Men to complete the rituals of a selection committee meeting.         
	Nobody dared object.         
	Kaptan ki team hai or Khan Saheb insisted on so-and-so, is what wed often hear (in private conversations) from the Pakistan selectors.         
	Of course, all captains havent had Imrans aura and, so, havent always been able to get the men of their choice.         
	Sourav Ganguly did, for a while, but thats because the team had been delivering. Also, it helped that coach John Wright would play ball.         
	Unless the captain is an Imran, his own performance and that of the team goes a long way in determining just how much of an influence hell have when the 14/15 is picked.         
	Captains and coaches are co-opted members of the selection committee. They dont have a vote, yes, but arent statues at meetings either.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni has neither exactly confirmed nor clearly denied a report that hed threatened to quit over medium-pacer (and best buddy) Rudra Pratap Singhs omission for the Bangalore and Cuttack ODIs against England, but a debate has started.         
	How much of a say should a captain actually have when hes in a selection committee meeting?         
	Look, it should never get to a stage where it becomes the captain versus the selectors... If it does, then thats very bad news, former India captain and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday evening, he added: Differences of opinion could be there and I see nothing wrong with that... In fact, a debate is healthy... However, the handling is important... For example, Id make it a point to informally interact with the captain and coach before the selection meetings... Id do that because one should be more or less on the same wavelength as them...         
	Fine, but who should have the last word?         
	The selectors, as theyre the ones whove been given a specific job At the same time, the views of the captain and coach are critical Going back in time, I cant recall an instance when I had to fight with the selectors.         
	Vengsarkar, who was the chief selector for two years from September 2006, worked with three captains  Rahul Dravid (Tests and ODIs), Anil Kumble (Tests) and Dhoni (ODIs only).         
	Asked whether Dhoni could indeed have been so upset by what seems a small issue, Vengsarkar replied: Ive been surprised by news of the threat reportedly made by him... Dhoni has always come across as balanced and Id be really taken aback if he did take such an extreme position...         
	The India captaincy doesnt come easy and its rare for somebody in the hottest seat  Dravid has been an exception  to vacate it on his own.         
	The selectors (with Krishnamachari Srikkanth in the chair), though, had gone to Thursdays meeting in Kanpur knowing that Dhoni would resist the move to drop the struggling Rudra Pratap (one wicket in the first two ODIs).         
	For, on the eve of the meeting, somebody connected with the selection process told this Reporter: Were looking at Irfan Pathan, but one problem could be that the captain is so fond of RP...         
	Irfan, eventually, did get into the 15  at Rudra Prataps expense.         
	Its another matter that the Board should have asked the selectors to overlook Irfan after his poor conduct in the Baroda-Railways Ranji match in Delhi.         
	The (hurling the ball at Sanjay Bangar) incident had occurred just a day before the selection meeting.         
	Captains do have favourites, but theyve got to deliver. Rudra Pratap, who can be unplayable in conditions where the ball swings, hasnt been doing that of late.         
	Incidentally, batsman Robin Uthappa is another one seen as a Dhoni favourite. Hes been out after the June-July Asia Cup and the captain appears to have accepted that quietly.         
	Bottom line is that Uthappa deserved to be dropped after the Asia Cup and, the other day, Rudra Pratap deserved to be left out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim has a lucky escape
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Karim has a lucky escape
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Karim Bencharifas antics nearly sparked off trouble in the galleries during Mohun Bagans goalless tie against CPT on Tuesday. The coach should consider himself extremely lucky to have been spared the ignominy of being sent to the galleries after pushing assistant referee Kashinath Sen.         
	In fact, referee Biplab Poddars inept handling of the situation led to Karims display of such audacity on the field.         
	The incident happened in the 80th minute when Jose Ramirez Barreto, who was in the clear inside the CPT half, was ruled off-side by Sen. The incident happened near the Mohun Bagan bench and Karim immediately rushed to Sen, pushing him from behind and making his displeasure clear.         
	Sanity, however, prevailed as assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee intervened in the nick of time. The referee, however, preferred to turn a blind eye.         
	Karim again got into the act a little later after a CPT player was brought down by Habibur Rehman Mondal. This time Poddar was at the receiving end of his mouthful.         
	Karim was, however, pleased with the performance. The fact that we managed to create so many chances proves that we didnt play too badly.

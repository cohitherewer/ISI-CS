	SUMMARY             Spiridon Louys      
	 A huge relief  
	 The inauguration of the first Games of the modern era, opened by King George I at the foot of the Acropolis on April 5, 1896, was a huge relief for Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Greece rsquo;s instability and economic stature, due to numerous conflicts, proved almost insurmountable obstacles.  
	 However, a rich Greek from Alexandria, George Averoff, donated a gift of one million drachma and in a matter of 18 months a superb white marble stadium, able to hold 60,000 people, was constructed.  
	 Baron de Coubertin rsquo;s dream of reinventing the Games was one he had coveted since 1892 mdash; two years later the official announcement was made and Athens chosen as the site.  
	 Almost 300 athletes, two-thirds of whom were Greek, from fourteen countries and three continents arrived in Athens.  
	 An American Harvard student, James Connolly, became the first Olympic champion of the modern era on the first day of the Games, winning the triple jump with a leap of 13.71 metres. Yet the most impressive story of the Games was one involving a marathon-winning shepherd from the Athens area: Spiridon Louys. Emulating the journey in 490 BC of the soldier Philippides, who ran 40km between the village of marathon and the Olympic stadium in Athens to announce the victory of Greece over Persia, Louys ran the distance in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds.  
	 Louys rsquo; triumph sent the country wild. It was just one of many eventual victories for the host country, who finished with 50 places of honour (given for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places), compared to the United States' 19, Germany's 14, and France's 11. Short of being a true success, Athens proved that the rebirth of the Olympic Games was a worthwhile project, and one which could be expanded in the future. It was simply a question of giving it a push in the right direction.   
	ANECDOTES  
	 Pick-me-up  
	 Greece rsquo;s Spiridon Louys, the marathon winner, refused official refreshments after the race preferring instead a few glasses of wine.  
	 Royal respect  
	 France rsquo;s Tournoi ran in the 100m sporting white gloves: ldquo;I rsquo;m running in front of the king, rdquo; he explained.  
	 Competing spectators  
	 A question mark exists over the precise number of competitors since, at the last minute, some English tourists put their names down to take part in the tennis tournament, notably John Boland who won the singles and the doubles after standing in for a sick player.  
	 Silver medals  
	 In 1896 Olympic champions were presented with a diploma, a crown made from olive twigs and a silver medal.  
	 The first ever  
	 America rsquo;s James B Connolly was the first athlete to etch his name on the Olympic roll of honour, winning gold in the triple jump (13.71m). Later, he took silver in the high jump and bronze in the long jump.  
	 Generous benefactor  
	 Greek benefactor Georges Averoff proposed his daughter rsquo;s hand in marriage to marathon winner Spiridon Louys, who politely declined.  
	 Natural talent  
	 America rsquo;s Robert Garrett had never set eyes on a discus before arriving in Athens. But that didn't stop him as he took the gold medal and even added the shot put title in a remarkable performance.  
	FEAT  
	 Historic triumph of Louys  
	 The marathon victory of the little shepherd from Amarousion in the first Olympic Games of the modern era was celebrated not only as a historic event, with Greece winning its only gold medal in athletics, but it also guaranteed the ecstatic Louys an eternal place in the nation's sporting history. His triumph, gained in front of huge crowds and during especially hot weather, was relevant enough for Louys to be given the honour of leading, as flag-bearer, the Greek delegation in the opening ceremony at the Berlin Games in 1936. That day, he handed an olive branch, a symbol of peace, to the chancellor Adolf Hitler.  
	 What is ironic, however, is that Louys almost never got the chance to compete in this marathon (run between 38 and 40km) mdash; included in the programme at the request of France, in memory of the soldier from Marathon. Eliminated after the qualifying rounds, the Greek runner was nonetheless included in the race thanks to the support of his colonel. When the colonel was about to give a lecture to his soldiers, he discovered that he had forgotten his reading glasses. Without hesitation, Louys offered to run the full 22km to collect the glasses - and promptly returned in record time to the delayed lecture.
  Resistant to the heat and the suffering of the marathon, the young Greek caught up with and overtook leader France rsquo;s Albin Lermusiaux, then the Australian, Edwin Flack, winner of the 800 and the 1500 m. At the entry to the Olympic stadium in Athens, a cannon shot announced the winner's imminent arrival to the excited crowds. An enormous cheer went up when Spiridon Louys appeared on the track, waved on by an ecstatic Greek crowd.  
	 In 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds, Louys recorded an historic victory in a race which, as part of their tradition, the Greeks were only too happy to embrace. In becoming the first marathon champion of the modern Olympics, symbolically, Louys carried on the torch which the soldier Philippides carried from Marathon to the Athenians to announce Themistocle rsquo;s victory over the Persians.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania vows to give her best
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania vows to give her best
                      
	New Delhi: Carrying the hopes of a billion people is a privilege for Sania Mirza and the Hyderabadi tennis ace vows to give everything it needs to bring home an individual Olympic medal, a feat only four Indians have managed since independence.         
	Sania will compete in the strongest ever singles field, led by world No. 1 Serb Ana Ivanovic, in the history of the quadrennial extravaganza and the young Indian knows well that the road ahead is full of challenges.         
	Yet, she is determined to live up to the expectations.         
	Winning an Olympic medal in any discipline is not easy and the womens singles field in tennis is very, very tough. Winning a medal in womens singles or doubles will have to be against all odds.         
	But as someone representing the country, it is my duty to do whatever I possibly can to try and achieve this glory for my country, Sania said. Whenever she enters the tennis courts, Sania knows the nation of one billion plus people is watching every movement curiously, but she says she does not buckle under the pressure.

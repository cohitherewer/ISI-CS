            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal start their CFL Premier Division campaign against Calcutta Port Trust at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee is not taking anything for granted and described CPT as a dangerous outfit.         
	East Bengal will be without eight of their players, busy with national duty, but Manoranjan wasnt reading much into it.         
	Weve had a few sessions of good practice How well the team is prepared will be known tomorrow (Monday), he said.         
	Its about playing according to the situation. We have a nice blend of experience and youth and its going to be a huge challenge for the youngsters, he added.         
	East Bengal, though, will be without a foreigner with Edmilson yet to arrive from Brazil. Ashim Biswas and Parveen Kumar are likely to start upfront.         
	CPT have forward Raman Vijayan and goalkeeper Gopal Das in their ranks. CPT may be considered a small team but they are a fighting side... Thats a worry, Manoranjan said.         
	Meanwhile, Gouranga Dutta and Surya Bikash Chakraborty will play for United SC in the CFL Premier Division.         
	East Bengal on Sunday had a meeting with United SC, paving the way for the duo to play for the latter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grant yet to decide on Lampard 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Grant yet to decide on Lampard 
                      
	London: Chelsea manager Avram Grant has to decide whether to recall a grieving Frank Lampard for the Champions League semi-finals after the Blues 2-1 win over Manchester United.         
	Lampard, whose mother Pat died Thursday, was left off the team for Saturdays Premier League game against the Red Devils, but returned to training the next day ahead of Wednesdays second-leg decider against Liverpool.         
	Although the midfielder wasnt at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, the Chelsea fans repeatedly sang his name and, when Michael Ballack headed the Blues in front, the players celebrated by holding up a shirt bearing Pat Lampards name.         
	The victory is for Frank and his family, Ballack said. It is a difficult time for everybody, especially his family, so we do not forget this.         
	But Grant has to balance the huge outpouring of emotion with the fact that Lampard has, until Sunday, barely trained over the last week.         
	Frank wants to play all the time, Grant said. When I put him on the bench after many years of playing, he didnt feel good with it. He wants to play but we need to respect his situation.         
	Grant will let the England midfielder decide if he is in the right frame of mind to play in such a big game.         
	We will leave the decision about Wednesday to him, Grant said. I will respect any decision he makes. Football is exciting, but there are things that are more important.

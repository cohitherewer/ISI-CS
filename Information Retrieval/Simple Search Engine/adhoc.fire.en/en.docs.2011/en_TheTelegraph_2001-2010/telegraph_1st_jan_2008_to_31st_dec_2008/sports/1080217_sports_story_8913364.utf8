The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB in battle of relegation with Viva Kerala
                                                   EB in battle of relegation with Viva Kerala
                      
	Kozhikode: East Bengal and Viva Kerala will cross swords over each other in a battle of relegation on Sunday.         
	Facing relegation, an out-of-form Viva Kerala will look to salvage some pride while facing three-time NFL champions East Bengal in the penultimate round of the ONGC I-League Sunday.         
	With 12 points from 16 outings, hosts Viva Kerala are placed second from the bottom and their task is absolutely cut out.         
	Even if they beat the Calcutta-team, they will face leaders Dempo in the final round.         
	East Bengal with 15 points, thus, are slightly better placed in that a draw will help Manoranjan Bhattacharjees side avoid relegation.         
	Salgaocar are the bottom-placed team and barring a miracle, set to be demoted.           (PTI)

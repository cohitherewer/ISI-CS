The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghtons note of caution 
                                                                                                                                                                                             Houghtons note of caution 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	Srinagar: National coach Bob Houghton is not one who believes that Indias place in the final of the SAFF Cup could be a foregone conclusion.         
	On Wednesday, at the National Stadium in Male, India take on Bhutan, one of the lowest-ranked teams in the Fifa rankings. Out of the 199 nations in the Fifa table, Indias neighbours are placed 196th.         
	First of all, anything can happen in football. We have to win the match out there on the pitch, Houghton said.         
	I was under the impression that we will face Afghanistan. But I watched Bhutans performance on television and was impressed. We havent played them recently. So I dont have any plans for them, the coach said.         
	Houghton, however, is more concerned about the formation of his defence, where two of the key players  N.S. Manju and Samir Naik  will be unavailable. While Manju has pulled a hamstring, Naik will have to sit out as he received marching orders in the previous match against Maldives.         
	According to sources, Houghton may play Mahesh Gawli in Naiks left-back position. While Dipak Mondal will continue to don the right backs role, Anwar and Gourmangi Singh are likely to play as the two stopper backs.         
	All the frontline players, who were rested against Maldives, are set to make a comeback in the starting XI.         
	When India played Bhutan in the SAF Games in Nepal in 1999, it turned out to be a cakewalk for the Indians. I.M. Vijayan scored in less than 30 seconds after the start and India won 4-0.         
	This time Bhutan are much more prepared. They are coached by Japanese Koji Gyotoku, who has made it clear that his team wont go down without a fight.         
	I have a set of amateur players and I am impressed with their enthusiasm and talent. I can assure you it wont be easy for India, he said.

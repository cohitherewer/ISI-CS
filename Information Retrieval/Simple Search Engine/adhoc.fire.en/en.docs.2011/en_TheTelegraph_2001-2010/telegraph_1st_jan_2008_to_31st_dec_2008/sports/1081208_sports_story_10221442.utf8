The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bracken turns to spin
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bracken turns to spin
                      
	Melbourne: A desperate Nathan Bracken is eyeing to cash in on the void in Australias spin department to force his way back into the national side and now-a-days the left-arm pacer is busy fine-tuning his spin bowling skills in the nets, instead of swing.         
	Ive been practising them (spin) a fair bit. Ive been bowling them at training but the hardest thing has been trying to get the chance to bowl them in a game, said Bracken, who was earlier this year ranked the worlds No. 1 one-day bowler.         
	Incidentally, during the last Sheffield Shield game against Tasmania, Bracken who took a match total of eight wickets playing for New South Wales, asked his skipper Dominic Thornely to allow him to bowl spin in the second innings.         
	I said to Dom (Thornely) the Tasmanians would go me I knew theyd want to take me on and figured it might have brought us a wicket. He wanted to see how things went but, to his credit, Dom didnt rule the idea out, Bracken told an Australian daily.         
	Although, he has been practising spin at the nets for quite sometime, Bracken admits having some problems in working out the pace of his tweakers.         
	Its been suggested I look at Colin Funky Miller as an example. Funky bowled them at about 90 to 95 kilometres an hour. He had a fast bowlers mentality because Colin would make sure the batsman couldnt get down to him.         
	I was bowling to a few of the younger guys the other day and one of them said during the session hed just realised I didnt turn the ball.         
	He came down the wicket for the next one and it turned in a big way. But I am still learning, he said.           (PTI)

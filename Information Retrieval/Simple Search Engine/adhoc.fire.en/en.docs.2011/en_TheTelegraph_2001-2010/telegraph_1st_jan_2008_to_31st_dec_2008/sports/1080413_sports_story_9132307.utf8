                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sharing attack with Pathan, Sreesanth excites Lee 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES             Brett Lee of Kings XI Punjab with Preity Zinta in Mohali on Saturday                           
	Calcutta: Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee said on Saturday that he was looking forward to sharing the new ball with Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Praising the Indian bowlers as world class, Lee said: It would be great to share the new ball with them.         
	The Australian quick also rubbished suggestion that the Indian Premier League (IPL) would lure players away from national duty, saying both could co-exist without being detrimental to each other.         
	I dont think we should compare or match the IPL with Australian team as both have their own place, said Lee, who would be playing for Kings XI Punjab.         
	On being quizzed about a recent survey conducted by Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) which says nearly half of the Aussie players were willing to give up their central contracts to play in the cash-awash IPL, Lee said: I dont think there is any reason why we cant do both (play for Australia and the IPL simultaneously).         
	My heart is for Australian team and wearing baggy green is a great honour, he added.         
	Coach Tom Moody said there wouldnt be any lack of motivation because of the presence of players from different countries.         
	They are all professionals and have played in different conditions at different times...A lot of pride is at stake, Moody said.         
	Preity Zinta, co-promoter of the team, Lee and Moody kick-started ticket sales with the first two selling and autographing tickets.         
	It is great to see so many people turning up to buy tickets and joining us to support and cheer Kings XI Punjab, Zinta said.

	Madrid: Atletico Madrid tightened their grip on fourth spot in the Primera Liga, and a berth in the Champions League qualifiers, with a 3-0 home win over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday.         
	Midfielder Ignacio Camacho, who scored two goals, got on the scoresheet for the first time while fellow teenager Sergio Aguero weighed in with his 17th goal of the season.         
	Atletico have 58 points, three behind third-placed Barcelona and five clear of Racing Santander who both play on Sunday.         
	At the other end of the table Real Zaragoza snatched a last-gasp 1-0 win over Deportivo Coruna to climb out of the relegation zone.         
	Zaragoza laid siege to the Deportivo area in the second half and looked as though they would be denied by a combination of brilliant keeping by Dudu Aouate and poor finishing.         
	But Argentine centre-back Roberto Ayala stabbed the ball home from one metre during a goalmouth scramble four minutes into stoppage time.         
	Zaragoza rose to 16th, one spot above Recreativo and two higher than Osasuna, who host leaders Real Madrid on Sunday.         
	Deportivo remained seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Sevilla who entertain Valladolid on Sunday.         
	At the Calderon, Camacho opened the scoring by heading past keeper Stefano Sorrentino after a corner midway through the first half.         
	Argentine striker Aguero made it 2-0 in the 54th minute when Maxi Rodriguez squared the ball following a scorching run down the right.         
	Camacho sealed victory in the 75th by tucking in a low shot after snapping up a miscued effort from Luis Garcia.         
	Meanwhile, Olympique Lyon missed a chance to close in on a seventh consecutive Ligue 1 title when they were held to a goalless draw at mid-table Nice on Saturday, add reports from Nice.         
	Leaders Lyon now have 73 points, five ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, with two games left.         
	Six-time champion Lyon struck the bar twice before the interval throubgh Juninho and Jeremy Toulalan but failed to score the goal that would have increased the pressure on Bordeaux.

 Former England captain on umpiring errors and related matters

      Tony Greig 
                
	Sydney: Former England captain Tony Greig has been a keen watcher of the goings-on in cricket. On Thursday, he spoke to The Telegraph about the poor umpiring at the SCG and related matters. 
       
	The following are excerpts 
       
	On whether hed himself walk 
    
	I wouldnt at the international level, but thats largely because Id been brought up in South Africa, where the umpiring wasnt good... As a cricketer, the best period (concerning umpiring decisions) I experienced was at the County level in the 1970s when players walked... The umpires were also pros and if you didnt walk, then they felt you were stuffing them... Word got around and, well, they would retaliate. They would do so because they thought that those who didnt walk were cheats... When people didnt, they got nailed. 
    
	On whether all walked in County cricket in the 1970s 
    
	No... Barry Richards, for example, was nicknamed Glue because he never left the crease! 
    
	On whether his England teammates would walk 
    
	Most of them would, even though Id plead with them not to because the Australians, for example, wouldnt walk... In the Ashes, Id tell them that we would begin a Test six down because of our blokes walking and the Australians not doing so. 
    
	On technology exposing umpires 
    
	Its not that mistakes werent made in the days when there werent live telecasts, its just that technology is showing the umpires in poor light... I refuse to believe that (Steve) Bucknor went out of his way to give (Andrew) Symonds not out yesterday (Wednesday)... He made a mistake and, because of the high quality of cameras, stood exposed. Because technology is getting better, were ending up in a dreadful situation where umpires are getting exposed and the batsmen dont walk... In my view, its best that the players take control of their own game... The batters should walk, do what (Adam) Gilchrist does. 
    
	On Gilchrist 
    
	Hes far ahead of the others because he walks... He didnt think twice about walking even in a World Cup semi-final (versus Sri Lanka in Port Elizabeth, 2003)... 
    
	On whether theres a solution given that few batsmen are going to emulate Gilchrist 
    
	Yes... The Match Referee and/or third (TV) umpire should press a button if theyre convinced that the on-field umpire has erred... It could be for any form of dismissal and would mean not out... Match Referees, especially, keep travelling all over the world and its time they did something besides sitting in air-conditioned cabins... Theyve got to stop what has become an embarrassing situation for all concerned. The Mike Procters should press a button when they see its not out. 
    
	On centurion Symondss admission during Wednesdays media conference that hed been very lucky not to be given out on 30 
    
	I wouldnt like your headline to say Ive called him a cheat... Symonds, I feel, has been caught up in the system... 
    
	On the justification by most that the decisions even out 
    
	I dont agree with that logic... Just dont agree. 
    
	On whether batsmen dont walk as theres too much at stake, financially and otherwise 
    
	Im sure its a factor, but Im not sure how big a factor it is... Id like to add that if the players arent good enough, then the game will sort them out sooner rather than later... Umpires cant save them. 
    
	On whether insecurity could also be a factor 
    
	Well, even if hes dropped, a good batsman can always come back after a poor decision. 
    
	On Steve Waughs call to have Simon Taufel officiating in the premium Tests 
    
	If the best happens to be an Australian, I see no reason why he shouldnt stand in a Test involving Australia... I wouldnt have an issue if the other on-field umpire in an India series is an Indian... Id go for efficiency, not nationality... In fact, Im disappointed to learn that theres no Indian on the ICCs Elite Panel... Cant believe it. 
    
	On the Elite Panel 
    
	Im not sure what good it has done... Personally, Ive never had an issue with the integrity of umpires. 
    
	On the best umpires of his time 
    
	There were quite a few... Charlie Elliot, Dickie Bird... 
    
	Finally, on his reluctance to call non-walkers cheats 
    
	(Grins) Thats because I didnt walk myself and people could call me a cheat... But I didnt walk because the opposition batters didnt do so... Hopefully, in time, well be seeing more Gilchrists.

                                                                                                                                                                                           45 overs per side in Guwahati
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday curtailed the number of overs for the sixth one-day International between India and England at the Nehru Stadium here because of the early sunset in this part of the country.         
	The BCCI informed the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) that the number of overs in each innings would be a maximum of 45 instead of 50, and the lunch break in between the two innings would be curtailed to 30 minutes instead of 40.         
	According to ACA secretary Bikash Baruah, the match will now start at 8.30 am and end by 3.20 pm. The decision was taken after match officials found the light to be inadequate after 3.40 pm.

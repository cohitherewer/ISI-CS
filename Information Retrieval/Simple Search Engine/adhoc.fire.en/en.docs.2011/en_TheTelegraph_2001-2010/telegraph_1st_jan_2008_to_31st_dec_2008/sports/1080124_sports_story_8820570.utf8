      STAR RACER
                  
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs ward Aperitivo did it again for a third time in a row, winning the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup, the main attraction in the nine-event race card on Wednesday. C. Alford partnered the winner, a seven-year-old by Diffident out of Dramatic Irony. The victory for the city Derby winner, three years ago, not only entitled him to pocket a hefty purse of about Rs 11.21 plus a trophy valued at Rs 40,000, it also elevated his status as he walked into the Hall Of Fame.
     
	The Indian Champagne Stakes was , in contrast, closely contested by two brothers  Neeraj and Nilesh Rawal. If Neeraj partnered the winner, Arcology  a Vijay-trainee  in a businesslike manner, Nilesh was all at sea on first-timer Lycia Falcon to lose the race by the proverbial whisker. Rutherford Alford, also a debutant, was hoping to lead in the Falcon but was disappointed. The jockey-turned-trainers career was cut short after a near-fatal fall in Bangalore about 14 months ago. Now confined to a wheelchair, Rutherford has been encouraged by the RCTC with a training licence  the first ever to a physically handicapped professional.

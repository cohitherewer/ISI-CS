            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: It was a sterling performance at Ludhianas Guru Nanak Dev Stadium 14 months ago that ended East Bengals decade long wait to win the Federation Cup.         
	On Friday, a day before the red and yellow brigade take on JCT in the ninth round of the I-League at the same venue, East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario said his team was ready to make a dramatic upward surge on the league table.         
	In the morning, the boys were telling me that the Guru Nanak Dev Stadium was a lucky venue for us in the last Federation Cup, said Rozario. I am sure our journey towards winning the I-League could now begin here with a victory against JCT.         
	Rozario, who is likely to miss dependable defender Surkumar Singh due to an injury, said the next three matches could prove to be the turning point for his team.         
	After playing JCT, we will travel to Goa to play Dempo and then will host Churchill Brothers in Calcutta. These are very crucial outings and if we manage to come out unscathed, we will be in a position to go all out for the title after the league reopens in January, the East Bengal coach said.         
	At the moment we have 12 points and I wont really lose my sleep if we finish on 19 at the end of the 11th round, Rozario added.         
	The JCT coach, Sukhwinder Singh, said all he hoped for was his team to play to their potential.

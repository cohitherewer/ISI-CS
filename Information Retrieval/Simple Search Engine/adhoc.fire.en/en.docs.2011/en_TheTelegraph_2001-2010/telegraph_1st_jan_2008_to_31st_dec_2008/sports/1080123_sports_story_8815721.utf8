	Melbourne: Indian seamers have found a new admirer in none other than Australias renowned fast bowling mentor Troy Cooley, who said the visitors exploited the Waca conditions in Perth really well. 
    
	They kept a good seam position throughout the Test match, which was good. We probably tend to hit the deck a bit harder, but they really bowled well in the conditions, he said. (PTI)

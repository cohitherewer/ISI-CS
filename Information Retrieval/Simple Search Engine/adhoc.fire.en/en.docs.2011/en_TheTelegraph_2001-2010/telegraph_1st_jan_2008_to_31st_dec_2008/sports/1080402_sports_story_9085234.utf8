The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pitch will be sporting, says Motera curator
                                                   Pitch will be sporting, says Motera curator
                      
	Ahmedabad: After the run-glut on a flat Chennai pitch, all eyes would be on the Motera wicket for the second Test between India and South Africa starting from Thursday.         
	The curator, however, insisted on Tuesday that it would be a sporting track.         
	I expect the wicket to be a sporting one, unlike the one in Chennai, helping the fast bowlers initially and then aiding the spinners on the last two days.         
	We have kept some grass on it. The texture is 50 per cent clay and the rest a mixture of red and black soil, said curator Dhiraj Parsana.         
	The free grass cover on the surface can help the seamers.         
	They can expect some carry. I expect the wicket to behave better than in Chennai, the former left-arm Test mediumpacer said.         
	Incidentally, the last Test South Africa have played at this venue more than a decade ago, saw a dramatic collapse in their batting, not against the Indian spinners but against speedster Jawagal Srinath.

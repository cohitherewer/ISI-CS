	London: Manchester City manager Mark Hughes will assess the fitness of 34m British record signing Robinho before making a final decision on the Brazilians prospects of making the starting XI in Saturdays self-styled clash of the cash against Chelsea.         
	With the 24 year old having spent the last 10 days in South America, Hughes has so far been unable to work with Robinho and is understood to be reluctant to increase the already intense spotlight on the forward by risking him from the start against Chelsea following his draining 12 hour flight from Rio.         
	Liverpool duo Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard were both unexpectedly passed fit on Friday for Saturdays Premier League game against champions Manchester United at Anfield.         
	After both players trained on Friday, Benitez told the clubs website: They are both much better. They came through a full training session this morning.         
	Gianfranco Zola, one of the greatest overseas players to grace the English game during his seven years at Chelsea, was named as the new manager of their Premier League rivals West Ham United on Thursday.

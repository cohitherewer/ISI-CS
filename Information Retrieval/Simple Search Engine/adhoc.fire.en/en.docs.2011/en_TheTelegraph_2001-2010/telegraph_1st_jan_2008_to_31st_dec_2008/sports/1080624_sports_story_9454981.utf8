	London: Returning to his favourite stage and resuming his dominant ways on grass, Roger Federer started his bid for a sixth straight Wimbledon title on Monday by sweeping Dominik Hrbaty in straight sets on a sunbathed Centre Court.         
	In keeping with tradition, Federer had the honour of opening the play on the main stadium court as defending champion at the 122nd Wimbledon championships.         
	He seemed right at home as he beat Hrbaty 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 for his 60th straight grass-court win and 35th consecutive victory at the All England Club.         
	I played well. It was a good match against a good friend of mine, Federer said. I was consistent all the way throughout.         
	I didnt have to face a break point. Its good, but never easy to open in Centre Court, but its a real honour.         
	A few minutes before Federer closed out his match, two-time womens champion Serena Williams completed a harder-than-expected 7-5, 6-3 win on court one over Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.         
	Following Federer on Centre Court was top-seeded woman Ana Ivanovic, who beat Rossana de Los Rios of Paraguay 6-1, 6-2 in less than an hour in her first match since winning the French Open and taking over the No. 1 ranking.         
	The Serb never faced a break point and ripped 13 baseline winners. Coming as the top seed, lots of people just expect you to win, Ivanovic said.         
	You have to work hard, especially on grass. Everything is happening so fast. Among the men, No. 3-ranked Novak Djokovic, the Australian Open champion who could face Federer in the semi-finals overcame a poor second set on Centre Court and beat Michael Berrer 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0.         
	Djokovic dropped the last five games of the second set against the German left-hander, but won the next three games while dropping only one point and cruised the rest of the way.         
	Federer won the first 11 points of the match, setting the tone for a trouble-free, one-sided match. Every time you walk out (on Centre Court) its beautiful. I mean the grass is beautiful. The grass is perfect. You really feel like nobody has really walked on it. It felt very special again, the exulted world No. 1 said.         
	The 30-year-old Hrbaty, playing his 12th Wimbledon, had beaten Federer in their only two previous meetings  in 2000 and 2004.         
	But the Slovakian player, who had elbow surgery last year, has slipped to No. 273 in the rankings and had won only two matches this year on the top-tier tour. There were some light moments in the match. In the sixth game of the first set, Hrbaty ran down a lob and, with his back to the net, flipped a reverse shot down the line past a startled Federer.         
	As Hrbaty ran across the court with hands raised in celebration, Federer smiled and clapped his racket.         
	He hit the shot of the match behind his back, Federer said. In the final changeover at 5-2 in the third, Hrbaty realizing it could be his last time on Centre Court, sat in a chair alongside Federer and the two chatted and laughed.         
	It was quite nice he did that. It was nice to share that moment on Centre Court together. Hrbaty paid tribute to the champion. I just wanted to tell him hes a great friend of mine and I appreciate that, he said. Federer will next face big-serving Swede Robin Soderling, who beat Kevin Kim of the US 7-5, 0-6, 6-3, 6-4.         
	In other mens matches, 10th seeded Marcos Baghdatis, a semi-finalist in 2006 and quarter finalist last year moved into the second round by beating Steve Darcis of Belgium, 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 6-3.         
	Former champion Lleyton Hewitt drew on his vast experience to tame Dutchman Robin Haase on his Wimbledon debut, the Australian prevailing 6-7, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7, 6-2 in their first round encounter on Monday.         
	After losing the third set Haase needed medical treatment for blisters on both feet but showed no ill effects by easily claiming a second tiebreak to send the match into a decider.         
	The 27-year-old Hewitt slammed his racket to the ground in frustration after spurning two break points in Hasses opening service game but needed to save two against his own in the next.         
	Also advancing among the women was No. 4 Svetlana Kuznetsova, who overcame Mathilde Johansson of France 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-3.         
	Five lower seeded women went out, including No. 12 Patty Schnyder. The Swiss player, who reached the fourth round last year, lost to Australias Casey Dellacqua 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.         
	Serena Williams, whose Wimbledon wins in 2002 and 03 are among her eight major titles, struggled in the first set. She fended off five break points against the French Open quarter finalist. The turning point came at 5-5 when Kanepi had a break point for 6-5. Williams attacked and put away a forehand volley smash, letting out a shout and pumping her fist. She held serve and Kanepi double faulted on set point in the next game. Williams was in command throughout the second set.

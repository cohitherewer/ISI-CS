The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds will return, says Clarke
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Symonds will return, says Clarke
                      
	Hyderabad: Michael Clarke does not wear his heart on his sleeve and is not one to admit that it was painful for him to dump pal Andrew gone-fishing Symonds.         
	But what the Australian vice captain does not hide is how much he yearns for the return of the feisty all-rounder he counts among his chums.         
	Asked how difficult it was to acquiesce to such a harsh decision for someone so close to him, Clarke evaded a direct answer and maintained there was no other way out.         
	This was a decision taken by the leadership group and I still believe it was taken in the best interest of the team and in the best interest of Symmo as well, Clarke said.         
	But he makes it very evident that he cannot wait to see Symonds back to where he belonged. (PTI)

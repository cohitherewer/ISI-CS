	Kanpur: Piyush Chawla, who played his second Test at his home ground, believed that India were in a good position to bounce back in the series after dismissing South Africa for 265 on Day I of the final Test on Friday.         
	Although the wicket is a slow turner, we have an experienced and quality batting order and they will be able to do the job for us and we can then bowl them out cheaply in the second innings, Chawla, who replaced the injured captain Anil Kumble and gave India their first breakthrough, told a news conference on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indias Day I performance         
	It was a very good day for us We played as a unit and bowling them out for 265 was hugely satisfying.

	I was not satisfied with my performance since I was looking for more wickets. But Im happy that other bowlers has stuck to their job.         
	Indias chances in the match         
	I feel well do well tomorrow (Saturday). It will now depend on how our batsmen play. Although the wicket is a slow turner, we have an experienced and quality batting order and they will be able to do the job for us and we can then bowl them out cheaply in the second innings.         
	On his return to the Test fold         
	It is a great feeling to play the second Test after a long time. I came to know that Im playing only 45 minutes before the match. I will be more happy if we win it.         
	Whether he was feeling any pressure on being back in the team         
	You know pressure will always be there. But its nice to play on my home ground. The crowd has cheered all through the day It feels great.         
	Turning point of the day         
	Ishants late spell he was simply superb.         
	Anil Kumbles absence

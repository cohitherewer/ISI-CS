The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif case deferred till Sunday
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif case deferred till Sunday
                  Mohammed Asif                     
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday dismissed media reports which claimed that detained speedster Mohammed Asif has been charged for alleged possession of contraband drugs in Dubai.         
	Nadeem Akram, PCB director of administration, insisted that the beleaguered fast bowler has not been charged with any offence by the authorities in Dubai.         
	Many media reports had claimed that Asif had been charged for possession of drugs.         
	These reports are incorrect. The factual position is that he appeared before the public prosecutor on Thursday and recorded his statement. He has not been charged as yet of any offence, Akram said.         
	The PCB official said after Thursdays meeting the prosecutor had with Asif and the PCB lawyers, the board was hopeful that Asif would be released on Sunday.         
	We are confident the prosecutor will allow him to return home on Sunday when he next hears the case, Akram said.         
	Shafqat Naghmi, another board official, had earlier told a news conference in Lahore that the reports of the tests conducted on the substance found in Asifs possession and his blood and urine had been sent to the prosecutor by the investigators.         
	But he did not give details of the reports saying Asif claimed the substance found on him was just a medicine prescribed to him by a hakeem for his elbow injury.         
	But sources close to the board said even if Asif is allowed to return home on Sunday, he might face a probe by the PCB as his actions have brought shame for Pakistan cricket.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson said Asifs detention in Dubai will hamper the pacers progress to full bowling form after an injury lay-off.         
	Asif was in the original squad to tour Bangladesh for the tri-series but was dropped after the drug incident.         
	He was in the team as he had been making a successful comeback from his injury mostly through IPL. From that point of view this incident is disruptive and could hamper his progress and return to full form, Lawson said.

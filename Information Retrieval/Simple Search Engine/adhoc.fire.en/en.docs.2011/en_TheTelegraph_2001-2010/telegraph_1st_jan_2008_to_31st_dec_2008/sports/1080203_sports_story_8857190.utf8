      PRAVESH GUPTA
   
	Mumbai: The mood at the Mahalaxmi raceground is upbeat despite the drubbing punters got on Saturday. Sunday is another day, they say. Expectations are very high in the 2,400m McDowell Indian Derby as it looks to be the most open race in the last decade with at least half-a-dozen runners having a good chance of landing the prize. Bourbon King is a reluctant favourite, say the Mumbai bookmakers but trainer S. Ganapathy argues about the 10-win streak of the Diffident-Queen Ann son. 
     
	The King has delivered in all his last starts in a workman like manner. He may lack the turn of foot of those who make the finish look impressive but his potential should not be undermined, according to someone close to the Ganapathy-stable. The horses stamina is also been questioned but Ganapathy has been countering all as Doubting Thomases.
     
	Trainer S. Padmanabhan (Paddy) has already been quoted saying that his charge Retribution is the best stayer in the field and the horse also has the best of jockey in world, Frankie Dettorie, doing duty on the Placerville-First One Home son. quot;What else would you look for in the Derby field, asked Paddy. The horse has put his mind into racing quite late and his Golconda Derby win was quite assuring in respect of his winning chances in the Indian Derby, according to Paddy.
     
	Goblin is a bit of lazy type. He needed the Guineas run yet he finished about six lengths behind Bourbon King. He is out and out stayer. Dont rule him out, said trainer Imtiaz Sait.
     
	The Hyderabad challenger, Ruby Queen, has been on the up since winning the Golconda Guineas. She may not have beaten much in the Guineas but her Oaks win revealed her real potential when she made a hack of Sweeping Success, the 2,000m Deccan Derby winner.
     
	Hotstepper was seen gaining ground on to Bourbon King in the Indian Guineas, prompting the horses connection to requisite the services of Mick Kinane whos past exploits on the Mahalaxmi ground are well known. However, the Glory of Dancer colt is himself a suspect over the Derby course.
     
	Finally, the Calcutta challenger, Regal Connection, was never considered as a Derby material but surprised all beating a strong fancy like Classic Sky. The Vijay Singh-trained horse is still improving and the long Mahalaxmi straight will further his cause. 
     
	All said and done, Retribution gets the first call while Bourbon King, Regal Connection and Ruby Queen may fight out for the minor placings in the Derby. SELECTIONS

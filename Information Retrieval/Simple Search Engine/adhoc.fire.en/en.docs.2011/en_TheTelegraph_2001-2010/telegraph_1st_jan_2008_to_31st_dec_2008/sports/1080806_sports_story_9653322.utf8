                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ruud bids adieu   to Oranje
                            
	Amsterdam: The Netherlands striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has retired from international soccer to concentrate on his club career with Real Madrid, the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) said on Monday.         
	It said the 32-year-old had told coach Bert van Marwijk he would no longer be available for the Dutch team after deciding he could not perform to his best for club and country.         
	After studying the schedule of Real Madrid and the Dutch team I realised ... playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore I made this choice, Van Nistelrooy was quoted as saying.         
	Im taking no chances and after the enjoyable Euro 2008 finals I can look back upon (my decision) with a good feeling.         
	Van Nistelrooy won a total of 64 caps and scored 33 goals after making his international debut in 1998.         
	The former Manchester United striker missed Euro 2000 with a knee injury and the Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup but he scored four goals at his first major tournament, the next European Championship finals in Portugal in 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africans fight back on a day of anti-climax
                                                     South Africans fight back on a day of anti-climax
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Virender Sehwag made 319                           
	Chennai: The buzz around the stadium on Saturday morning indicated that something special was about to happen. It was a huge letdown as Virender Sehwag fell for 319 but Rahul Dravid stayed put to script his 25th century and en route, completed 10,000 runs in Tests.         
	There was hardly any other positive for India on Day IV as South Africa changed the tenor of the first Test of the Future Cup. At close, the visitors, having gone through a tricky 147 minutes of batting, were 44 runs in front with nine wickets in hand.         
	It will be left to the spinning duo of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh to unleash some magic on a slow final day track and force a victory. But going by the mood in the dressing room and the conditions, not too many are optimistic.         
	The Indian pacers seemed to have learnt nothing from their South African counterparts earlier in the day as Sreesanth and Rudra Pratap Singh wasted the new ball. It would have been prudent to open the attack with a spinner instead of relying on the pacers!         
	As early as the eighth over, it was back to the predictable ways of sub continent cricket  four close-in fielders prying in front of the wicket with the spinners bowling in tandem. The first ball from Harbhajan turned and he trapped Graeme Smith leg-before in his second over.         
	The captains departure had no effect as Neil McKenzie (59 batting) and Hashim Amla (35 batting) carried on the good work. Kumble tried the options available  Sourav Ganguly sending down two tidy overs  but nothing could prevent the second-wicket pair from carrying on where they had left in the first innings.         
	For 28 minutes on Saturday morning the dream of overtaking Brian Laras 400 stayed alive. Sehwag was cautious against the second new ball as he pushed and prodded to go past his previous best of 309. The expectations had been rising since Friday evening, and by the time play started there were more people on the stands than on any of the first three days.         
	Sehwag batted coolly and was unperturbed by the circumstances. He provided the first hint of aggression, pulling Makhaya Ntini to the mid-wicket boundary to go past Chris Gayles 317 on the all-time list.         
	But it was all over in the next ball as the nick went to Neil McKenzies right at first slip. The 319 runs spanned 531 minutes and came off 304 balls including 43 boundaries and five sixes.         
	The sudden disbelief and an eerie silence gave way to a standing ovation. The South Africans too joined in.         
	More disappointment followed as Sachin Tendulkar lasted just nine minutes at a venue where he has scored 736 runs including four hundreds. It was his 14th duck in Test cricket.         
	Ntini was suddenly looking dangerous as he got the ball to move off the seam. Dale Steyn, too, managed to extract some life and reverse swing and ran through the late-order to finish with four wickets.         
	We didnt bowl badly yesterday, we just witnessed somebody who batted unbelievably well. Sehwag kind of took the game away from us but we fought back today. We learnt a lot and we executed it a lot better today, Styen said later.         
	Sourav (24) was not in his elements during his 56-minute stay. There was the occasional punch through covers but he never looked confident enough for a long innings. He fell in an unconvincing fashion off the bottom edge.         
	Dravid, in the meantime, reached the five-figure mark in Tests clipping Morne Morkel to mid wicket for a single. He started the day slowly, adding just three to his overnight 65 from the first 30 balls he faced.         
	Sourav, who had seen him score his first run at Lords nearly 12 years ago was at hand to celebrate with a hug. Dravid became the sixth batsmen in the world and the third Indian after Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar to reach the landmark.         
	Dravid ended the first session on 99 and a straight driven four of Ntini sparked the celebrations a second time. A double bonanza for the former India captain in the presence of wife Vijeta and son Samit. Dravids 111 took him 396 minutes and 291 balls and he played the perfect foil for Sehwags monumental knock.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni made a silly attempt to charge at Steyn as he had no answer to a short one directed at his body. As he fended tentatively, Boucher completed the formalities.         
	V.V.S. Laxman was left to fight a lone battle before gifting Harris another wicket. South Africa had done a commendable job to restrict India to 627.

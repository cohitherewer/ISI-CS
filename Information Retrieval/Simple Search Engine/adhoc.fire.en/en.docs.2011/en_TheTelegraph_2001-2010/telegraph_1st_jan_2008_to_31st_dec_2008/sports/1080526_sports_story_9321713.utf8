    - German great looks forward to taking a penalty kick tomorrow           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bayern Munichs Oliver Kahn with autograph seekers at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines, on Sunday. The legendary German goalkeeper inaugurated a Kolkata Police soccer tournament. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                   
	Calcutta: It was exactly at 1.23pm when the six-foot-two-inch figure of Oliver Kahn strode out of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to board the team bus.         
	Dressed casually in a blazer over a white T-shirt and sporting a pair of dark glasses, the living legend of German football stopped for a moment to look around and then gently waved to his fans waiting outside the security cordon.         
	And when he spoke, he was even more impressive. Addressing the media an hour after his arrival, Kahn spoke about his career, his successes and failures and his plans after retiring from the game.         
	The former Germany captain made it clear that a career spanning over 22 years had taken a toll on him.         
	After I bid adieu to the game, I may try my luck as a commentator for a television channel, said Kahn. Surely, I need to get a little distance from the game. I need a break.         
	The former three-time world Goalkeeper of the Year made no secret of the fact that he was utterly disappointed after being sidelined by Juergen Klinsmann in the 2006 World Cup which was hosted by his country.         
	It was a sad exit for me, certainly said Kahn. I was disappointed but had nothing to do. After all the coach (Klinsmann) had a plan. We had to abide by that.         
	Kahn, who has already played his last competitive match for Bayern in the Bundesliga, said he did not regret losing the 2002 World Cup final to Brazil or losing the Champions League final to Manchester United in 1999.         
	Success and failure are part of life. I have to take it in my stride, was his comment when asked about the best and worst moments of his life. There were several ups and downs in my life. I can not talk about particular experiences. After all, I have played the game for 22 years at the top.         
	It is interesting that Klinsmann will be the new Bayern Munich coach from the next season. I will look forward to see how he does. I hold no grudge against Klinsmann and Jens Lehmann.         
	Kahn has no idea about Indian football but he is eager to enjoy the match against Mohun Bagan. So much so, that if an opportunity comes, he would not mind taking a penalty kick at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	I wont mind taking a penalty kick, he said.         
	Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who was sitting beside Kahn, smiled and said: There could be trouble about who would be taking it if we win a penalty.         
	To Kahn, his former coach Sepp Maier still remains the best goalkeeper in the world. He was the best, though I have great regards for Gianluigi Buffon, Edwin Van der Sar, Petr Czech.

                                                   DAY II HIGHLIGHTS

           
	 This was the 17th time Sachin Tendulkar notched up 150-plus score in an innings. Brian Lara (19) and Don Bradman (18) lead the list of batsmen with most 150-plus individual scores 
    
	 Sachin equalled the record of most 150-plus scores in Tests against Australia. Fridays was his fifth against the home side. He joined Walter Hammond (5) and Brian Lara (5), who also have five 150-plus scores against Australia 
    
	 Sachin Tendulkar (1509), when on 144, also went past 1500 runs on Australian soil. He became the eighth visiting batsman to do so. For the record, the most runs by a visiting batsman on Australian soil is 2493 by Englands Jack Hobbs who happens to be the only visiting batsman to score 2000-plus runs in Australia 
    
	 Brad Hogg, playing his seventh Test, finally took his first catch in Tests to dismiss Tendulkar, more than 12 years after he made his debut in 1996 
    
	 The 107-run eighth wicket partnership between Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh was only the second 100-run partnership for the eighth wicket at the Adelaide Oval. The first one was a 243 run eighth-wicket stand between Australians Roger Hartigan and Clement Hill against England and came a hundred years ago in 1907-08 
    
	 Harbhajan (63) scored his fourth Test 50, his second consecutive one. He equalled his highest score against Australia (63 in Sydney) but failed to get past his highest Test score which remains 66 versus Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, 2001 
    
	 With 414 dismissals (377 catches, 37 stumpings) Adam Gilchrist broke the world record for most Test dismissals, getting past South Africas Mark Boucher with his 413 (394 catches, 19 stumpings)

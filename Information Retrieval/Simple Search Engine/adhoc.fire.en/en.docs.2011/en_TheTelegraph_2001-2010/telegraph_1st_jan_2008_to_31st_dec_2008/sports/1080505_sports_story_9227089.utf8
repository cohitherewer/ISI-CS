	New Delhi: In an embarrassing revelation, the under-7 girls national champion  along with five others  has been found over-age in the ongoing under-9 National Chess Championship here.    
	National under-7 champion N. Madhumita, S. Akhila, H. Tejaswini, Sagarika Ilvk  all from Andhra Pradesh  and Orissas Shovna and Sonali Jena were declared over-age after the Delhi Chess Association (DCA) conducted medical examination of 14 players on Saturday, suspecting the correctness of their submitted birth certificates.    
	DCA president and All India Chess Federation (AICF) treasurer Bharat Singh Chauhan said if the organising committee has doubts about players age, they can subject them to medical examination to verify their age.

	There are three matches left in the league and possibly two Cup matches, he told the newspaper after a training session in the southern Swedish city of Malmo. Perhaps I can play even as early as next Sunday.    
	Ibrahimovic, who suffered a knee injury in March, is confident he will be fully fit for the European Championship in June. I will be fit in plenty of time, he said.

                                                    Steve: Dravid should open with Sehwag in Sydney

	Calcutta: Steve Waugh feels India should open with Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag in the second Test beginning in Sydney on Wednesday. 
    
	I would keep him (Dravid) as an opener but I would bring in Sehwag to open with him. If Sehwag comes in and plays his shots, his natural way will take the pressure off Dravid who can work his way back into a bit of form, the former Australian captain told The Daily Telegraph. 
    
	If both guys at the top of the order are struggling together, then it makes it real hard work. Jaffer would have to be the guy that misses out. 
    
	Waugh was all praise for Dravid. He is a genuinely good guy. He is obviously struggling at the moment but every player is entitled to struggle once or twice in his career. He has had a phenomenal last decade. He probably hasnt timed his poor form well, but I certainly wouldnt write him off for the rest of the series. 
    
	I only need to look back to one of my early series Andrew Jones of New Zealand was written off after the first Test. Everyone said this bloke cant play and he got 150 in the next Test in Adelaide. Thats the great thing about cricket. You can come back and you can turn things around quickly. 
    
	I was quite surprised he relinquished the captaincy because I knew he really valued that and cherished that role. There may be one or two issues going on behind the scenes that people dont know about. You never know quite what is going on. I think Dravid needs to just enjoy his cricket. He didnt really look like he enjoyed it. He has to take in the attitude that he doesnt have anything to prove to anyone. He has done everything you could possibly do in cricket  just go in with a clean slate and enjoy yourself, Waugh said. 
    
	Sachin Tendulkars form has also impressed Waugh and felt he could prove to be the danger man in Sydney. He was very impressive in the first innings. He looked set for a big hundred. He has set himself for a very big series here. It will be his last series in Australia. His form has been up and down for the last 12 months, two years. He hasnt got a lot of runs against the top Test nations. This is an important series for him. I think he is the danger man in Sydney for Australia. 
    
	On whether India can bounce back in the series, Waugh said: Their bowlers got Australia out for 343 in Melbourne from 135 for one. That showed a lot of character. That showed a lot of dedication led by a tough cricketer in Anil Kumble who wont accept defeat easily. He will be hurting from that first Test match. 
    
	There are a billion people very disappointed and wanting a better show. If they are ever going to lift, they are going to lift in the next Test. They have got matchwinners. 
    
	In Melbourne, Ricky Pontings men recorded their 15th straight win. Waugh said he would not be surprised if the side went on to win even 30 Tests in a row. 
    
	There is no reason why they cant. The way they are playing at the moment, the way they are dominating...

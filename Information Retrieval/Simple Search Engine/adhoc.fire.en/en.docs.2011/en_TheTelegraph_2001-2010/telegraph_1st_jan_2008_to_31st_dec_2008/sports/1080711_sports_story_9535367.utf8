The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifa clarifies rules
                                                                                                                                                                                           Fifa clarifies rules
                      
	Berne: World soccers governing body Fifa has reminded clubs that they must release any players aged under 23 who are called up by their countries for next months Olympic Games.         
	The release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs, Fifa said in a statement on Thursday. For Beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply.         
	A Fifa spokesman said that the clarification had been sent out after several European clubs questioned the need to release players at a time when their own domestic leagues will be getting underway.         
	Under rules agreed between IOC and Fifa, the Olympic football competition is primarily an under-23 event, although teams are also allowed to select up to three older players.         
	Clubs are not obliged to release the overage players, but Fifa president Sepp Blatter, an IOC member, has repeatedly urged them to do so out of respect for the Olympic spirit.         
	 Brazil, who have never won the Olympic title, named an impressive squad for the Games on Tuesday, including Ronaldinho and Real Madrid striker Robinho as two of their overage selections. Barcelona have already said they will not release Ronaldinho despite having told the player that he no longer features in their plans for next season.         
	Sixteen countries are taking part in the Olympic soccer tournament, including four of Fifas top 10 ranked teams: Argentina, Brazil, Italy and the Netherlands.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winning start for Ramos
                                                                                                                                                                                           Winning start for Ramos
                      
	Brussels: A double from Raul helped Juande Ramos secure his first win as Real Madrid coach in the Champions League on Wednesday and extended the Spanish strikers record as the competitions all-time top goalscorer.         
	Rauls two goals and a third by Arjen Robben gave Real a 3-0 victory over Uefa Cup holders Zenit St Petersburg in group H in their first match under Ramos, who replaced the sacked Bernd Schuster on Tuesday.         
	Holders Manchester United took top spot in group E despite being held 2-2 at home by Danes AaB Aalborg, who qualify for the Uefa Cup. Villarreal were second in the group after a 2-0 defeat at Celtic and had forward Guille Franco sent off.         
	A lacklustre start to the season by Madrid culminated in a 4-3 defeat to Sevilla on Sunday and Schusters dismissal ahead of a crucial La Liga trip to rivals Barcelona this weekend.         
	Raul fired home the opener midway through the first half before adding his 64th goal in European soccers top competition in the second half. Robben scored just after halftime.         
	Porto beat an under-strength Arsenal side 2-0 to clinch top spot in group G.         
	 Real finished second in the group on goal difference behind Juventus, who were held 0-0 at home by BATE Borisov.

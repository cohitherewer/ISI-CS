The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hopes rest with Saina, Anup
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hopes rest with Saina, Anup
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal                           
	Beijing: Shuttlers Saina Nehwal and Anup Sridhar were the only bright spots for India on an overcast day, the gloomy weather a reflection of the Indian mood.         
	Nehwal, the national champion, registered a 21-18, 21-10 victory over Ukraines Larysa Gryga in a mere 28 minutes to move into the singles pre-quarter finals at the Beijing University of Technology Gymnasium.         
	Saina, world No.15, will take on Chen Wang of Hong Kong, No.5 in the world, someone she had failed to beat in her last two attempts.         
	After her win over the Ukrainian, Saina said: I had not played her earlier, so I could not go all out right from the word go. She played a tactical game and played more of down shots, like smash and half-smash and I too made some mistakes. So I needed time to pick her.         
	Sridhar, too, breezed into the second round with a 21-16, 21-14 win over Marco Vasconcelos of Portugal. Sridhar set up a second round clash with world No.12 Shoji Sato of Japan.         
	Sridhar, who suffered an injury scare a few months ago, had said earlier that the incident was the turning point in his preparation. Ive come back stronger, fitter and more positive. I am quite an introspective person and while it wasnt fun being injured, it gave me some time to think about my game and where I wanted to take it.         
	Marco raced to a 6-3 lead before the Indian went on to win five points on the trot to snatch the lead and never lost the tempo as he wrapped up the game in 15 minutes.         
	In the second, Sridhar seized early initiative to go 6-1 up. He didnt allow the Portuguese to come back into the match and sealed it in style.         
	Sridhar told reporters that it was a conscious decision on his part not to play too many smashes. The court was slow and to hit a smash you have to be early in your position, else the opportunity may go waste. Also my ankle is still stiff and though it did not trouble me, I did not want to take chances, he said.         
	The shooters continued to perform dismally with trap shooters Manavjit Singh Sandhu and Mansher Singh failing to deliver.         
	Manavjit failed to produce the form that fetched him gold at the Zagreb World Championships two years back and could manage only 116 out of 125 to finish 12th at the end of the five-round qualifying sessions. Mansher was a shade better, tallying 117 to finish eighth. He fired a twin 24 but Saturdays 20 in the third round proved too costly.         
	Unlike in 2006 and 2007, I have not been in great form this year. I know people had expectations but form and fortune do fluctuate, Manavjit later said.         
	David Kostelecky of the Czech Republic won the trap gold, hitting all 25 targets in a rainy final round. Kostelecky finished with a final score of 146. Giovanni Pellielo of Italy won the silver and Alexey Alipov of Russia took the bronze.         
	Kostelecky and Alipov were tied for first place after qualifying, but the Czech shooter turned in the only perfect final round. Nobody else hit more than 23 targets in the final.         
	In swimming, 16-year-old Virdhawal Khades campaign in the 200m freestyle sank without a trace. Khade clocked 1:51.86 to finish seventh in the eight-man heat 4 and overall 48th on the chart. It was way below his personal best of 1: 50.35sec.         
	Indias rowing duo of Devender Kumar Khandwal and Manjeet Singh finished at the bottom in the lightweight mens double sculls heats. The Indians clocked 6:37.13, nearly 21 seconds behind the winners  Marcello Miani and Elia Luini of Italy.         
	Nachhatar Singh Johal was at the 23rd position in the overall standings of the Finn class at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Centre.

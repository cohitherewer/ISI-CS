The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ric set for a defined role
                                                     Ric set for a defined role
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ric Charlesworth                           
	New Delhi: After three days of hectic meetings and closed door conferences, nothing changed in Indian hockey.         
	In the end, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) and the ministry of sports came up with a formula that would keep both groups in the federation happy.         
	Under the new agreement, which is yet to be made official, Australian coach Ric Charlesworth will be the technical adviser and expert coach of the IHF for one year and Joaquim Carvalho will remain the chief coach for at least a couple of months more.         
	According to sports ministry sources, Charlesworth will be the technical advisor for senior and junior mens and womens teams, while Carvalho will carry on with his duty till the invitational tournament in Australia scheduled in April.         
	A change of guard can only take place after the tournament in Australia, or may be after the Azlan Shah, sources revealed. All parties, including Charlesworth, have agreed to it and a contract will be signed in this regard.         
	Carvalhos reappointment is being seen as a personal triumph for IHF president KPS Gill, who wanted to retain the Mumbai based former India player. In the meeting of the IHF office bearers that was held on Thursday, several members wanted to remove Carvalho but Gill remained unmoved.         
	Till date I have been accused of throwing out coaches in an arbitrary manner, Gill said. It shouldnt happen again.         
	Gill had a round of meeting with the ministry officials on Thursday morning. After Gill left, Charlesworth and IHF officials also met the ministry for a meeting that lasted till late in the evening.         
	While everyone in the IHF, including Charlesworth, remained tight-lipped, ministry sources said the Australian agreed to the new formula after he was assured that it was only a matter of time before he could be given the full charge of the senior team.         
	Charlesworth was made to understand it would only kick up more controversy if Carvalho is shown the door for a single defeat in the Olympic qualifier, sources said.         
	He was also told that the ministry, which will pay his salary, would like him to be involved in a wide range of assignments and not only the senior team.         
	The Aussie legend will be paid a salary of Rs 6 lakh per month which is Rs 2 lakh more than what foreign coaches normally get.         
	Charlesworth will be based in Chandigarh and his work will be monitored for the next six months by a committee comprising of former Olympians.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India thrash Nepal 4-0
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India thrash Nepal 4-0
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Bhaichung Bhutia		    
	New Delhi: India began their title defence in the SAFF Cup at Male with a thumping 4-0 win over Nepal on Tuesday but could hardly celebrate the victory as left back NS Manju suffered an injury 10 minutes before the final whistle.         
	According to information received here from the Maldives capital, the Indian team management is extremely worried about the fact that Manju, who was stretchered off after a hamstring injury, may not be in a position to take any further part in the tournament.         
	Nothing is certain till Manju is thoroughly examined by doctors, said manager Pradeep Chowdhury. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It would be a big blow for the team if Manju is ruled out.         
	To add to India s woes, stopper back Gourmangi Singh also suffered a thigh injury and could be out for the next match against Pakistan on Thursday. The situation is definitely worrying as the Indian squad dont have too many substitute defenders.         
	As a last resort, chief coach Bob Houghton is likely to push in Samir Naik to the left back position and offer Anwar the jersey for the first time in the starting eleven in the next encounter. With India expected to play five matches in 11 days in two countries, this is certainly going to be very taxing for the Indian defenders.         
	Back on the pitch, India were a dominant lot from the very beginning and opened the scoring in the 26th minute through midfielder NP Pradeeps glancing header off a free-kick by Steven Dias. Eight minutes later, India moved further ahead when skipper Bhaichung Bhutia scored a fine goal with a spectacular back volley.         
	India pressed more in the second session and Sunil Chetri made it 3-0 in the 67th minute. Houghton then pushed in all his substitutes with Anwar going in for Gourmangi, Sushil Singh for Bhutia and Mehrajuddin for Pradeep.         
	Manju suffered the injury 10 minutes before the end and India were then left with no other options but to carry on with 10 players for the rest of the period.

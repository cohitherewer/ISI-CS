The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are ready to take on India: Haddin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We are ready to take on India: Haddin

	Jaipur: Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin on Friday refused to bite the bait on the raging controversy on Rajasthan Cricket Academy obliging the visiting team more than required but said his side has got the confidence to take on the Indians after their stint at RCAs state-of-the-art facilities.         
	I dont know whether India has lost the home advantage or not. But for us it was great to have prepared for our tour at these outstanding facilities. The preparations here have been spot on. We are fully equipped and we are now confident to take on the Indians, he said after three-hour team practice session here.         
	Asked whether his team would get support from the home crowd after Indias controversy-ridden Test tour of Australia early this year, Haddin said his side would concentrate on playing good cricket and not interested on re-opening the old wounds.         
	What happened in the past is in the past. We are here to play good cricket and enjoy the game. Test cricket is very hard these days. Concentration to the game is important in India and we are not thinking of any other issue besides focusing on our cricket, said the 30-year-old glovesman, who filled into the shoes of Adam Gilchrist.         
	Haddin said he could not get hold of Gilchrist to take a few tips or two from the retired great but had spoken to another great Ian Healy on how to go about in India.         
	I had a chat with Healy but not with Gilly. Healy gave me valuable tips on how to prepare for an Indian tour. From the next 10 days onwards, I will be able to know how I do in India.         
	I think you have to adjust while keeping in slow and low pitches in India. You have to be a bit close to the wicket than in Australia. So I am getting into all these, he added.         
	Haddin does not have any particular aim for the Indian tour but said consistency is the key in keeping wickets and batting.         
	I dont have any particular aim in India. I have to be consistent in batting and keeping. It is the same against any opposition in world cricket, he said. Haddin, who did not sign up with any Indian Premier League (IPL) team this year, said he would love to see a Sachin Tendulkar or a MS Dhoni play a domestic Twenty20 game in Australia.         
	I would love to play alongside Tendulkar and Dhoni, he said tongue in cheek when asked whom he would want to play with from the Indian team.         
	Australia will begin playing competitive cricket with a two-day practice game against Rajasthan Cricket Associations Centre of Excellence team at Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Saturday. After four days of practice, Ricky Ponting and his boys will play against a team led by former India player Gagan Khoda.

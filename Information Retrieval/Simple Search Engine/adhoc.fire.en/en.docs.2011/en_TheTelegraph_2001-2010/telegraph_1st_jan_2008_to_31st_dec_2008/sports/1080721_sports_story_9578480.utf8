The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians lose thriller
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indians lose thriller
                      
	Melbourne: Suresh Raina (115) and captain S. Badrinath (95) waged a grim battle but still could not see the side through as India succumbed to a 19-run defeat against the Australian Institute Of Sports in a run-feast of a match in the Emerging Players tournament in Brisbane on Sunday.         
	Put into bat, the hosts piled up 371 for five in 50 overs with Theo Doropoulos (107) and captain Moises Henriques (124) scoring bulk of the runs.         
	In reply, Raina and Badrinath almost knocked down the target but their batting colleagues let them down and the side were bowled out for 352 in 46.2 overs at the Albury Oval.         
	Batting first, the Australians got a rollicking start with Doropoulos and David Warner (80) tearing apart the Indian attack, putting 133 runs for the first wicket before Abhishek Nayar removed Warner.         
	But with Henriques joining Doropoulos in the middle, there was no respite for the visitors. The second-wicket partnership yielded 156 runs before Doropoulos was castled by Amit Mishra.         
	Henriques, however, was hardly perturbed as he blasted his way to the century off just 76 balls.         
	Abhishek Nayar (5) and Manoj Tiwary (10) could not live upto the expectation and Indias hopes went up in smoke when Badrinath fell to Grant Sullivan.                 
	Brief scores         
	Australian Institute of Sports 371/5 in 50 overs (M. Henriques 124, T. Doropoulos 107, D. Warner 80) beat India Emerging Players 352 in 46.2 overs (S. Raina 115, S. Badrinath 95; G. Sullivan 3/62).

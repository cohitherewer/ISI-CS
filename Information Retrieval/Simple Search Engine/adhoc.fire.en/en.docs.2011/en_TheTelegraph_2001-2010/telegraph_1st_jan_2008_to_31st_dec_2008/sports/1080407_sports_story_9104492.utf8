The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury cloud over Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Injury cloud over Kumble
  - Munaf Patel replaces RP Singh in the only change for final Test       A STAFF REPORTER            Munaf Patel                                 
	Calcutta: There is once again an injury cloud over Anil Kumble and the India captain will have to undergo a fitness test along with Ishant Sharma on the eve of the third and final Test against South Africa. The Kanpur Test gets under way on Friday.         
	A batting disaster was responsible for Indias innings defeat in Ahmedabad inside three days, but the only head to have rolled at the selection committee meeting in Ahmedabad on Sunday was of pacer Rudra Pratap Singh. Munaf Patel comes in for him.         
	Off-spinner Ramesh Powar, who last represented the country in the two-Test series in Bangladesh in May, has earned a surprise recall  albeit as cover for Kumble.         
	If losing Sachin Tendulkar was not enough, Kumbles groin injury has come as a bigger worry for the Indians who must win in Kanpur to avoid a series defeat. There is a 50-50 chance of Kumble making himself available for the Test.         
	Kumble was off the field a little after lunch on the final day of the Chennai Test because of the groin injury. He played in Ahmedabad after passing a fitness test on the morning of the match.         
	The latest scare is a recurrence of the same injury.         
	Two selectors will be in Kanpur to watch the fitness test, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.                     
	The squad would be trimmed to 14 after assessing the fitness of the two players.         
	Kumbles four wickets in this series so far have come at an exorbitant average of 60.25, making it one of his worst home series so far. Harbhajan Singh has fared better, with 12 wickets at 33.33.         
	Powars inclusion is sure to raise a few eyebrows, especially after his disappointing domestic season. He ended with 25 wickets in 10 games and was left out of the West Zone side in the Duleep Trophy.         
	He was chosen ahead of Yousuf Pathan and Mohnish Parmar, two off-spinners who have fared better this season.         
	The team is keen to play three spinners and hence Powar has been added to the line-up, Shah told reporters.         
	Clearly, Murali Kartiks injury  he twisted his left ankle during a Deodhar match recently  couldnt have come at a worse time. For, if fit, he would have been in the 14 right from the first Test.         
	Indias biggest failure in Ahmedabad was the batting, which remains unchanged for Kanpur.         
	It is understood that this will be one final chance for Wasim Jaffer. What saved his place was the 73 he got in Chennai. The selectors have, of course, taken note of his technical problems.         
	Ishant missed the first two Tests due to an inflammation to his big toe and a finger injury, both sustained during Indias recent tour to Australia. If he passes the fitness test, his presence will significantly boost the pace attack that has been struggling.         
	In the two Tests, Sreesanth and RP have taken three wickets compared to 26 by their South African counterparts.         
	RP has been struggling since making a comeback after the injury that ruled him out of the tri-series in Australia. He failed to get a single wicket while conceding 235 runs in the first two Tests. His fitness remains a big concern.         
	Munaf, who has not played a Test since the second match against Pakistan at the Eden, has also been given a fresh lease of life.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Openers: Virender Sehwag, Wasim Jaffer         
	Middle-order batsmen: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh         
	Wicketkeeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	Spinners: Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Ramesh Powar, Piyush Chawla         
	Pacers: Irfan Pathan, Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Ishant Sharma

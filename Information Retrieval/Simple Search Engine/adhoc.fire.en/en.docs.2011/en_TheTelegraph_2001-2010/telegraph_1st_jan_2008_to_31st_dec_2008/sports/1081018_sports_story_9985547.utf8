The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United SC seek Mumbai double
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United SC seek Mumbai double
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Having tasted success on their previous visit to the business capital, United SC would be keen to repeat their giant-killing act when they take on Air India in a fourth round match of the I-League at the Cooperage on Saturday.         
	We want points, three at the best but at least one. But we dont want to lose any points, said United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee after the teams match-eve practice session.         
	League debutants United SC stunned Mahindra United in their second round encounter a fortnight ago. They also did well to hold the Odafa-led Churchill Brothers for a goalless draw last weekend.

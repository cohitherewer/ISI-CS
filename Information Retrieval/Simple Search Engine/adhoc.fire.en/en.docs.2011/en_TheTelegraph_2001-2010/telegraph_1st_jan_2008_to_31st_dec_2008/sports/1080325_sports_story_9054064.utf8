	Miami: Tiger Woodss winning streak was snapped on Monday when Australian Geoff Ogilvy kept his nerve to win the WGC-CA Championship.         
	Darkness forced an early end to the final round on Sunday after nearly three hours of play were lost due to dangerous weather. The final round had already started late because of the completion of the third round earlier in the day.         
	The remaining holes of the competition were finished on Monday.         
	Indias Jeev Milkha Singh, who was still negotiating his back nine when play was called off on Sunday, finished tied 26 after a final round 73. He finished at seven under 281 for the tournament.         
	Indian Masters champion S.S.P. Chowrasia was one-under with one more hole to go when play was stopped. He came back on Monday tied 47th overnight but parred the final hole to finish at tied 51 and one-under 287 for the tournament.         
	Ogilvy saved a round that seemed in peril with a chip-in for par at the 13th hole and went on to claim his second victory in a World Golf Championship event.         
	A final-round of one-under 71 was good enough for him to finish at 17 under, one shot better than Retief Goosen, Jim Furyk and Vijai Singh, all closing with 68s in the rain-delayed tournament. Woods was alone in fifth at 15 under.         
	With the win, Ogilvy joined select company  only Woods and Darren Clarke have more than one WGC title. But this week wont be remembered for that accomplishment: Itll be known as the week someone finally took down Tiger.         
	Woods had won his last seven tournaments world-wide. The 13-time major winners focus will now switch to next months US Masters.         
	The last time Woods was beaten was in September when he tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Massachusetts.         
	He had won nine of his last 10 competitions, including the unofficial Target World Challenge held in Thousand Oaks, California in December.           (AGENCIES)

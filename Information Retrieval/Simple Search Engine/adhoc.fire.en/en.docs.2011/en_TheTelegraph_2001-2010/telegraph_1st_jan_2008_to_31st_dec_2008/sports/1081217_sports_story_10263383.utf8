	Calcutta: Perseverance and hard work did it for Mohun Bagan as they fought to a 2-1 win over Air India in the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Tuesday. Down by a goal at one stage, the city giants were clearly not out.         
	For Mohun Bagan, on Tuesdays chilly evening at the Barasat Stadium, it was a repeat of their I-League story. The green and maroon brigade regrouped, changed strategy and romped home to a great win.         
	The must-needed result saw them through to the semi-finals ending Vascos dreams of a semi-final berth. Both teams finished equal on points (6), but Bagan advanced for having scored more goals (4 to Vascos 2).         
	Bagan now meet arch-rivals East Bengal in the semi-final on Thursday. In the other semi-final, Dempo will lock horns with Churchill Brothers.         
	A vibrant Air India went into the lead in the 26th minute when Soccor Velho slotted home a Surajit Roy cross from the right.         
	Down by one goal, Bagan restored parity in the 52nd minute when a 22-yard Lalkamal Bhowmick shot found the far corner.         
	Grabbing a loose ball outside the box, Bhowmick surged past two casual Air India defenders and sent in a low shot to score the equaliser.         
	Eight minutes later Marcos Pereiras brilliant free-kick, from just outside the right side of the top box, flew over the human-wall, foxed goalkeeper Arup Debnath and found the net.         
	Air India failed to convert from the spot in the 73rd minute, Sangram blocking a re-taken Ravinder Singh penalty that had gone in on the first occassion.         
	Earlier, the kick-off was delayed by 34 minutes as Air India were stuck in traffic on their way to the Barasat Stadium.         
	With Jose Ramirez Barreto back, the local giants started on a positive note with the Brazilian and Bhaichung Bhutia leading from the front.         
	However, it looked as if Air India had done their homework. They were equally aggressive, and with Samson Singh and Soccor Velho, matched their much-fancied opponents attack for attack.         
	Dominating things from then on, Air India, inspired by their lead launched back to back forays at the Bagan goal.         
	Four minutes after drawing first blood, they came close to scoring again when a Samson shot off a free-kick was parried by Sangram Mukherjee.         
	Not only did Air India keep Karim Bencharifas million dollar duo of Barreto and Bhutia under check but also at times unleashed challenging moves into the Bagan citadel.         
	But Bagan were a different side altogether and equalised seven minutes into the second half. Scoring two within a span of eight minutes, Bagan showed that experience counts.         
	Barreto surprisingly missed the easiest of chances at the fag end of the match when his header, after being palmed away by the goalkeeper, went on to hit the post before going out of play.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh after the loss said: It was a total conspiracy against us. The bus was late to take us         
	Then we were stuck for about three hours in the traffic That took the toll on the boys. But I am happy that they fought hard They fought till the last minute.         
	His counterpart, Bagans Moroccan coach was a happy man and called the win a team effort.         
	The boys were eager to win. Thats what they did I will say this is a team effort and they have done a great job I am happy but the bigger work is still left, Bencharifa said.

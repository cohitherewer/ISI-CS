                                                                                                                                                                                           Ruling group undecided
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ruling group in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) remained undecided on their candidates for the Board of Trustees on the eve of the last day for filing the nominations for the high-profile elections, scheduled for July 29.         
	The current office-bearers, however, blamed it on a problem of plenty.         
	Its not true that we dont have candidates for the posts. In fact, we have too many candidates for the five posts. We will meet on Monday morning and decide on the names, CAB joint secretary Samar Paul said on Sunday.         
	The candidate for the chairman of Board of Trustees was also left undecided after Chandi Ganguly turned down the proposal due to health concerns.         
	All pending nominations will be filed by the deadline on Monday. There is nothing to worry for us, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the 14-day physical conditioning-cum-mental toughness camp, under the supervision of South African trainer Adrian Le Roux, will be held from Tuesday.

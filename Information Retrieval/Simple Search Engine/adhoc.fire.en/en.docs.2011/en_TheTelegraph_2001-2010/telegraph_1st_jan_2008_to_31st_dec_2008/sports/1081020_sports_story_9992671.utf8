The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarkes wicket most satisfying: Mishra
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clarkes wicket most satisfying: Mishra
            OUR CORESPONDENT            Amit Mishra celebrates the fall of an Australian wicket on Day III of the second Test in Mohali on Sunday                           
	Mohali: Debutant Amit Mishra said at a press conference on Sunday that his only aim was to take wickets whenever he gets a chance and picked Michael Clarkes wicket as the most satisfying.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	His reaction after the five-wicket haul         
	I came with an aim that whenever I get a chance, I would bowl to take wickets. It was a happy moment when I could take five wickets on my debut innings in a Test.         
	His selection         
	It is not in my hands. Whenever I play I always try to take wickets and perform. This was a big match and I had one thing in mind to perform and take wickets.         
	Five years in the wilderness         
	I did feel bad sometimes but the five years in first class cricket has been a good experience. I could talk with people and could learn a few tricks and variations by playing in domestic cricket and for India A. It helped me to become a better and experienced bowler. The A matches were quite competitive ones. It benefited me as the selectors could watch me play.         
	Did he expect his call-up         
	I never had anything in my mind and I never expected to play against the Australians but I always thought in my mind that I would take wickets.         
	Most cherished wicket         
	I think the wicket of Michael Clarke was the best of the five. It was crucial wicket for our team and we got it at the right time. The ball fell on the right spot.         
	Kumbles advice         
	He told me just bowl as you bowl in Ranji matches. Focus on your line and length.         
	Were the tips useful         
	Of course some of the tips were useful and helped me in this match. Anilbhai always supported me and he was the first person to give me a call when I was selected in the Indian team. It is a great opportunity to play alongside and under him. His tips did help me a lot in this match.         
	His interaction with Hirwani         
	I used to interact with Hirwani in the past even before he became a selector. It was more of passing on tips from one leg-spinner to another leg-spinner.         
	On the pitch         
	The wicket is turning a bit, though its a slow turner. It will offer more turn in the next two days.         
	Kumble and Dhonis captaincy         
	Both are helpful, but today the way Dhoni encouraged me was very useful. He gave me the confidence and told me, bowl whatever you are comfortable with. Play your normal game. I thought it was a big thing.         
	Whom he wants to dedicate the five-wicket haul         
	I would dedicate the five-wicket haul to the Haryana Cricket Association and Ranbir Singh Mahendra (former BCCI president and Haryana strongman), and of course, my parents.         
	His idol         
	I like Anil Kumble a lot but Shane Warne is my idol. I could meet him for five minutes during the IPL tournament. He gave me a lot of positive thoughts and whenever I meet him I would try to talk and learn a few tricks from him.

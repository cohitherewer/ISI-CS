The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Superb 224 by Laxman
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Superb 224 by Laxman
                      
	Hyderabad: A superb 224 by VVS Laxman and an unbeaten 100 by Ahmed Quadri helped Hyderabad pile up a mammoth 553 for six declared on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Super League match against Rajasthan.         
	Laxmans knock came off 360 deliveries in 524 minutes and included 24 boundaries.         
	In Bhubaneswar, a fine unbeaten hundred by Prabhanjan Mullick and his 143-run stand with stumper Haladhar Das (80) powered hosts Orissa to a strong position against Punjab on the second day.         
	After dismissing the visitors for a paltry 60 in their first innings, Orissa established a huge 292-run lead before being bowled out for 352. At draw of stumps today, Punjab were 59 for one in their second innings.         
	Mullick, who had been recalled to the team after being dropped, frustrated Punjab as he and Das consolidated Orissas position.         
	In New Delhi, Sanjib Sanyals sedate 70 and Raja Alis gritty 39 saw Railways equal Andhras first innings total of 208 on the second day. Resuming on eight for one, Railways lost two quick wickets to find themselves reeling at 16 for three before Sanjib bailed out the side with a 148-ball 70 that included eight hits to the fence.         
	Railways survived another mini collapse when Yere Goud (13) and Sanjib perished in the same over. However, down the order, Raja Ali, chipped in with a gutsy cameo to keep Railways on course for a crucial first innings lead. At close, Murali Kartik was batting on 18 in the company of Kulamani Parida (4).         
	Rahul Dravid made 83 before Sunil Joshi and Tilak Naidu put on a 103-run stand for the sixth wicket to help Karnataka pile up 347 for seven against Baroda in Bangalore.         
	Dravid hit 11 boundaries and a six during his 177 minute stay at the crease, facing 117 balls. He was also involved in a 69-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Naidu.

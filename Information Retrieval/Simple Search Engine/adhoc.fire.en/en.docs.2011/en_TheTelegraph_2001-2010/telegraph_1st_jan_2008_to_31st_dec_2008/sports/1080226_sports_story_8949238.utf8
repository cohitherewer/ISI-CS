                                                     Aussies fined for slow over rate
            A STAFF REPORTER            Lasith Malinga during training in Hobart on Monday, the eve of their tri-series match against India. (AP)                           
	Calcutta: Australia have been fined for maintaining a slow over rate during their 18-run victory over India in Sydney on Sunday.         
	According to an ICC press release, Match Referee Jeff Crowe imposed the fine after Ricky Pontings men were ruled to be two overs short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing over rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.         
	Ponting was fined 20 per cent of his match fee with his players penalised 10 per cent each.         
	Prior to the match in Melbourne, I had a chat with the Australian team management in which I had reminded them of their responsibilities regarding over rates, said Crowe.         
	I understand and accept that it was a close and high-scoring match.         
	Under such circumstances, getting through their overs in the early stages would assist them to have enough time available to work with the bowlers and set fielding placing when the match enters the last 10 overs or crucial stages.         
	The offence is contrary to Section J of the Code of Conduct which relates to slow over rates. For such offences, the decision of the Match Referee is final and binding.

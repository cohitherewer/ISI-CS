            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Mohun Bagan and East Bengal players involved in one of the brawls on Friday. A Telegraph picture		    
	Calcutta: As East Bengal coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee was walking towards the media briefing room, two supporters drenched in sweat and weeping piteously ran up to him and in voices hoarse with panic, complained that the Mohun Bagan supporters were attacking them. An already troubled Bhattacharjee, rumours are he stands losing his job after Fridays draw, turned to them, and in his usual impassive way said: This is the first time Ive heard of East Bengal supporters getting beaten up.         
	Whether that implied shock or underscored the innocence of the EB fans is hard to say, but what can be said for a fact, is that the East Bengal partisans along with those belonging to rivals Mohun Bagan participated with alacrity in the hustle, bustle and bloodshed that accompanied the final derby of the CFL Premier Division.         
	The flashpoint came with East Bengals equaliser in the 83rd minute. The VIP box erupted in a clamour of war cries. This was accompanied by a pitched battle which saw pet bottles being used as missiles; also an uprooted chair. Throughout the match the kops greeted every unwelcome decision with a rain of bottles onto the pitch.         
	Some came close to hitting the players. Club authorities and supporters from both sides were up in arms over charges of bad refereeing and alleged high-handedness of the police. However, the situation never really spun out of control.

	Beijing: A billion dreams came true as marksman Abhinav Bindra captured Indias first-ever individual Olympic gold medal in mens 10m air rifle on Monday.         
	Little did one know that history would be created at the Beijing Shooting Range Hall when the 25-year-old lay fourth after qualifying. After the second shot of 10.3 in the final, Bindra had moved to second position. He moved into the lead with a 10.6 in the seventh (a difference margin of 0.2). After the ninth shot, he was tied for the top slot with Henri Hakkinen of Finland with scores of 689.7 each.         
	Then came the tenth, the moment of truth, where Hakkinen collapsed with a poor 9.7. Bindra scored an almost perfect 10.8, his best shot and the sure sign of a champion who can keep his nerves under pressure.         
	That poor last shot shoved Hakkinen into the third spot, allowing pre-tournament favourite Qinan Zhu of China to move ahead and claim the silver. In the final, Bindra never scored below 10 as he totalled 700.5, adding 104.5 to his qualifying round score of 596.         
	Earlier, in the qualification, Zhu had to rush his final shots to make the time limit, dropping to second behind Hakkinen ahead of the final.         
	While Bindra, a 2001 Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awardee, remained cool as a cucumber all through the proceedings and beyond, defending champion Zhu sobbed uncontrollably, on the podium and then again at the news conference.         
	I had trained for this day rigorously over the past four years, he said, but I have failed my countrymen today. I failed to clinch the gold in my homeland, said the Chinese.         
	He added: In the last two rounds I made several mistakes because I had used up all my physical and mental energy. By this victory, Bindra showed to the world that he has what it takes to bounce back from reverses.         
	In Sydney 2000, a young Bindra was not considered a medal prospect. He had surprised everyone by reaching the final and then worked hard the next four years. On way to Athens he won 12 back-to-back European medals.         
	Unfortunately in Athens he finished seventh even while creating an Olympic record at qualifying. It was difficult, that return from the abyss. But on Monday, Bindra, now an Olympic champion beside being a world champion, proved that we Indians have what it takes to be a winner at the world stage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liverpool bank on Torres return

	London: Arsenal and Liverpool return to Champions League action this week seeking to recover from what could be crushing Premier League losses.         
	Arsenal are desperate for a morale-boosting victory over visiting Fenerbahce after a defeat at lowly Stoke left the Gunners six points off the top of the Premier League and fading from title contention.         
	Liverpool will be especially keen to beat Atletico Madrid after their first loss of the season at Tottenham cost them first place.         
	Both English teams look well placed to rebound, with Arsenal having won 5-2 at Fenerbahce two weeks ago and the Liverpool team that drew 1-1 in Madrid likely to be strengthened by the return from injury of star striker Fernando Torres.         
	Hopefully he will be ready, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said. If he cannot start the game then he will be on the bench if everything is OK. Its good we have another important game on Tuesday and the reaction of the players has to be to play well and win the game.         
	We just have to keep going and keep playing the same way.         
	Torres has not played for almost a month because of a hamstring problem, but Benitez left him out of Saturdays 1-2 loss at Tottenham to make sure he is fit to face his former club.         
	Liverpool and Atletico share the lead of Group D and both look likely to advance to the next round irrespective of the result, although the loser at Anfield on Tuesday could still be caught by PSV Eindhoven or Marseille  who meet in the groups other match.         
	PSV are expected to have a full strength side at Marseille, with defenders Mike Zonneveld and Jan Kromkamp set to return from injury and winger Nordin Amrabat hoping to pass a late test on a groin problem.         
	In general, Marseille have a lot of quality but if we are well-organised, we stand a chance to beat them, PSV coach Huub Stevens said.         
	Chelsea, Englands Premier League leader, are at AS Roma in another of Tuesdays eight matches. The Blues lead Group A by three points from unheralded Romanian side CFR Cluj, who host Bordeaux.         
	Roma are in the midst of their worst start to a Serie A season for 35 years after losing four straight games, and could be without captain Francesco Totti because of a sore knee.         
	Also Tuesday, Group B leaders Inter Milan are at Anorthosis Famagusta while Panathinaikos travel to Werder Bremen with their morale lifted by a 2-1 win at Panionios on Saturday. Coach Henk Ten Cate has all his players at his disposal except for midfielder Andreas Ivanschitz, who is doubtful because of a leg injury.         
	Panathinaikos have one point from three games and Tuesdays match is vital if they want to remain in the race.         
	Barcelona, the only one of the 32 teams with a perfect record after three matches, host FC Basel in Group C, which also features Shakhtar Donetsks trip to Sporting Lisbon.         
	Arsenals task against Fenerbahce on Wednesday was probably made tougher by the injuries they sustained Saturday rather than the disappointing result. Striker Emmanuel Adebayor and defender Bacary Sagna limped off the field and winger Theo Walcott was carried off with a shoulder injury.         
	We have very bad injuries to Adebayor and Walcott, and there is Sagna, Wenger said. One or two have knocks as well.         
	Dynamo Kiev host 2004 champions FC Porto in the other Group G match. Defending champions Manchester United will expect to maintain their recent good form when they visit Celtic  with a draw possibly enough to send the Red Devils through from Group E to the next round  and Aalborg host Villarreal.         
	Record nine-time European champions Real Madrid have the chance to avenge a 1-2 loss at Juventus when they host the Italian team on Wednesday, when BATE Borisov host Zenit St Petersburg in the other Group H match.         
	In Group F, Fiorentina host Bayern Munich, and Lyon host Steaua Bucharest.

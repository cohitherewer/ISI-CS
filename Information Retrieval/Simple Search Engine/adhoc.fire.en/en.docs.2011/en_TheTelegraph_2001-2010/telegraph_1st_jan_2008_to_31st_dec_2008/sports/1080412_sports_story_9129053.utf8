The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bopanna, Amritraj clinch thrillers
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bopanna, Amritraj clinch thrillers
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj displayed remarkable grit and discipline to put India 2-0 up against Japan in the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone second round tie here on Friday.         
	Off court, it was yet another day of chaos in Indian tennis as fans and officials were stunned by the uncharitable remarks of captain Leander Paes in an interview against doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi.         
	On the court, however, it was an immensely satisfying day as Bopanna and Amritraj clinched marathon five-setters to take India to the brink of qualification for the World Group play-off.         
	On an extremely hot and humid day, Indias victory march was started by Bopanna who defeated world No. 120 Kei Nishikori 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 in a contest that lasted close to three hours at the R.K. Khanna Stadium here.         
	In the afternoon, Amritraj scored a 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 8-6 win over Go Soeda. Amritraj, who lost the first two sets and was down a break in the third, scripted a fascinating comeback.         
	Bopanna, it seems, has finally come of age. Accused of being a choker in crucial matches, the Bangalore based player kept his cool throughout, to tame his fancied Japanese rival.         
	While Nishikori struggled to cope in the stifling heat, Bopanna played some fine volleys and showed good net approach to blow away the Japanese in the first set tie-breaker, winning 7-2.         
	Nishikori came back with a vengeance and hit some fabulous backhand shots to clinch the second set in just 22 minutes.         
	Bopannas best, however, came in the fifth set. He not only served big but also played some deadly passing shots that had the Japanese rooted to the ground.         
	Nishikoris discomfort with the heat was clearly apparent in his game and he missed some easy winners to go a serve down in the eighth game. Bopanna pounced on the opening and sealed off the issue with a booming service winner.         
	Amritraj initially looked rusty and tamely lost the first two sets to Soeda before coming back.         
	At the end of the second set, Amritraj was so frustrated with his own game that he flung his racket across the court and stormed out for the break. Paes picked up the racket and followed him into the dressing room.         
	Amritraj emerged from the dressing room a completely changed player. He not only served well and won crucial points but also rushed to the net to attack his opponent. His change in attitude and style had the Japanese on the backfoot. In the fifth and final set, Soeda tried to make a last ditch effort, but by then it was too late.         
	The last point went to deuce four times but the Indian had the last laugh when Soeda hit the ball wide off the court.

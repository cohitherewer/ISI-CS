	London: David Beckham took some time out from training to meet a high-profile fan mdash; British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The LA Galaxy star went to 10 Downing Street on Tuesday night for a one-hour private meeting with Brown to discuss Beckham rsquo;s soccer academy and England rsquo;s bid for the 2018 World Cup.
 
	The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder also met Brown rsquo;s wife, Sarah, and the couple rsquo;s two sons, John and Fraser. ldquo;He rsquo;s interested in sports and his football, rdquo; Beckham told the BBC. ldquo;He is very interested in doing a lot for my academy and also getting involved in schools around the country as well. He rsquo;s a very good man. ... I rsquo;m very proud to be here. rdquo;
  
	Milan: Filippo Inzaghi loves the spotlight and the Olympics could be his next big event. The AC Milan striker wants to be part of Italy rsquo;s team for the Beijing Games later this year. ldquo;I would gladly go to China. The Olympics have always fascinated me and to play in one would be an honour, rdquo; Inzaghi was quoted as saying in an Italian sports daily on Wednesday.
 
	Countries sending soccer teams to the Olympics can use professional players, but only three can be 23 or older. Pierluigi Casiraghi, coach of the Olympic team and Italy rsquo;s under-21 team that will form the basis of the squad that goes to China, could also pick Juventus captain Alessandro del Piero if he doesn rsquo;t make the Euro 2008 squad.
  
	Liverpool: Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has denied reports that he may leave the club because of disagreements with its American owners. British papers have reported that the Spanish coach rsquo;s position is in doubt after a disappointing start to the Premier League season.
 
	Benitez has said he was angry that a group of journalists chose to report details of a private conversation he had with them at the club rsquo;s Melwood training ground. ldquo;I was asked several questions about my future, rdquo; Benitez told the Liverpool Echo. ldquo;I answered honestly, saying that there had been misunderstandings in the past but they are now in the past and that I am now working very well with the club rsquo;s owners. I can only assume that the conversation I had with the journalists from the Sunday newspapers meant something different to them than it did to me. rdquo;
  
	Newcastle: Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce left the club ldquo;by mutual agreement rdquo; on Wednesday after just eight months in charge. Allardyce had been jeered by fans this season after failing to impress with his favoured style of play, a direct, combative approach that brought him relative success at Bolton. He won just eight of his 24 matches at Newcastle. ldquo;A new manager has not yet been appointed at Newcastle United, rdquo; Newcastle said in a statement on their web site. 
 
	First team coach Nigel Pearson will lead the team for Saturday rsquo;s Premier League game at Manchester United.
  
	Chandigarh: A resurgent Bangalore Hi-Fliers rallied to a 4-2 victory over Chandigarh Dynamos to stay alive in the best of three-finals of the PHL on Wednesday. After a lacklustre performance in the first final, Bangalore staged a comeback in the second to drag the contest to Friday rsquo;s decider.
 
	Chandigarh took a 2-0 lead through Deepak Thakur (10th) and Rajpal Singh (22nd), but Sandeep Michael (23), You Hyo Sik (32nd, 42nd) and Sunil (61st) frustrated the Dynamos with their strikes.
  
	New Delhi: A ldquo;settled rdquo; Jeev Milkha Singh hopes to return to action with renewed vigour and eyeing glory at the Dubai Desert Classic and the Indian Masters. Jeev married childhood sweetheart Kudrat Brar in Chandigarh recently and said he was over the moon. ldquo;Everything rsquo;s been good. I feel settled in life now. Any sportsman will tell you it rsquo;s very important to find a partner who can console him and someone he can talk to after a day rsquo;s work, rdquo; he said.

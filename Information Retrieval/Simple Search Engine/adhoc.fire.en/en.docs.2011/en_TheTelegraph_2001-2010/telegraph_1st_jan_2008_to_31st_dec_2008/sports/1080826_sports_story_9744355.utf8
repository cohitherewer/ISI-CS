The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | China looks   at life beyond Games

	Beijing: The elaborate closing ceremony that ended the Olympic Games on Sunday also ended nearly a decade in which the ruling Communist Party had made the Games an organising principle in national life. Almost nothing has superseded the Olympics as a political priority in China.         
	For Chinese leaders, all that effort paid off. The Games were seen as an unparalleled success by most Chinese  a record medal count inspired nationwide excitement, and Beijing impressed foreign visitors with its hospitality and efficiency.         
	But a new, post-Olympic era has begun. The question now is whether a deepening self-confidence arising from the Olympic experience will lead China to further its engagement with the world and pursue deeper political reform, or whether the success of the Games and the muted Western response to repression will convince leaders that their current model is working.         
	Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, declared Sunday afternoon that selecting Beijing as a host had been the right choice and that the event had been a bridge between China and the rest of the world. The world has learned about China, and China has learned about the world, Mr. Rogge said.         
	Beneath the sphere of geopolitics, many analysts were impressed with ordinary citizens in Beijing during the Games. The authorities had worried that the angry strain of nationalism that erupted during the Tibet crisis might mar the Games with local crowds jeering other teams. But little of that came to pass.         
	Any Olympic host city experiences a blend of letdown and relief once the torch is extinguished, and Beijing is likely to be no different. The relatively blue skies during the Games were achieved only by restrictions that removed two million vehicles from the streets of Beijing and forced the temporary shutdown of many factories around the region. The citys air pollution, which ranks among the worst in the world, will return when the restrictions are lifted after the conclusion of the Paralympics in late September.

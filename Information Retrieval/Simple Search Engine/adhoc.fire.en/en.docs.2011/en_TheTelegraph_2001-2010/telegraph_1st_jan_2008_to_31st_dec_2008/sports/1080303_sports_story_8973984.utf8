The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir: Never before have I felt as secure 
                                                   Gambhir: Never before have I felt as secure 
  - Success in Twenty20 World Cup convinced me that I really belonged to the international level, says Indian batsman       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Sydney: Gautam Gambhir got run out for just 3 in the first tri-series final, at the SCG on Sunday, but he remains the tournaments leading run-scorer (425 at a handsome average of 60-plus).         
	An introvert, at least for the public, Gambhir spoke to The Telegraph at the Radisson Plaza on Saturday evening. During the course of that one-on-one, the 26-year-old said he was grateful to the ODI and Twenty20 captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for making him feel secure.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q. A year ago, youd been despondent after being overlooked for the World Cup. Today, its all quite different...         
	A. That period was probably the most depressing of my life... But I had to keep motivating myself... Having always wanted to play cricket, I couldnt suddenly go elsewhere... I didnt look at options and decided that Id fight my way back.         
	You made a comeback last summer, but what has made you the player youve become in recent months?         
	I should be thanking the captain, MS, for the kind of faith hes had in me and the kind of support given... Never before have I felt as secure and Im grateful to MS... Hes made me a more confident player and Ive been trying to live up to his expectations.         
	The sense of security, then, has made it easier on the mind?         
	Absolutely... Once youre secure, you start to think on lines other than trying to keep your place in the XI... That urge to contribute and help the team win gets stronger...         
	What did you tell yourself during the time you didnt feel secure?         
	That I should keep trying to be the best I could... That getting picked or dropped wasnt in my hands.         
	Youve been around for almost five years... Has there been a defining moment in your international career?         
	(Grins) There have been a few turning points, but the No.1 would be last Septembers Twenty20 World Cup... I was consistent throughout (227 runs, second highest in the tournament) and being successful in South Africa enhanced my self-belief... Convinced me that I really belonged to the international level... MS, as you know, was the captain.         
	But it was a Twenty20 tournament...         
	Fair enough, but it was international cricket all the same... It was a big event with plenty of pressure... By getting runs I showed I could handle pressure... The tournament, indeed, gave me the confidence to do well in all forms of the game.         
	What were your thoughts when you landed in Australia for the one-off Twenty20 International and the tri-series?         
	Despite coming with the confidence of four hundreds in domestic cricket, I still had doubts whether Id be able to continue with that form...         
	Why the doubts?         
	Id played here in the 2006 Top End Series, but the conditions are quite different from home... Then, everybody would talk of Australias pace battery... Everyone had said performing in Australia wouldnt be easy... I knew I first had to be very tough in the mind.         
	Did you talk to anybody to help overcome those doubts?         
	Actually, (fielding coach) Robin Singh, whod been the India A coach when I was in the A team, gave tips... Hed played in the 1999-2000 tri-series here and had also been the coach during the Top End Series... He spoke from experience.         
	Which innings gave you the confidence?         
	The unbeaten 102 against Sri Lanka, in Brisbane, where wed lost four wickets very quickly and MS and I had a big (184 runs) partnership. That was our second match in the tri-series and it was important to get a big score early on... Rain forced abandonment, but thats another matter.         
	Dont you think you should be considered as a regular opener in Tests?         
	Thats not in my hands... Also, while its nice to get runs, the runs count only if theyve helped the team to win.         
	Are you weighed down by expectations?         
	I look at the expectations positively... That my job becomes easier because the good wishes of millions are behind me.         
	What have you learnt most in almost five years of international cricket?         
	To control the things I can control... Not worry about being picked or not being picked. Also, that eventually, its the runs that talk.         
	Youre essentially an opener. Are you, then, comfortable at No.3 in ODIs?         
	Its not for me to choose... Ive got to do what the team wants... My mental make-up is such that Im comfortable wherever the team wants me to bat.         
	Are you particular about something in your preparations?         
	Not really, I do the basic things... If Im batting at No.3, then I know what my role is if we have a good start and what my role will be if one of the openers gets out early... More than any weakness I try and focus on my strengths... Work out the areas Im most likely to get the maximum runs in.         
	You handled Muttiah Muralidharan particularly well in the tri-series...         
	Id pick him early, thats it. In any case, we Indian batsmen are recognised as being the finest against spin... But Muralis a great bowler and the challenge for batsmen is to do well against the top bowlers.         
	How do you unwind, particularly on a long tour overseas?         
	Go out for lunch or dinner with (Virender) Sehwag and Munaf (Patel)... Im a Manchester United fan and, so, could watch their matches... I like playing badminton, but dont get the chance on tours.         
	A good number of youngsters, especially in Delhi, now see you as a role model. Did you have one?         
	Sourav Ganguly... Hes been a great player... In more recent years, Ive been an admirer of Sehwag... Its a pleasure batting at the other end when hes striking the ball as only he can. Id probably give anything to watch him in action.         
	The last one: Why is it that you hardly show any emotion?         
	(Laughs) Thats the way I am... I cant change my nature, but let me tell you Im neither shy nor quiet when Im with friends... You could check this out with Sehwag and Munaf... (After a pause) I dont think I need to change because people see me in a particular way. For them, Id rather let my bat do the talking.

    - Not everyone can be among runs in every game                           
	Hyderabad: Australia seem to be a little weak against spin bowling but captain Ricky Ponting refuses to panic, asserting his team is up to the challenge of facing Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh in the upcoming Test series.         
	Nine Australian batsmen surrendered to Piyush Chawla, Pragyan Ojha or Yuvraj Singh in the first innings of the warm-up match here. In the second, only two wickets fell and that included Matthew Hayden  perceived as one of the better players against spin bowling  who was trapped by Chawla.         
	Ponting said it was not a case of surrendering before the opponents spin might.         
	When spinners bowl 75 per cent of the total overs, chances are more that you would lose wickets to them, he said, as a matter of fact.         
	No doubt they (Chawla and Ojha) bowled well and we disappointed in the first innings. But I think it was a good opportunity for all players to get some good practice (against spin bowling) before we reach Bangalore , Ponting explained. Not everyone can be among runs in every game, he added.         
	Ponting, however, admitted that facing Kumble and Harbhajan would be the real challenge for the batsmen.         
	Look both Kumble and Harbhajan are world class spinners, especially Kumble. He has been around for quite a long time. We have to play well against these guys.         
	Australias thin spin resource was also exposed in the warm-up match with lone specialist spinner Jason Krejza taking quite a battering, especially from Yuvraj.         
	Ponting sees it as the learning curve for the rookie offie. I think he started well, used angles and tried things. But Yuvraj was very aggressive this morning and in a hurry to pile up before declaring. Anyway, its all part of learning. Ponting said.

                            ECB scraps Zimbabwe tour  London: The England and Wales Cricket Board on Wednesday cancelled Zimbabwe rsquo;s tour of England next year.  In a statement, the ECB said the British government had given it ldquo;a clear instruction that Zimbabwe rsquo;s bilateral tour scheduled under the ICC Future Tours Programme for 2009 should be cancelled rdquo;. The ECB said it had consequently suspended all bilateral arrangements with Zimbabwe Cricket. Cricket South Africa has already suspended all bilateral programmes with its southern African neighbour and the International Cricket Council will discuss suspending Zimbabwe from international cricket at an executive meeting in Dubai next Wednesday.  Paul rsquo;s view  London: England rsquo;s one-day captain Paul Collingwood believes winning the Twenty20 World Cup could be the prime ambition for cricketers who have grown up with the youngest form of the game. For most players of Collingwood rsquo;s generation. Test cricket remains at the summit of the sport. For the majority of Anglo-Australian cricketers that means the Ashes, cricket rsquo;s oldest international contest, is the series they want to win above all others. But Collingwood thinks attitudes could be changing. Speaking at the launch of the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup in England at the Oval here on Tuesday, he said: ldquo;The Twenty20 World Cup hasn rsquo;t got any tradition at the moment, has it? It is very new. When I was growing up, you always had the Ashes. For the next generation, they will may be see that as the No. 1 competition to win. rdquo;  Appointments  Calcutta: In another move that will increase the level of support to the world rsquo;s top match officials, the International Cricket Council has appointed five regional umpires rsquo; performance managers (RUPMs) to coach, mentor and assist the umpires as they strive for on-field excellence. The five RUPMs are: John Holder (Americas and Europe), Arani Jayaprakash (Asia, including Bangladesh and India), Peter Manuel (Asia, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka), Ian Robinson (Africa) and Bob Stratford (Pacific).

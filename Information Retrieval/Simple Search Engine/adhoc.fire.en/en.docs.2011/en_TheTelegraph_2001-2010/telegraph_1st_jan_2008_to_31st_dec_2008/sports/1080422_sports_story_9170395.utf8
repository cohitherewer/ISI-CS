	Estoril (Portugal): Roger Federers claycourt intelligence-gathering exercise, which resulted in Estoril Open title, has also given the Swiss a timely French Open boost.         
	The world No. 1 broke his 2008 title drought and earned a significant claycourt advantage over triple Roland Garros winner Rafael Nadal, the world No. 2, and Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, the world No. 3.         
	Now Federer, and interim coach Jose Higueras, head for the Monte Carlo Masters with a major psychological edge after the win here over Nikolay Davydenko.         
	The Russian world No. 4 quit with a leg injury while trailing in the final 7-6 (7/5), 1-2.         
	I got a lot of information about my game this week, it feels great to win the title. I have a tournament victory and guys like Nadal and Djokovic havent yet played on clay, said Federer who earned his seventh title on the surface and 54th overall.         
	I already have five matches on the surface  this a good start for me.         
	Twelve-time Grand Slam title winner Federer, who suffered with glandular fever before Januarys Australian Open where Djokovic relieved him of his title, broke his duck as he notched a 12th win against no defeats in his career the series with Davydenko.         
	Federer had won the last of his titles in November at the Masters Cup in Shanghai.         
	Its great to win a title, fantastic, said Federer. This will give me great confidence for the rest of the season.         
	Federer said that starting with an extra claycourt event in 2008 was the right move and gives him confidence looking forward to Paris, where he has come up short to Nadal in the last two finals.         
	I have time ahead of the French Open. Im happy things have paid off already, he said.         
	I dont need to be running after matches like two months ago when I didnt have enough of them. I have bounced back and Im playing well again considering my tough start to the season.         
	Davydenko, who took the Masters title in Miami last month, says trainers believe he can be fit for a Wednesday start in the second round at Monte Carlo after a bye.         
	When I ran to the left, I felt pain, said the Russian. I tried to fight but I knew there was not much that I could do.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sutil hopes to get a point
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sutil hopes to get a point
                  Adrian Sutil                     
	Fuji: Adrian Sutil, then with Spyker, survived numerous intrigues and inclement weather to score his maiden Formula One point at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and the German youngster, now behind the wheel of Force Indias VJM01, hopes for an encore when he hits the Fuji Speedway on Sunday.         
	Rain lashed the Fuji Speedway last year and Sutil brought home his car at ninth place, pipped by Toro Rosso driver Vitantonio Liuzzi, who is incidentally Force Indias current test driver.         
	Liuzzi was subsequently handed a 25 second penalty after it emerged that the Italian had overtaken under the yellow flag and it was enough for Sutil to win his first F1 point.         
	Cherishing great memories of the track, Sutil said he was looking for a repeat show even though it would not be easy.         
	For sure this is what you have to hope for, but its more difficult than ever this year, Sutil said.         
	We had a tough event in Singapore, but we are so close to the pace that it only takes for one team to have a difficult time and we could be up there. Of course you cant rely on other teams, you have to make sure you are on top form yourself, so lets see, said the German.         
	Recalling last years race, Sutil said, The race itself was very difficult. The conditions were tough as visibility was so bad but in very difficult circumstances I think we made some good decisions.         
	When I crossed the line I thought I was actually ninth, which was slightly disappointing as we were so close to getting that point.         
	Then the team told me that I should have been eighth as Tonio, who was then racing for Toro Rosso, had passed under yellow and should have been given a penalty, he said.

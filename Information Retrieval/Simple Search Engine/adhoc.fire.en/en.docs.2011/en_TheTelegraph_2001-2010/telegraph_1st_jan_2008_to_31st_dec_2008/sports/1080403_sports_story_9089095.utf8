                                                   Spurs too expensive, feel EB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Uncertainty looms large over the East Bengal-Tottenham Hotspur exhibition match since the city club officials are finding the match fee astronomical.         
	According to a top East Bengal official, the fee which the English Premier League side has asked for is much more than the clubs annual budget.         
	They are asking for an astronomical match fee that is much more than our annual budget, the official said on Wednesday. We are keen on hosting the match but for the fee... The offer to host the match came up very late and it would be impossible for us to provide such a huge sum. We have written the club, he added.         
	The club is thinking of allowing the Tottenham Hotspur authorities to bring in some of their sponsors for the proposed exhibition match. They have lots of sponsors. We have suggested that if some of their sponsors can come to India during the match our problem may be solved. Were expecting a reply by Saturday, the official said.

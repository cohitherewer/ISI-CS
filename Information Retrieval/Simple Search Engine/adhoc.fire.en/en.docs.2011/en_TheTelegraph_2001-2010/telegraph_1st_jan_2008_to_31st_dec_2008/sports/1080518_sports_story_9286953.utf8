                                                                                                                                                                                           FRIDAY TO FRIDAY 
  -   REVIEW OF IPLS WEEK NO. 4
                            
	 The two hattricks (Lakshmipathy Balaji for Chennai Super Kings vs Kings XI Punjab at Chepauk and Amit Mishra for Delhi DareDevils vs Hyderabad Deccan Chargers at the Kotla) within a span of five days was the highlight of the week. It was the 14th and 15th hattricks in Twenty20 cricket since the first by Dimitri Mascarenhas for Hampshire against Sussex at Hove in 2004. Incidentally, Balajis hattrick was the first on Indian soil and the fourth in the sub-continent.                   
	Kolkata Knight Riders David Hussey has become the most capped player in the history of Twenty20 cricket. During the match against Deccan Chargers, Hussey went past the tally of 52 matches held by South African Martin van Jaarsveld. Hussey now has appeared in 55 matches.         
	Mumbai Indians Sachin Tendulkars four catches against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede equals the record for the most catches by a fielder in a Twenty20 match. This record is shared by eight other players. The other Indians who have achieved this feat are Jaydev Shah (Saurashtra) and Manoj Tiwary (Bengal) both in April 2007 during the Indian national domestic Twenty20 competition.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders total of 67 at the Wankhede Stadium was the fifth lowest (shared by four other teams) in Twenty20 cricket and also the lowest ever on Indian soil. Incidentally, it is the second lowest score made by any team in the sub-continent. The Sri Lankan Army Club XI was dismissed for 59 by the Sinhalese Sports Club in March 2007.         
	Mumbai Indians win over the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede with 87 balls to spare was the biggest margin of victory in Twenty20 history. The Mumbai team reached their target in just 5.3 overs. The previous record was held by Jamaica when they beat Bermuda in July 2006 with 85 balls to spare.         
	 Delhi DareDevils Gautam Gambhir with 425 runs in this tournament has become the only fifth batsman in Twenty20 history to aggregate 400-plus in any tournament/series. Australian Justin Langer with 464 runs has the most runs while playing for Somerset in the English Twenty20 Cup in 2006.

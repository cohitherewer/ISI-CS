                                                   Stormy meeting on cards 

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: East Bengals executive committee meeting at the club tent on Wednesday evening is billed to be a stormy affair with growing pressure for coach Subrata Bhattacharyas removal following the teams disastrous performance in the ongoing I-League. The club is struggling to avoid relegation in the league with eight points from 11 outings. 
    
	The names of Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, Aloke Mukherjee, Biswajit Bhattacharjee and veteran Amal Datta have been doing the rounds as replacement for Subrata, but officials are debating on whether it would be prudent to ring in a change only four days before the second-phase Derby clash against Mohun Bagan. 
    
	The buzz is that Subrata has put in his papers after returning to the city on Tuesday, but club officials declined to comment. 
    
	On Monday, Subrata had offered to resign after crashing to a 0-3 defeat to JCT in Ludhiana, but the players urged him to stay on. There is a school of thought that a section of footballers have not been co-operating with the coach and that has been the main reason behind the debacle. 
    
	The coach says that a turnaround is on the cards after every defeat but he hasnt been able to arrest the slide. . A decision has to be taken at the earliest and there will be no place for emotions, said an influential executive committee member. 
    
	If the club officials fail to find a suitable replacement in such a short time, assistant coach Bikash Panji could be asked to take charge along with Tushar Rakshit.

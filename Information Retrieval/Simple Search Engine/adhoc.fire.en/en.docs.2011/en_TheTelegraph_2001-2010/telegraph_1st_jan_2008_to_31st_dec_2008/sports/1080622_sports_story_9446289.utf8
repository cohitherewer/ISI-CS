	Bangalore: Babu Rao-trained Fleeting Arrow (Burden Of Proof-Sabre Dance), to be ridden by K. P. Appu, looks good to win the 1.600m Colts Trial Stakes, the second Classic of the season to be run here on Sunday.           
	Fleeting Arrow, who had beaten Western Command in his last outing, may find a serious challenger in Mark Of Gibraltar and Star Of Washington. The former was second to the Fillies Trial winner Set Alight in his last outing.

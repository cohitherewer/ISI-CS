                                                   Kirsten helps Sehwag find touch again

           
	Adelaide: Virender Sehwag is back to where he belongs and he can thank new coach Gary Kirsten for mapping his route of return. 
    
	Sehwag helped India save the fourth and final Test with a remarkable 151 in Adelaide and is now one of the key players Team India would bank on for the Twenty20 match and one-day tri-series in Australia. 
    
	Sehwag came to Australia on reputation rather than on form and it was not until his century against ACT XI in Canberra, between the second and third Tests, that he was offered a lifeline to resurrect his Test career in Perth. 
    
	Kirsten, due to take over as coach of the team in March, arrived as a consultant in Perth and being an opener himself, set about reigniting the Sehwags career. 
    
	Sehwag offered India a positive start in both the innings in Perth but his scores of 29 and 43 did not make for a thumping return. His first innings dismissal in Adelaide, cutting close to his body and being caught at first slip, made Kirsten seek him out for a special session in preparation for the rest of the match. 
    
	In that lengthy nets of a few hours, Kirsten asked Sehwag to take an off-stump guard and leave everything which was bowled to him on and around that area. It ostensibly was an attempt to make Sehwag leave out a few shots which he couldnt resist outside the off-stump. 
    
	The second advice was to completely leave out the upper cut  even though it made for a pleasing, exciting sight to see the ball soar over the slips and sometimes even the third man  for it would leave too much room for errors. (PTI)

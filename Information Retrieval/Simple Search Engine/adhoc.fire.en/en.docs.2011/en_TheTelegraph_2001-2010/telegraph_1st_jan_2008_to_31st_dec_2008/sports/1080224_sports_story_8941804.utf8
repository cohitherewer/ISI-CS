                                                   India bank on batting
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: India bank on their in-form batting line up in their quarter-final tie of the ICC Under-19 World Cup against England on Sunday. With blend of styles in their batting, the Indians will bank on skipper Virat Kohli, Tanmay Srivastava, and opener Turuwar Kohli who are among the top four run-scorers in the tournament.         
	While Srivastava, who has notched up 181 runs in three innings, is capable of building big innings, the middle-order is packed with good batsmen such as Virat, who hit a 74-ball century against the West Indies, Saurabh Tiwary and Ravindra Jadeja.         
	However, Englands bowlers  lanky Steven Finn, James Harris  are likely to be India batsmens sternest test. Harris has so far bagged 10 wickets while Finn, on the other hand, has taken five wickets in two matches.         
	Though no team in the tournament have managed to score over 150 against the English side, theyll have to put an exceptional performance to keep that streak going against India. A loss against Bangladesh while chasing a mere 150 to win, pushed England to second spot.

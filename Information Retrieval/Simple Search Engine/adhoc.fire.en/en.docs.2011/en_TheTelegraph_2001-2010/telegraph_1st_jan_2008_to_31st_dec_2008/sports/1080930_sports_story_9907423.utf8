  - Motor racing under floodlights could change F1 forever       Kevin Garside                            
	Welcome to Formula One 24/7. The success of the Singapore night shift has, according to the McLaren chief of staff, Ron Dennis, introduced a heady new dimension that will transform the sport.         
	Taken to its logical conclusion, the dawn of floodlit racing could spell the end of the traditional F1 season.         
	The British Grand Prix could challenge footballs domination of the domestic Boxing Day programme. Its all round to mine for sherry while we watch Lewis Hamilton start from pole.         
	The requirement to run in natural light is no longer the ball and chain it was.         
	Formula One visionary and commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone pioneered the expansion of F1 across new frontiers as a way of expanding his business.         
	The night slot in Singapore was his way of delivering F1 into European homes at lunchtime instead of dawn, seven million viewers instead of three.         
	Now he has the template to go one better. He can bring it back to Europe at night, and in winter if he wishes.         
	Its not just a new experience, Dennis said, its a real big step in the history of grand prix racing because it has been done so well.         
	Everything has been proven now and we can take this model and apply it to anywhere in the world, either to bring it to Europe at a time when people watch it, or even within Europe to make it more spectacular.         
	Trying to top Singapores Marina Bay backdrop wont be easy. From a distance the circuit looked spectacular under lights, though this was not always conveyed by television during the race with the focus on cars via downward camera angles.         
	Singapore gave us the first example of a circuit passing under a flyover.         
	The sight of the Singapore traffic cruising overhead as the cars powered around turn one was a novel addition to the list of signature corners in F1.         
	Sir Frank Williams, who saw Nico Rosberg place a Williams on the second step of the podium despite a drive-through penalty, believes that Singapore might yet threaten the majesty of Monaco as the premier street circuit in a harbour setting.         
	It has a good chance of challenging Monaco for being the jewel in the crown of Formula One, Williams said. Thats the most accurate thing to say. They have great weather, a very good track, and the grandstands were packed. I think theres a lot of enthusiasm out there.         
	More conventionally the street circuit threw up a random winner. Fernando Alonso drove brilliantly to claim his 20th career win but generously acknowledged the role played by providence after his team-mate, Nelson Piquet, bounced off one wall into another to prompt the intervention of the safety car.         
	Felipe Massas colourful burst down the pit-lane trailing a Ferrari fuel pipe added to the pageant, and to Lewis Hamiltons chances of claiming the world drivers championship.         
	Mount Fuji is next. After Singapore, Japans sacred mountain might even be considered an anti-climax.         
	Such heresy would have invited a visit from men in white suits before the switch was thrown on 1,800 lights at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. Suddenly F1 occupies an enhanced position in the sporting market place.         
	The research results will be on Ecclestones Knightsbridge desk before his private plane has landed.         
	Bring it on, says Dennis.         
	It provides F1 with a very powerful tool, because effectively we can target anywhere in the world for what time they watch the race, he said.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Md. Sporting manage to stay afloat
            A STAFF REPORTER            A. Jyothi Kumar at Barasat on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: A. Jyothi Kumar headed in a late winner for Mohammedan Sporting as they beat Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) 2-1 in a Federation Cup Group B match at the Barasat Stadium on Monday.         
	Jyothi headed in a Satyajit Bose cross, barely seconds from the final whistle. The margin failed to depict the local teams domination throughout the match.         
	The importance of Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday was revealed time and again as the black-and-white brigade failed to convert their chances. The team looked short on firepower upfront and it would be tough for them to put it across to mighty Mahindra United, whom they play in their next match.         
	Mohammedan Sporting should have scored at least thrice in the first half. Satyajit made a mess of two sitters, and as it turned out, Mohammedan Sporting had to wait till the last minute for the winner.         
	The second half started on a positive note. Both teams showed good pace during the period.         
	Mohammedan Sporting took the lead in the 53rd minute through Lalhariatuzala Tezoka. Ramla Francis Novas brilliant back centre from the goal line reached an overlapping Tezoka, whose grounder beat gaolkeeper Amar Deb.         
	Mohammedan Sportings lead was nullified as HAL equalised in the 62nd minute. Dada Nabeel was allowed a free header by the Mohammedan Sporting defence off a Goutam Debnath cross from the left.         
	HAL wasted a golden opportunity to seal the fate of the match when they received a penalty in the 68th minute. But Frederick Okwagbes shot from the spot hit the bar and was later cleared.         
	HAL, who have no chance of making it to the next stage of the Federation Cup, were unable to take advantage of their opponents who were missing their foreign players. HALs foreign recruit Okwagbe wasted a couple of sitters.         
	Mohammedan Sporting survived some anxious moments late in the second half, when HAL came close to scoring. Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali rued the missed opportunities after the match.         
	Were not playing too bad with our limited resources. Were creating a lot of chances, but we have not been able to score. Its going to be difficult if we miss so many chances, he said.

	Referee: Pratap Singh.

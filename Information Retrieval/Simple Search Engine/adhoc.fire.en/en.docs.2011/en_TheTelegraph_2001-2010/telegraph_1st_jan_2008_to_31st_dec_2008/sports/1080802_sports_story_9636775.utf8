	 Virender Sehwag surpassed Sourav Ganguly to make the highest score by an Indian on Sri Lankan soil. Ganguly had scored 147 at Colombo (SSC) in 1997-98         
	 Sehwag completed 5000 runs in Test cricket. He became the 10th Indian to do so         
	 Sehwag became the second fastest Indian to reach the 5000-run mark. He has achieved this milestone in his 59th Test and has taken just 99 innings to achieve this feat. He also became the third youngest Indian to reach the landmark after Tendulkar and Dravid         
	 When on 200, Virender Sehwag posted the highest score by an Indian vs Sri Lanka in Tests. The previous highest was 199 at Kanpur 1986-87         
	 He is only the third visiting player to score a double hundred on Sri Lankan soil         
	 Sehwags 201 not out is now the highest score by a visiting batsman at Galle. The previous highest was 178 by Brian Lara in 2001-02         
	 Sehwag also became the second Indian to carry his bat through. The first was Sunil Gavaskar (127 not out) who batted through Indias innings of 286 versus Pakistan at Faisalabad in January, 1983         
	 It was only the seventh time in Test cricket that a player carried his bat through and scored a double hundred         
	 Ajantha Mendis claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests. It is the 19th five-wicket haul at this venue. Interestingly, Dilhara Fernando (5-42, vs Ind 2001-02) and Javagal Srinath (5-114, vs SL 2001-02) are the only pacemen to take five wickets on this ground.         
	 Malinda Warnapura and Kumar Sangakkara bettered the second wicket partnership at Galle. The previous best was 109 by Marvan Atapattu and Sangakkara vs West Indies in 2001-02                 MOHANDAS MENON

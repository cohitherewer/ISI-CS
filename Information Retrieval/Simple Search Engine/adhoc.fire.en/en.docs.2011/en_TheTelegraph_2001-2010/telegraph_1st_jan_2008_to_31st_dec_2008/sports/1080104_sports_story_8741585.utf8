                                                    Cilic takes Mahut in stride

	Chennai: He had been in the news, but for the wrong reasons. During the St Petersburg Open in October last year, Marin Cilic had defeated world No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in a second-round match but the spotlight fell on the Russian as he was fined by the ATP for not trying hard enough. 
    
	If that was unfair on the teenager, his performance at the Chennai Open on Thursday indicated that it wouldnt be possible to deny the talented Croat his share of the limelight  for the right reasons  for too long. 
    
	Indeed, Cilic hardly put a foot wrong in his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of the fifth-seeded Nicolas Mahut en route to the quarter finals of the $436000 ATP event. 
    
	It is another matter that the Frenchman looked a shadow of the player who defeated Jonas Bjorkman, Ivan Ljubicic, Rafael Nadal, Arnaud Clement in the Queens Club meet last June and came within a point of taming Andy Roddick in the final. 
    
	Top seed Nadal didnt have any hiccups in his 6-2, 6-1 win over American qualifier Rajeev Ram in a match peppered by slight drizzle. 
    
	But if the scoreline suggested a walk in the park for the world No. 2, Nadal begged to differ. 
    
	It was quite windy out there, said Nadal. It is difficult to play in such conditions and I had to hang in there. The serve was going haywire and so were the winners. It was tougher than it seems. Luckily I gained a little bit of rhythm towards the end. 
    
	The three-time French Open champion, who will face unseeded compatriot Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the quarters, appeared a little worried about the two easy matches that he had had. 
    
	Its always better to have a few tough matches early on as it prepares you well for the close games ahead, said the world No. 2 who had thrashed Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt 6-2, 6-4 in Round I. 
    
	But I am happy with my game and I feel I am playing well. 
    
	Garcia-Lopez earned the right to face Nadal after upsetting seventh seed Werner Eschauer 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3) in a two-and-half-hour epic on Thursday. 
    
	Unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, who had ended second seed Marcos Baghdatiss campaign in the first round, set up a date with Cilic. The world No. 114 won 6-1, 7-5 against Croatian qualifier Lovro Zovko in a late match. 
    
	Hard court is obviously not Mahuts favourite surface and it showed. The world No. 45 has a game suited for grass. En route to showing Ljubicic and Nadal the door, the spiky haired Frenchman had won almost 85 per cent of his first serve points. He fell well short on the Plexipave surface. 
    
	When the ball was being returned, Mahut had almost no answer. And apart from the fact that Cilic has a very good backhand which he put to good use, the fifth seed committed four double-faults  all at crucial stages. 
    
	But any more analysis of what went wrong with Mahut would be taking away from what Cilic was doing right. 
    
	The junior Grand Slam champion has a game suited for all surfaces. 
    
	Truth to tell, though, his first break  in the third game of the match  came via a Mahut unforced error, something he would go on to commit with alarming regularity later on. 
    
	But once Cilic went ahead, there was no catching him. He overpowered the Frenchman in his service game and broke him again in the next to go 5-1 up. Mahuts body language showed he was waiting for the second set. 
    
	Mahuts previous Chennai outing also ended in the second round. He didnt get a single break-point and lost the first set 2-6. 
    
	When the fifth seed was broken in the very first game of the second set, it seemed the Chennai crowd was in for a big letdown. However, Mahut got the break back following a breathtaking rally at 15-30. 
    
	The third and fourth games went with serve. It was in the marathon fifth game when it became clear that it was not Mahuts day. 
    
	The game went to deuce five times and Cilic failed to convert even one of four break-points. 
    
	When playing well, Mahut has a big serve, is quite commanding at the net and strong off the ground. It may have been because of the wind factor at the Nungambakkam Stadium that his game lacked the bite. His first serves deserted him and the attempted winners fell wide. Small wonder then that he failed to get the crucial break back and bowed 4-6. 
    
	It was a tad difficult for him to break Cilic, as true to his tradition, the strapping Croat slammed four of his eight aces in his last two service games.

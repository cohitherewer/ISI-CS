	Shanghai: A flawless five-under 67 propelled Digvijay Singh to the tied fifth spot, while Jeev Milkha Singh recovered lost ground with a blemish-free two-under 70 in the penultimate round of $2.3 million BMW Asian Open on Saturday.         
	Digvijay, tied 29th overnight, now has a total of three-under 213  six strokes off the pace of leader Irelands Darren Clarke (67).         
	In his best round of the tournament so far, Digvijay struck back-to-back birdies on the seventh and eighth to make the turn two-under. He picked up three more shots  on 10th, 13th and 17th holes  in the back nine to round off a brilliant performance.         
	Jeev, on the other hand, lies a shot below Digvijay at tied ninth. The seasoned campaigner struck a birdie-brace on the first two holes and parred the rest to bounce back after a horrendous 76 in the second round.         
	SSP Chowrasia (72) is the next best-placed Indian on the leaderboard at the tied 32nd spot with a total of one-over 217. Shiv Kapur, meanwhile, had another disastrous outing, turning in a two-over 74 to slide to the tied 52nd position with a total of four-over 220.

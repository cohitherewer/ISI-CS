The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Successful Test cricketers live long
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Successful Test cricketers live long

	Cricketers who play more Tests can expect to enjoy a longer innings in life, according to research. A study of England players found that those who represented their country more than 25 times had an average life expectancy of almost 80, compared with 73 for those who played fewer than 25 times.         
	The research, published on Thursday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests that cricketers who were more successful were happier because of the acclaim they received and were therefore less likely to suffer illness.         
	However, those who reached the pinnacle of their careers by captaining England did not live any longer than those who did not, the study found.         
	Professor Paul Boyle, from the University of St Andrews in Fife, who carried out the research, said: There are many reasons why successful cricketers would be more likely to live longer than those deemed less successful. One suggestion is that they benefited from the kudos they earned and this stayed with them for the rest of their lives, meaning they were less likely to be stressed and suffer ill-health.         
	He looked at 418 cricketers who played for England between 1876, when the first Test was played, and 1963. The average life expectancy for those who played more than 25 Tests was 77.95, compared with 73.25 years for the others.         
	The research considered players social backgrounds, which influences how long people live.         
	During the years studied, cricket players were classed as either quot;gentlemen quot;, who tended to be wealthier, or professional players, who were working class.         
	Until 1963, many English cricketers were gentlemen who came from privileged backgrounds or high-ranking jobs and were able to take time off work to play in important matches.         
	As expected, the study found that the privileged gentlemen lived to an average age of 77, three years longer than the working-class professionals, who had an average life expectancy of 74.         
	The study appears to support research carried out by Canadian scientists among actors. They found that Oscar winners lived up to six years longer than actors who did not win an award.         
	The findings make happy reading for wicketkeeper/ batsman Alec Stewart, Englands most capped cricketer, who was 45 on Tuesday. He played in 133 Tests before his retirement in 2003.

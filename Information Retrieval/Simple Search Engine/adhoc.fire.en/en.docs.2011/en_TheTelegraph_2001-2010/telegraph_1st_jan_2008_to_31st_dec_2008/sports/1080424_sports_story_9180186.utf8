The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daljit: Eden pitch horrific
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Daljit: Eden pitch horrific
                      
	Mohali: The Eden Gardens pitch on which Knight Riders played their first IPL home match against Deccan Chargers was sandy and had been prepared without taking into account the sultry conditions there, BCCI pitches and grounds committee chairman Daljit Singh said.         
	Daljit who returned here Wednesday after reviewing the preparations for the remaining matches in Calcutta, said the earlier strip was not at all conducive for holding a Twenty20 match.         
	The centre pitches had been top-dressed with sandy soil of very poor quality. The top soil was sandy and the surface very abrasive. It appeared the strip had not been prepared keeping in view the extremely hot conditions in Calcutta at present, but according to the conditions prevailing in November-December, Daljit told reporters here.         
	He said even though the outfield at the Eden was terrific, the pitch was horrific.         
	I did not go there to find any faults. We decided that the pitch on which the last match was played should be rested and the CAB has now ordered better soil to re-do the square as soon as IPL is over. I also told the curator that the pitch should not be under-watered, he said.         
	Daljit also made it clear that there was no problem with the Mohali pitch.           (PTI)

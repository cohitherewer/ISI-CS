	ANECDOTES         
	Greed         
	The boxer Eduard Paululum was justly proud, being the first athlete from Vanuatu to appear at the Olympic Games. But the morning of the bout, instead of eating after the weigh-in, the bantamweight contender decided to have a hearty breakfast beforehand. Unfortunately, he was too heavy at the weigh-in to be considered for the contest and the officials had no choice but to disqualify him.         
	Sit-in         
	Bad loser South Koreas Byun Jong-il staged a 67 minute sit-in protest after his boxing defeat to Bulgarias Alexander Hristov. Byun felt he had been cheated by New Zealand referee Keith Walker.               
	EXPLOIT         
	As soon as the curtain was raised on the Olympic Games in Seoul, Kristin Otto wrote herself into the Olympic record books. With a total of six gold medals, she became the most decorated women ever in a single Olympiad, all sports combined. The only person to have bettered this feat was Mark Spitz. The king of the pools wait for his Olympic queen had taken 16 years.               
	SUMMARY         
	The morning after Ben Johnsons blistering 100m dash set a new world record of 9.79sec as well as leaving the likes of Carl Lewis trailing in his wake at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the Canadian was revealed as a drug cheat.         
	Johnson was eventually stripped of his gold and received a hefty ban, but the real damage was the dint left in the tournaments credibility and subsequent pace-setting athletes have been subject to cynical scrutiny from fans and the anti-doping agencies alike.         
	Other than the Johnson scandal the Games were a relative success.         
	After Moscow and Los Angeles had been devalued by boycotts all the big guns were present when proceedings began in South Korea. North Korea boycotted in protest at not gaining co-organisation and the only other notable absentees were Cuba and Ethiopia.         
	So the events themselves were fiercely competitive with the US, the Soviet Union and East Germany leading the medals charge. In athletics the US bagged the lions share of awards, their efforts spearheaded by Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the long-jump and heptathlon. Also for the US the late Florence Griffith-Joyner exploded toward the 100m and 200m titles.         
	Carl Lewis added three more titles to his haul winning the 100m, long-jump and 4x100m while Roger Kingdom won the 110m hurdles as the USA took twelve medals in athletics.         
	Pole vaulting Czar Sergei Bubka, from the Ukraine, won a deserved gold having missed out because of politics four years earlier.         
	In the pool there was a regal battle for the gold on offer. It ended with East Germanys Kristin Otto pillaging six and American Matt Biondi taking five gold.

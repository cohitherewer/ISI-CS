	Nagpur: Shalabh Srivastav and Vikranth Gonnade scored half centuries against Bengal as Vidarbha posted a respectable 403 in their first innings, before scalping four top order batsman of Bengal for 149 to wrest the initiative after the second days play of the Ranji Trophy plate B group match here Saturday.         
	Overnight batsman Ranjit Paradkar fell soon after resumption Saturday morning and was followed by Gaurav Upadhaya.         
	Thereafter Shalabh Srivastav, and Vikranth Gonnade pushed the Vidarbha innings past the three hundred mark.         
	The Bengal bowlers lacked penetration as Vikkrath Gonnade blasted some confident shots round the park.         
	Allrounder Srikanth Wagh also chipped in with an useful contribution as Vidarbha cruised past the four hundred mark to be all out in 143.1 overs, 28 minutes before tea.         
	Bengal vying for the top spot in their pool struggled from the start and were 56 for three at one stage with Manoj Tiwary out for a duck.         
	Medium pacer Umesh Yadav scalped two for 39, while Srikanth Yadav took one for 53 making the early inroads before Wriddiman Saha checked the slide.         
	Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla holed out at cover off medium pacer Alind Naidu. Dibyendu Chakraborty joined Saha and looked to resurrect the innings for the visitors as the game ended two overs before scheduled close of play due to bad light.

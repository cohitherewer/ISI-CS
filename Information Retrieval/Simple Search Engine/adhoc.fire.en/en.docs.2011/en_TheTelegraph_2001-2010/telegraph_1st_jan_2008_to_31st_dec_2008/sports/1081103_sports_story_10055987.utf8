The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha tied 50th
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev Milkha tied 50th
                      
	Sotogrande: Jeev Milkha Singh continued to struggle in wet and windy conditions and carded a four-over 75 in the penultimate round to be placed tied 50th at the European Tours Volvo Masters here.         
	Jeevs three-round total stands at 14-over 226 at the Club de Golf Valderrama. The 10th tee starter began positively with a birdie on the 13th but it all went downhill from there on. After a bogey on the 16th left him even-par at the turn, Jeev could only find bogeys in soggy conditions.

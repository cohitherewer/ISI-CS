	Ningbo City (China): M.C. Mary Kom remained on course for a fourth successive title but Indias hopes of retaining the team crown all but ended after two of its four pugilists lost their semi-final bouts in the fifth World Womens Boxing Championship here on Friday.         
	Apart from Mary Kom (46kg), N. Usha (57kg) was the only other Indian to make the final.         
	In her bout against Korean Ok Jong, Mary Kom kept her guard well to her rival to notch up an 8-3 win. (PTI)

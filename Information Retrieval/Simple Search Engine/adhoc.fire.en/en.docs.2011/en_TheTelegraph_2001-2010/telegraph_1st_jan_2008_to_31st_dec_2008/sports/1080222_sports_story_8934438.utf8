The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Preity Zinta promises Powar makeover
                                                     Preity Zinta promises Powar makeover
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Preity Zinta                           
	Calcutta: The svelte Preity Zinta, co-owner of the Yuvraj Singh-led Mohali team in the Indian Premier League (IPL), has promised to be an active boss.         
	Indeed, shes even ready to help make the portly offie, Ramesh Powar, fitter!         
	Preity has promised that shell make Powar run with her and that should improve his fitness, former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Inderjit Singh Bindra, synonymous with cricket in Mohali, told The Telegraph.         
	Bindra is one of the architects of the IPL as well.         
	Powar came at a nice price ($170,000, the lowest for an Indian bowler) and he can also bat, so hes actually been a very good buy for the team Theres excitement over the players Mohali has got, Bindra added.         
	Yuvraj apart, the crowd-pullers are Brett Lee and Sreesanth, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Irfan Pathan as well.         
	As for Powar, the 29-year-old has played two Tests (six wickets) and 31 ODIs (34 wickets). He has been out of favour for quite some time, though.         
	Powar, in fact, has been dumped by West Zone too and so the IPL is really a saviour for the Mumbaikar.

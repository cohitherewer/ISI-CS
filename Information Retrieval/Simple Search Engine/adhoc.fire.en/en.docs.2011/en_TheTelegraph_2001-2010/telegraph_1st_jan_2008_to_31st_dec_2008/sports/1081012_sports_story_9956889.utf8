The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif hearing adjourned
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asif hearing adjourned
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Asif in Mumbai on Saturday                           
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) drug tribunal, looking into Mohammed Asifs doping case, was on Saturday forced to hold back its verdict after the Pakistani pacers lawyer argued that the tribunal did not have the authority to rule on the case.         
	The counsel of Mr Mohammed Asif has raised interim objections on the maintainability of the case. I have reserved my passing an order on the issue (objections).         
	I will give my decision in three-four days, Shishir Gupte, a lawyer and on the tribunal, told reporters after the hearing at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters here.         
	The hearing itself has been adjourned for four weeks and would resume tentatively on November 11, when the recording of the statements of the witnesses was expected to begin.         
	Gupte said that Asifs lawyer Shahid Karim argued that the IPL has no right to prosecute or take action against the player as there was a separate anti-doping institution to go into the matter.         
	Besides Gupte, the tribunal included former India captain Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Bapat, a former vice-chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Science.         
	Asif was also accompanied by Michael Graham, a sports medicine expert.         
	The grounds for the argument put forward by Asifs counsel seem to be weak.         
	The IPL was sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, which is a signatory to the Wada code.         
	The dope testing at the IPLs inaugural edition was conducted by IDTM, a Sweden-based independent team, and the samples were analysed by a Wada-accredited laboratory in Switzerland.

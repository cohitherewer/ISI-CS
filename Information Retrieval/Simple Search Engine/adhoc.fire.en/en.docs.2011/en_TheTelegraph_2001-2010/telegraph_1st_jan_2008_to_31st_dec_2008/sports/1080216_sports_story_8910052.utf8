The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB will seek pound of flesh from BCCI
                                                   PCB will seek pound of flesh from BCCI
    - If Australians dont tour Pakistan, then             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which has been backing the initiatives of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), will be seeking its pound of flesh if the Australians refuse to tour.         
	As things stand, citing misgivings over security, everything points to Ricky Ponting and Co. not making the long-haul trip next month.         
	The PCB, quite clearly, has taken a tough stand on the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) and wholeheartedly endorsed the Indian Premier League (IPL). Besides, it has been lobbying for Inderjit Singh Bindra, one of The Telegraphs sources in Pakistan pointed out on Friday afternoon.         
	A former BCCI president, Bindra is seen as the frontrunner to succeed Malcolm Speed as the International Cricket Councils chief executive.         
	Specifically, the PCB is looking to host India for three ODIs in mid-March, assuming that the Pontings dont show up for the full-fledged tour (three Tests, five ODIs and a solitary Twenty20 International).         
	Towards that end, two key officials  chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi and Subhan Ahmed, general manager (international cricket)  had a dialogue with top BCCI office-bearers in Mumbai the other day.         
	Naghmi and Ahmed had been invited for the opening of the sponsorship bids for the IPL.         
	A proposal has come, yes, but weve neither accepted nor rejected it... This is something that will probably be decided at the level of the president (Sharad Pawar) only, is what one of the BCCI office-bearers said late on Friday.         
	He added: Well have to take into account the rest-factor for the players... Many will be coming home after close to three months in Australia...         
	However, somebody with much influence in the BCCI took a somewhat different line: A neighbour in trouble cant be allowed to feel isolated.         
	If Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men reach the finals of the ongoing tri-series and the tournament goes the distance, then the Indians will be busy in Australia till March 7.         
	The three-Test home series against South Africa, though, wont begin till March 26 and, so, theres actually a window if the BCCI wants to oblige.         
	The PCB is also looking at Sri Lanka for help  after India, that is  and the two key officials have reached Colombo for a short visit.         
	The Sri Lankans, one learns, have been given the option of either playing five ODIs or three Tests.         
	Elections are being held in Pakistan on Monday, but status-quo could be maintained in the PCB (in the immediate future, at least) as President Pervez Musharraf is its chief patron.

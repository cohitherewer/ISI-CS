The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Totti out of United tie
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Totti out of United tie
                      
	Rome: Francesco Totti has been left out of AS Romas squad for Wednesdays Champions League quarter-final second leg at Manchester United, the Serie A side said on Monday.         
	Totti missed the first leg last week with a thigh problem and there had been conflicting reports over the weekend about the strikers availability for the Old Trafford leg, with Roma trailing 2-0.         
	The forward, however, was not included in a squad list published on the club website (www.asroma.it). Roma boss Luciano Spalletti had said after Saturdays 3-2 win over Genoa that it might be better for Totti to miss the United game and fully recover for next weekends league clash at Udinese.         
	Manchester United, however, received a boost with the news on Monday that defender Rio Ferdinand has not broken a bone in his foot.         
	The England defender is still doubtful for Wednesdays match, however, with Uniteds medical staff not confirming how long he might be out of action.         
	Rio went for a scan on Monday and we can confirm that he has not suffered any break, a club official said. (Reuters)

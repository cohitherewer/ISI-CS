The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin out of torch relay
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin out of torch relay
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar has become the second big name in Indian sport after Bhaichung Bhutia to pull out of the Olympic torch relay in the capital.         
	Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi, who addressed a crowded press conference on the torch run on Wednesday, admitted that the batting maestro wont be there to run along with some of Indias biggest sporting icons.         
	Sachin has sent us a message saying that he wont be there tomorrow (Thursday), Kalmadi said. Besides, he will also be busy with the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The IOA chief had initially made it appear that Sachin was desperate to carry the torch. Kalmadi went on record saying that the star cricketer had called him up and showed his willingness to be included on the list of torch bearers.         
	The Telegraph, however, broke the story that the cricketer had never approached the IOA chief in this regard. At no time did Sachin either volunteer or personally telephone anybody, the cricketers wife Anjali told the paper exclusively on April 8.         
	While a section of the IOA officials said that the physio of Sachin-led IPL team, Mumbai Indians, has advised him not to run the relay because of his groin injury, Kalmadi said he was not worried a bit by his absence.         
	It (Sachins absence) doesnt worry us a bit, Kalmadi quipped. There are lots of other sportspersons present here. They are all famous people in Indian sports. And mind it, those who will not be present will also pray for the success of the historic event. Only Bhaichung Bhutia has pulled out because of personal reasons.         
	With Sachin pulling out, the prestigious torch run on Thursday will not feature any cricketer. Kalmadi said that Sunil Gavaskar was invited but the former captain, too, had declined the invitation.         
	Gavaskar was approached around three weeks back, Kalmadi said. He initially agreed to run but he too then got busy with the IPL.         
	Asked whether Kapil Dev was invited, Kalmadi replied in the negative.

                                                    Tie to provide India vital practice 

 - After Harbhajan episode, its back to busINess with twenty20 clash 
   A CORRESPONDENT
      Its uncertain whether Sachin Tendulkar will play 
                
	Melbourne: Sachin Tendulkar remains uncertain for Indias Twenty20 International against Australia at the MCG on Friday. Till late on Thursday night, it was unclear whether Sachin would play and apparently it has been left up to him to decide on his participation. 
    
	The teams have met twice in this form of the game with the visitors coming up trumps on both occasions  first with a 15-run semi-final win at the ICC World Twenty20 and then with a seven-wicket triumph in Mumbai a month later. 
    
	The Indians will not have their full complement of players to choose from because Yuvraj Singh is still unfit and Rudra Pratap Singh is home bound. Munaf Patel and Manoj Tiwary will arrive in Brisbane and will be available for this match. 
    
	Australian captain Ricky Pontings participation was also doubtful as he had still not fully recovered from a back injury. I injured my back last week in Adelaide So I pretty much have been flat on my back the last couple of days, just trying to give myself the best chance to recover, he said. 
    
	Ponting had missed their previous Twenty20 match in Perth against New Zealand in December. I didnt play the last Twenty20 game, so if I am fit I will obviously have to come into the side somewhere, he said. 
    
	With the Harbhajan Singh issue having been sorted out, the focus will be back on cricket. The Indians can expect a fierce backlash from the Australians who have been quite livid with the developments in the last two days. 
    
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was candid on the luck factor in Twenty20 cricket. It depends on luck sometimes, whether your decisions are coming right or not. But its not just being lucky, its also about how well you play. 
    
	We will treat this Twenty20 game as a practice game as a lot of the boys who have been here still have not got a decent hit, he said. 
    
	The practice session was affected by rain. 
    
	Ponting said Australia were keen to stamp their authority on Twenty20 cricket. For us, maybe there are some scores to settle... We are going to be playing more of it and theres definitely room for improvement for Australia. 
    
	Meanwhile, the BCCI has asked the players to be careful after the row involving Harbhajan, secretary Niranjan Shah said on Thursday. We have already asked the players, given them instructions not to get into such type of altercations, Shah said, adding that he expected India to put the controversy behind them.

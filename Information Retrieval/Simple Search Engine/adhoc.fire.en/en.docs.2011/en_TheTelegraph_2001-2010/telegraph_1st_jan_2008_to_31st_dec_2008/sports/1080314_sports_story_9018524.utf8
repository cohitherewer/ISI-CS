The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso is confident
                                                   Alonso is confident
                      
	Melbourne: Most of the faces are familiar, but Fernando Alonso knows things are very different at Renault since return.         
	Alonso, who has rejoined the French team after leaving them for McLaren last season, fears his old outfit have lost the confident swagger that saw them dominate Formula One in 2005 and 2006.         
	After winning two years in a row when I left in 2006 they were confident and they were believing in themselves a lot, he told a news conference on Thursday.         
	Now, after they did not get such good results last year, maybe they are lacking a little bit in confidence. But I think they know that they are able to do good things.         
	Alonsos move to McLaren coincided with both the end of his and Renaults domination.         
	The 26-year-old lost his world title to Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen and quit McLaren after just one season while Renaults fortunes also took a turn for the worse.         
	Alonso will make his comeback for Renault at Sundays season-opening Australian Grand Prix and he believes the glory days can be revived.         
	They have nothing to prove to anybody so it is just a matter of time and good work with everybody to put the team in a better place, he said. Coming back to Renault for me is a great challenge and for them too.         
	I think they are extra motivated this year to have the success we have had in the past and I am extra motivated as well. (REUTERS)

      STAR RACER
              
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs ward Regal Connection won the 2,400m Calcutta Derby Stakes on Sunday, upsetting the applecart of the triple Classic winning filly, Classic Sky  an 11-10 favourite in a field of seven. Jockey Christopher Alford partnered the winner. It was, however, not a cakewalk for the Regal Connection, a Mr Mellon son who was neglected at 5-1 in the betting by the Derby-day crowd which started packing the stands from an hour before the first race was flagged off at 12.05pm.
     
	Alford followed an age-old strategy from the start of the race, keeping Regal Connection in the rear while Triple Edge tried to cut a hot pace right from the beginning. The pace-maker had the likes of Local Warriors, Steal The Glorys and Star Teams and the rest following him till the halfway stage of the race before running out of the gas. 
     
	Local Warrior assumed the charge of running from that point with Steal The Glory and Star Team on his haunches while the favourite improved places and so did Regal Connection.
     
	Classic Sky had already moved into the box seat and the other fancied runners, too, had settled down to vantage positions a little before the tricky final bend which had taken many a toll in the past. Jockey Colm Dononghue, too, fell a victim of the hairpin bend  having to take the outer course in stead of an economic route. He could now blame his stable-mates  B. Prakash and I. Chisty  who were in no mood to sacrifice their chances in the Derby.
     
	Alford, on the other hand, was the wisest of the lot. He followed Donoghues route till the home turn and quickly switched course when the field straightened up. Bisecting the tiring trio of Local Warrior, Steal The Glory and Star Team, he brought Regal Connection abreast of the favourite and also established a slender lead. Donoghue tried to work some magic but to no avail as the filly was tiring and the masculine power was getting stronger. The half-a-length lead built up by Regal Connection in the last 150m never receded even before a couple of strides ahead of the winning-post, when Alford punched the air.
     
	The crowd loved it all and cheered Alford and Vijay. when the two professionals led in their fifth winner of the day.

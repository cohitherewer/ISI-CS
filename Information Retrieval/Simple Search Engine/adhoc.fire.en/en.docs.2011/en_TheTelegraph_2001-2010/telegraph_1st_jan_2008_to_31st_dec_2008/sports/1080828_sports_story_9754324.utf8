The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arthur had a purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arthur had a purpose
            WILLIAM C. RHODEN            Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe                           
	On September 9, 1968, Arthur Ashe Jr defeated Tom Okker of The Netherlands to win the first US Open mens singles championship. The victory was the first in a string of accomplishments that would distinguish Ashe, who died in 1993 at the age of 49.         
	For his historic triumph, Ashe, as an amateur, received only $280 for his daily expenses. Okker, a professional, got the $14,000 first prize.         
	He didnt win any money, but it wasnt about the money, his widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, said during a recent telephone interview. There was so much going on that year  the assassinations, the riots, the turmoil. Yet in the midst of all that, Arthur won the US Open. Arthur, even then, had a purpose, and it was not achieved just by making money.         
	Some decades are worth a year; some years are worth a decade. The year that rocked the world was 1968. Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in April, Robert Kennedy in June. In August, the Democratic National Convention, being held in Chicago, exploded into a bloody confrontation between the police and antiwar protestors.         
	Eleven days after the tumultuous convention ended, Ashe, with typical calm, grace and quiet strength, achieved history at Forest Hills. The victory, in a sport that had not welcomed Blacks, was yet another marker in what Ashe called a hard road to glory.         
	His was the first major victory for an African-American since Althea Gibsons Forest Hills triumph a decade earlier. He became the first African-American man to win a major tennis title. Ashe, who also won the US Amateur Championship and helped the American team claim the Davis Cup that year, ended a 13-year title drought by American men at Forest Hills.         
	But his triumphs at the US Open and later at Wimbledon did not, as many had predicted, pave the way for a flood of African-American champions. Venus and Serena Williams have been the only consistent champions, and James Blake has been the only consistent African-American male player.         
	Im a little surprised, but thats going to change, Jeanne Ashe said, adding that African-Americans would be inspired by Barack Obama being his partys candidate for president.         
	Ashe was concerned about achieving the greater good, of the African-American community and the country as well; he recognised that the two were linked. The most useful part of the 40th anniversary of Ashes win is that it provides an opportunity to reflect on a mans life and measure the ideals against reality.         
	As Ashes generation was defined by struggle and protest, a younger generation, with so much given, so much at its disposal, has lost sight of this greater good, of a sense of purpose. For the current generation, the greater good has been narrowly redefined in individual terms. The potential of sports to heal, reform and call attention to injustice has been lost.         
	Thats the great thing about anniversaries, Jeanne Ashe said. It gives us a chance to look back and review where we are going. Its not about visiting the past and staying in it. Its looking at the past as a way to look to the future.

            CRICKET ONLINE    Ravi Shastri          
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. Though I bowl an off stump line, my deliveries constantly fall short of length despite my best efforts to pitch the ball up. Please help.              
	(Soumen Banerjee, 17, Calcutta-10)              
	Make sure your left shoulder doesnt fall away too early at the point of delivery.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to lift the ball, it goes high but never reaches the boundary. Is it due to less bottom-hand into the shot?              
	(Shakti Saha, 16, Calcutta)              
	No, you are lifting your head too early.              
	My aggressive approach often leads to my dismissal in one-dayers. Should I try to curb my instincts?              
	(Sudipto Dhar, 19, Calcutta-21)              
	Pay attention to your shot selection and try and get your eye in initially.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. When trying to play the pull shot I lose my balance. Please help.              
	(Swapan Karmakar, 18, Siliguri)              
	You must use the depth of the crease when going back and across. That will give you time and better balance as well.              
	I am a left-handed batsman. I often fail to judge the incoming ball from a medium-pacer. As a result, I get bowled. Please help.              
	(Ratan Kumar, 22)              
	Watch the ball closely. Try and get your front foot in line with the ball and if playing back get behind it.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to pull a short-pitched delivery, I get caught at square leg. Please help.              
	(Rohit Jhunjhunwala, 19)              
	Again use the depth of the crease when going back and work with your coach on rolling your wrists when playing the shot.              
	I am a right-hander. I have constantly been getting out bowled missing the line to an off-spinner. Please help.              
	(Romesh Mukherjee, 23)              
	Get your foot close to the pitch of the ball and also make sure your head is not bobbing around when looking to play the ball.              
	I am an allrounder. I have been doing a lot of running and gym during the off-season. Is it okay?              
	(Sanjoy Jha, 21, Jamshedpur)              
	Thats the best time to really train hard. You are doing the right thing because once the season starts you are in pretty good condition.              
	I am an allrounder. But after every off-season I struggle to get back to my rhythm. Why does this happen?              
	(Sohit Chatterjee, Calcutta-17)              
	Work on your fitness during the off season and do a lot of running.              
	Which life do you enjoy more  a cricketer or a commentator.              
	(Roshan Nayak, 17, Sambalpur)              
	Nothing beats playing the game. Broadcasting on live cricket is the next best thing.

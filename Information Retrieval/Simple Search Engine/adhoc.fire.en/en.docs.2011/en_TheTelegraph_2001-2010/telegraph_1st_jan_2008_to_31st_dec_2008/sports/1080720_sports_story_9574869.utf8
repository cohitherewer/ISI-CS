	Calcutta: The annual awards ceremony of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) at the Town Hall on Saturday was held amid a whiff of the ensuing CAB elections. While the office-bearers were seated along with their associates in the main hall, the members owing allegiance to Jagmohan Dalmiya were seated in an adjoining hall.         
	The ruling faction hasnt named their nominees for the Board of Trustees. It is learnt that they are yet to garner the support of the requisite members (six each for the five candidates) needed to file their nominations.

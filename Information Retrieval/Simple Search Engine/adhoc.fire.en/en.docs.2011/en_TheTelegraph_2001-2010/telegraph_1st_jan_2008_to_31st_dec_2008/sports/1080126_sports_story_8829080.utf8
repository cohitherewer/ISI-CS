	Calcutta: Sunil Gavaskar has asked ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed to go through his entire fortnightly column which has created a controversy. It was learnt that the former India captain has also asked Speed and other ICC officials not to go by excerpts which appeared in some Australian papers. 
    
	The matter will be discussed by the ICCs executive board. Gavaskar, the chairman of the cricket committee, has asked the ICC to invite him when the board meets so that he can give his side of the story in person. 
    
	Speed and cricket manager Dave Richardson recently spoke to Gavaskar on the issue. 
    
	The Australian on Friday had reported that the ICC was preparing to take action against Gavaskar for his attack on Match Referee Mike Procter. 
    
	According to sources in Australia, there appears to be a move to have Gavaskar replaced by former captain Mark Taylor. 
    
	Gavaskar has been under attack following his claim that Harbhajan received a three-Test ban for racial abuse because Procter believed the word of a fellow white man instead of a brown man, the paper reported. 
    
	In his column that appeared in The Telegraph on January 16, Gavaskar wrote: Millions of Indians want to know if it was a white man taking the white mans word against that of the brown man. 
    
	Quite simply if there was no audio evidence nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand. 
    
	This is what has incensed the millions of Indians who are flabbergasted that the word of one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Sachin Tendulkar, was not accepted. 
    
	Meanwhile, Procter did not consider Sachins evidence in the Harbhajan hearing because he thought the champion batsman was not in a position to hear what his teammate had uttered during the controversial Sydney Test.

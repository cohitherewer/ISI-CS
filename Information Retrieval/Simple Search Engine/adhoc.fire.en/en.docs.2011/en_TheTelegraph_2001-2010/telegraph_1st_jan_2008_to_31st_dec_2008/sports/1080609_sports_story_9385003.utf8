The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovic lives her dream
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ivanovic lives her dream
            Clive White in Paris            Ana Ivanovic in front of the Eiffel Tower on Saturday                           
	A Grand Slam winner in two successive majors  if Serbia could bottle it they would probably sell it to the Lawn Tennis Association. As befits a young pretender who has been told she is to be crowned queen tomorrow come what may today, Ana Ivanovic boldly took matters into her own hands on Saturday by celebrating her anointment as world No. 1 in the only manner appropriate: by winning the French Open.         
	Maria Sharapova may not give a boo-hoo about losing the No. 1 ranking, which she held for three weeks, but for the lovely girl from Belgrade it has always been her dream. When she was introduced to her potential Swiss backer Dan Holzmann in a Zurich apartment six years ago, he asked her what her goal in tennis was and then looked deep into her eyes for the right answer before committing himself to a 250,000 speculation. To become the No. 1 player in the world, the 14-year-old replied unhesitatingly. As she held aloft the Suzanne Lenglen trophy, which she received from the former champion Justine Henin after beating a worthy opponent in Dinara Safina of Russia, 6-4, 6-3, the young woman said: As a kid I used to bike to practice and dream of this. Not any more.         
	It may take her a while to settle into the shoes of the recently abdicated champion, but at least she won in a style that Paris hadnt been accustomed to throughout the little Belgians extraordinary reign. Probably not since the 2001 cliffhanger between Jennifer Capriati and Kim Clijsters has a Court Philippe Chatrier crowd enjoyed a womans final so much.         
	Any fears among Ivanovics supporters  and they included the former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who is a life-long friend of Holzmanns  that she might suffer a recurrence of the stage-fright that consumed her in last years final against Henin were quickly dispelled. In fact probably the only time they feared for her was when she climbed on an unstable-looking linespersons chair to get up into box to join the celebrations afterwards. They were too busy hugging each other to help me  I thought, What about me?         
	Otherwise, it was her fearlessness to go for her shots in the big moments that was the key to her victory, as it has been throughout these championships. It helped, of course, breaking Safina in the opening game and when she reached that same point, at 2-1 up, from where she crumbled last year she boldly went past it, celebrating with her customary clenched fist salute and a cry of Come on.         
	A double break had her firmly in control, or so it seemed, but Safina is nothing if not a fighter like Ivanovic and she pulled back both breaks to level at four-all. There was a momentary wobble then from the Serbian but she quickly righted herself to reclaim a break. The set was still in the balance as Ivanovic served for it and in fact Safina twice had a break point, but Ivanovic, although she may look like a beauty queen, is made of much sterner stuff and she managed to serve out.         
	A year ago a double fault in the sixth game of the second set, which gave Safina the chance to break back, might have unsettled her, particularly since she must have known Safina had come back from 2-5 down in the final set to beat Sharapova, but the Ivanovic nerve again held firm.         
	She admitted it was hard then not to allow her mind to wander towards lifting the trophy but this time, unlike in the Australian Open final against Sharapova in January, she was in no mood to be upstaged by compatriot Novak Djokovic. When Safina hit a backhand long at 3-5 it gave her three championship points. She needed only one, thanks to the biggest forehand in womens tennis. Those in her box never doubted it for a moment and probably havent done for the past six years.

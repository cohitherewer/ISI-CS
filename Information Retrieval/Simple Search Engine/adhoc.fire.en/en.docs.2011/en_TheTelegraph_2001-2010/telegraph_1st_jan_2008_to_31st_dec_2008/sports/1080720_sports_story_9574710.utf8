	Rome: AC Milan moved to end speculation on Saturday that Brazil playmaker Kaka is up for sale, although the players spokesman said negotiations with Chelsea are ongoing.         
	Kaka is absolutely not for sale, Milans communications director Vittorio Mentana said in a brief statement posted on the clubs website. However, Kakas spokesman Diogo Kotscho said in Sao Paolo that negotiations are ongoing between the two teams over the 26-year old Fifa player of the year. Yes, they are negotiating, Kotscho said. Chelsea have made a formal proposal to Milan for Kaka.         
	Kotscho said the Premier League team has offered euro100 million, 15 percent of which would go to Kaka. Representatives of both clubs met twice over the past week in London and Milan, he said.

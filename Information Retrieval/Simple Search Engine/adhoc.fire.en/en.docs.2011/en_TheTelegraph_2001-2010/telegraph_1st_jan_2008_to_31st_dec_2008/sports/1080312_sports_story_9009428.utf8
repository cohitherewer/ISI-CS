The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie pullout to boost IPL
                                                   Aussie pullout to boost IPL
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Australia on Tuesday scrapped their tour of Pakistan barely a few hours after twin bomb blasts rocked Lahore, a decision which cleared the decks for their star cricketers to take part in next months Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	All Australians, including big names such Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds, would be available for the April-18 to June 1 Twenty20 tournament since they have no engagements in April.         
	Only Justin Langer, who has opted out of the League, wont be seen in action among the Australians.         
	Shortly after the blasts which left a number of people killed, Cricket Australia (CA) conveyed the decision to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), putting an end to months of speculation on whether the tour would go ahead.         
	The two boards issued a joint statement, announcing that new dates for the tour would be decided soon.         
	We are very sorry that the tour could not take place at this time. This was a difficult decision based on independent review of the circumstances prevailing in Pakistan, CA chairman Creagh Connor said.         
	We wish no loss to PCB and look forward to undertaking this tour in the near future, he said.         
	Australia were scheduled to tour Pakistan later this month but the deteriorating law and order situation since the assassination of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December first led to trimming of their itinerary and eventually its postponement.         
	CA chief executive James Sutherland said in Melbourne that they tried their best to make the tour possible but had to postpone it after the latest carnage.         
	Weve left no stone unturned, we wanted to play this tour. (But) our absolute priority has been the security and safety of our players and our employees, he said, adding that the CA also considered the Australian governments advise in the matter.         
	Sutherland made it clear that the tour would not happen before next year. Theres a couple of windows in 2009 an 2010 and there may be a little bit of manoeuvring in order to make that happen, he said.         
	Sutherland said the option of neutral venues was also considered but Pakistan were desperate for the tour to proceed on its home soil.         
	The CA and PCB said in a joint statement that the tour would be scheduled soon by the chairmen of the two boards when they meet in Dubai next weekend to further discuss possible dates for the deferred tour.         
	The ICC Future Tours Program is complex and changes require extensive consultation with other member boards with whom Australia and Pakistan have existing commitments. This process will be undertaken over coming weeks, they said.         
	PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said: We are obviously very disappointed. I guess there is not much we could do and sincerely hope that the tour of Australia to Pakistan can materialise at the earliest opportunity.         
	The Australian government, which had a travel advisory warning against travelling to Pakistan, said it was pleased with the decision.         
	I welcome the decision by CA and the PCB to postpone the Australian teams planned tour of Pakistan, said foreign minister Stephen Smith.

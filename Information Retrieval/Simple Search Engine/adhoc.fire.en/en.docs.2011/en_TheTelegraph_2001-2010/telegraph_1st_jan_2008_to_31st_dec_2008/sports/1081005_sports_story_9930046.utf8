	Dalmiya said they are ready to extend full support to Shah Rukh. If he comes one-and-a-half step forward, we will go three-fourths. There will be full co-operation from our side. It was a very friendly, very warm and very open talk. If the attitude is right, the approach is right, one can always find ways and means to sort out issues, he said.

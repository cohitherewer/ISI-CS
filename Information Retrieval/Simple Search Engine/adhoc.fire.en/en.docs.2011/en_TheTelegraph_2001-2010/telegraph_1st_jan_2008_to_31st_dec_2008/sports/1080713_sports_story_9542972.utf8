	Calcutta: Kalighat created a record in the Maidan on Saturday, sweeping all five trophies this season.         
	Having already bagged the Senior Division League, Knockout, J.C. Mukherjee and A.N. Ghosh titles, they beat BNR by 23 runs at the Eden on Saturday to clinch the P. Sen Trophy.         
	In the final, Kalighat after being put in to bat, had a shaky start.         
	They reached a respectable 137, thanks mainly to a 23-ball 37 by Ranabir Nath, which rescued them from a precarious 75 for seven.         
	In reply, BNR (who were docked one over) managed 114 for six. Mithun Dutta hit a half-century.

                                                    Bhajjis excuse an insult to women

      SUE MOTT

	Mrs Symonds, what can we say? You have been disgustingly insulted but as far as international cricket is concerned, the abuse you have suffered is of no importance whatsoever. In fact, it is positively a good thing. The alleged truth that India bowler Harbhajan Singh did not call your son Andrew a big monkey during the intense Sydney Test match last week, but instead uttered a highly derogatory remark about your good self is the linchpin of the Indians defence. 
    
	Heavyweight lawyers are to be wheeled in from India, when a New Zealand judge hosts the International Cricket Council appeal, to insist that Harbhajans offence was the minimal one of being abusive to a mans mother and not involving the primate kingdom at all. How civilised. 
    
	In all the continuing controversy of this case, not a living soul has thought to question whether being rude about someones poor mum is just as heinous a sin as comparing them to a monkey. It has been taken as read that this is a defence. 
    
	There is something almost funny about the casual inconsiderateness of all this. There are highly trained legal minds as we speak preparing to argue that the alleged insult Harbhajan offered Symonds mother in Hindi could have been misheard by Symonds and teammates Matt Hayden and Michael Clarke as big monkey in English. That would be all right then. Sorry chaps, misunderstanding. Rescind Harbhajans three-Test ban, put the tour back on track and well say no more about it. 
    
	Women may not be entirely logical creatures but even we, examining the bare threads of the case, are suspicious. India lose the second Test in Sydney, partly thanks to some pretty hopeless umpiring decisions in the face of hard-baked Australian sledging, and are highly offended by the accusation that one of their players, the Sikh of Tweak, has allegedly called a mixed race player a monkey. 
    
	The ban is imposed, the Indians threaten to pull out of the series. The ancient sporting rule is invoked by the ICC: Never let a controversy get in the way of profit margin. 
    
	Seeking to appease the infuriated tourists, umpire Steve Bucknor is sacked and Harbhajan is allowed to play on pending an appeal. Through news leakages we discover that Harbhajan, though he said not a word of this at the initial four-and-a-half hour hearing, has remembered that he was speaking Hindi at the time and now enters his new claim, the mother of all excuses. That is indeed one heck of a tweak. 
    
	Sport will not tolerate racism. The monkey had to go. Sport will, however, tolerate blatant sexism. Indeed, sexism offered up like a prize. It is quite a philosophical conundrum. 
    
	Abruptly, we have been halted in our smug female tracks. There we were imagining that all this work and ready meals were finally doing the trick. We were mounting the ramparts of equality. Even the MCC had consented to the disturbing rattle of jewellery and squirt of hairspray in the pavilion (and thats just the players going out to bat). 
    
	We had moved on. It was a new world. Four out of 10 households, we are told, now feature women bringing in the larger slab of the bacon. 
    
	It was all going so well. Then this Antipodean thunderbolt strikes and you realise that it is all, aptly, cosmetic. Governments like to pretend they are all for equality, businesses wouldnt dare say they are not. 
    
	But the world of sport strips away all edifice in the raw arena of combat (and courthouse). The central lie has been exposed. Women, there you were thinking you were more to cricket than mere slatherers of butter on the sandwiches, and now one of your number has been roped in  late in the day  to bear the brunt of an insult that might otherwise have been deemed offensive. 
    
	The offence to this dear lady is simply waved away, with the swish of a barristers silk handkerchief. 
    
	The central tenet of Harbhajans case is that he was disgracefully rude to a fellow cricketers mother. The whole cricketing world seems to be united in the view that this is such a minor infraction it can be viewed as a positive. No monkeys. Only mothers. All good. In fact, every one of them connected with the case, from the ICC chief executive, Malcolm Speed, to the lip-happy bowler himself, should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. And one can only hope their mothers let them know so at the earliest opportunity. 
    
	It seems, Mrs Symonds, we still have a way to go.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harmison joins ODI squad
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Harmison joins ODI squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Steve Harmison has been called up to the Englands one-day International squad after Ryan Sidebottom was on Thursday ruled out of the opening NatWest Series ODI owing to a groin injury.         
	According to information received here, Harmison has come out of ODI retirement to join the squad ahead of Fridays first encounter against South Africa at Headingley.         
	The Durham fast bowler announced his retirement from ODIs following the 2006-2007 Ashes in Australia and played his last ODI for England against Australia at the Champions Trophy in October, 2006.         
	Harmison said: After recently being asked by the England management to reassess my retirement Ive decided to join the ODI squad after careful consideration. Its something I have been thinking about for some time and due to recent injuries in the England camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series.         
	Meanwhile, South Africas Albie Morkel has been ruled out for the first ODI.         
	Morkel has been struggling with a shoulder injury that he picked up while playing club cricket prior to the tour. It has not responded as quickly to treatment as we had hoped, said captain Graeme Smith.         
	And we will have to make a decision on his prospects for the remainder of the series at the weekend, he said.

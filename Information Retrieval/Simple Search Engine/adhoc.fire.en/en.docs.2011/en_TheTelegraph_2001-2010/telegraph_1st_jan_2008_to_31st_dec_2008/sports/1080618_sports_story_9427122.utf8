The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trial to enhance game, says ICC
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Trial to enhance game, says ICC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday said that the decision to trial the umpire decision review system in this years Sri Lanka vs India Test series is an attempt by the ICC to further enhance the game at international level.         
	The system will see the fielding and batting side allowed three unsuccessful appeals to the umpire per innings to change a decision if it is perceived to have been incorrect.         
	These appeals can be made only by the batsman in receipt of the umpires original decision or the captain of the fielding side, in both cases by the player making a T sign with both forearms at shoulder height.         
	The on-field umpire will consult with the third umpire, who will review available television coverage of the incident before relaying fact-based information back to his colleague.         
	The on-field umpire will then deliver his decision either by raising his finger to indicate out or by crossing his hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his waist three times  as per a safe decision by an official in baseball.         
	ICCs David Richardson, a former Test and ODI player for South Africa, said:         
	 We want to see if we can enhance the game further by reducing or removing the few clearly incorrect ones.         
	Duleep Mendis, a former international captain welcomed the initiative.         
	I think this is a very good idea, he said. As a past player we used to say that good and bad decisions would even themselves out but times have changed, the stakes are much higher now for all concerned and if the technology is available then why not use it?         
	Slow-motion replays, the wicket-to-wicket mat, sound from stump microphones and ball-tracking technology up to the point of impact on the pad will be available for use by the television umpire.

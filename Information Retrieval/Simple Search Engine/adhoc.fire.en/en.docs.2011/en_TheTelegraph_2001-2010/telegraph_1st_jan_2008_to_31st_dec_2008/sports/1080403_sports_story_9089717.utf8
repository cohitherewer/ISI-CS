                                                                                                               Antonique may lift Donegal Cup
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Antonique, a failed-favourite in her last outing, is expected to make amends in the 1,100m Donegal Cup on Thursday. In her last outing the Vijay Singh-trained filly had finished a good second in spite of switching from Classic trips to a sprint. Neeraj Rawal partners the filly.

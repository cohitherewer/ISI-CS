            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: The competition is expected to be tough in Wednesdays seven-event race card. The feature event, the 1,200m Arcade Cup, bears a very open look with four horses  Cosmos, Supreme Attraction, Red Sails and Strengthto Succeed having the credentials to land the prize. Supreme Attraction and Strengthto Succeed are on the up while Cosmos and Red Sails have managed to bring their weights down. All of them have been well-prepared for the event but Cosmos appears to have edge over the rest in view of jockey Vicky Aharwals riding allowance of 5kg. Richard Alford will saddle the seven-year-old horse.

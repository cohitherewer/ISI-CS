The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela unhappy with casual approach
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mahela unhappy with casual approach
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene was not happy with the casual approach of his under-fire batsmen and said his side did not deserve to win the third one-dayer against India here.         
	I thought we were a bit casual in the game, we gave away a couple of soft wickets. I dont think we deserved to win the game because we made too many mistakes in the game especially with the bat, he said after their 33-run loss to trail the five match series 1-2.         
	The bowlers bowled really well upfront, picked up wickets and 225-235 is a good score to chase down. But we lost four wickets in 15 overs. From there it was a pretty uphill task, we came close but not good enough, added a dejected Jayawardene.         
	Jayawardene, however, is not losing hope in his batsmen and said they would not want to lose a series at home.         
	Every cricketer goes through a bit of hiccups in one or two games. But these are quality players, I am sure they will get back into form. Just need to find out how we can handle these situations bit better.         
	It is a tough position (after trailing 1-2) to be in but it is a good challenge for us. We know where we are going wrong and hopefully we can get it right, he added.         
	Jayawardene praised Thilan Thushara for his good show with the ball and the bat. He was happy with Thushara for showing signs of becoming a real all rounder.         
	We want him to be a good bowler but he is showing good quality with the bat as well. Lower down the order it will be very handy for us. If he can manage to be aggressive both with the ball and the bat that will be great. So, more matches these guys are playing they are going to be exposed to international cricket more, and they will learn more, he said.

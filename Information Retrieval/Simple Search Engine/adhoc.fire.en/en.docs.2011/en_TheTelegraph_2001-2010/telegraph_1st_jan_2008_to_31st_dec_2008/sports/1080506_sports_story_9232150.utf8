The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Expect fireworks from Shoaib

	It was a bad day in office Sunday. When the beginning of an innings is less than perfect, it can sometimes be difficult to rebuild, and that is what happened with us, particularly with Sohail Tanvir bowling a dream  or nightmare, depending on your point of view  spell. He exploited the seamer-friendly conditions perfectly, with the pitch offering both swing and bounce, and gave his team an ideal start. Parthiv Patel and I both got out playing across the line to in-cutters.         
	And then Shane Warne bowled a great spell to take out Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and it was only some good rearguard action from Suresh Raina and Albie Morkel that eventually got us to 109. But it was never going to be enough, even for someone like Muralidharan, who bowled a wonderful first over to Graeme Smith.         
	Speaking of bowlers, it is interesting to see how in week two of the competition, the bowlers have recovered to stage a fight back. So my bet is the totals will get lower and slightly more realistic as the format corrects itself, as it were. The bowlers have realised that they will have to work really hard to prevent the batsmen from running away with a game, and they have come up with some really fine performances in the past week.         
	I know there has been plenty of talk about how badly we are missing the Hayden-Hussey-Oram trio, but I dont think that is entirely the case.         
	I think it also has something to do with the law of averages, and we realise that a couple of good games will get us back into the reckoning for top spot. Just look at Mumbai Indians, who had such a poor start and who have now come into their own pretty strongly with that excellent win over the in-form Delhi DareDevils, who were on a red-hot streak.         
	So as I say, it is a matter of two games to reverse a winning or losing streak. What we are looking to do is to regain our position at or near the top of the table as soon as possible.         
	It is important not to lose confidence and focus, and not to buy into the reports that the prophets of doom are circulating.         
	As we go into our match against Hyderabad tomorrow, we have to remember that the Twenty20 format is all about playing smart and grabbing every opportunity  whether to score runs, or take a catch, or save a single.         
	As far as the other teams are concerned, its good news that Shoaib Akhtar has been cleared to play for Kolkata Knight Riders. So expect fireworks there!         
	Off the field, amid all the travelling and bonding, Ive been having a pretty good time, though unlike some of the other overseas players, I havent begun learning any Indian language yet. Time to brush up on the Tamil, you think?           GAMEPLAN

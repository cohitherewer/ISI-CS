The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randhawa looks to make it 3 in a row
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Randhawa looks to make it 3 in a row
  - INDIAN OPEN GOLF       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Daniel Chopra and Jeev Milkha Singh with the trophy on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa will be looking to make it three wins in a row when the $1m Hero Honda Indian Open tees off at the Delhi Golf Club (DGC) on Thursday.         
	Defending the crown on his favourite turf is not going to be easy and no one knows it better than Randhawa himself, who will be out there to emulate the feat of the Aussie legend, Peter Thomson, who bagged the title thrice in 1964, 1966 and 1976.         
	The 36-year-old Indian ace is expected to face a stiff challenge from some leading players, including Swede star Daniel Chopra, the winner of the Mercedes-Benz championship in Hawaii, and the Ginn Surmer Classic at Tesoro and in-form compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh, who is determined to win his first Open title at the DGC.         
	New Zealander Mark Brown will lead the Asian Tour charge to dethrone Randhawa, followed by Calcutta sensation S. S. P. Chowrasia, Chinas Liang Wen-chong, Australias Kane Webber, Thai star Thaworn Wiratchant and Singapores Mardan Mamat.         
	Aware of the strong field, Randhawa chose to take a cautious approach while talking about his prospect of notching up a hattrick.         
	The biggest hurdle is myself, the golf course and the elements. Daniel is a good player and Jeev is solid. So they will also pose a strong challenge, said the defending champion.         
	Every time you tee off, its a new game. I was doing well in the beginning of the season and then I was not doing too good in the mid-season. Its not been too consistent, Randhawa added.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, on the other hand, is eager to set the record straight on his home turf despite a nagging ankle injury.         
	The greens are rolling nicely and there are some good players this week with Jyoti and Daniel. It will be a fun week with a lot of depth in the field here, Jeev said on Wednesday.         
	I am still trying to learn the course. Ive played here many times, probably not as many as Chopra, but I am still not comfortable here. Its a challenging layout. I havent won a national Open and it would be great to do so, he remarked.         
	The Chandigarh-pro has won a European Tour and a Japan Tour event this season besides finishing tied fifth at the prestigious British Masters.         
	Chopra said the Delhi Golf Club always brings back his childhood memories. Its amazing to see how the course has changed. I remember celebrating my eighth birthday here. Winning here will be like realising a dream, he said.

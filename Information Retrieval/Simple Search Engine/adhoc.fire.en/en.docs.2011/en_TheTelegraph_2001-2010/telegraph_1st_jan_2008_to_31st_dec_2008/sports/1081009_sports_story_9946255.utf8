The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilip: Had asked Sourav to follow my example
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dilip: Had asked Sourav to follow my example
    - The day after the former team India captain he would quit           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Vengsarkar                                 
	Calcutta: Former chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar had, last month, suggested to Sourav Ganguly that he follow his (Vengsarkars) example while deciding on the road ahead.         
	Sourav and I had a pretty long chat after he hadnt been picked for the Irani Trophy... I said everybody who played first-class cricket stood a chance of being selected for India, but I also suggested he could follow my example... I retired not long after a big one for Mumbai... That was after my last tour (1991-92, Australia), Vengsarkar told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	A former captain himself, Vengsarkar played 116 Tests and 129 ODIs, with his first India appearance coming in 1975-76. He was around 36 (roughly the same age as Sourav) when he quit.         
	Asked whether not picking Sourav for the Irani Trophy had actually been influenced by certain observations from Team India coach Gary Kirsten and Test captain Anil Kumble, Vengsarkar replied: Thats past... I dont wish to say anything which could become controversial... In fact, I shouldnt be saying anything at all about what happened in the selection meetings...         
	A question mark over Souravs motivation after a poor series in Sri Lanka and a fall in his fitness standards were reasons which made Vengsarkar and Co. ignore Sourav for the Irani Trophy, a trial for the Australia series.         
	Despite that, the new selection committee headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth included Sourav, Indias most successful Test captain, in the XV for the first two Tests.         
	For his part, Vengsarkar added: I dont subscribe to the talk about a deal between Sourav and the Board... That he failed in Chennai, while playing for India A, may have convinced him to announce plans to retire... Top players value performances and Sourav falls in that bracket.         
	Incidentally, if not being picked for the Irani Trophy made Sourav decide to quit (after the Australia series), Vengsarkars brilliant 110 against the Rest of India in 1975-76 got him the India call-up.         
	That was in Nagpur, which should see the Sourav bow-out next month.         
	Look, Sourav and I were roommates on his  and my last  tour and weve always had a good relationship... He should leave with a hundred, in a blaze of glory... That will please all of us, Vengsarkar signed off.

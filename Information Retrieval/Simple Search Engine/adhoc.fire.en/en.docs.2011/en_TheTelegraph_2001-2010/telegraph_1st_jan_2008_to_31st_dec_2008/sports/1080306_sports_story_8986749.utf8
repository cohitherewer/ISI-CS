The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gillespie: Not end of   the world for us
                                                     Gillespie: Not end of   the world for us
  - Dhonis a fine captain and a very nice person, says recently retired quick       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jason Gillespie                                       
	Mumbai: Its not the end of the world for us In any case, rightly or wrongly, we tend to put more emphasis on Test cricket and we did win that series against India         
	Thats how the recently retired quick, Jason Gillespie, summed up Australias 0-2 loss at the hands of India in the best-of-three tri-series finals.         
	Gillespie, who spoke to The Telegraph on board Qantas nearly 13-hour Airbus 330-200 flight from Sydney on Wednesday, added: The Indians, of course, played better and deserved to win.         
	Asked to list the reasons for the world champions defeat, Gillespie replied: I havent given it much thought, to be honest, but Brad Hogg shouldve played at The Gabba (on Tuesday) I wouldnt have had an all-pace attack, relying on Michael Clarke to play the role of a specialist spinner         
	Did the rather needless controversies, surrounding Harbhajan Singh, affect Australia instead?         
	Look, youve got to put that question to those who played the tri-series I didnt have a problem with Harbhajan when I played against him, but I know that quite a few of our players just dont like him Ive really no idea why it became so hot this time I remember the 2001 series in India was fiercely fought, but we didnt have any incidents, Gillespie said.         
	He praised Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership. Dhonis a fine captain and a very nice person too He had a calming influence and, clearly, led very well.         
	While pointing out that hed been impressed by young Ishant Sharma (Indias most successful bowler in the tri-series with 14 wickets), Gillespie suggested that he build strength.         
	I hope too many people arent trying to offer him confusing advice He should be allowed to grow as a fast bowler, but hes definitely got to build strength That way, a heavy workload wont be an issue.         
	The flamboyant Gillespie himself had a number of injuries, otherwise his international career wouldve been much longer.         
	In 71 Tests, Gillespie took 259 wickets. He also played 97 ODIs (142 victims). His last appearance for Australia was in the April 2006 Test in Chittagong.         
	Hes only 32, by the way, but remarked that his time as an Australian cricketer was up and, so, quitting wasnt difficult.         
	Gillespie is in India to take part in the rebel Indian Cricket League. Im playing for the Ahmedabad Rockets, but dont think I ever played there during my days as an Australia cricketer, he quipped.         
	Some of those wholl be turning out in the Board-approved Indian Premier League could be saying the same thing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka to focus on basics
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lanka to focus on basics
  - Asia Cup Battle for supremacy begins today               Yuvraj Singh, Manpreet Singh Gony, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag during practice in Karachi on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Karachi: Determined to defend the Asia Cup title, Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene on Monday asked his team to quickly switch over from Twenty20 mode to the one-day Internationals here.         
	We are professional cricketers and we need to have the ability to switch to any form of the game  be it Test, one-day or Twenty20 cricket. Playing for your country is a big incentive, he told at a press conference in Lahore.         
	I dont think it is difficult to play the Asia Cup especially being motivated after something like the Indian Premier League (IPL). In fact, there are a lot of good things and positives one can take from the IPL And use it for good effect in this tournament, the captain said.         
	Jayawardene made it clear that his team would not take any side lightly and would try to give their best in each match.         
	We are the defending champions and this is the biggest event of sub-continental cricket. So we are here with a clear mind. We are going to take every match as it comes and award respect to every team, he said ahead of his teams opening game against United Arab Emirates (UAE).                     
	Jayawardene said his team had not been doing badly in one-day cricket since making the World Cup final last year and the Asia Cup was an ideal platform for them to re-discover their winning touch.         
	Since the World Cup, Sri Lanka have won only eight out of their 22 one-day Internationals and have a new coach in Trevor Bayliss.         
	Three of the wins have come against Bangladesh at home.         
	We just need to get our basics right and be more consistent. We have a good side, getting things right and planning well ahead.         
	We know this is going to be a tough event with teams like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh ahead of us, he said.         
	Bayliss said he was prepared for some good matches, as the pitches in Pakistan traditionally are good for batting.         
	But we have two very good spinners in our line up Muralitharan and Mendis, so we are prepared for anything, he said. (PTI)

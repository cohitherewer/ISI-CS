  - Bengal ahead by 32 runs with five wickets in hand at the end of day I       OUR CORRESPONDENT              Ranadeb Bose celebrates with teammates after picking up a wicket in Guwahati on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Guwahati: Bengal gained the upper hand after bundling out hosts Assam for a paltry 86 in the first innings on the first day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Plate Group B match at the NF Railway Stadium in Maligaon here on Friday.         
	Assam, however, came back well to reduce the visitors to 118 for five at draw of stumps. It would take some inspired performance from the hosts on Saturday for them to remain in the game. Assam looked all at sea against their rivals strong pace attack, comprising Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Avik Chowdhury, after electing to bat.         
	It was the seasoned Ranadeb who stole the limelight at Maligaon, ripping apart the Assam top order with a devastating nine-over opening spell  his only spell in the innings  to finish with five for 10.         
	Dinda returned figures of three for 41 and Avik took one for seven when the Assam innings folded half an hour into the post-lunch session. Left arm spinner Iresh Saxena scalped one for 13. Bengal fielded Iresh as an additional spinner replacing Sourav Sarkar, on a track known to assist spinners from day two onwards.         
	Ranadeb struck off his very first delivery dislodging the stumps of opener Palash Jyoti Das, which incidentally was also Assams third consecutive first-ball duck of the season. Nishanta Bordoloi against Madhya Pradesh and Pritam Debnath against Vidarbha were the others to fall off the first ball.         
	Ranadeb also accounted for opener Mrigen Talukdar and skipper Rashmi Ranjan Parida, both caught behind, before trapping Martin and Swarupam Purkayastha leg before off successive deliveries to reduce Assam to 15 for five in the 13th over.         
	The home side were tottering at 43 for eight when Arlen Konwar (8) mistimed Iresh to be caught by Rohan Banerjee at second slip off the first delivery of the 30th over.         
	However, wicketkeeper-batsman Kunal Saikia (31), who top-scored for his side, with five boundaries off 52 deliveries, tried to rebuild the innings with a patient 38-run ninth wicket partnership with Anand Katti (8). Allrounder Dhiraj Goswami (17, 4x2) was the only other Assam batsman to reach double figures while P.J. Das, Parida and Purkayastha were out for nought.         
	Assams decision to bat first against the Bengal attack left everybody surprised.         
	The visitors too had a shaky start losing quick wickets to an effective spell by seasoned left-arm spinner Anand Katti who notched up three for 44 off 14 overs. His wickets included the prized scalp of skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla (0), whom the bowler caught off his own bowling.         
	It was the in-form Manoj Tiwary and wicketkeeper-batsman Wridhiman Saha (28, 4x3) who tried to rebuild the innings with a fifth wicket partnership of 57 runs before the latter was caught by Parida off a Purkayastha turner when the scoreboard read 99 in the 36th over.         
	Tiwary was batting on 40 (4x1) with Avik Chowdhury keeping him company on 12 (4x1) at close of play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New order poses stiff challenge

    - Monfils, Djokovic looking to derail the Grand Slam kings                 Rafael Nadal                           
	Paris: With a reputation of being the practical joker on tour, Novak Djokovic would be hoping to have the last laugh when he faces three-time champion Rafael Nadal in the French Open semi-finals on Friday.         
	Ranked second and third in the world, Nadal and Djokovic had expected to run into each other but in the other semi-final, world No.1 Roger Federer would be facing an unexpected adversary in the shape of 59th-ranked Frenchman Gael Monfils.         
	Like a runaway bulldozer, Nadal has flattened anyone and anything that has come in his way at Roland Garros this year. He has made no allowances for reputations as he extended his perfect record at the clay court major to 26-0.         
	Fellow clay loving Spaniard Nicolas Almagro was supposed to have provided Nadal with a decent test of his credentials in their last-eight showdown. Instead, Nadal reacted by pulverising Almagro 6-1, 6-1, 6-1, thus winning the most lopsided mens quarter final at Roland Garros in the 40-year history of professional tennis.         
	If that was not enough, Nadal has dropped only 25 games en route  the fewest number dropped by a man reaching the semi-final of a Grand Slam. But he was not about to become complacent. If Im not playing my 100 percent, then its going to be very difficult for me to win this match against Djokovic, so I need to play my 100 percent, said Nadal, whose No.2 ranking would also be on the line.The warning signs are loud and clear for Djokovic.         
	 Hes been playing better and better. Hes improved the serve a lot this year, on clay especially, and hes going for shots much more. Its impressive, said the Australian Open champion, whose last two runs in Paris were stalled by Nadal.         
	But I dont want to go out there into the semis and just try my best. I dont want to do that. I want to win. Djokovic has provided relief over the past two years by impersonating his fellow professionals on court but during his stay in Paris, his focus has been on getting his hands on the Musketeers Cup.         
	Of course, hes a favourite and all the credit to that. But only with a positive attitude and approach in the match I can get the positive outcome, said Djokovic, whose clay court record against the Spaniard stands at 0-4. While Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lit up Melbourne with his surprise run to the final, Monfil has taken over the baton in Paris.         
	To the delight of the passionate home fans and on the 25th anniversary of Yannick Noahs triumph here, the gangly Monfils has at long last reached his first Grand Slam semi-final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United SC go down 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     United SC go down 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goa continued their domination of the I-League with a 1-0 victory over United SC in a sixth round match that was marred by a 27-minute power-cut at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday evening.         
	Joseph Pereira scored the all-important goal for the Goan outfit in the 73rd minute. Harmanjot Khabras cross from the right was deflected off United SC custodian Gopal Das and fell to an unmarked Joseph who made no mistakes in shooting it home.         
	The Goans thus remained on top of the table with 15 points from six matches while Subrata Bhattacharjees men, who will be ruing missed chances, sank to the bottom with five points from six encounters.         
	Earlier, the first-half witnessed a balanced game. Though Sporting dominated the initial play, the city side too started making back-to-back forays as the game progressed.         
	The Goans with Amos and Junior Obagbemiro up front missed a ripe opportunity in the 7th minute  thanks to a brilliant save by Gopal Das. Six minutes later United SC came close to scoring  but Bidemi Daniels ambitious attempt flew over the target.

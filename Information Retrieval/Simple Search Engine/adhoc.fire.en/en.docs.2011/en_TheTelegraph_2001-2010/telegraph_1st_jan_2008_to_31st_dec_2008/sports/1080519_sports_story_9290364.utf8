The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India lose in final 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India lose in final 
                      
	Ipoh: Mario Almada struck a golden goal as a spirited India suffered a narrow 1-2 defeat to Argentina in the final of the Azlan Shah Cup on Sunday.         
	Sandeep Singhs 10th minute penalty corner conversion put India ahead but veteran Almada led Argentinas fightback with a brace in the 14th and 73rd minutes to help his side clinch the championship.         
	India can leave the tournament with the silver medal and heads held high as they showcased a brilliant turnaround to win four matches in a row after two defeats to book a berth in the final after a huge gap of 12 years.         
	The clash was a keenly contested and ill-tempered encounter that went down to the wire before being decided through Almadas golden goal in extra-time.         
	From the beginning both Argentine wingers worked overtime, giving the Indian defenders some jittery moments. But Diwakar Ram and Sandeep warded off the initial forays and goalkeeper Adrian DSouza came up with some scintillating saves to deny their rivals any early advantage.

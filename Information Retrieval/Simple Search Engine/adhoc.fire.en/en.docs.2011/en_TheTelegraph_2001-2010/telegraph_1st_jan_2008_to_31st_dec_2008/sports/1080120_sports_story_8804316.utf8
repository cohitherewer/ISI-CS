                                                   Sreesanth set for comeback

      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Perth: The two selectors on duty here, Venkatapathi Raju and Ranjib Biswal, were to have met ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the others on Saturday, but the win at the Waca has forced a change. 
    
	Apparently, they will now only meet on Sunday morning, some hours before the squad for the tri-series (and the one-off Twenty20 against Australia) is picked. 
    
	It seems Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Wasim Jaffer will have to head home. Possibly either Vikram Rajvir Singh or Pankaj Singh as well. Could even be both. 
    
	Anil Kumble has, of course, retired from ODIs. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Gautam Gambhir, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Murali Kartik and Sreesanth look certain to be selected. 
    
	Piyush Chawla and Manoj Tiwary could come into the reckoning as also Munaf Patel. 
    
	Meanwhile, as consultant Gary Kirsten will be involved with the teams preparations, his views too are likely to be taken into account.

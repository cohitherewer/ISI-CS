	Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne has heaped praise on youngsters Ravindra Jadeja and Dinesh Salunkhe, saying they are superstars of the future.         
	Believe me, with the kind of talent Ravindra and Dinesh have shown, they are going to be superstars in the near future, the Australian spin legend said after the six-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League on Monday.         
	We had spotted Jadeja right from the beginning and he has shown his mettle in the first two matches, Warne, who also doubles up as coach of his team, said.         
	Jadeja smashed a vital 25-ball 36 against an attack consisting of Brett Lee, Sreesanth, James Hopes and Irfan Pathan.         
	Earlier, Salunkhe, a spinner gave away 20 runs in his two overs but claimed the prize scalp of Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene.         
	MoM Watson, too, was all praise for Jadeja. He hit a great bowler like Brett Lee nonchalantly and it speaks volumes about his talent. (PTI)

	Bristol: Teenager Tim Southee took four wickets to lead New Zealand to a 22-run win against England in the third ODI on Saturday.         
	New Zealand had appeared to be heading for a comprehensive defeat earlier after they slumped to 49 for five but after taking 50 runs from their last five overs to reach 182 all out, Southee ripped through Englands middle-order.         
	He returned career best one-day figures of four for 38 as the home team were bowled out for 160 with 22 balls left.         
	Paul Collingwood top scored for England with 34. The teams are now all square at 1-1 in the five-match series after England won at Durham and the no result at Edgbaston. The next match is at The Oval on Wednesday.         
	It was Southee, 19, who turned the game with a three-wicket burst for no runs as England slumped from 62 for two to 64 for six.         
	That passage of play ultimately cost England their opportunity to go 2-0 up.         
	Southee removed Ravi Bopara, Owais Shah and Tim Ambrose in the space of eight balls and England never recovered from his deadly spell.         
	England failed to gain any momentum from the outset, losing opener Luke Wright to the fourth ball of their innings and Kevin Pietersen followed in the fifth over.

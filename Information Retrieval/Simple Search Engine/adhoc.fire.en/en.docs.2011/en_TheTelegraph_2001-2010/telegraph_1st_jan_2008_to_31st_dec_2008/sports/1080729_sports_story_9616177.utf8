                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vote for my team, urges Mukherjee
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: The ruling group of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) spent the entire day at the Eden Gardens on Monday, 24 hours before the D Day, claiming to have completed their campaigning the day before. Time will tell if it was a sign of confidence or resignation to fate.         
	The office-bearers sat down for a closed-door meeting in president Prasun Mukherjees office in the evening, which lasted for two-and-a-half hours.         
	Treasurer Tushar Sarkar, who was the first to walk into the CAB among the ruling group, also made final preparations regarding the accounts to be presented in the AGM.         
	Meanwhile, court-appointed observer Justice Santosh Kumar Phoujdar paid a brief visit to the BC Roy Club House to take note of the arrangements and discussed the procedure of Tuesdays AGM. Both Mukherjee and Jagmohan Dalmiya, candidates for the presidents post, were present.         
	It has also been decided that the new CAB working committee will be selected rather than being elected.         
	Addressing the media, Mukherjee said he was quite confident of winning the elections along with his panel, but declined to comment on the numbers he had with him. I have asked everybody to vote for the whole panel. If you are voting for the president, you should also vote for his team, otherwise its of no use. How will I work? he said.         
	According to sources, the ruling group is banking heavily on the votes from the districts and the universities. They, however, do not enjoy much support from the first-division clubs.         
	The former Calcutta police commissioner also said that he had asked his group to stress on their achievements in the election campaign. The rapport the ruling camp enjoys with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has also been stressed upon in the campaign.         
	We have done our bit and I believe we have done a good job. Now its up to the voters to decide, Mukherjee remarked.         
	Asked what the BCCIs role has been in the elections, Mukherjee said that the board has been regularly in touch.         
	They are not involved directly But of course the BCCI has been in touch. Everyday they call and tell me that they want me to win, Mukherjee told The Telegraph.         
	The ruling president also said that he personally did not agree with the cancellation of Malda DSAs Subhasish Sarkars nomination.         
	I personally do not agree with the rejection of Sarkars nomination. But the observers decision is final and I am okay with it, he said.

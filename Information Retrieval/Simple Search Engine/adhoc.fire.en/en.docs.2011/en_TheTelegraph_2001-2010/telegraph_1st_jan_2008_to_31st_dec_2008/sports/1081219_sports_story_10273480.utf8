	Calcutta: Dempo SC outplayed Churchill Brothers and beat them 2-0 to qualify for the finals of the 30th Federation Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	Ranty Martins put the Dempo ahead, converting a 13th minute penalty while Clifford Miranda broke clear to finish with a cool header in the 58th minute to take Dempo to the finals for the fourth time.         
	After an aggressive start, Dempo earned the penalty when Churchill Brothers medio Kalu N. Ogba handled a Anthony Pereira lob inside the box. Ranty foxed Arindam Bhattacharya to find the net with a low shot to his left.         
	The Nigerian, however, found one of his earlier attempts well thwarted by the Churchill keeper. A defensive lapse outside the box, and the opportunistic Ranty unleashed a left-footer that needed an alert Arindam to keep it out.         
	Luck had abandoned Churchill Brothers in the very early minutes of the match. Warun Deep, Govin Moirangthem, Gourmangi Moirangthem and Robert Lalthlamvana in the mid-field were uncharacteristically lax.         
	And their rivals built on this opportunity. Defensively too, Dempo put up a great show. An impressive Mahesh Gawli cut down Odafe Okolie, marking the Churchill striker closely.         
	The match came to a five-minute standstill when Ranty Martins and Kalu N. Ogba collided head on while going for the ball. Both fell on the ground and were taken to the hospital.         
	While Peter Carvalho came in for Ranty, Joseph Daniel Martins Louis replaced Kalu.

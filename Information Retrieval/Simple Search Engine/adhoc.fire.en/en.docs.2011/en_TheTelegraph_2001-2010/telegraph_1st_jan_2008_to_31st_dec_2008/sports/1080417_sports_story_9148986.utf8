	Castries (St Lucia): Persistent rain stopped the third and final one-day International between the West Indies and Sri Lanka with the match evenly poised.         
	The home team was 81 for two off 18.2 overs, chasing Sri Lankas 257 for eight in 50, when showers swept across Beausejour Stadium and caused the abandonment of the match and a no result on Tuesday.         
	West Indies sealed the three-match series 2-0 following victories last Thursday and Saturday in Trinidad.         
	Opener Sewnarine Chattergoon topscored for the West Indies with 46.         
	Mahela Udawatte and Tillakaratne Dilshan hit half-centuries to lead Sri Lankas effort.         
	Captain Chris Gayle led the home side with two for 41 off 10 overs before he tumbled in the field and limped off with a suspected groin strain.         
	Daren Powell took two for 50 on his 30th birthday while Dwayne Bravo claimed two for 67.         
	West Indies began strongly after Gayle won his third straight toss and again inserted the Sri Lankans.         
	The visitors slumped to 44 for three after 12 overs with the seasoned trio of Kumar Sangakkara (1), captain Mahela Jayawardene (17) and Chamara Silva (6) back in the pavilion.         
	The 21-year-old Udawatte, in his first international series, completed his maiden half century off 87 balls.         
	Kapugedara hit two fours off 52 balls before Gayle claimed a simple return catch to halt the partnership.           (AP)

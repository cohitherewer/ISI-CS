	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday got a nod of approval for their security arrangements for the Asia Cup from Indian team manager Arindam Ganguly. Ganguly also played down security fears expressed by New Zealand and Australia about coming to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in September.         
	Pakistan clearly have a good cricketing environment and I think the security arrangements are also good. We are not concerned with this aspect as it is well taken care off, he said during the Indian teams practice session at the National Bank Complex. We are very happy to be in Pakistan for this tournament and we are enjoying ourselves and feeling at home. The hospitality is good, he said.

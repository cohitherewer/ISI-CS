	New Delhi: S.S.P. Chowrasia moved up more than 200 rungs to be 161 in the latest world golf rankings. He has also leapfrogged to the top of the Asian Tour Order of Merit.         
	Chowrasia, who was ranked 388 last week, had a meteoric rise in the rankings following his triumph in the Indian Masters at the Delhi Golf Club on Sunday.         
	Jyoti Randhawa remained the highest-ranked Indian at 85, despite his poor tied 22nd finish here.         
	Fellow European Tour regular Jeev Milkha Singh, who could not make the cut in the first European Tour event in the country, slipped to 93.         
	Among other Indians, veteran Gaurav Ghei, thanks to his tied sixth finish, rose to 212, while Shiv Kapur was ranked 263rd.         
	Chowrasias stunning victory also propelled him to the top of the 2008 Asian Tours Order of Merit.         
	Incidentally, the Asian Tour Order of Merit top 10 features five Indians with Chowrasia ($ 416,660), Digvijay ($ 115,500) and Ghei ($ 66,200) occupying the top three slots.         
	Atwal ($ 34,500) ranks fifth, while Randhawa ($ 26,000) is seventh in the list.         
	Asian Tour executive chairman Kyi Hla Han lauded Chowrasias breakthrough victory, saying that it would boost the game in India.         
	The Asian Tour couldnt have asked for a better champion to emerge in our first tournament of the 2008 season. Chowrasia will serve as a wonderful inspiration to Indian golf as he has proven that hard work and dedication can lead to great things and success, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Away with away goals: Wenger
                                                                                                                                                                                             Away with away goals: Wenger

	The Arsenal manager revealed the topic was under discussion at a Uefa managers meeting attended by the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho in Vienna last week, although no conclusion could be reached.         
	The law was introduced 42 years ago in a bid to entice defensively-minded travelling sides to attack in the away legs of European ties. But Wenger, and many of his managing peers, feel the rule is no longer relevant or effective.         
	He said: The weight of this goal in the tactical approach to games is too much.         
	It was brought in when teams just defended when they were abroad because it was much more frightening to travel. You didnt know what to expect. Now, if you play at home and do not concede, it is a good result. The situation is reversed. We discussed it at the managers meeting and some wanted to keep it, some wanted to move forward.         
	I feel it would be a better balance just to use it in extra time, like they do in the Carling Cup. Should the Frenchman succeed in sending the away goals rule the way of the back-pass, he would gladly consign the increasingly litigious nature of the game to footballs history books too.         
	Wenger fears West Ham and Sheffield Uniteds seemingly endless court battle over the Carlos Tevez affair sets a dangerous precedent and he urged clubs not to take football issues to the civil courts.         
	He said: In sport we rely on quick decisions but we are still talking about Tevez two years later. It is important that the power remains within the game. All the clubs agree not to challenge the rulings of the governing bodies. While I have my differences with them, it is dangerous for football if they do not have control.         
	Away from such cerebral matters, Wenger faces a more immediate challenge in negotiating a Champions League group he admits is the toughest his side have ever faced.         
	A late equaliser in Kiev snatched a draw with Dynamo but Wenger knows his young team cannot afford to drop any points at home, starting with Porto on Tuesday night.         
	He said: We know you go through with 10 points, so you must win your home games. It is a very even group, with no easy teams. And it is very hard for us to win away from home when we have a team like the one that we put out in Kiev, with so many players who are 19, 20 or 21.         
	Meanwhile, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has warned his European champions their crown could slip if they drop more points against Bruce Riochs Aalborg in Denmark on Tuesday.         
	Ferguson said: We always try to get to that 10 points and qualify as quickly as we can.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

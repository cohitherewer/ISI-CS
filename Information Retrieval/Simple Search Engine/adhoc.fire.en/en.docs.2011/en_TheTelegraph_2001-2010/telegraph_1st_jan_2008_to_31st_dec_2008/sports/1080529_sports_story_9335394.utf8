The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods return at US Open 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woods return at US Open 
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Washington: Tiger Woods is set to make his comeback at the next months US Open even though his recovery from a knee operation has sorely tested his patience, the world No.1 said on Tuesday.         
	The 32-year-old American had hoped to play in this weeks Memorial tournament in Dublin, Ohio, an event that he has won three times, but decided he was not ready. The knee is doing better, said Woods at a news conference in Bethesda. The rehab is working. Im just trying to get this thing organised for the Open and Im right on schedule.         
	Asked about his pain, Woods said, I wouldnt say its pain-free. It is stiffer than anything, trying to get the muscle to fire back and get those things developing again.         
	The 13-time major champion had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on April 15.         
	The main thing right now is keeping my endurance up but its hard to be patient. I always want to go all out. Sometimes it is hard for me not to do that but youve got to be smart about it and Ive done that.         
	Woods also said his game was not sharp enough for this weeks Memorial hosted by Jack Nicklaus. I started my practice just recently and therefore going to the Memorial that rusty, it wouldnt have made any sense, he said. I didnt hit all my shots I needed to hit yet ... and make sure everything is organised. I wasnt quite ready and there is no sense in going there not ready. The whole idea is to be ready for the US Open. (Reuters)

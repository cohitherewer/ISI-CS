            Beijing bites          
	The Olympic hierarchy will soon find themselves the subject of a lawsuit after banning Ekaterini Thanou from running in the 100 metres. The potential for embarrassment or worse was made clear when the Greeks lawyer stated: I will leave no stone unturned until I bring these people to justice. The IOC executive board decided Sunday that it was not obliged to let Thanou, who has served a ban for missing three drugs tests, compete in Beijing. Giselle Davies, the IOC director of communications, said: There were a whole string of events in this sorry tale and these resulted in a scandalous saga that overshadowed the Athens Games. Those events included an alleged motorcycle crash, the arrest of seven doctors for making false statements and a continuing perjury case against Thanou and Konstantinos Kenteris. However, Thanou is refusing to go quietly and her lawyer, Dr Gregory Ionnidis, has launched a scathing counter-attack on the IOC. There are rules in this society and no one is above the law, he said.  
	Ana pulls out  
	Top seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia withdrew from the Olympic tennis event on Sunday with an injury to her right thumb. Ivanovic, who will be replaced by fellow Serb Jelena Jankovic at the top of the world rankings on Monday, said she had not been able to practise since arriving in China. She said she sustained the injury when she returned to training after losing at Wimbledon.  
	Sporting truce  
	Russia and Georgia, waging a bloody conflict in Central Europe, called a truce at the Olympics today when two of their competitors wrapped themselves in an emotionally-charged medals podium embrace. The incident happened after the final of the womens 10m air pistol shooting event where Natalia Paderina of Russia took silver ahead of Georgias Nino Salukvadze, who took bronze.   
	Coghlan rsquo;s excuse  
	Irelands former world athletics champion Eamonn Coghlan has revealed how his despair at missing out on an Olympic medal lead him to consider doping. The 1983 world champion over 5000 metres admitted being tempted to take drugs when he was 35-years-old, at a time when, he claims, many athletes believed that you had to use drugs in order to win an Olympic medal.  
	Lucky name  
	 Thai weightlifter Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon not only has one of the longest names of the Olympics, but also one of the luckiest. A fortune-telling nun advised the 24-year-old last year to change her name from Chanpim Kantatian to improve her luck, and the charm seems to have worked  Prapawadee won her first Olympic gold medal in the womens 53kg class on Sunday.

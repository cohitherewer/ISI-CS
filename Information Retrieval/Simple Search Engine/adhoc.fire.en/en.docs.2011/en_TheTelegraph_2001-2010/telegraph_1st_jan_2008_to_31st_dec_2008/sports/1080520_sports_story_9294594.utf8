                                                                                                                                                                                                     Owners can cheer from dugout: IPL
                      
	Mumbai: A day after Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan was asked to stay away from his teams dressing room, the Indian Premier League authorities Monday issued fresh guidelines which has cleared the decks for the presence of a franchise owner in the team dugout for the Twenty20 matches.         
	IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi announced that the organisers would issue an all-area accreditation badge to one member of each of the eight team franchises, following the warning to Shah Rukh by the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) officials of the International Cricket Council.         
	While defending the decision of the ACSU officials to ask the superstar to vacate the dugout during the tie between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings at the Eden, Modi said suitable measures would be taken to avoid a repeat of this incident.         
	There have been reports in the media about denial of a team owner access to the dugout and dressing room. The IPL is conducted as per the rules and regulations of the ICC whose ACSU officials were just doing the job entrusted, Modi said.         
	They go strictly by the colour code. A red badge issued by the ACSU, on approval of the team manager, will help the person holding it access to all areas, he said.         
	Modi said since this was the first year of the IPL they were still learning the ropes. If we make mistakes we are willing to set them right. This is the first year of IPL.         
	We had already provided such badges to Preity Zinta (owner of Kings XI Punjab) and Vijay Mallya (owner of Bangalore Royal Challengers) as we had received such a request from them in advance, Modi said.         
	The team owners have the right to be with the team at all times, he added.         
	Modi also said that each team, in addition, would get four visitors passes with the condition that the holder of that badge, one at a time, can sit with the team members during the match for a maximum of 15 minutes.         
	Earlier, ICC expressed surprised at Shah Rukhs statement that he had been ejected by ACSU personnel.         
	The reported incident has nothing to do with the ICC as IPL is a domestic tournament which is being held under the rules and regulations of the BCCI, an ICC spokesman said. (PTI)

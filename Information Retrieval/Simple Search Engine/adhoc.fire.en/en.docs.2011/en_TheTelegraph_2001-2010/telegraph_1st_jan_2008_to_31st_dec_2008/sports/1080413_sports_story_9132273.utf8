The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One of my best Test knocks: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       One of my best Test knocks: Sourav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT    
	Kanpur: Sourav Ganguly would like to rate his knock (87) on Saturday as one of his best in Tests. But the 51 in Johannesburg in his comeback Test would still remain his best innings, the former India captain told reporters at the end of Day II on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Rating this knock         
	In terms of pressure, the one in Johannesburg is the best  since I was coming back and in terms of difficulty of surface. But this one is one of my top five Test knocks, considering the surface.         
	Your predictions for Day III         
	Lets see what happens. We are about 20 runs ahead but on this surface you never know whats going to happen. If the spinners bowl well and we get early wickets, then there are some possibilities. We need to restrict them to 150.         
	Indias chances         
	Today we played Harris well But we felt the ball may spin more in the second innings If we bowl well in third innings we have a chance.         
	Will the seamers be threatening?         
	One needs to stop worrying If it goes off it goes off Just have to play on the merit of the ball and be a bit lucky.         
	Days proceedings         
	Batting on this pitch was really difficult and the South African bowlers were also quick We batted well to get to 288.         
	Getting out on 87 again         
	I am very, very disappointed. I got out for 87 quite a few times Must be a mental problem.         
	Game plan before taking guard?         
	I decided to be positive, go out and hit if the ball was there to be hit. The key was to keep the scoreboard moving I decided to stay positive. I played my game         
	What would be a handy lead?         
	If Sreesanth and Ishant can do some magic on Sunday it will be great Somehow we need to get to a 50-run lead and pick up early wickets.         
	Dhonis captaincy         
	I dont want to rate anyones captaincy. Hope we win this game.         
	On batsmen throwing their wickets         
	I dont think anyone did. None of the batsmen threw it away We batted well to get to 288 on this surface.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Williams, Jankovic make it a Super Six at US Open
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Williams, Jankovic make it a Super Six at US Open
    - The thinnest resume in the bunch belongs to Andy Murray           Chuck Culpepper                            
	New York: What the US Open lacks in charm, it often counterbalances with gravitas, true again this promising tennis weekend.         
	Only tropical storm Hannas outer rains might disrupt the transcendent match-ups, and theres always a chance that even she might take one look at Rafael Nadal and run cowering back to the ocean.         
	Twelve days of the usual mayhem have seen No. 1 Ana Ivanovic bowing out and wondering, Juan Martin Del Potro finally losing after 23 consecutive wins and sobbing, the Bryan twins claiming a sixth Grand Slam doubles title and hugging, and whats left qualifying as pretty riveting.         
	With Serena Williams versus Jelena Jankovic, Roger Federer versus Novak Djokovic and Nadal versus Andy Murray, the six players in the mens semi-finals and womens final have such distinction that the thinnest resume in the bunch belongs to Murray.         
	Thats the Murray enjoying a breakthrough summer, the Murray wholl rise to No. 4 in the world come next week, the Murray who beat Djokovic to win the ATP Masters Series Cincinnati event, the Murray whose hardcourt comfort and brazen demeanour peg the US Open as the Grand Slam hes most likely to win.         
	Its the Murray who said he didnt just come for the semi-finals and said: I think how you do in Slams is how youre remembered in tennis.         
	And its the Murray of whom his opponent, No. 1 Nadal, conqueror of Murray three times this year including Wimbledon, said: Im not playing against a guy whose ranking is 50 and for him being in the semi-finals is unbelievable, no? Andy, when I come here, for sure he know he can be in the semi-finals and he can win the title, no? So going to be nothing strange for him, no?         
	Thats the worst theyve got left here.         
	On a womens tour in a tepid year, Williams versus Jankovic for the final Grand Slam rates dreamy only partly because the winner will ascend to No. 1 next week.         
	Its also the introduction of Jankovic and her ready smile to a Grand Slam final audience after two years spent banging hard on the door and losing in four other semi-finals before she finally edged Elena Dementieva, 6-4, 6-4, on Friday and cried.         
	And its also the reintroduction of Williams as a mainstay in her second straight Grand Slam final. Ive been saying I feel like I just started again, like I just feel so excited to be out there for every match, she said after a 6-3, 6-2 mastery of both the swirling winds and the worlds hottest player since May, Dinara Safina.         
	Here she stands one win from returning to No. 1 for the first time since the middle of 2003 and, asked if she ever doubted shed return to the perch, shes saying: Absolutely not.         
	I feel like Venus was playing the best in this tournament, Serena said. I felt like she had a chance to win, and maybe she even would have won. Obviously I would like to do what I think she would have done. But at the same time, I dont want to put too much pressure on myself.         
	Federer claims likewise even  or maybe especially  from the No. 2 spot after 239 weeks at No. 1 that concluded in mid-August. Given his sub-Federer form, and his Australian Open semi-final loss to Djokovic, many consider Djokovic the favourite, a matter from which Federer derives zero motivation.         
	I mean, I guess some players get a kick out of that and want to prove people wrong and stuff, he said. I mean, Im not that type of person, you know, to go through life just wanting to, you know, prove myself.         
	As Federer has climbed back from mononucleosis and sagged by his Herculean standard in a Grand Slam year that actually rates among the best in mens tennis history  semi-final-final-final  Djokovic has gone about accruing more huge-point experience.         
	The last three matches have been extremely difficult for me... , Djokovic said. Im maturing more and more. You know, I know what I need to play in the certain moments and important moments.         
	That rare knack could be said of all the last six.

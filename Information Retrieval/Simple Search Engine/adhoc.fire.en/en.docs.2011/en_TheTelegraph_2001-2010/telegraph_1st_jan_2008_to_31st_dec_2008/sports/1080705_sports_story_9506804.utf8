The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashraf puts up brave face
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ashraf puts up brave face
                      
	Karachi: PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf allayed all fears about the Champions Trophy being shifted out of Pakistan in September.         
	It gives me great pleasure to say that the Champions Trophy will be held as per schedule in Pakistan. And by successfully hosting the current Asia Cup and addressing all security concerns, we have sent a message across that Pakistan is safe and we are all looking forward to the tournament, Ashraf told a news conference on Friday.         
	As for the ICC keeping a back-up venue (South Africa), it is part of their rules and in case they did not do it they would have violated their own rules. It is like keeping a reserve day for a final, Ashraf said.         
	The fact that we have heads of the Australian and England boards coming over to attend the ACC ceremony Saturday shows where we stand, he stated. Dismissing talks about sacking Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and coach Geoff Lawson after the teams dismal show in the ongoing Asia Cup, Ashraf said that the young side need support of the people. He made it clear that both the captain and the coachs performances would be closely monitored.

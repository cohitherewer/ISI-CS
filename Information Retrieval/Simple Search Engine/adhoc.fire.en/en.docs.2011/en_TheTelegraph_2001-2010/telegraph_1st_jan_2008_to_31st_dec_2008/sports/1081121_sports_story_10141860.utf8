	Islamabad: Pakistan Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on Thursday said he would personally request the Indian government to send its national cricket team for a tour early next year even as security fears are threatening to derail the trip.         
	The chances of India coming to Pakistan depend on the clearance of their government, which recently refused to send their junior hockey team across the border for a Test series on security grounds.         
	[The Telegraph had reported in Wednesdays edition that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would move on multiple fronts to ensure that the tour goes ahead as scheduled. Also, that the first move would be at the governmental level.]         
	The Prime Ministers assurance came during a meeting with the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt, who apprised Gilani about the situation regarding Indias tour.         
	In a meeting with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt, Gilani said as cricket was loved by the people of both countries, he would personally request the Indian Prime Minister to allow Indian team to visit Pakistan, an official statement said.         
	The Prime Minister said that the Indian government would be provided assurances on security concerns.         
	The Indian team is scheduled to arrive in January next year to play three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match in Pakistan.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India crush Mexico 18-1
                                                     India crush Mexico 18-1
                  Rajpal Singh scored six goals                     
	Santiago: India maintained their goal-scoring spree and hammered Mexico 18-1 for their third consecutive win in the Olympic hockey qualifying tournament at the Prince of Wales Country Club on Tuesday.         
	Mexico showed early promise when they forced three penalty corners in the first five minutes, but the Indians not only kept their composure but hit back with a vengeance.         
	Rajpal Singh and Prabhjot Singh scored six and four goals, respectively, including a hattrick each.         
	Drag-flick specialist V. Ramachandra Raghunath, who doubled up as a forward, struck four, three of them from penalty corners, while Shivendra Singh (2), Tushar Khandekar (1) and Sardara Singh (1) rounded off the tally.         
	The Mexicans only goal came on the stroke of full-time when Pol Moreno scrambled the ball home following a mix-up in the Indian defence.         
	India, who beat Russia 8-0 and Austria 7-3, have nine points. Mexico, beaten 0-11 by Britain and 0-4 by Chile, are virtually out of contention for the lone Olympic spot available. Britain are level with India on nine points but are placed second on goal-difference.         
	Our aim was to get into a rhythm and score as many goals as possible so that our forwards would maintain their form. More than the number of goals, I was pleased with the manner in which some of them were struck, said chief coach Joaquim Carvalho.         
	India were keen on creating penalty corners that provided Raghunath opportunities to get going with his drag-flicks. Raghunath did not get to play for long periods in the previous two games and so we wanted to create opportunities for him. In the end, I thought he came up with a few quality conversions, Carvalho said.         
	India, in fact, received 10 penalty corners of which three were converted. A couple of them went wide while the Mexican goalkeeper brought off a few good saves.         
	Carvalho asserted that not much should be read into the three penalty corners early in the match and also the goal that Mexico scored in the last minute.         
	When you are up against a weak team, you tend to lapse in concentration. The Mexicans did surprise us early on, but once we settled down, it was a different story. In the end, we dropped our guard when leading 18-0 and conceded a goal. But I will not attach much significance to that, since in a tough match we will be on top of our game, he said.         
	Mexicos coach Edith Ramirez admitted that her team had been totally outclassed. We all know how good this Indian team is. We attacked in the beginning and forced a few penalty corners in the first five minutes. But we have not trained enough to convert our chances as the team got together only in January, she said.         
	Britain overcame a fighting Chile 4-1. After a barren first half, Britain turned on the heat as James Tindall (2) Richard Mantell (1) and Barry Middleton (1) scored for their third consecutive win.         
	Chiles Esteban Kainz kept them in the game with a 47th minute equaliser but they did not have the experience or skill to pull off a win. Two yellow card suspensions in the second half put Chile under further pressure and in the end they yielded to better-structured opponents.         
	Austria kept their hopes alive by defeating Russia 5-4 for their second win in three matches that put them in third place with six points.           (PTI)

  - Think tank in a fix over bowling combination       NILESH BHATTACHARYA            Anil Kumble on Wednesday                                 
	Ahmedabad: After supervising the match-eve nets with coach Gary Kirsten at the Motera on Wednesday, Anil Kumble had barely adjusted to his seat during the news conference when pat came the question: Are you satisfied with the wicket here? Will it produce a result?         
	Kumble took his time, as if to reflect on the challenge in hand. Raising his eyebrows and stressing on each word, he said: I think too many questions are being asked about it and the answers are very few so lets wait, he said.         
	The leg-spinners contemplation was directly linked to the predicament India find themselves in, going into the second Test for the Future Cup.         
	It is here that two years ago, Kumble in association with Harbhajan Singh engineered a facile win over Sri Lanka.         
	As he himself is a doubtful starter struggling with a groin niggle, he has kept his availability as well as Ishant Sharmas in abeyance till hours before the Day I action begins.         
	Were yet to decide on the XI because of a couple of injury concerns. We have some time before the Test so we will take a final call tomorrow (Thursday) morning, the India captain told a news conference on the eve of the match.         
	Regardless of the combination, we have the potential and quality to do the job. We have worked out some plans to ensure that we put pressure on South Africa and hopefully we will get the right result, he added.         
	Its this selection worry, this plan of rejigging the bowling order, that made Kumble a man of very few words in the news conference (it lasted just about five minutes) and may give the visitors a psychological edge.         
	Kumble didnt look in his usual groove despite bowling at the nets with his proper run-up.         
	With Sachin Tendulkar missing in action, India just cant afford to lose another matchwinner. After all, the record at the Motera speaks heavily in favour of the bowler who has taken 35 wickets in six Tests.         
	A doubtful Kumble means a delightful Graeme Smith as the rival captain is salivating at the prospect of winning a few yards of the battlefield before a single ball is bowled.         
	After the last game, India have a few more things to think about than us in terms of combination, in terms of the selection of the bowlers. So they have to answer our challenges Make sure we come back down to neutral, Smith said.         
	If he (Kumble) does not play you will lose a real competitor, someone who can really change a game It makes all the difference, continued the South African opener.         
	Soon after landing here late on Wednesday night, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar held an emergency meeting with the think tank, lending credence to Indias desperation to come out with a formula to challenge the Proteas.         
	If Kumble eventually fails to make the cut, Piyush Chawla will come into the picture but whether the five-bowler strategy will still be maintained remains a mystery. What is certain is V.V.S. Laxmans promotion to No. 4 in absence of Sachin but Yuvraj Singh can hope for a recall only if India adopt a cautious line of attack.         
	Smith, in contrast, wore a confident and determined look, endorsing coach Mickey Arthurs recipe of chin music for Virender Sehwag and drawing inspiration from their recent success in the subcontinent.         
	South Africa have played only one Test at this venue. Only one member of that 1996-97 side is a survivor of the current series: India coach Gary Kirsten. A fiery Jawagal Srinath spell handed the Sachin-led side a 64-run win in that match.

	London: Retired spin legend Shane Warne has hailed Sachin Tendulkar on becoming Test crickets highest run-getter, saying that a batsman of his class and skill deserved to be on top of the run heap.         
	I just think he has a class. I just take my hat off to him. Its everything about him. The way he conducts himself on and off the field, the pressure hes under with a billion people watching him every time he goes out to bat, the way he handles decisions, hes pure skill, Warne said. (PTI)

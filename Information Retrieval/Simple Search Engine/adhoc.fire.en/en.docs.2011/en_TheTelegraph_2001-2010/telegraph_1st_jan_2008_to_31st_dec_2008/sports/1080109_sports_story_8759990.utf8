The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirsten hopes to calm tempers
                                                Kirsten hopes to calm tempers
                      
	 India coach-designate Gary Kirsten hopes to calm the tension between Indian and Australian players following the Sydney Test saying the important thing is to settle the emotions.         
	The former South African opener said he was confident that bad blood would be removed when he arrives in Perth next week ahead of the third Test. I will enter this series as an outsider and may be I can bring with me an objective viewpoint, Kirsten told the Melbourne Age.         
	Kirsten stressed that the important thing is to settle the emotion and get the attention back on to the cricket before the Perth Test. The third Test starts on January 16.                     
	 Calls for sacking of Australian captain Ricky Ponting were pure nonsense, The Australian reported. Past and present Australian cricketers have rejected calls for Ricky Ponting to be sacked as Test captain but some have questioned his teams on-field conduct and the strength of his leadership, wrote the newspaper. Former Australia captain Richie Benaud wrote in the report that Ponting had been an outstanding leader of the team. The thought of Ponting being sacked, I think thats absolute nonsense, Benaud said.         
	Invincibles member Neil Harvey said this Test team didnt play with the right spirit and criticised Ponting for allowing his players to go too far with sledging. Certainly the captain needs to be stronger and keep his guys in line. He needs to look at himself I dont think they are very sporting, Harvey said.         
	Harvey agreed with the International Cricket Councils decision to withdraw West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor from the third Test in Perth next week. He said: He past his best He has been making a lot of mistakes for the past five years.         
	 Reacting to Steve Bucknors sacking, The Sydney Morningh Herald carried a headline: Bucknors head served up on a platter. The report said India have had their way. Bucknor last night was preparing to board the next flight to Jamaica after the ICC caved into Indias demand to have the struggling umpire sacked.         
	Criticising Anil Kumble for his comment that only one team played the Sydney Test in true spirit of the game, a columnist said: Indias sportsmanship at times was as lacking as Australias when using elaborate ruses to slow the over rate on the last day. India got the rough end of the stick here, but were as sore losers as Australia were graceless winners.         
	... India have done themselves no favours by bringing a tit-for-tat charge against Brad Hogg. Overwhelmingly, in all spheres, it is whites who have practised racism against non-whites. Yet in cracking down on racism, cricket makes as its first example a non-white player. This was always bound to sit poorly with Indians.                     
	 Major Australian bookmakers have suspended betting on the Australia-India Test series, said a report in Herald Sun. Melbourne bookie Simon Beasley said he needed to know more before he could continue taking money. Weve got it on hold at the moment until we know whats happening, Beasley said.         
	Phil Hanna, of Sportsbet, said he was waiting for confirmation games would go on before he would again start fielding on the series. Which is a pain... It sounds like they (the Indians) are pretty serious, he said.

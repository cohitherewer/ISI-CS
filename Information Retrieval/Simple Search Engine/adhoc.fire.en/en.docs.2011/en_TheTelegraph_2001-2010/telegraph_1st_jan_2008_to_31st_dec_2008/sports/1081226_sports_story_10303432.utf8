The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All eyes on Dravid, Pujara
                                                                                                                                                                                           All eyes on Dravid, Pujara
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rahul Dravid might have come out of his lean patch but he would feel some burdened when he plays for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals against Saurashtra here at the Brabourne Stadium starting on Friday.         
	The former champions go into the match with a thumping 155-run victory against Maharashtra in their last league engagement. But their performance this season has been patchy at the best  three comprehensive wins blemished by as many draws. They conceded first-innings lead on all those occasions.         
	The main worry for Robin Uthappa, coming to terms with the role of captain, has been the inconsistency of the batsmen. The team has only once gone past the 400 mark, and will look to Dravid to Wall them against an opposition who have a more balanced line-up.         
	Dravids presence will be a big help but it is not going to be a big boost for us because other batsmen have done well, too, said Uthappa, on the eve of the match.         
	Those are brave words but coming from the skipper of a team which has no batsmen  apart from the captain himself, who has scored 455 runs  aggregating 300 or more runs, it could be more of a general with depleted resources talking loud ahead of a key battle.         
	Dravid himself spoke differently.         
	The team asked me if I could play. Its an important game  its a young team and there are a few players whom I dont know well. It is nice to be back. Hopefully we can put up a good show, the India player said.         
	In other quarter finals from Friday, Mumbai will take on Himachal Pradesh at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad while Gujarat will face Uttar Pradesh at the Moti Bagh Stadium in Vadodara.

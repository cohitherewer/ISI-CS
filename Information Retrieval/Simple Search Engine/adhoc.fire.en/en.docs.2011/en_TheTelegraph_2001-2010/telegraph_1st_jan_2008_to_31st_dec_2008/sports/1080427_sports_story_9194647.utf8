                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sreesanths also my son: Bhajjis mother
                      
	Chandigarh: Off spinner Harbhajan Singhs mother Avtaar Kaur on Saturday said Friday nights controversy between her son and paceman Sreesanth should not be blown out of proportion.         
	I dont think any such thing happened and it should not be blown out of proportion, she said from Jalandhar.         
	Harbhajan is my son and so is Sreesanth. At the end of day they have to play together (for India), she said.         
	Avtaar Kaur admitted that it was not a very good feeling to see Harbhajan courting controversies more often than not. I feel hurt when he is in the news for wrong reasons, she said.         
	Mumbai Indians stand-in-captain Harbhajan had allegedly slapped Sreesanth on Friday night after their encounter versus Kings XI Punjab at Mohali.         
	Harbhajan had preferred to remain silent on the issue in the post match news conference but Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh had described the incident as ugly. (PTI)

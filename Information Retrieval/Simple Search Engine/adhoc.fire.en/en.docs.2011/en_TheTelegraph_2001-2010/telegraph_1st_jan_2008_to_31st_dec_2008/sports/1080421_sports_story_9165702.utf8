                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ghei finishes tied 28th 
                            
	Beijing: Gaurav Ghei finished tied 28th, the best by an Indian, as the Volvo China Open into history as one of the few tournaments that did not see a even a single player breaking par in the final day.         
	Among other Indians in fray, Gaganjeet Bhullar (298) signed off with a disastrous nine-over 81 to finish tied 44th, while S.S.P. Chowrasia (304) brought home an identical card that had him tied 63rd.         
	Torrential rain lashed the Beijing Cbd International Golf Course and Irelands Damien McGrane (278) claimed his maiden title after closing with a one-over 73. He was nine shots ahead of Oliver Wilson, Simon Griffiths and Michael Lorenzo-Vera, who were all tied for second on 287.         
	Conditions were not ideal for scoring but two bogeys were cancelled out by as many birdies and Ghei managed to stay level-par as he approached the 14th hole. (PTI)

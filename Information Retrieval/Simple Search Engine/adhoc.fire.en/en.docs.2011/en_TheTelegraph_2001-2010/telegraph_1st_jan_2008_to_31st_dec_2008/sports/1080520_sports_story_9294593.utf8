The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders face Royals in do-or-die encounter
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Knight Riders face Royals in do-or-die encounter
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shoaib Akhtar                           
	Calcutta: Knights fight till their last breath. And if a Kolkata Knight Riders team member is to be believed, just like the ancient warriors, they would never give up and do everything to make it to the last-four stage of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Dont write us off. We are knights and the battle is still not over, the player said. We will fight till the end and give it our all, he reiterated.         
	Things, however, look mighty difficult for the hosts as they take on League toppers Rajasthan Royals in a do or die encounter at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	While the Shane Warne-led side are almost through, the Knight Riders must win all their remaining three matches to have any hopes of making it to the knockout round.         
	With pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar likely to sit out on Tuesday after complaining of a knee injury, things look even more complicated for captain Sourav Ganguly.         
	Though the Pakistan speedster has been kept in the 13-member squad, he will undergo a two-day medical scrutiny. In case he fails to make the cut, Umar Gul will be his replacement.         
	He came to the tournament under-prepared He has given his 100 per cent. But he has a problem with his knee and we will monitor him for the next couple of days, coach John Buchanan said on Monday evening.         
	Sourav, however, in a function later on Monday night, claimed that the fast bowler was fit enough to play.         
	Besides the confusion over Shoaib, Norwester can also be a major concern for Shah Rukh Khans side. On Monday evening, it rained heavily for about an hour and the Eden outfield became water-logged again.         
	After a lot of experimentation with the opening slot, it was learnt that Buchanan, after a discussion with captain Sourav, is keen to stick to the Salman Butt-Mohammad Hafeez combination to open against the Royals.         
	Though the duo managed only 14 runs on Sunday against the Chennai Super Kings, the coach is still hopeful of a good show from the Pakistani duo.         
	Spinner Murali Kartik, who was included in a 13-member squad, may make it to the playing XI. In that case, Ajit Agarkar may be forced to sit out. Ishant Sharma will then open the bowling with Ashok Dinda.         
	However, a lot depends on Souravs batting performance. Though he has been inconsistent in the IPL so far, the vastly experienced captain can run through a bowling attack.         
	The Rajasthan side, meanwhile, are expected to field an extra batsman against the hosts. Former Pakistan captain Younis Khan may be included the playing XI. With the likes of Shane Watson, Munaf Patel, Yousuf Pathan, Sohail Tanvir and Shane Warne in their ranks, the bowling department looks compact.         
	TEAMS         
	Kolkata Knight Riders (likely): Salman Butt, Mohammed Hafeez, Sourav Ganguly, David Hussey, Debabrata Das, Wriddhiman Saha, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ajit Agarkar/Murali Kartik, Shoaib Akhtar/Umar Gul, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda.         
	Rajasthan Royals (likely): Graeme Smith, Shane Watson/Younis Khan, Shane Warne, Swapnil Asnodkar, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Kaif, Mahesh Rawat, Siddharth Trivedi, Munaf Patel, Sohail Tanvir, Yousuf Pathan.         
	Umpires: Rudi Koertzen, Brian Jerling; TV: K. Hariharan.         
	Match Referee: Farokh Engineer.         
	Match starts: 8pm.

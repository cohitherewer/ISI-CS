                                                                                                                                                                                                     Brunei axed
            Beijing Bytes                
	 Brunei were excluded from the Olympic Games after they did not register any athletes for competition, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday. It is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them, IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement.The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday, to have them register, but to no avail. The decision meant only 204 countries would take part in the Games opening ceremony parade.         
	Australia critical         
	 Australias Olympic chief criticised Beijing organisers on Friday over their wishy-washy assurances on internet access, and said bus transportation and pollution were still problem issues.Olympic organisers BOCOG lifted restrictions on some Internet sites earlier this week after complaints from media and the IOC.         
	 We all would have preferred if some of the other assurances, wishy-washy as they may have been in terms of opening up Internet sites, had happened, Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates told a news conference hours before the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Games. Some have been opened up, there is progress, and where I sit, things happen slowly in this country. Its probably better progress than we from the West might think, added Coates, who was a senior official in the organising committee for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

	Sailing controversy         
	Olympic Tornado champion Roman Hagara said he and team mate Hans Peter Steinacher do not know whether they will race in Qingdao because of a sail controversy that has divided the multihull class. The Austrians, gold medal winners in Sydney and Athens, said they are unhappy at the hybrid Code Zero spinnakers which will be used by 2004 Olympic silver medallists Charlie Ogletree and John Lovell and some other teams. The Americans have developed their own version of a sail they call Chupacabra, Spanish for goat sucker, a savage blood-sucking beast of legend. Hagara said the sail does not correspond to the rules of the class, accusing Ogletree of exploiting a loophole that will give the Americans and others a huge advantage in light winds.         
	Baby boom         
	New Chinese parents celebrated the birth on Friday of their lucky Olympic babies  children born on the day of the Olympics opening ceremony and on the lucky eighth day of the eighth month, 2008. Dr Zhang Yunping, director of the Maternal and Child Hygiene Hospital of the Haidan District in Beijing, said his hospital delivered 30 babies between midnight and 1 p.m. of which 20 were by caesarean sections.         
	Packed subways         
	Beijings cavernous new subway stations near the Olympic Green were bursting at the seams on Friday as spectators with and without tickets surged towards the Birds Nest stadium. Crowd control officials barked out instructions on megaphones, but local and foreign visitors paid little heed as the escalators from the subway ejected ever more people into the swelling mass with nowhere to go. Im from Washington D.C. and hes from New York City, so were used to crowds on the subway, but this is like the worst rush hour, said Katie Konkel, breaking away from the throng with her friend, Matt Pareti. It was impossible for taxis to get near the stadium as police cordoned off the streets around the perimeter as part of the sweeping security measures for the hotly anticipated opening ceremony. Wang Li, deputy head of the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau, said organisers had realistic expectations about the possibility of congestion during the Games, even with all their preparations.

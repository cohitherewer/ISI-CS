                                                A timely boost for city golf: Singh
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasias victory at the Indian Masters should be seen as a timely boost for golf in the city, feel former players.         
	According to former Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh, RCGC players win on Sunday was an incredible achievement.         
	Chowrasias win is a great thing for Indian golf an incredible thing, I must say. To a certain degree, Calcutta will now get a little more importance through his success, Singh, who won the golf gold in the 1982 Asian Games, said.         
	Former RCGC captain Ashit Luthra echoed similar sentiments. The centre of golfing power has recently been shifted from Calcutta to New Delhi. With SSP clinching the Indian Masters, the city will once again get special mention. His success is great for the RCGC, the city and India, he said.         
	Singh maintained that Chowrasia would now have a different terrain to explore. The win has now earned him a three-year exemption on the European Tour. It will open up his entire golfing career. Hell be playing in Japan, Europe and, maybe, in the United States. Its a great opportunity for him, he pointed out.According to Singh and Luthra, consistency and a cool brain were behind Chowrasias success in New Delhi.         
	He is a cool customer under pressure. He never gets frightened by the occasion. His short game has been exceptional. Because of his control over chipping and putting, hes fondly called Chipputtsia, Luthra said.         
	Singh felt that he had a steady head on his shoulders. SSP putted extremely well on the final day, he said.         
	Singh, though, refused to dub SSPs victory the best ever by a Calcuttan. As a standard of golf, yes, this win will be on a much higher level. But Arjun Atwal and Firoz Ali had also won major meets earlier and all these wins are equally good.

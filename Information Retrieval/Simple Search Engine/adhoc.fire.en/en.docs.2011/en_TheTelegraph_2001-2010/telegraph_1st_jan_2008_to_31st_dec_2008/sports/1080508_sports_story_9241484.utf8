                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lets not jump up and down about youngsters: Sourav
  - FORMER TEAM INDIA CAPTAINS LOCKED IN TEST OF RESOLVE AND LEADERSHIP       A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly knows a win against Bangalore Royal Challengers will help Kolkata Knight Riders stay in the reckoning for a semi-final berth. In the post-match news conference, he said it was time for the players to perform.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Shoaib Akhtars availability         
	I dont know why there is so much confusion on this He is part of the team But whether he will play or not will be decided by John (Buchanan) I dont see any scope for confusion         
	[The Knight Riders coach remarked: He is coming up reasonably well. He wants to play. But he is not in the condition that he should be]         
	Royal Challengers CEO Charu Sharma being sacked Are the franchise-owners putting lot of pressure on the players?         
	Look, at this level there is always huge pressure. Whether he is playing for Bengal or for the national team, pressure will always be there on the player. There will be both bad and good days You cannot guarantee performance Pressure is part and parcel of life.         
	Your batting has come under a lot of criticism         
	Look mate I am always under scanner since my comeback. I have scored more than 3000 runs last year which is more than any other Indian batsman But still I am under the scanner         
	Local youngsters performance         
	Yeah They are playing well Lets not jump up and down too much at their performance in Twenty20. As a player, Id love to see them perform in five-dayers and 50-over games. Thats where the real test lies.         
	Leading in Twenty20         
	Its different. It demands quick thinking. Captaining a Test side, you get a lot of time to make a comeback but in Twenty20 if something goes wrong in three-four overs, you may be gone.         
	Thursdays game plan         
	We expect to win We are backing our players which includes me We have thought about some ideas for Thursdays match. We will give it our best.         
	On Aakash Chopra         
	He has done well in domestic cricket... He has a good strike rate and we are backing him. But he has to change his game a bit Its time for all of us to perform.         
	The toss factor         
	As long as the wicket is good the toss will not be a factor.         
	Is fielding a concern         
	We have dropped a couple of catches in the last match. But thats not our concern Our main concern is our batting. We have to back each other.         
	Which team do you feel have fair chance in IPL?         
	Teams are not far away from each other I feel Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab have a slight edge over the rest Time factor is less with little scope and no time to come back

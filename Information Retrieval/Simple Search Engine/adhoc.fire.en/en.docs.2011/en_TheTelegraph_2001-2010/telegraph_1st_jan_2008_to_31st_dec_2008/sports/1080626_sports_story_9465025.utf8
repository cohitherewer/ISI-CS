	Karachi: India launched their Asia Cup campaign in an emphatic manner, routing minnows Hong Kong by 256 runs in their opening Group B match here on Wednesday.         
	Electing to bat, India rattled up a massive 374 for four, riding on centuries by Suresh Raina (101) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (unbeaten 109), practising well ahead of clash against arch-rivals and hosts Pakistan on Thursday. They then bundled out the opponents for a paltry 118 in 36.5 overs to register their second best victory margin, the highest being the 257-run win against Bermuda in 2007.         
	Young leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (4/23) weaved the spin magic, bowling with guile as he forced three stumpings by foxing batsmen with his intriguing line and length apart from effecting a catch out. Hong Kong skipper Tabarak Dar (21), James Atkinson (23) and Irfan Ahmed (25) were the main contributors to their sides dismal run-chase.         
	Man-of-the-Match Raina said his first ODI hundred was not an easy one as Hong Kong bowled well in the middle overs. They were bowling well when I went in Between the 25th and 35th overs, they bowled well. I concentrated on placing the ball into the gaps and hoped to hit the loose balls. My plan worked, Raina said. Im looking forward to play an innings like this against Pakistan, Raina added.         
	R.P. Singh drew first blood, trapping Skhawat Ali for nought. Dar and Atkinson then put up a 45-run stand for the second wicket but once the skipper was dismissed, the Hong Kong batsmen lacked confidence in negotiating the Indian attack. The runs came at a slow pace as the 100 came up in the 32nd over.         
	Poor running added to the woes of Hong Kong as lack of understanding resulted in run outs of Irfan and Roy Lamsam. Sehwag then closed the Hong Kong innings with two wickets on successive deliveries as he first clean bowled Afzaal Haider and then had Nadeem Ahmed caught behind.         
	Earlier, Suresh Raina notched up his maiden ODI century and Dhoni his fourth as India sent minnows Hong Kong on a leather hunt scoring a massive 374 for four. Raina spearheaded the batting blitz with his scintillating 101-run knock and teamed up with Dhoni to put on 166.         
	The 21-year old left hander was in spectacular form, reaching his first 50 from exactly 50 balls.           (AGENCIES)

                                                   Robin: As good as Twenty20 triumph
                      
	New Delhi: Team India fielding coach Robin Singh on Thursday rated the tri-series victory in Australia at par with the triumph in the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa last year.         
	I think its probably as good as the Twenty20 world cup victory, Singh said.         
	He added that the young talents played brilliantly and stood up to the test.         
	It feels pretty good The guys played brilliantly. Young guys stood up to the test and Sachin (Tendulkar) led from the front, Singh added.         
	On the mood in the Indian team, he described it as brilliant.         
	He, however, declined to comment whether the team, at any stage, felt the absence of senior players such as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid.         
	I think we won the series and that is important, he added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heskey blow to Chelsea title hopes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Heskey blow to Chelsea title hopes 
            HENRY WINTER            Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack vies with Wigans defender Paul Scharner during their Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Humiliation engulfed Avram Grant on Monday night, cries of you dont know what you are doing reverberating around the Bridge as Chelsea effectively surrendered the Premier League title race. It was Emile Heskeys injury-time equaliser that cancelled out Michael Essiens opener, and Grant cut a dejected figure as he sloped down the tunnel.         
	Having squandered Jose Mourinhos inheritance, the Carling Cup and FA Cup, Grant now faces mission impossible in the Premier League. Chelsea lie five points behind Manchester United with four games left. The way Chelsea are playing so unconvincingly under Grant, Sir Alex Fergusons side could well seal the title here on April 26, the ultimate indignity for Grant.         
	Grant had made the bizarre decision to keep the effervescent Cole in reserve until the break. Stamford Bridge was close to ferment, calling constantly for Cole. When he arrived, he immediately brought skill and invention to Chelseas attacks, helping create Essiens strike, and the Bridge was left wondering why he had not started.         
	The opening period had hardly lifted the spirits, Grants men playing like strangers in the night. The Chelsea employee whose first-half work most impressed was the in-house television man, who somehow found enough highlights for the half-time package.         
	For 45 minutes, it was stultifying fare, with Chelsea fans singing endlessly for Joe Cole, who had been kept in reserve by Grant until the break in preparation for Thursdays trip to Everton. Within 30 seconds, Cole had sent Essien charging down the inside-right channel and also tried a shot at goal, which flew into a thicket of white shirts.         
	When Cole geed up his teammates, gesticulating animatedly, the fans responded. Here was someone willing to take the game to Wigan, to ensure United did not enjoy a procession. Here was some trickery Chelseas attacking moves craved. His 54th-minute cross from the right set the scene for Chelseas breakthrough, Nicolas Anelka nudging the ball back to Essien, whose 20-yard shot flew past the unsighted Chris Kirkland.         
	Coles introduction proved the timeliest of tonics, a shot in the arm to the sluggish Blues, keeping the flickering flame of their title ardour alive. Until then a subdued mood permeated the Bridge, as if Chelsea felt their dream disappeared with Uniteds fightback against Arsenal the day before.         
	Grant had been forced to juggle his midfield at the last minute when Frank Lampard left the ground, the club citing family reasons for the midfielders sudden absence. At least Chelsea fans had the reassuring sight of the returning Petr Cech, not that they could see much of their battle-scarred goalkeeper. Hes got two masks, hes our No. 1, declared the Bridges excited master of ceremonies.         
	Cech quickly reminded everyone of his class with a low save from Antonio Valencias drive. Full of confidence until Coles arrival, Wigan impressed early on, all hard-working 4-4-2, all balls down the channels for Marcus Bent and Emile Heskey to chase. Heskey soon laid the ball back to Paul Scharner, whose shot was blocked by John Terry.         
	Joe Cole settled Chelsea nerves. Terry went close. Kalou saw a close-range shot saved brilliantly by Kirkland, who stood no chance when Essien came calling, prompted by Cole.         
	Steve Bruce shuffled his pack, introducing Jason Koumas and Antoine Sibierski, changing to 4-5-1 and relying on Heskey to take on Terry and company.         
	Chelseas reliance on Cole was confirmed when Ballack was presented with a promising free-kick opportunity, but the German lifted the ball into the crowd. Cole almost showed Ballack the way shortly afterwards, again eluding Kilbane. Cole scampered into the box, but his right-footed shot flew narrowly wide.         
	But then came Heskey, sliding in at the far-post to meet Koumas expert cross. Bruce danced on the pitch. Doubtless Ferguson permitted himself a little jig in front of his TV. The race is all but run.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

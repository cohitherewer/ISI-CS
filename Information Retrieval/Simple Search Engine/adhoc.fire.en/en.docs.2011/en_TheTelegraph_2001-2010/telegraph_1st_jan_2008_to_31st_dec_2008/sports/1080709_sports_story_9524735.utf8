	Calcutta: Kalighat remained on track to bring home all five trophies this season, beating East Bengal by six wickets to clinch the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy on Tuesday. This was their fourth crown.         
	Captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla put in an allround performance, picking up five wickets and then making a quick-fire 65 off 44 balls.         
	Batting first, East Bengal made 142 for nine in 40 overs (overs were reduced due to rain). Kalighat reached the target in only 19.1 overs.         
	Shuklas innings was studded with four sixes and six boundaries. Wriddhiman Saha remained unbeaten on 57. Kalighat were in a spot of bother when they lost three early wickets. But a 124-run fourth wicket partnership between Shukla and Saha eradicated all chances of an East Bengal win.         
	Brief scores:

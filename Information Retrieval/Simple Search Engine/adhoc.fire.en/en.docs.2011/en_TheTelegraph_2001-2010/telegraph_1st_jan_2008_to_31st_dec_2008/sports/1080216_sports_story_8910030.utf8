The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NRAI shoots back
                                                   NRAI shoots back
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) secretary general Baljeet Singh Sethi said internal politics in the sports ministry is causing a great damage to the sport in India.         
	Reacting to sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyars remark that NRAI is not aware of import rules, Sethi said on Friday: The problem is that the minister is not aware of what is happening in his ministry.         
	There is a great deal of problem there. The government has been providing us with ammunition for the last 23 years. They have stopped it for the last two and half years, Sethi alleged.         
	It is wrong to say we didnt react in time, the NRAI boss said. We were told only on December 13 that we have to apply for import licence. We did it accordingly but so far havent received any notice from them.         
	Sethi wanted to know why the government, which had been importing ammunition for 23 years, could not do it now. I think they have some internal problems and trying to put the blame on us.         
	Nine Indian shooters, who have qualified for the Olympics, are Indias main medal hopes in Beijing. The NRAI, however, has threatened to pull out of Olympics alleging that the government was not providing enough ammunition for practice.

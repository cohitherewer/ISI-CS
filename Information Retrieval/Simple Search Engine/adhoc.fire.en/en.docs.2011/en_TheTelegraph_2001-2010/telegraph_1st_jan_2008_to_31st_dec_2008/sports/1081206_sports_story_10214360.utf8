The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Odafe Okolie brace sinks Md. Sporting 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Odafe Okolie brace sinks Md. Sporting 
            A STAFF REPORTER              Action during the Mohammedan Sporting-Churchill Brothers group B match at the Barasat stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                      
	Calcutta: Ten-man Churchill Brothers defeated Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 in the second group B match of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Friday evening.         
	Odafe Okolie struck twice  once through a 28th minute penalty, followed by a superb right-footer three minutes from time  to help the Goans bag full points from their opening group B league match.         
	A hapless Mohammedan Sporting, however, managed a consolation goal in the 72nd minute thanks to A. Jyothi Kumar. On the evening, Churchill Brothers had everything that Mohammedan Sporting lacked.         
	Down to ten men, after goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya was sent-off for a rough tackle on Vimal Pariyar in the third minute, Churchill Brothers refused to give up. With Odafe as the lone striker upfront the Goans employed all their manpower to thwart what can only be described as a timid Mohammedan Sporting attack.         
	Coach Zoran Djordjevic brought in custodian Lalit Thapa in place of medio Thokshom Naoba Singh.         
	Although they seemed vulnerable to the frequent forays of Shabbir Alis men in the opening quarter of the match, their tireless efforts brought them back into the match.         
	After initial hiccups, they slowly but steadily grew in confidence and took charge of the match. On the contrary, the men of the black and white brigade failed to make proper use of their man advantage. While forward Goutam Thakur either headed or shot every ball out his colleague Vimal Pariyar, after an initial spark, went into a defensive shell. A mediocre midfield led by the Farooq Hyders aggravated the situation for the local side.         
	Further, a hapless Mohammedan Sporting defence led by Madhab Das (booked for a nasty tackle in the second half) looked clueless.         
	In the process, Churchill were gifted a penalty when Odafe was brought down by custodian Tharangachan Tungshang in the box. A clean Odafe right footer found the Goans leading 1-0 before the interval.         
	However, a hard earned effort brought Shabbir Alis boys back into the game in the 72nd minute. Substitute Satyajit Bose made a surging move from the right and sent a defence tearing cross to A. Jyothi Kumar in the box to restore parity.         
	But that was not enough, as Odafe Okolie had other ideas. Three minutes from time, his right-footer found the net beating substitute keeper Naseem Akhtar.         
	Incidentally, Okolie had scored when they defeated Mohammmedan Sporting 1-0 in the first phase of the ONGC I-League.

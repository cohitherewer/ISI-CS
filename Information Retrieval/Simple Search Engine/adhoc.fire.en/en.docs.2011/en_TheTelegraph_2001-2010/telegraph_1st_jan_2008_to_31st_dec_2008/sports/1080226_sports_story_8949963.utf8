                                                   SA ease to 5-wicket win over Bangla
                            
	Dhaka: South Africa reeled off the 27 runs required for victory in less than an hour to record a five-wicket triumph over Bangladesh on the fourth morning of the first Test on Monday.         
	Resuming on their overnight score of 178 for four, the visitors needed less than 11 overs to reach their victory target of 205 runs in 44 minutes for the loss of a single wicket.         
	South Africa lost Ashwell Prince for 38 when he was trapped lbw by Shahadat Hossain (three for 70) before wicketkeeper Mark Boucher hit the winning run with a cover-drive off spinner Mohammed Rafique.         
	On Sunday, skipper Graeme Smiths 20th Test half-century and five wickets from Jacques Kallis laid the foundations for a South Africa victory after Bangladesh had matched the tourists for the first two days.         
	Shahadat registered career-best figures of six for 27 in the first innings to help the hosts bundle South Africa out for 170 as Bangladesh carried a 22-run lead into the second innings.         
	However, Kallis struck back with the ball (5/30) and Smith with the bat (62) to ruin any hopes Bangladesh harboured of recording a rare Test victory.         
	The winning run chase was the highest on the sub-continent for South Africa, surpassing the 164 they managed when beating India in Mumbai three years ago.         
	Smith, who took over as skipper when he was just 22 against Bangladesh in Chittagong four years ago, equalled Hansie Cronjies record of captaining South Africa for a 53rd time.         
	Mark Boucher also reclaimed the world record for the most Test dismissals by a wicketkeeper with his 417th victim on Sunday, surpassing the mark held by Australias Adam Gilchrist.         
	Boucher then added his 418th wicket, catching Saqibul Hasan off Kallis to wrap up the Bangladesh innings.         
	Smith said the wicket was tougher than others on the sub-continent but was satisfied with performance of his batsmen.         
	I am very comfortable with the way the batters have played after coming out to chase more than 200 runs, he told reporters.         
	Obviously we can always improve and I think out top six batsmen are always looking to get better.         
	Bangladesh played really good cricket in the first two days. The fast bowler (Shahadat) bowled really well, he got the reverse swing which made it tough.         
	Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful said his side lost the match as they failed to reach a target of more than 250 runs in the first innings.         
	The teams now head to Chittagong for the second match of the two-Test series starting on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

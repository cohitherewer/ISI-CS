	Melbourne: In a change of stance, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has backed under-fire captain Ricky Ponting who was accused of putting his self-interest before the team during the final Test against India in Nagpur.         
	Sutherland had earlier said he would seek an explanation from Ponting. But, speaking at the launch of Pontings Captains Diary 2008 in Sydney, Sutherland backed Pontings decision to bowl spinners and part-timers in a bid to reel back a slow over rate. He is a player that has always put the team first and he has never measured success by personal statistics, Sutherland said.         
	Meanwhile, the debate on Pontings captaincy reached the Tasmanian Parliament. Sports minister Michelle Byrne has issued a notice of motion on Pontings leadership. (PTI)

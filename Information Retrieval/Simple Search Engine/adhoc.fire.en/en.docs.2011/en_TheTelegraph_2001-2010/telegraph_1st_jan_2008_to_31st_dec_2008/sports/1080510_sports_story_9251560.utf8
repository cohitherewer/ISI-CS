The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Champia makes Beijing cut 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Champia makes Beijing cut 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Archery Association of India (AAI) on Friday confirmed that Mangal Singh Champia will represent Indian men while Laishram Bombayla Devi and Dola Banerjee will take the womens category in the Beijing Olympics in August.         
	And on Saturday, the third name in the womens group will be decided at the SAI, Eastern Centre.         
	Chekrovolu Swuro, who was instrumental in getting India a berth in the ladies section, is struggling to find form. She finished outside the top eight at the Meerut National ranking and failed to make it to the two-day trials here.         
	Considering her past contribution, her ability and experience influenced the president of the AAI, V.K. Malhotra, to include Chekrovolu as a special case. At the halfway stage of the trials, Chekrovolu stood fourth.         
	The Indian squad for the third World Cup at Antalya in Turkey from May 27 to 31 will have all the four who made it to the Olympic squad.         
	Three top men will join Champia in the mens team while two top women from the two-day trials will form the womens side along with Bombayla and Dola.

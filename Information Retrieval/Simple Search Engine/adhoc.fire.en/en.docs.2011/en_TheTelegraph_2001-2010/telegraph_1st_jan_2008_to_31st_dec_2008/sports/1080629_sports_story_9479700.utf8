	Pakistan A to tour Zimbabwe  Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board official has said they will send their A team to Zimbabwe from August 20 as planned, regardless of any sanctions that might be taken next week against the African nation by the International Cricket Council. They also said that they will not support any sanction on Zimbabwe.   The England and Wales Cricket Board called their 2009 tour of Zimbabwe off on Wednesday under instructions from the British government over the growing violence before Friday rsquo;s presidential election run-off in Zimbabwe.   Cricket South Africa has already suspended all bilateral programmes with its southern African neighbour.    
	 Expert arrives  Karachi: Cricket Australia-appointed independent expert Reg Dickason arrived here on Saturday to access the security situation ahead of the Champions Trophy to be hosted by the country in September.  Dickason has been sent to the strife-torn nation on an inspection tour after some Australian and New Zealand players expressed reservations about playing the biennial tournament because of the security situation in Pakistan. Dickason is no stranger to Pakistan, having come here before with different touring teams, including Australia, in 1998.    
	 Ponting fined  St George rsquo;s (Grenada): Australia skipper Ricky Ponting has been fined 30 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent at umpire rsquo;s decision during the team rsquo;s second ODI against the West Indies in Grenada. Match referees Roshan Mahanama handed out the penalty after a post-match hearing, charging Ponting under clause 1.3 of the ICC code of Conduct, which refers to ldquo;showing dissent at an umpire rsquo;s decision rdquo;.   The charge was laid by on-field umpires Asad Rauf and Norman Malcolm, as well as third umpire Billy Doctrove and fourth umpire Clyde Duncan.    
	 Warne criticism  London: Shane Warne said Paul Collingwood would be known as the man who ldquo;did not show the right sportsmanship rdquo; after his failure to withdraw a run-out appeal against New Zealand.  Warne said the fact Collingwood made the lsquo;wrong rsquo; decision when given time to make up his mind would be held against the allrounder.  ldquo;We all make mistakes on the field when things are tight and a decision is needed in seconds. But what disappointed me was that he (Collingwood) had time to weigh up the options.  ldquo;Unfortunately it is something that he will have to live with., rdquo; Warne wrote in his column for Saturday rsquo;s edition of a British daily.     
	 Asif case  Karachi: The three-member fact-finding committee, formed to probe the Mohammed Asif detention case in Dubai, is unlikely to begin its work before next week as they are still to receive all documents related to case. Shafqat Naghmi, PCB chief operating officer, said they had not received the report of the case from the public prosecutor rsquo;s office in Dubai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil Kumble doubtful for opener 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anil Kumble doubtful for opener 
                      
	Bangalore: Indian Test captain Anil Kumble may miss the Bangalore Royal Challengers inaugural match of the Indian Premier League against Kolkata Knight Riders, as he has still not recovered from a groin injury.         
	He (Kumble) probably may miss the first game definitely, Royal Challengers skipper Rahul Dravid said, adding that another team member, Nathan Bracken, would be able to join the squad only in the first week of May.         
	Given the Twenty20 format, Dravid said the tournament was very, very competitive and therefore there were no favourites.         
	I think there is no clear favourite in the tournament, he said.         
	On his comment made in Chennai over auctioning in the IPL team selection, Dravid said it was an off the cuff remark that was taken out of context, and then went on to support the IPL concept. Its a great opportunity for domestic cricketers, he said. Its a domestic tournament with international flavour.

	Chennai: The little girls eyes said it all. 
    
	The camera had on Saturday caught her shouting Rafa, Rafa when the world No. 2 was trailing 6-7, 4-5 and Carlos Moya was serving for the match. 
    
	On Sunday, she was reduced to tears as a stunned Rafael Nadal and a capacity crowd at the Nungambakkam Stadium saw Mikhail Youzhny play near perfect tennis to walk away with his fourth ATP career title, the 2008 Chennai Open. 
    
	The 0-6, 1-6 scoreline should be enough to suggest that the top seed was far from his best. In fact, Nadal could barely move and had to call for the trainer during his 57-minute on-court ordeal. 
    
	Such was the mental and physical exhaustion after playing one of his best matches ever on Saturday night that the world No. 2 failed to even mildly trouble the fourth seeded Russian. 
    
	In effect, the final turned out to be the biggest letdown, an anti-climax of the highest order. 
    
	It is difficult to repeat the kind of tennis dished out on Saturday night by the mentor and his protg, and that too, in the very next day. 
    
	But no one guessed Nadal, known to be a matador, a fighter, would perform an utter submission in the final of the title he is yet to win in three attempts. 
    
	The three-time French Open champions game is based on super athleticism and a mind which refuses to buckle under the greatest of pressures. 
    
	Many times in the past, through his sheer will and physical ability, Nadal had overpowered his opponents through three or more sets of uncompromising power hitting. 
    
	It is inexplicable, therefore, why he showed a distinct lack of will and appeared so dispirited on court. 
    
	The obvious answer  that he was not 100 per cent fit  was denied by the world No. 2 later in the post-match news conference. 
    
	On the other side of the spectrum, Youzhny, playing his fifth ATP event final, looked absolutely calm and collected on court. 
    
	Nothing could distract him as he dropped just five points on serve and denied Nadal an even semblance of chance in the first set. 
    
	The seasoned Russian, in his ninth year as a pro on circuit, sensed quickly that Nadal was not moving well. 
    
	After dropping a single point in the opening service game, the world No. 19 converted the lone break point in game No. 2 as Nadal started committing uncharacteristic unforced errors. 
    
	The Russian, in his second outing in Chennai, then proceeded to break Nadal twice more and pocketed the first set 0-6. 
    
	Even though Youzhny had started off the blocks in a manner unprecedented, many thought the Spaniard would come back strongly in the second set, something which he had done many times in the past. 
    
	But the Russian was in the zone. He played two incredible backhands and served up an ace to hold the first game of the second set. 
    
	As the Spaniard, who has an 81-match winning streak on clay to his credit, went into the scoreboard in the second game of the second set, Youzhny bided his time. He held his serve with a chanceless game and put pressure on Nadals serve. 
    
	Following a replay in game No. 4 owing to an umpiring error, Youzhny unleashed a mean backhand to make it 15-30. Another stinging forehand at 30-30 and he had one break point. He clinched the game with a scintillating down-the-line forehand winner. The force was with him and Nadal could only watch. 
    
	The Spaniard called for the trainer on game six, in which he was broken again, and failed to earn a single point in the championship deciding game  the seventh. 
    
	It was only fair that Youzhny would clinch the issue with another forehand winner. The Sunday was his after all. 
    
	Thai twins Sanchai and Sonchai Ratiwatna defeated the Cypriot-French pair of Marcos Baghdatis and Marc Gicquel 6-4, 7-5 to lift the doubles title.

	New Delhi: India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has refused to be part of the Olympic torch relay but the Indian leg received a shot in the arm on Monday with Sachin Tendulkar volunteering to join the April 17 run in the capital.         
	Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi confirmed the maestros participation in the relay, which has witnessed protest by pro-Tibetan supporters worldwide.         
	Its a matter of great pride that the torch would pass through India. There is a big rush among the sportspersons to be part of it. Sachin Tendulkar called up this (Monday) morning and asked if we would like him to carry the torch, Kalmadi said.         
	Kalmadi, meanwhile, assured that with adequate security in place, the relay would go through without any hiccup.         
	Milkha Singh, Pullela Gopichand, Anju Bobby George  they all would take part in the relay and I appreciate their enthusiasm. In fact, there is a big demand to include them and we would accommodate as many as possible.         
	The relay is a matter of pride and we would ensure that no untoward incident takes place.         
	Everything has been planned and there would be adequate security, he said.         
	Asked if foolproof security would make it difficult for the man on the street to get a glimpse of the torch, the IOA chief said, we are provisions so that the public and students can watch it.         
	Even though Bhaichung had refused to take part, the All India Football Federation has said it wishes the event all success.           (AGENCIES)

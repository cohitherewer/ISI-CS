	Anecdotes         
	Triple tally         
	At the age of 42 Lucien Gaudin was crowned triple foil (fencing) champion. His teammates celebrated by carrying the Frenchman victoriously on their shoulders.         
	Canadian hero         
	Canadas virtually unknown Percy Williams stunned the athletics world at just 20 by taking gold in the 100m and 200m. He went on to establish a world record of 10.3sec two years later.         
	Pagans         
	Queen Wilhelmine refused to appear at the opening or closing ceremony as she considered the Games to be tantamount to a pagan festival.         
	Controversy         
	The womens 800m won by Germanys Karoline Lina Radke saw several competitors collapse with exhaustion. After much debate, the result was that women would not run races over 200m for another 32 years.               
	EXPLOIT         
	Weissmuller remains on top         
	On arriving in Amsterdam, Johnny Weissmuller was already credited with an impressive medal haul with three Olympic swimming titles and also a bronze medal for water-polo. He left Amsterdam with yet two more prizes on his list before becoming a well-known film star.         
	In 1922, the 18-year-old American swimmer caused a sensation when he became the first man to swim the 100m freestyle in under a minute (58.6). Two years later in Paris, Weissmuller reaffirmed his talent by winning the 100m, 400m freestyle, and the 4x200m.         
	Returning to challenge for more medals in 1928, he was plagued by muscular problems. However, this did not stop him sticking to his gameplan, and he won the 100m and the 4x200m during which, with his compatriots, he set a new world record.               
	SUMMARY         
	Amsterdam hosted the Olympic Games from May 17 to August 12, made possible thanks to public support as the Queen of the Netherlands Wilhelmine was against the event, considering it a demonstration of paganism.         
	For the first time the Olympic flame lit up the stadium night and day but Queen Wilhelmine refused to attend the opening ceremony.         
	The 9th Olympiad in Amsterdam was noted not only for the appearance of the Olympic flame, but for the appearance of women in the athletics events (100m, 800m, 4x100m relay, the high jump and the discus)  despite recommendations to the contrary by baron de Coubertin.         
	Germany, enforced absentees during the Games in 1920 and 1924, made up part of the 3,000 athletes from 46 countries.         
	Flying Finn Paavo Nurmi harvested more medals, Canadas Percy Williams surprised in the 100 and 200m and the Franco-Algerian Boughera El Ouafi won the marathon.         
	Nurmi and Weissmuller swing into action         
	Despite the addition of two countries since the Games of 1924, Amsterdam failed to produce a true Olympic star.         
	They did, however, reconfirm the superiority of Paavo Nurmi, who won three medals, including a gold in the 10,000m. Nurmi failed to grab all golds  falling to compatriots Loukola in the 3000m steeple, and Ritola in the 5000m. American swimmer Johnny Weissmuller was another star of the Games  and added to his medal tally (five in total between 1924 and 1928) before heading for the bright lights of Hollywood and a career as Tarzan, Lord of the jungle in 1930.         
	Young Canadian athlete, Percy Williams, was among a number of competitors to make an impression in Amsterdam  with victories in the 100m and 200m. The Finn, Harri Larva, successfully completed an epic duel with Frances Jules Ladoumegue in the 1500m, while the historic success of little Mohammed Boughera El Ouafi in the marathon left a memorable impression. Originally from Algeria, he gave France an unanticipated gold medal and was the only African at that time to have won a medal in athletics.         
	Pierre de Coubertin finally ended his connection with the Games. He played no part in the organisation of the Amsterdam Olympiad.

                                                                                                                                                                                           Cant afford to make any mistakes, says Dravid
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bangalore Royal Challengers captain Rahul Dravid believes one win will turn things around for his boys who have so far lost five of their seven matches. Speaking after a practice session at the Eden on Wednesday evening, the former Team India captain said his focus would be on keeping it simple and staying positive ahead of their tie versus Kolkata Knight Riders.               
	The following are the excerpts         
	The quantum of pressure         
	We are not feeling any pressure We are focused on playing positively on Thursday With our backs to the wall, though, we cannot afford to make any mistakes There is no way out for us and we have to perform.         
	Secret behind your consistency with the bat         
	I am getting used to the shortest version of the game Learning the tricks with every game. You have to keep things simple and play your shots.         
	Any compromise with technique in this format         
	The game progresses very fast. There is little chance of coming back after making mistakes. One has to stay positive and get on with it. Talking about technique, I feel a good shot is always a good shot.         
	Playing XI for Thursdays match         
	We will take a final decision after having a look at the wicket But I feel there wont be many changes Only Wasim Jaffer (injured finger) will be missed         
	Mark Bouchers fitness         
	He is completely okay Because we can only play four foreigners we rested Boucher in the last tie and tried out a few things. Actually we tried some combinations by dropping him. He is available on Thursday.         
	Brijesh Patel being the new CEO         
	Its too early to comment on this. He is in his early days of taking charge.         
	Charu Sharmas sacking         
	Its a company decision. I dont want to comment on something which is not under my control We just want to focus on our cricket.

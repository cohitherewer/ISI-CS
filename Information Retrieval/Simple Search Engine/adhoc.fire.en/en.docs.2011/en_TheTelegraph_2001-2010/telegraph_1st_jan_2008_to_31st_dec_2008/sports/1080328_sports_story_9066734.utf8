                                                   Title for Aronian, Anand tied 6th
                      
	Nice: Viswanathan Anands squandered the lead in the rapid game against Boris Gelfand of Israel and settled for a 1-1 draw in the 10th and penultimate round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament.         
	Anand won the blindfold game and now stands joint sixth in the overall standings with just one round to go.         
	Levon Aronian of Armenia won the tournament with one round to spare after settling for two draws with Vladimir Kramnik of Russia.         
	The Armenian took his overall tally to 13.5 points in all and remained 2.5 points ahead of nearest rivals Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Peter Leko of Hungary, Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Kramnik, who all have 11 points apiece.         
	Anand shares the sixth place overall with 10 points along with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Alexander Morozevich of Russia.         
	In the blindfold, Morozevich shares the lead with Aronian on 5.5 points while the rapid has also been won by Aronian with a round to spare as he has an unassailable two-point lead in this section.         
	It was a slip of a mouse some time back that gave Anand a much needed victory over Gelfand in the penultimate round of blindfold. While preparing a fashionable variation of the Slav defence, the Indian had put the 21st move by mistake and found that it was indeed the best response.         
	Gelfand suffered for the remaining part of the game, losing eventually in 31 moves.         
	In the return game it was Gelfands turn to deliver the goods as black. This time Anand was up against a Slav and blundered on the 16th move to land himself in difficulties. Gelfand won a pawn in quick time thereafter and it was smooth sailing for the top Israeli GM.

                                                   I back Paes fully: Khanna
                      
	New Delhi: Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Monday found support from a top tennis official who said his commitment was unquestionable.         
	Sometimes, personality clash cause problems. But I dont need to say that I back Paes. Of course, I back him totally, All India Tennis Association (AITA) secretary Anil Khanna said on Monday.         
	He showered praise on the seven-time Grand Slam champion, saying he had brought unprecedented glory to the country and his commitment to the team was unquestionable.         
	Paes is a wonderful player. He is just fantastic. He has done a lot in the last 17 years. He is an Olympic medallist. He also took India to Davis Cup semi-finals, won gold in Asian Games. He is great guy, I really dont need to say that I support him, he said.         
	Khanna criticised the revolting players for raking up the issue ahead of their Davis Cup tie against Japan.         
	We have this important tie against Japan. If players had opted to discuss it with me after the tie, it would have been better, Khanna said.         
	We could have sat together and sorted it out. Then there are challengers tournaments in May, it should not have been raised at this moment.           (AGENCIES)

                                                   HIGHLIGHTS

           
	 Mike and David Hussey became the eighth pair of brothers  the first for Australia  to play in a Twenty20 International 
    
	 Nathan Bracken became the second Australian bowler to deliver a maiden over in a Twenty20 match. Ashley Noffke holds the record in the Twenty20 game in Perth against New Zealand in December 2007 
    
	 Bracken (14 wickets) now has the most scalps by an Australian in Twenty20 Internationals. He went past Stuart Clark (13) 
    
	 India hit just three boundaries in their innings. South Africa, who managed only two in their match against the West Indies in December 16, 2007, hold the record. The SA-WI tie, however, was a 13-over affair owing to rain delay 
    
	 India were bowled out for 74 in 105 balls, the second lowest total in a Twenty20 International. The dubious credit belongs to Kenya who scored 73 versus New Zealand (September 12, 2007). Australia, however, still hold the distinction of being dismissed in the least number of balls. England dismissed Australia for 79 in just 87 balls in Southampton on June 13, 2005 
    
	 The win by Australia is the third quickest in terms of balls faced. The following are the top three: 
    
	p 74 balls  NZ bt Ken (Sept. 12, 2007) 
    
	p 60 balls  Aus bt SL (Sept. 20, 2007) 
    
	p 52 balls  Aus bt Ind (Feb. 1, 2008) 
    
	 Australias nine-wicket win was the third such in Twenty20 Internationals and the second time Australia have registered a nine-wicket win in this form of the game. They had beaten Bangladesh earlier

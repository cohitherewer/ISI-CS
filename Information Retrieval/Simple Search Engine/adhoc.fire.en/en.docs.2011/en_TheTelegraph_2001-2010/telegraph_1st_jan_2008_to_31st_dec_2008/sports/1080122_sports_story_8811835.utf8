      A STAFF REPORTER 
           
	Calcutta: The West Bengal Table Tennis Association (WBTTA) has set the time for the proposed state league in early March. 
    
	As things stand now, six teams will play the round-robin competition spanning for about five months. East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting and BNR have agreed to field teams. 
    
	According to Table Tennis Federation of India vice-president, Prabir Mitra, the WBTTA does not want the league to clash with any major competition on the national calendar. We were thinking about starting it in February-end. But we are now hopeful things will start rolling in early March, he said. It has been learnt that each team will consist of five players of three different grades (A, B and Juniors). Grade A will be a national ranking player while players with state rankings will be deemed grade B.

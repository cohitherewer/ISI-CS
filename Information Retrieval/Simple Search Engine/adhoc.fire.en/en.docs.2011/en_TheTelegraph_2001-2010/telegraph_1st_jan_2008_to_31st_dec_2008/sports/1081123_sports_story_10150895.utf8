The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Almunia gets armband
                                                                                                                                                                                           Almunia gets armband
                      
	London: Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia was given the captains armband for Arsenal at Manchester City on Saturday after William Gallas was dropped from the squad.         
	Frenchman Gallas was left out by manager Arsene Wenger following comments in the media criticising his teammates.         
	Gallas was quoted as saying that Arsenal are not brave enough in battle and specifically spoke of one unnamed player insulting teammates.         
	When as captain some players come up to you and talk to you about a player... complaining about him... and then during the match you speak to this player and the player in question insults us, there comes a time where we can no longer comprehend how this can happen, Gallas said.         
	Launching a robust defence of his captaincy, Gallas said he was speaking out because there are things that cant be said and cant be tolerated. (REUTERS)

	Mohali: Mike Hussey cracked the fastest century in Twenty20 cricket history as Chennai Super Kings pulled off a comfortable 33-run victory over Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Saturday.         
	Husseys blistering unbeaten 116 off just 54 balls steered Chennai Super Kings to an imposing 240 for five on a perfect batting strip at the PCA Stadium.         
	The Chennai IPL outfit then restricted the home team to 207 for four to win their opening match, which turned out to be a high scoring contest under lights.         
	It was a virtual carnage as Hussey plundered runs at will to notch up the second century of the tournament in as many days after Brendon Mccullums 158 in the opening match in Bangalore Friday night.         
	Electing to bat, the Chennai team took full advantage of a batting track and short boundaries with sixes and fours raining on a hapless Yuvraj Singh-led home team.         
	Suresh Raina (32), S. Badrinath (31) and Matthew Hayden (25) were the other notable scorers for Chennai Super Kings.         
	The home team started off well and kept themselves in the hunt till the midway stage of the innings but the dismissal of James Hopes (71) brought Chennai back in the game.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (54), Karan Goel (24) and captain Yuvraj Singh (23) were the other batsmen who chipped in with some runs for Kings XI.         
	Hussey hit 10 sixes and seven boundaries to record an amazing strike rate of 211.11. The likes of Brett Lee, Sreesanth, Irfan Pathan and James Hopes could do nothing to stop the run deluge while the two spinners Piyush Chawla and Karan Goel were little more than cannon fodder.         
	In fact, Chawlas only over cost 19 runs forcing Yuvraj to take him out of the attack.         
	However, wicketkeeper skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the highest paid player in the landmark auction, could manage just two runs before being trapped leg before by Hopes.         
	But his teammates made amends for his cheap dismissal with some lusty hitting, which helped Chennai Super Kings put on a mammoth total.           (PTI)

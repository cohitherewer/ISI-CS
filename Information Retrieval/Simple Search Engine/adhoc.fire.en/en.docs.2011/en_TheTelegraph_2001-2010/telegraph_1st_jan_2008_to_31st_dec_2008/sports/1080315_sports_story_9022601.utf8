	London: Arsenal and Liverpool will face each other for the first time in European competition after being drawn together in the quarter finals of the Champions League on Friday.         
	With four English clubs in the last eight, the most ever from one country, it was almost inevitable that two would meet as the names were drawn at Uefa headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.         
	Manchester United face Roma in a repeat of their clash at this stage last year while Chelseas quest to win Europes premier club competition for the first time will be tested by a tie with Turkish last-eight debutants Fenerbahce.         
	Barcelona will have home advantage in the second leg after being drawn to play Germanys Schalke.         
	With the semi-final draw also being made, the eight remaining clubs now know their prospective paths to the final to be played in Moscow.         
	Liverpool could face Chelsea in the last four, having beaten them at that stage last year and in 2005. Manchester United and Barcelona are also on collision course in the semis.         
	Premier League leaders Arsenal, beaten in the final two years ago by Barcelona, are at home in the first leg against five-time European champions Liverpool.         
	With a Premier League meeting on April 5 the sides will meet three times in a season-defining week.         
	Liverpool, finalists in two of the last three seasons, will have home advantage in the second leg.         
	Playing the second game at home could be very positive for us because always when we play at Anfield it is an inspiration to us, Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez told the clubs website. When you play against a good team the small details can make the difference.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was not surprised to be facing English opposition.         
	You know when you have four clubs from England in the quarter final, you will have to play one or two at some stage, he told Arsenals website.         
	Liverpool raise their game in the Champions League. We know we can beat them and therefore it is the form of the day that will be the decider.         
	Twice winners Manchester United and Roma have plenty of recent history.         
	Roma will have painful memories of the 1-7 drubbing they suffered at Old Trafford last season after a first leg marred by crowd trouble ended 2-1 to the home side in the Olympic Stadium.         
	Like last year Roma will be at home first.                          (REUTERS)

                                                     Virat wants to imitate Dhoni
                  Virat Kohli in New Delhi on Thursday                     
	New Delhi: Virat Kohli, Indias under-19 World Cup-winning captain, is keen to learn the art of staying calm on the field like Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Dhoni is a bit calm on field and I am not. I need to improve on that. I get a bit upset about things happening on the field.         
	He is a great captain and is wining matches Good for India, he said.         
	The young Delhi player said he wasnt disappointed for not being able to face arch-rivals Pakistan in the final.         
	We would have been happy if Pakistan were there. It would have been a crunch game. But the South African gave us a good fight They gave us a dream final. We could not have asked for more, he said.         
	Kohli now has his eyes set on playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Yes, I am (looking forward to playing in the IPL). I have not talked to any one but an agreement is going to materialise soon, he said.         
	Kohli also said that his focus was on playing good cricket and thoughts of transition to the senior team had never crossed his minds.         
	I have not thought about that. You dont know what the future holds. I am currently concentrating on the domestic season. IPL, of course, is coming up, he said.         
	Meanwhile, team member Saurav Tiwary was on Thursday presented a cheque of Rs 1.5 lakh by the Jharkhand State Cricket Association.         
	JSCA president Amitabh Choudhary said, Saurav has a bright future and he would definitely get a berth in the national team.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aston Villa underline   top four credentials
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Aston Villa underline   top four credentials

	Aston Villa have their place in the top four, but it has to be said the jury is still out about whether they have actually cracked the top four yet. Their win against Arsenal the previous week was not quite enough to dispel the psychological damage of 14 consecutive defeats against their nemesis but at least they stopped the rot here  not to mention the fact that they prevented United from scoring (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). No mean feat.         
	A few more players in the side with scant regard for Uniteds reputation, like James Milner, and next time they might even pull off that long-awaited victory.         
	Villa fans will say that could have happened on Saturday had referee Chris Foy awarded them a penalty, as he ought to have done for a blatant foul by Nemanja Vidic on Gabriel Agonbolahor, but Villa will learn from experience.         
	Villa had four representatives in the England squad in Berlin in midweek. Next time it could be five after Milners thrilling contribution here. He was a constant menace to United, be it going forwards or tackling back. Stuart Pearce told Martin Neill he had stolen the crown jewels when he signed him from Newcastle. He may not be quite that yet but hes certainly a gem.         
	United could not have wanted for greater encouragement to pick up the pace in the Premier League after the joint leaders, Chelsea and Liverpool, dropped points at home. For all their willingness to get forward in the first half, the British games great entertainers struggled to put moves of great coherence together.         
	In defence, Rio Ferdinand and John Shea wasted no time in asserting their physical authority. They seemed to be telling Agbonlahor for one that his pace may have frightened the life out of Germanys defence in midweek but it didnt intimidate them. It would have been stretching a point to say it was like men against boys, but United did seem to be making a point to the top-four wannabes. From the 20th minute onwards the champions were virtually camped in the Villa half.         
	It was going to need greater invention than Nigel Reo-Cokers effort from 25 yards to beat Edwin van der Sar, although one had to applaud his optimism. Villas one chance of knocking United out of their confident stride in the first half came when Ferdinand inadvertently stood on the ball in the penalty area following a cross by Milner. For a second he didnt know where the ball was but unfortunately for Villa neither did the lurking Agbonlahor.         
	If his England teammate Ashley Young was making little impression going forwards, he certainly made an invaluable contribution defensively when with a perfectly-timed tackle the Villa striker prevented Ji-Sung Park from almost certainly putting United ahead after 38 minutes.         
	Wayne Rooney was the man responsible for setting up the South Korean and his red boots were all a-twinkle again seconds later when Park came desperately close to converting a cross from the midweek England absentee.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zlatan brace helps Inter retain crown
  - Lyon make it 7 in row Rijkaard signs off in style             Inter Milans Zlatan Ibrahimovic is congratulated by Patrick Vieira after he scored the first of his two goals against Parma on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Milan: Zlatan Ibrahimovic returned from injury to score twice as Inter Milan retained their Serie A title on Sunday with a 2-0 win at Parma, who were relegated.         
	Inters triumph on the final day is their 16th championship and their third in a row, but the achievement was marred by a policeman being seriously injured in fights outside the ground, the media reported.         
	Coach Roberto Mancini also did not speak to reporters after the victory, sparking fresh media speculation that he would not be continuing as manager.         
	His side won the Scudetto the hard way, missing opportunities to wrap up the title the last two weekends and letting an 11-point lead in February get whittled down to one.         
	In the end, second-placed AS Roma finished three behind Inter after drawing 1-1 at Catania, who stay up while Empoli go down despite a 2-1 win over already-relegated Livorno.         
	Fiorentina bagged the final Champions League qualifying place ahead of AC Milan after Pablo Osvaldos overhead kick sealed a 1-0 win at Torino.         
	Fifth-placed Milan beat Udinese 4-1 but will not play in Europes premier club competition next season for the first time since the 2001/02 campaign. Milans Carlo Ancelotti has been confirmed as coach for next season despite their failure.         
	Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero was Serie A top scorer in a season for the first time after his double in Saturdays 3-3 draw at Sampdoria took his tally to 21, with no one on Sunday coming close to beating his mark.         
	In the Spanish league on Saturday, it was a day of farewells for Barcelona as coach Frank Rijkaard said an emotional goodbye after five years and his team gave him the perfect send-off with a 5-3 win at relegated Real Murcia.         
	Rijkaard won two league titles and the 2006 Champions League crown to etch his name in Barcelonas history books but he will now make way for reserve team coach Pep Guardiola after two seasons without silverware.         
	Rijkaards final match was a festival of goals as 19-year-old Mexican striker Giovani Dos Santos scored a hattrick with Samuel Eto and Thierry Henry also on target on Saturday.         
	The Dutch coach allowed himself a huge smile  something he has not been able to do much this season  as Giovani scored two great goals to complete his hattrick.         
	Saturdays game could be both Etos and Henrys final match in a Barca shirt with their futures far from clear but both signed off by getting on the scoresheet.         
	Brazilian Ronaldinho and Portuguese playmaker Deco are set to follow Rijkaard out of the camp Nou exit door but took no part against Murcia.         
	Meanwhile, Olympique Lyon wrapped up a record seventh consecutive Ligue 1 title with a convincing 3-1 win at AJ Auxerre on Saturday.         
	Lyon ended the season with 79 points, four ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who had to settle for a 2-2 draw at Racing Lens that sent the northerners down to Ligue 2.         
	No other team from a major European league have won six straight titles, let alone seven.         
	Lyon will bid for a first domestic double in next Saturdays French Cup final against Paris St Germain, who escaped being relegated for the first time since they were promoted to the top-flight in 1974 with a 2-1 win at Sochaux.         
	In a nail-biting end to the season, two goals from Djibril Cisse gave Olympique Marseille third place with a 4-3 comeback victory over Racing Strasbourg.         
	The win meant Marseille will play in the third qualifying round for next seasons Champions League. Nancy, who slumped to a 3-2 home defeat by Stade Rennes finished fourth and will play in the Uefa Cup.         
	They will be joined in the competition by St Etienne, who took fifth place courtesy of a 4-0 thrashing of Monaco.

                                                Row delays SA squad
                      
	Durban: Disagreement between South Africas selectors and administrators has delayed naming the squad to tour Bangladesh this month.         
	The list of players was due to be decided in a teleconference Tuesday but the announcement was deferred after Cricket South Africa (CSA) president Norman Arendse refused to approve the selectors decision.         
	If two of the players selected for Bangladesh are not fit and will undergo fitness tests on Monday, why dont we wait until Monday before we announce the squad? Arendse said on Wednesday.         
	Arendse said he was referring to batsman Neil McKenzie, who tore a calf muscle in the second Test against the West Indies in Cape Town last month, and fast bowler Andre Nel, who has been struggling with a sore neck.         
	Arendse denied reports that he wanted two players who were apparently not in the squad, opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs and fast bowler Monde Zondeki, to be included.         
	Gibbs and Zondeki are black while McKenzie and Nel are white but Arendse said race was not an issue in the disagreement.         
	Im a true blue cricket person, Arendse said. I hate losing as much as anyone else, and Im not going to insist on a players inclusion on the grounds of colour.           (REUTERS)

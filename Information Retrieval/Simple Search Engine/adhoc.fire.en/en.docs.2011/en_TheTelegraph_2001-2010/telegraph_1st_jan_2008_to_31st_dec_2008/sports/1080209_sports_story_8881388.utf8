The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - David holds the key
                                                                                                            David holds the key 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: With the current champion stayers like Regal Connection and Classic Sky out for greener pastures, stage is for the past heroes to decide the outcome of the 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II (Grade III) Cup, the star attraction in the trophy-studded eight-event card on Saturday.          
	Barring Moon Forest and Right Again, none among the eight horses in the line-up give the impression of being comfortable over the gruelling trip. Moon Forest is last winters Derby winner while Right Again lifted the St Leger a month later. It is a toss-up between the two Daniel David-trained hoses but Moon Forest appears to have the edge over his stablemate, having beaten a tough opposition in his Classic year.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

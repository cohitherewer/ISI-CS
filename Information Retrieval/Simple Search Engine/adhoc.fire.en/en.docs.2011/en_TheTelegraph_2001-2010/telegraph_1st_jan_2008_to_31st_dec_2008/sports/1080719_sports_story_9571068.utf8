	India A continue winning streak  Calcutta: The S. Badrinath-led India A team continued to impress in the Emerging Players tournament, with a seven-wicket win over New Zealand A, at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, says A Staff Reporter.  India had beaten the Australian Institute of Sport by five wickets in their previous game. They also defeated South Africa A in a T20 fixture. New Zealand A scored 248 for six in the allotted fifty overs after being put in to bat. Virat Kohli (120), skipper of the World Cup-winning under-19 team, spearheaded the chase. Bengal rsquo;s Manoj Tiwary, who batted well to score 60, and Kohli were unbeaten at the finish. India A overhauled the target with nine overs to spare.    
	 Kaneria miffed  London: Tired of being overlooked by the selectors, Pakistani leg-spinner Danish Kaneria is toying with the idea of switching side and playing for England. The 27-year-old said he has enough cricket in him and he would not hesitate to switch sides if Pakistan continues to ignore him.  Kaneria did not find a place in Pakistan rsquo;s list of 30 probables for the Champions Trophy but he still yearns for a recall in the ODI squad.     
	 Faisal rsquo;s trouble  Karachi: Playing in a recent Twenty20 invitational tournament in Florida along with some lsquo;rebel rsquo; cricketers cost Faisal Iqbal a place in Pakistan rsquo;s list of probables for Champions Trophy and the trouble is not still over for Javed Miandad rsquo;s nephew, according to sources.  The PCB omitted the Test batsman from the preliminary squad and according to PCB sources, the general body would decide any future course of action.    
	 Toronto meet  Karachi: The selectors are waiting for a final word from the Pakistan Cricket Board before they announce a shortlist of players for the Twenty20 four-nation meet in Toronto in August.  Pakistan, Bangladesh, West Indies and Canada are to take part in the four-day tournament from August 17-20. ldquo;There are still some minor issues to be sorted out with the organisers of the tournament although we have been told that they have signed MoUs with Bangladesh, West Indies and the host country for the event, rdquo; a board official said.    
	 Money power  Karachi: Banned Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq feels that until the BCCI relaxes its policy on the Indian Cricket League (ICL), no other cricket board would change its stance on the rebel players. The 28-year-old allrounder believes that BCCI has a strong say in world cricket because of their money power. ldquo;The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and the ICC both know that currently India produces a lot of revenue for them, so whatever India decides, they will do, rdquo; Razzaq said.

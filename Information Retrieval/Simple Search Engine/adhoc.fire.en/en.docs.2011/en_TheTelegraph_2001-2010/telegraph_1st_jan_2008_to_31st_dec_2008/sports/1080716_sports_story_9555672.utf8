The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB bans Asif indefinitely
                                                                                                                                                                                                       PCB bans Asif indefinitely
                  Mohammed Asif                     
	Karachi/Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday suspended Mohammed Asif from all cricket activities following his positive dope test in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and dropped him from the probables list for the Champions Trophy even as the embattled pacer decided to seek a B sample test.         
	A day after the IPL identified Asif as the player in centre of a doping storm, the 25-year-old speedster found himself in more trouble with the PCB taking a tough stand and making it clear that he would have to fight the battle alone.         
	Asif, who was also left out of the 30-member list of probables, will not be allowed to take part or associate himself with any activity related with PCB, ICC or ICC members until a final decision on his dope result is reached.         
	PCB hereby suspends Mohammed Asif with immediate effect from participating in cricket including its organisation, administration and promotion conducted by or under the auspices of PCB, ICC or ICC members until a final decision which includes appeal, PCB COO Shafqat Naghmi said in Lahore.         
	Naghmi said the PCB has a zero tolerance policy towards doping and condemns such practice in all forms and manifestations. Asif maintained that he will seek a B sample test to prove his innocence.         
	He said that the PCB will offer any assistance asked by the IPL drug tribunal and is under obligation to recognise and enforce any penalty pursuant to the anti-doping regulations of the ICC.         
	The board shall offer every reasonable assistance to ICC and other ICC members as they may require for the implementation and enforcement of their anti-doping regulations, he said.         
	Asifs lawyer reckoned that a few legal aspects were in favour of the cricketer.         
	Generally the odds may be against us but I think a few legal aspects of this case are in our favour and we can prove his innocence, Karim said.         
	He pointed out that Asif had given dope tests conducted by the board in recent months and was cleared. So how can he test positive so soon? Hopefully we will clear the issue with the passage of time. (PTI)

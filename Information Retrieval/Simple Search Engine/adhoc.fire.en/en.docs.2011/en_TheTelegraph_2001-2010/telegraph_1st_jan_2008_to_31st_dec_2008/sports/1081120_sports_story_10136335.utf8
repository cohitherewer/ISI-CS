The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni hopes for Yuvraj hattrick
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dhoni hopes for Yuvraj hattrick
                      
	Kanpur: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is confident that stylish batsman Yuvraj Singh will go on to complete his hattrick of tons in the third ODI against England Thursday.         
	I hope he scores his third consecutive century here and that would suit the team as well, Dhoni said after practice session at the Green Park Stadium Wednesday.         
	Yuvraj has been in murderous form against England, hitting a 78-ball 138 in Rajkot and following it up with a blazing 118 in Indore, where he took four wickets as well.         
	Dhoni doffed his hat at the Punjab batsman and said it was a pleasure to watch him when he was on song. On song, Yuvraj is simply one of the best, even the top bowlers struggle against him, Dhoni observed.         
	As a captain, I have noticed that all big players who slog down the order are left-handers, probably because the bowlers have sorted out the right-handers. They can bowl a yorker or low full toss to a right-hander but struggle to find the right line for the left-handers.         
	Sachin and Sehwag are also spectacular but when in full flow, Yuvraj really stands out, for he is a strong-hitter and hits along the ground, Dhoni said.         
	Asked what was his advice to Yuvraj, Dhoni quipped: I tell him see the ball, hit the ball.         
	England off-spinner Graeme Swann said they are unlucky that Yuvraj has struck form against them.         
	Speaking to reporters after the net session at Green Park, Swann, who broke into the 12-man England team for the third ODI, said: As a side, we were a little unlucky. When the tour started, Yuvraj was down in form but he bounced back in the first two matches of the series and is looking hungry for more.         
	Swann, however, oozed confidence that captain Kevin Pietersen and talismanic allrounder Andrew Flintoff would step up to match Yuvraj shot for shot.         
	 quot;We also got two very good hitters in Pietersen and Flintoff and though they have not fired on all cylinders, I hope on Thursday they would, and well win the match, quot; he said.

                                                   Hari settles for draw

           
	Reggio Emilia (Italy): Grandmaster P. Harikrishna played out an easy draw in black with GM Ni Hua of China in Round III of the 50th Reggio Emilia International Chess tournament on Tuesday. 
    
	The draw kept the Indian within striking distance of the three leaders on two points each. It turned out to be yet another hard fought day but there were only two decisive games out of a possible five in this category-16 round robin meet. 
    
	GM Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan added a full point to his kitty after punishing the reckless play by David Navara of the Czech Republic. The other winner was Russian Konstantin Landa, who beat against Mihail Marin of Romania. Eighth place is shared by the remaining three contestants Tiviakov, Godena and Navara on one point each.

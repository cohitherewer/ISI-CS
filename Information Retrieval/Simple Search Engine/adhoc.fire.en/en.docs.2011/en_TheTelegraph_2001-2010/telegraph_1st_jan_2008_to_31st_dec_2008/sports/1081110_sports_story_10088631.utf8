                                                                                                                                                                                                     Venus wins in Doha 
                      
	Doha: Venus Williams won the WTAs Sony Ericsson Championships by defeating Vera Zvonareva 6-7 (5-7), 6-0, 6-2 Sunday in the final of the season-ending event.         
	The Wimbledon champion took command in the last two sets with powerful serving, smashes and aggressive groundstrokes against her Russian opponent.         
	Zvonareva became increasingly frustrated and collapsed to the ground when Williams broke in the final set to go 3-1 up.         
	Im so excited, Williams said. That was a hard-fought match, every point, right down to the end.         
	Williamss ranking improved from eighth to sixth, while Zvonareva moved from ninth to seventh. The two were the lowest-ranked players at the event.         
	Williams lost the first time they played in the fourth round of the French Open in 2003, but she now holds a 6-1 head-to-head record over Zvonareva. (AP)

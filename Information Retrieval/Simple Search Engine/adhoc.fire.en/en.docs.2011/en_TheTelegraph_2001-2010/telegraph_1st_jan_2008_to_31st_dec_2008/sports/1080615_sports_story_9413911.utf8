	Bridgetown: Openers Simon Katich and Phil Jaques batted through out the entire morning to help Australia fortify their position in the third and final Test against West Indies on Saturday.         
	At lunch, Australia, leading by 35 runs from the first innings, reached 163 without loss with Jaques unbeaten on 78 and Katich not out on 74 on the third day of the Test.         
	Australia continued from their overnight total of 35 without loss and the two openers capitalised on the easier nature of the pitch and dropped anchor, as the Caribbeans only seemed to be going through the motions.         
	Everything West Indies tried, they seemed to find a method to counter it. Katich chopped his 107th delivery from West Indies captain Chris Gayle  trundling his uncomplicated off-breaks to square third man for two to reach his 50.         
	Jaques soon followed his lead and guided his 124th delivery from left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn to backward point for two to reach his landmark.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian under ICC scanner
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indian under ICC scanner
                      
	Karachi: An Indian national, close to some of the Pakistani players, is now the focus of the ongoing investigations by ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), which quizzed three cricketers at the weekend in Lahore.         
	Banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on the other hand has diluted his match-fixing allegations saying that he did not inform about it because the incident happened much before the ACSU was established.         
	Sources in the PCB said the ACSU investigator, Alan Peacock, came down to Lahore to talk to Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria and Umar Gul who had received expensive gifts from him on their 2007 tour of India.         
	Known as Annu Bhai, the Indian was seen in the company of some of the players during the tour and according to sources, the ACSU was investigating the Indian on suspicion of him being a bookmaker.         
	The Indian was the reason why Peacock came down to Lahore to interview and exchange information with the players. But he also met fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar about his claims that he was offered big money to under-perform in some matches, the source claimed.         
	The source added that Shoiab played safe in his meeting with Peacock by shifting the year of the incidents from 2003 to 1998 and 1999. He (Shoaib) told Peacock that offers were made to him in 1998 and 1999 and he didnt report it because the ICC had not set up its anti-corruption unit by then. The unit was established in 2000 after the match-fixing scandal hit world cricket with the banning of several top players for their involvement in the menace, the source claimed.         
	Shoaib said the offers came in 1998 and 1999 when he toured South Africa and India respectively, he added.         
	When Peacock reminded Shoaib that he had talked about an offer in 2003, the pacer said since he was upset with the ban, he might have got his dates and facts wrong.         
	The ICC Code of Conduct states that any player who fails to report any approach to fix matches to his captain, team manager, board or ACSU is liable to be banned for one to five years.         
	Younis was so incensed at the ACSU questioning that he refused to play Wednesdays ODI against Bangladesh and only agreed after coaxing from the selectors and board chairman Nasim Ashraf. The source said that Younis made it clear that he had met and interacted with many fans during tours and he didnt know him directly.         
	The other two players are also said to have given the same reason and some backgrounder on how they met Annu Bhai.         
	The source disclosed that the ACSU would also be interviewing some other Pakistani players and some from other teams as well in the coming days in the course of their routine inquiry into the Indian national and his relations with cricketers.         
	After being handed a five-year ban by the PCB for breach of code of conduct, Shoaib had told a television channel that he was approached by bookies to underperform in matches in South Africa and India. In the television show, Shoaib had mentioned that in 2003 a person came to his room with money but he drove him away as he could not betray his team.

                                                     North tighten grip over East
  - DULEEP TROPHY 
  -  VRV Singh picks up five for 59               V.R.V. Singh                           
	Rajkot: A fiery spell of fast bowling by North Zone pacer VRV Singh helped his side bundle out East Zone for a paltry 143 and take a huge first innings lead of 217 runs on the second day of four-day Duleep Trophy match.         
	Resuming at their overnight score 260 for seven, North Zone added another 100 runs with the help of last three batsmen. Overnight batsman Uday Kaul 48 (105 b, 5x4) made early exit but Chetanya Nandas almost run-a-ball 58 helped North to put up a competitive total of 360 runs on the board. Nanda hit nine fours in his 59-ball knock.         
	Shib Shankar Paul was the most successful bowler for east taking five for 106 while Mohanty and Saha captured two wickets each giving away 39 and 102 runs, respectively.         
	East Zone needed to score 210 runs to avoid follow-on but their batsmen caved in against the splendid bowling of VRV Singh. Niranjan Behera did not bat for East Zone as he sustained fracture on his finger on Monday.         
	Only Wriddhiman Saha gave some resistance to North and scored an unbeaten 56 which came off 91 balls with nine boundaries. VRV Singh grabbed five wickets conceding 59 runs, while leg-spinner Amit Mishra and Chetanya Nanda took two wickets each.         
	North did not prefer to enforce follow on and decided to bat again. In their second essay, they made 109 runs for the loss of two wickets and stretched their overall lead to 326. Aakash Chopra 56 (80b, 9x4) and Mithun Manhas 12 were two not out batsmen at the end of the days play.

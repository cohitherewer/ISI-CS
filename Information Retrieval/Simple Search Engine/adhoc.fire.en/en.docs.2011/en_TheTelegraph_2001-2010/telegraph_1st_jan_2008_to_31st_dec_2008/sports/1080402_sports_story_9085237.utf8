            A STAFF REPORTER            Michael Clarke                           
	Calcutta: Australia middle-order batsman Michael Clarkes prospects of succeeding Ricky Ponting as the next skipper were lifted when he was named as vice-captain for next months tour of the West Indies.         
	The 26-year-old Clarke has led Australia in Twenty20 Internationals but the retirement of Adam Gilchrist allowed the selectors to groom him for the top job.         
	Announcing the 15-man Test and a 14-man ODI squad on Tuesday, Cricket Australias (CA) chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said: With Gilchrist retiring after a stellar career, we have identified the need to look towards the future.         
	While we had some very strong candidates within the current squad, including those of the calibre of Michael Hussey, we had no hesitation in recommending Clarke for the position.         
	We were thrilled with his performances as captain during the two Twenty20 International games this summer and believe he has outstanding leadership credentials.         
	On the selection of two spinners for the Tests, Hilditch said: We have recalled Stuart MacGill after his recovery from injury.         
	Stuart looked very fit during the Pura Cup final. We think he will play an important role during the series and believe a player with 200 Test wickets will have a significant impact.         
	We have also taken the opportunity to take a young spinner and by far the best during the Australian summer has been Beau Casson.         
	In regards to the selections for the ODI squad, Hilditch said: We have taken the opportunity to reward some fine performances in interstate cricket.         
	David Hussey and Cameron White have both performed admirably for Victoria and thoroughly deserve their chances.         
	The Australian players selected in the Test squad will gather in Brisbane on May 4 for a preparation camp, which will take place until the team departs on May 10.         
	Coach Tim Nielsen said: This camp will be an opportunity for us to get together and start our planning for the winter season. It provides the players with an opportunity to complete their preparation for the West Indies and to ensure they are ready for the competitive side of cricket as soon as we touch down.         
	The camp will not involve any trial games as such but will basically be an opportunity for us to get our bodies moving again, Nielsen concluded.

                                                   McMillan slams Hayden

           
	New Delhi: Matthew Hayden might have got away with his obnoxious weed remark against Harbhajan Singh, but former New Zealand allrounder Craig McMillan said the behaviour of the Australian opener was uncalled for. 
    
	When two competitive teams fight it out in the field, lot of things happen, some of which may go over the top. But what Hayden did was off the field and I dont think he should have done that, McMillan said. 
    
	However, McMillan opposed BCCIs proposal to ban sledging and said banning the verbal duel would take away the charm from the game and make it robotic. 
    
	In a related incident, McMillan will lead the Calcutta Tigers in the ICL 20s Grand Championship to be held from Sunday-April 7. Brian Lara will lead the Mumbai Champs, while Inzamam-ul Haq will take charge of the Lahore Badshahs, a ICL release stated. 
    
	The breakaway league also announced team compositions.

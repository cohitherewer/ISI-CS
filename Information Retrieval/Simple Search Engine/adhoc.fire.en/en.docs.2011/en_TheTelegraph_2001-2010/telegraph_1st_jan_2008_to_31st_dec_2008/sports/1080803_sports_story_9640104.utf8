	Calcutta: A late goal from defender Peter Odafe earned Mohun Bagan all three points against a George Telegraph side that once again impressed everyone, at the Mohun Bagan ground in the Premier Division Sahara CFL match on Saturday.         
	After holding East Bengal and beating Mohammedan Sporting comprehensively, Raghu Nandys boys almost upset Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifas plan of climbing to the top of the league table.         
	The match started brightly with George Telegraphs midfield duo of Suva Kumar and Maduako Francis holding their own against their much-fancied opponents.         
	Mohun Bagan also had their share of chances. Lalawmpuiya came close to scoring twice in the first quarter of the match, before putting his side ahead in the 21st minute. Malsawmtluanga started the move with a run down the right wing and sending a high cross into the box, which Jose Ramirez Barreto brought down. The Brazilian then released the ball for an onrushing Lalawmpuiya, who slotted the ball in, past Swarup Das in the George Telegraph goal.         
	The mercurial Suva Kumar, who was bossing the midfield, troubled Sangram Mukherjee in the 36th minute with a rasping left-footer from thirty yards out. But Bencharifas men doubled their lead soon after, when Malswamtluanga reached a S. James Singh pass to beat the George Telegraph custodian with a cheeky lob over his head.         
	The second half saw a brisk start, with George Telegraph winning a penalty in the very first minute after Mohun Bagans central defender Anand Vasan handled a long ball inside the penalty box.         
	Sangram saved Franciss shot, but substitute Ipekere took advantage of the slow-moving Mohun Bagan defenders at the edge of the box, to score from the rebound.         
	Egged on by their coach and Man-of-the-Match Suva Kumars wonderful range of passing, George Telegraph began to dominate possession, outplaying Bagan for almost the entire duration of the second half. Flying winger Pradip Roy went marauding down the left touchline in the 80th minute and cleverly cut the ball back to an unmarked Francis at the edge of the Mohun Bagan box. The midfielder bought himself some space with a clever touch off his right foot and then beat a diving Sangram Mukherhjee with a powerful shot aimed for the second post.         
	Despite drawing level, Raghu Nandys boys ventured forward adventurously looking for a win.         
	This proved costly for George Telegraph as Mohun Bagans Odafe struck in the 90th minute, tapping in from close range after Habibur Rehaman Mondal crossed a hopeful ball in from the left.

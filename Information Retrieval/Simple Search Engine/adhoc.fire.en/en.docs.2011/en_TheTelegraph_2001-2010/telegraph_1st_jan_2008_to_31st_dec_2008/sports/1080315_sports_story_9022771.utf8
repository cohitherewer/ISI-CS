                                                   Proteas on top in ODIs
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India are all set to occupy the second spot, behind Australia, in the LG ICC Test rankings.         
	In the ODI rankings, South Africa have swapped places with Australia and ensured that they will hold the top spot on the April 1 cut-off date.         
	According to an ICC release on Friday, India are sure of finishing runners up to Australia after England blew its chance of leapfrogging Anil Kumbles side.         
	Having wrapped up the series 3-0 against Bangladesh in Dhaka on Friday, South Africa gained 0.720 points and although they stayed on 127 rating points along with Australia, this fraction of a point was enough to put them ahead of Ricky Pontings side.

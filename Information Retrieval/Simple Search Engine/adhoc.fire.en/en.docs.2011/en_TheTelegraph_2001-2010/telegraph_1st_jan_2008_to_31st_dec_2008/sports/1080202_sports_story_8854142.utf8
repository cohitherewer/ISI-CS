	Madrid: Barcelona reached the semi-finals of the Kings Cup on Thursday after a Thierry Henry header earned them a 1-0 aggregate victory over 10-man Villarreal at the Nou Camp. 
    
	The French striker scored the only goal of the tie when he planted a well-placed header beyond the reach of Villarreal keeper Diego Lopez four minutes before halftime. 
    
	Earlier Racing Santander, who are riding high in fifth place in the league, made the semi-finals for the first time after a 3-3 draw at Athletic Bilbao put them through 5-3 on aggregate. 
    
	The two sides will join last seasons losing finalists Getafe and Ronald Koemans Valencia. 
    
	Anxious to appease their fans after falling nine points behind Real Madrid in the league last weekend, Barca made a lively start against Villarreal. 
    
	Argentine forward Lionel Messi proved a constant men ace to the Villarreal back four with his electric runs from midfield, but despite manufacturing a host of scoring chances Barca were frustrated by some top-class goalkeeping from Lopez. 
    
	The Catalans eventually broke the deadlock late when the unmarked Henry headed in after Deco had floated a free kick into the area and moments later Villarreal received another blow when defender Pascal Cygan was sent off after picking up a second booking for a foul on Messi. 
    
	Barcelona should have extended their lead when they were awarded a controversial penalty 15 minutes from time, but Lopez made a great full-stretch save to stop Messis spot kick.

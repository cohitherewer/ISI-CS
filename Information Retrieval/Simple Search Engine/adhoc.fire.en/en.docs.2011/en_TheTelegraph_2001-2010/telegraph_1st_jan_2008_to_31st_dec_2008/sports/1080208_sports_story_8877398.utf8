The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias young guns dont fear Aussies: Shastri
                                                Indias young guns dont fear Aussies: Shastri
                      
	 Former India captain Ravi Shastri has suggested that Australias dominance of the sport in the past two decades has fostered a fierce drive among Indias young players to compete against it.         
	The young kids who are coming on the block now from India, theyre right in your face, theyre not overawed by names and reputations. The bottom line is they want to compete against the best sides in the world, Shastri was quoted as saying in The Age on Thursday. And thats the biggest difference. Respect Australia for the way they play but were not out there to just fill in the numbers; theyre out there to compete. And thats the attitude they bring to the table. If theres one team competing against Australia, its India. Shastri also said Indias rivalry with Australia was bigger than the Ashes.         
	Pontings influence         
	 Ricky Ponting can go on to be the most influential Australian cricketer since Don Bradman, Cricket Australia (CA) chief James Sutherland said on Thursday. In my view, he (Ponting) is as good a player as we have ever had, bar Bradman.         
	And, as a leader, he has a great opportunity to stand up and I look forward to seeing him as someone who has influenced the game more than anyone bar Bradman, he was quoted as saying by The Australian.         
	It pays to understand his background. He came out of Launceston, basically at the age of 15 and has been a professional cricketer ever since. He is the sort of leader and captain that players absolutely love to play for. His teammates are in awe of him as a player and as a captain and players would walk out over hot coals, Sutherland said.         
	CAs losses         
	Cricket Australia (CA) could suffer massive financial losses if the weather continued to play truant during the remainder of the ongoing tri-series which had its first two matches washed out due to rain. As per CAs refund policy, if fewer than 10 overs of a one-dayer are played in a match, fans are entitled to a 100 per cent refund. If 10 or more overs but less than 25 are played without a result, ticket holders are eligible for a 50 per cent refund. With rain predicted for the ODI between Australia and Sri Lanka, CA might need to shell out another $3 million, according to The Daily Telegraph. CA has already had to refund fans around $3 million after the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy match at the SCG in December was washed out.

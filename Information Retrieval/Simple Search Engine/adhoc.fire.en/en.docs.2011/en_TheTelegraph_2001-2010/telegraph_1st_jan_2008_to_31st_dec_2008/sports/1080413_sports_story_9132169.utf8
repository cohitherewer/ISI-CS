	Kanpur: Former India captain Sourav Gangulys willow demonstrated its magic again on Saturday as he steered the tottering Indian innings to a 23-run lead on Day II of the third and final Test of the Future Cup series.         
	In response to South Africas first innings total of 265, the hosts were 288 for nine at stumps.         
	The Proteas paid heavily for dropping the southpaw at 40 when India were reeling at 199 for five with wicketkeeper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni new to the crease.         
	Its like playing on a beach The pitch has already turned into a sandbag, a South African player said at lunch when asked about the pitch.         
	The 35-year-old Sourav, who was heading towards his 16th Test century, hit nine boundaries and a six before perishing to a Dale Steyn delivery.         
	Running out of partners, Sourav, who was clearly at his best on the day both in terms of shot selections and building up partnerships, went for a big one and managed to find the safe hands of Hashim Amla at extra cover.         
	He featured in two crucial partnerships  firstly with Yuvraj Singh for 65 runs for the fifth wicket and then stitched 60 runs with Dhoni in a sixth-wicket stand.         
	Both Yuvraj and Dhoni adapted to the situation and some quick singles and typical ODI shots eased the pressure. But Yuvraj (32) found de Villers while trying to sweep Harris and Dhoni was stumped by Mark Boucher.         
	When the Prince of Calcutta took guard, the South Africans were in total control. They broke the 78-run third wicket stand between former captain Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman and the pitch seemed to be assisting the fiery South African pacers  Steyn, Makaya Ntini and Morne Morkel.         
	Sourav found a battery of fielders surrounding him when he arrived at the crease. But a composed Sourav showed that he was in no hurry and coolly opened his account with a single.         
	Earlier a strong crowd had gathered despite the scorching sun. Both Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer, however, failed to provide India a solid start. They appeared tentative and preferred playing backfoot shots.         
	While Sehwag seemed overconfident, a confused Jaffer scratched around a bit before getting a lifeline when Mark Boucher dropped him in the third over.         
	Things looked quite rosy when Sehwag started off with a boundary. But soon he was caught on the wrong foot by Morkel and Jaffer was similarly trapped in front by Steyn.         
	As Laxman went on to hit his 33rd half-century before Morkel cleaned him up, Dravid managed a patient 115-minute 29. His 106-ball resistance ended when a Morkel delivery took off from the good length and hit him on the gloves. Steyn and Morkel bagged three wickets each while Harris got two.         
	Harbhajan Singh (6) and local lad Piyush Chawla (4) offered little resistance.         
	Towards the fag end of the day, an unbeaten Sreesanth hit two boundaries to add on to Indias lead.  
	DAY II HIGHLIGHTS    V.V.S. Laxman (50) scored his 33rd ODI half-century, his fifth against Pakistan
      For Sourav Ganguly (87), it was his 34th Test half-century and his seventh versus South Africa. His maximum fifties have come against South Africa
      On 58, Sourav surpassed his previous best (57) in Kanpur in 2005-05
      Sourav has been dismissed in two consecutive matches on 87. Others who have been dismissed twice on 87 are Clem Hill, Richard Hadlee, Arjuna Ranatunga, Mohammed Azharuddin and Alec Stewart  
	COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

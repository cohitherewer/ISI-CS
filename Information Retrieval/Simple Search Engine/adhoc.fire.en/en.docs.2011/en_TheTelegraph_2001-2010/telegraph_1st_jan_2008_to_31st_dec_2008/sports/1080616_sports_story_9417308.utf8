The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punjab retain crown with ease
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Punjab retain crown with ease
            JAYDEEP BASU            Punjab players with the trophy in Srinagar on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Srinagar: Gurwinder Singh, then 22, was a rookie defender from Hoshiarpur district in Punjab when he was inducted into the JCT Academy by former national coach Sukhwinder Singh two years ago. Initially, he looked too rough and temperamental on the field and the team management had to work overtime to keep him under control.         
	On Sunday, at the Bakshi Stadium here, Gurwinder finally came good as he turned out to be the hero of Punjabs 1-0 win over Services in the Santosh Trophy final.         
	For 79 minutes, he kept Services most lethal striker Sochungmi Raleng under strict vigil to realise Punjabs dream of winning the national title for the eighth time.         
	Raleng, who was later adjudged Man of the Tournament for his 13-goal effort, was so frustrated by Gurwinders hard tackles and coverings that he left the pitch in the 79th minute. By that time Services had practically lost all hopes of winning the trophy for the first time in 48 years.         
	If Gurwinders display was a lesson for all defenders who surrendered meekly to Raleng throughout the meet, then Punjab midfielders should be complimented for their ability to take charge from the very beginning.         
	Services were lucky that they did not concede more than one goal, that also through a penalty. In the second half, Punjab were all over them and could have won by a couple more goals.         
	The all-important strike came eight minutes after half-time when Lal Rautefela handled the ball inside the area following a dangerous move by Balraj Singh, who, too, had a good day in office. After referee Dinesh Nair awarded a spot kick Jaspal Singh converted it with supreme confidence.         
	For Punjab, it was like retaining the title at home. The majority of the 10,000-strong crowd was backing the defending champions and cheered every move. It turned out to be a lively afternoon for the football fans in the city.         
	Services should blame themselves for the debacle. After conceding the goal they forgot to play their natural game and tried to play through the air. It made Punjabs task easier.

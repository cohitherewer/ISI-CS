The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rajput finds no place
                                                     Rajput finds no place
                  Rajput                     
	Mumbai: Lalchand Rajput will have no role to play in the new regime headed by Gary Kirsten. Technically, Rajput was the assistant coach on the just-ended tour of Australia but, effectively, hed been the coach.         
	Since Kirsten is now the India coach, I dont think he (Rajput) is needed, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah on Wednesday.         
	Rajput, it may be recalled, was the coach when India won the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa in September. Then, hed been the cricket manager (effectively the coach) during the successful home series against Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, contrary to speculations, the BCCI decided to retain fielding coach Robin Singh and bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad for Indias Test series against South Africa commencing from March 26 in Chennai.         
	As of now, we have retained them (Robin and Prasad) till the series ends, Shah said.         
	Prasad recently was named coach of the Bangalore team of the Indian Premier League (IPL) while Robin took over the coaching reins of the Hyderabad side, triggering speculation about their association with Team India.         
	Though both stay for the series against South Africa, Shah dismissed a dual role for the duo in future.         
	I dont think that they can perform a dual role. If they are employed by an organisation, unless they get a go-ahead (from the franchisee), they just cannot do that, he said.         
	Shah also pointed out that Paddy Upton would join the squad as physical and mental conditioning coach, while Paul Close would come on board as the new physiotherapist for the series.

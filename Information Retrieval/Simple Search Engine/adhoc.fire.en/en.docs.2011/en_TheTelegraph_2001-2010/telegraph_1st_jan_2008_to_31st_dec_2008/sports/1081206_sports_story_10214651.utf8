The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maradona is the greatest that Ive seen: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                             Maradona is the greatest that Ive seen: Sourav
  - Bengals No.1 icon wont be meeting Argentine legend         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Perhaps its because state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty isnt exactly a fan of Sourav Ganguly that Bengals No.1 icon of the present times wont be interacting with one of his heroes, Diego Maradona, during his visit here.         
	That, at least, was the bottom line late on Friday.         
	Chakraborty is playing a big role in the Argentine legends maiden trip to India and, despite whats being said, nobody bothered to call Sourav and invite him for any function.         
	Sourav, however, didnt wish to comment on whats definitely somewhat unusual. He did speak to The Telegraph about his one-time first love, soccer, and Maradona.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q You were into soccer in a big way, till cricket became the priority. What drew you to soccer?         
	A Like every other Bengali, I too took to soccer when I was very young... Came naturally Id play as a centre-forward and as a medio... In fact, I captained the school (St Xaviers) team for a couple of years.         
	[A left-hander in cricket, Souravs right foot was more dominant in soccer.]         
	What made you choose cricket?         
	Circumstances... Once out of school, I hardly got an opportunity to play soccer. On the other hand, there were plenty of opportunities for cricket.         
	Maradona is one of your heroes (Tiger Woods being another). Were you also bowled over by him in the 1986 World Cup?         
	Absolutely... He was so exciting and possessed such a high level of skill... What ability! I still recall his second goal in that sensational quarter final against England... Dribbling past five before beating goalie Peter Shilton... The impression it created on young minds such as mine was awesome... Its rightly called the Goal of the Century.         
	For all his greatness, Maradona has been controversial...         
	(Laughs) The greater a player, the bigger the controversies, I suppose... I wouldnt like to go into specifics, for I dont know why he got dragged into this controversy or that. Wouldnt be fair on my part to say anything.         
	The debate continues: Is Pele the greatest or is it Maradona?         
	Look, Maradona is the greatest that Ive seen... I havent watched enough of Pele to form an opinion.         
	Have you, in recent times, followed any players career with much interest?         
	Quite a few... David Beckham, Ronaldo, Cristiano Ronaldo... All have such terrific ability... Cristiano looks the best today.         
	Favourite national team?         
	Brazil, for the quality of play.         
	The club you root for         
	Used to be Manchester United, as long as Beckham was with them... Of late, Ive been following Chelseas fortunes with some interest.         
	One learns you wont be meeting Maradona...         
	I wont be.         
	Why?         
	I wouldnt like to comment.         
	The final one: What makes a great soccer player?         
	Skill and a million hours of dedicated practice... Actually, its the same for a great in any sport.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea still in the hunt
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chelsea still in the hunt
                                Ballack    
	London: Goals from Michael Ballack and Florent Malouda gave Chelsea a 2-0 win at Newcastle United on Monday that took them level on points with Manchester United at the top of the Premier League with one game each remaining.         
	Ballack, who scored both goals in a key 2-1 win over United on April 26 to open up the title race, glanced in a header after an hour and Malouda made it safe late on.         
	The result sets up a grandstand finish next Sunday  10 days before Chelsea and Manchester United meet in the Champions League final in Moscow.         
	United, 4-1 home winners over West Ham United on Saturday, and Chelsea both have 84 points but United have a goal difference advantage of 17. They visit Wigan Athletic next week and will retain the title if they at least match Chelseas result against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge.         
	It was by no means plain sailing for Chelsea on Monday at a ground where they had not won in the league since 2001.         
	Newcastle went into the game in great form having taken 14 points from their last six games and looked the more enterprising team in a tight first half.         
	Michael Owen, with six goals in his last seven club games, twice went close to continuing his hot streak in the first half.         
	The striker lifted a volley over the bar after six minutes and then had a powerful low shot cleared off the line by John Terry after keeper Petr Cech had saved at the feet of Mark Viduka.         
	Chelsea, desperate to avoid defeat, looked short of invention throughout the half but took control after the break, with skipper Terry smacking a header against the bar after 53 minutes as they camped in the home sides half.

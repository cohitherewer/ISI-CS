The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lampard nets four in   6-1 rout of Derby 
                                                     Lampard nets four in   6-1 rout of Derby

	Frank Lampard ensured normal service was resumed at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, where Chelsea forgot their FA Cup pain to lead the Rams to their latest slaughter. Lampards four goals took Chelsea to within five points of Premier League leaders Arsenal with a game in hand, and just three points behind second-place Manchester United.         
	Both teams must visit Stamford Bridge so those who believe Chelsea could finish the season trophyless count them out of the title race only at their peril. As for Derby, they are in danger of becoming the worst ever team in the Premier League; with just nine games to go they have 10 points and a goal difference of minus 49. Avram Grant, the Chelsea manager, made five changes from the team humiliated at Barnsley with Paulo Ferreira, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Salomon Kalou and Claude Makelele all returning. But, surprisingly, there was no place for Didier Drogba.         
	The Ivory Coast striker, rested on Saturday with a slight knock, was on the bench, but again Grant decided he could not start with both Drogba and Nicolas Anelka, fuelling more speculation that the formers days at Stamford Bridge are coming to an end.         
	Drogba has started only three games since early December, so his fitness may be a contributing factor to his place as a substitute, alongside the returning Andriy Shevchenko, back on the bench for only the second time since Boxing Day.         
	John Terry, the Chelsea captain, warned before the game that the club had to respond to the disappointment of the loss at Oakwell. He wrote in the programme: The result and the performance werent acceptable and everyone in the team must take responsibility. Everyone needs to perform when selected. We cant have any more days like Saturday. Losing (in) the FA Cup was horrible.         
	Derby arrived with Robbie Savage back in midfield, as captain, after being left out of the goalless draw against Sunderland. With 10 defeats and four draws under Paul Jewell, they started at odds of 20-1 to become the first team to win in the Premier League for more than four years.         
	Chelsea offered early signs that they would dispatch Derby in merciless fashion. They forced their first corner within 48 seconds, while only the right post prevented an opening goal in the third minute. Anelka and Kalou combined for Lampard, who was allowed to waltz through white shirts before sending his effort against woodwork.         
	When Derby were offered a chance, Kenny Miller avoiding the offside trap, he shot like a striker whose side do not know how to score, the ball arriving closer to the corner flag than the target.         
	Working on the theory that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, Derby had to make a defensive change after just 16 minutes when the experienced Alan Stubbs, following a tangle with Anelka, had to be replaced by Dean Leacock.         
	Despite their possession  the ball rarely left Derbys half in the opening 45 minutes  Chelsea were struggling to atone for their poor performance at Barnsley. Michael Ballack had the ball in the net after 20 minutes but was ruled offside while Joe Cole had one effort saved and hit another wide. The deadlock was finally broken in the 28th minute but it took a penalty to split the two very different sides. Joe Coles clever pass was chased into the area by Lampard, but he had his ankles tapped by Lecock and dispatched the kick to the right of Roy Carroll for his 14th goal of the season.         
	The second goal, in the 42nd minute, was a comedy of errors; Carroll slid on his backside outside his area, in an attempt to clear from the feat of Anelka and the ball fell to Kalou, who had the simple task of turning the ball into an unguarded net.         
	Derbys second half resistance, while commendable, was limited and in the 57th minute Joe Cole exchanged passes with Anelka, resisted a challenge from Stephen Pearson and rolled the ball across goal from where Lampard tapped in his second of the night.         
	In the 64th minute Chelsea added their fourth with Anelkas shot parried by Roy Carroll and Joe Cole converting the rebound. Lampards hattrick was completed in the 66th minute. His fourth, and best, came seven minutes later when he met Ferreiras pass before forcing his way into the area and finishing delightfully. Derby responded a minute later, when David Jones capitalised on Chelseas continued celebrations to claim only their sixth away goal of the campaign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB, Bagan on same side
                                                                                                                                                                                                     EB, Bagan on same side
            EDEN DIARY                
	 Mohun Bagan and East Bengal footballers were cheering the same side perhaps for the first time. Twelve Mohun Bagan players, including goalkeeper Shilton Paul, Madhav Das, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Sangram Mukherjee, Habibur Rehman Mondal and players from the Tata Football Academy were present. They shared the space with 22 East Bengal players including captain Alvito D Cunha, M. Suresh, and others. The footballers were cheering the Vijay Mallya-owned Bangalore Royals Challengers.               
	Indomitable spirit   
	Even unseasonal rain failed to dampen their spirits. They came in thousands to cheer their heroes at the Eden on Thursday. Dressed as Knight Riders, they sported golden helmets, uttering korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re. The plastic helmets were being distributed free just outside the stadium.  
	Forgetful curator   
	Eden curator Kalyan Mitra did a fine job on Thursday but the former Bengal bowler forgot to remove one of the two super soppers from the ground which was lying in the long-on region at the pavilion end till the first ball was bowled. And it was left to Bangalore Royal Challengers captain Rahul Dravid to point it out.  
	Dark box  
	 Not on such a large scale as the first match, but a power cut nevertheless. On Thursday night it was the turn of the press box to go dark. During the ninth over of the Royal Challengers innings, the lights in the press box went off. Fluctuation of voltage, said a CAB official.

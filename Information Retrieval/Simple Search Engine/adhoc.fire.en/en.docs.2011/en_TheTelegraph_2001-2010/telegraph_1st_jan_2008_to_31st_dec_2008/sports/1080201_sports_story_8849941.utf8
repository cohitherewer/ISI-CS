                                                     Jeev, Jyoti at joint 2nd 

               
	Dubai: An imperious Tiger Woods, who won the Buick Invitational in California by eight shots on Sunday, charged into a two-stroke lead after first round at the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday. 
    
	Indians Jeev Milka Singh and Jyoti Randhawa, who both hit a five-under 67, were in joint second place along with nine others, including Britians Simon Dyson and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
    
	Jimenez also recorded a hole-in-one. The former Ryder Cup player used a six-iron to ace the 186-yard seventh. 
    
	A further shot behind was Shiv Kapur in joint 13th place. Keeping him company are the likes of Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia 
    
	The world No. 1 made his intentions clear from the start when he chipped up to an inch from the cup at the 10th hole, his first, for a birdie four that paved the way for a seven-under 65 on a hot, sunny day at the Emirates Golf Club. 
    
	Scotlands Colin Montgomerie, partnering Woods and Swede Niclas Fasth, stayed in close touch with the world No. 1 until a late collapse meant he had to settle for a 72. Ryder Cup teammate Darren Clarke also slumped to an ugly nine at the 18th as he went round in 74, two over. (Agencies)

                                                Drivers indulge in show of unity 
            EDWARD GORMAN IN STUTTGART                       
	This time last year McLaren Mercedes pulled out all the stops with an elaborate presentation of their new race car in Valencia in a ceremony before hundreds of invited guests that cost millions to stage. At that point the team was introducing Lewis Hamilton as a Formula One driver for the first time alongside Fernando Alonso, their big new signing and the reigning world champion.         
	Little could anyone have known what a traumatic experience the team was about to endure as the pairs relationship fell apart.         
	One year on, battered, bruised, heavily fined for cheating and, most painful of all, without a championship title to their name, McLaren are a far less confident team as they try to put the horrors of 2007 behind them and focus on a new season.         
	No surprise, then, that Mondays launch of the 2008 car, featuring Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen, his new 26-year-old Finnish teammate, was a low-key affair.         
	Accompanied by a thumping beat and a video presentation showing how the machine was put together at the teams futuristic headquarters near Woking, Surrey, the MP4-23 duly appeared.         
	While Ron Dennis, the team principal, looked uneasy and confined himself to a short introduction , it was left to Martin Whitmarsh, the chief executive, to talk through the new challenger.         
	If the mood around McLaren is downbeat, the same could not be said of Hamilton, who is champing at the bit to get his second season in Formula One under way.         
	We expect to have exactly the same opportunity and Im sure that will be given to us, said Hamilton. As teammates we are going to push to beat each other and push the team forward and we both want to win the World Championship.         
	Just as 12 months ago, the McLaren drivers put on a concerted show of friendliness. However, unlike last year, Mondays bonhomie between Hamilton and Kovalainen felt more realistic.         
	Me and Heikki, we have known each other for a while and our friendship has grown over the years and I find it easy to get on with him, Hamilton said. Kovalainen echoed that view. Whatever happens in the races, we can laugh about it afterwards, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting: Blast vindicated us
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ponting: Blast vindicated us
                      
	Melbourne: Australia cricket captain Ricky Ponting shudders to think what might have happened had his team been in Pakistan and said Saturdays blasts in Islamabad have justified his countrys decision of opting out of the Champions Trophy, which was eventually postponed.         
	The Champions Trophy was scheduled to be held in Pakistan from September 12-28 but was postponed after a number of countries, including Australia and South Africa raised security doubts and Saturdays suicide attack only confirmed the worst.         
	Its devastating for the people involved, he said adding I mean, wed be talking hypothetically, of us being in the hotel or England or South Africa being in the hotel, Ponting was quoted as saying in a local daily prior to the teams departure for the four-match Test series against India.         
	Ponting felt they did the right thing by acting on the advice of Australias security experts and the department of foreign affairs.         
	I think what weve done right the way through is to have listened to the advice from the experts and our department of foreign affairs, and security advice.         
	Right way through they have not been happy for us to tour Pakistan, so obviously nothing has changed right now, with the tournament, he said.         
	It is an absolute shame that things like this continue to happen in Pakistan because, believe it or not, as players, you want to play in all the conditions around the world, he added.         
	India too came under terrorist attacks recently and Ponting said his team would be given regular security updates during their tour.         
	Talking about Andrew Symondss omission from the side, Ponting said that while there had been positive signs from the all-rounder, there was no way Symonds would be called up.         
	Symonds was dropped after missing a team meeting before the first of three one-day matches against Bangladesh in Darwin last month.         
	Asked if Symonds could be back in the side by November, Ponting said, How quickly it happens is up to him. (PTI)

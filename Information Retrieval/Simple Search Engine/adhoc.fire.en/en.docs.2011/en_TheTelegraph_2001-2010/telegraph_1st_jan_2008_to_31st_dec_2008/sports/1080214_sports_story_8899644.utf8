                                                   US, Asia cold on global plans 
                      
	London: Opposition is mounting around the world to the proposal to stage Premier League games abroad  and even the club owners are now having doubts.         
	The Premier League announced Thursday that it was looking at plans to stage an extra 39th round in five overseas countries starting in the 2010-11 season.         
	The proposal met with strong opposition from fans organisations, while Fifa and the English Football Association, far from supporting it, have asked for details before making any official comment.         
	Among the leading candidates to stage the English league games are the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, South Africa and the Middle East. The idea would be to stage two matches in each of five countries over a weekend in the middle of January.         
	US soccer federation president Sunil Gulati said it would not host a game without Fifas permission, and Asian Football Confederation president Mohammed bin Hammam issued a statement Tuesday rejecting the idea. Weve been reluctant to have official games played in the US, Gulati said. Well be guided by Fifa on this matter. But if its not in line with its rules then we wont sanction it.         
	We had a similar proposal 10 years ago when a team playing in Los Angeles wanted to play in the Mexican league. We didnt let that happen and CONCACAF said no.         
	Gulati understands the ambition to globalise what has become the most popular league in the world in terms of TV coverage, but he feels he has a duty to protect the growth of soccer in his own country.         
	We understand its a global sport, but its about nurturing the home game, he said.         
	If Fifa said, OK, its up to the relevant FAs, then we would look at it. We have got a great relationship with the English FA and theres a lot of good reasons to look at it. But there are also some issues that we have got which would cause us to be very hesitant.         
	Bin Hammam said he could not support a plan which might be harmful to the domestic leagues in Asia.         
	I always welcome the exchange of knowledge and expertise between foreign football associations and clubs, and support matches organised between AFC and other confederations which benefit the development of our clubs here in Asia, he said in a statement on the Asian soccer website.         
	But, at the present time, I cant see the wisdom in the proposed plans. My recommendation to the AFC executive committee would be to reject any initiatives of this nature. And we would urge the AFC member associations to protect their own national leagues and clubs within their territories. This is our position.

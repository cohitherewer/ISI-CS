The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Qualifier sends Safin packing
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Qualifier sends Safin packing

	Paris: Marat Safin said on Monday he was considering his future in the game after his first round loss at the Paris Masters.         
	The former world No. 1 Marat Safin stumbled out of the Paris Masters Series when he lost 6-0, 7-6 to Argentine qualifier Juan Monaco in the first round on Monday.         
	The Russian, who won the Paris indoor tournament three times, picked up his game too late to unsettle Monaco, who will next meet Frances Gael Monfils, seeded 16th.         
	I need to enjoy my life without tennis, I will see if I continue, the 28-year-old Russian told reporters after the match.         
	I need to think it through. I will see, it was too intense these last three years. We will see. I have no pressure, nothing to show, nothing to prove.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have advanced to the pre-quarter finals of the euro 2,270,000 Paris Masters after getting a bye in the first round with their respective partners here.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy have been seeded fourth while Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles of Bahamas are seeded third.         
	Safin lost the first eight games and notably served four double faults in a single game as Monaco was cantering through the match.         
	The former US and Australian Open champion got himself together when 2-0 down in the second set, and double faults turned into aces.         
	Safin broke back for 2-2 and both players then held serve until the tie-break, which Monaco took 7-4 when Safin sent a forehand long.         
	Earlier, American Sam Querrey benefited from Marcos Baghdatiss retirement with back pain to set up a second-round meeting with world No. 4 Andy Murray of Britain.         
	I felt a sharp pain in the back and I did not want to take any risk, said the Cypriot, who was 5-7, 7-6, 3-2 down when he called for the trainer.         
	Czech Tomas Berdych also reached the second round with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Robby Ginepri.         
	Berdych, winner of the Paris indoor tournament in 2005, will next meet Swiss 12th seed Stanislas Wawrinka, who still has an outside chance of grabbing one of the three remaining spots for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. Although he dropped serve twice in the match, Berdych broke twice in each set to ease past Ginepri.         
	German Nicolas Kiefer resisted Croatian Ivo Karlovics 12 aces to win 6-4, 7-5 and set up a second-round encounter with defending champion David Nalbandian, seeded eighth and also looking for a Masters Cup berth.         
	Another Croatian, Marin Cilic, saw off Italys Andreas Seppi 7-6, 6-2 and will take on Spanish qualifier Marcel Granollers, while Croatian Mario Ancic beat Rainer Schuettler of Germany 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.

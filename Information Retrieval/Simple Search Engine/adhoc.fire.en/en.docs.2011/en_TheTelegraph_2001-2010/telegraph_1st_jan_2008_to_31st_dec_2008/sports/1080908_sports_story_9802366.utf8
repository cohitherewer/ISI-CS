The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | King Kevin settles in for a long and happy reign
                                                                                                                                                                                                     King Kevin settles in for a long and happy reign
    - Im just the idiot chucking my arms around on the field, says england captain           STEVE JAMES                            
	You suspect Kevin Pietersen is no great student of classical mythology. The frequent comparisons with Narcissus might easily have passed him by, but all this talk of Midas now? Surely he must have worked that out. There is gold everywhere. This truly is a golden time and this truly has been a golden start to his captaincy reign.         
	Kevin can do no wrong. His every deed is applauded; his every decision vindicated. His every word is hung on to; his every quote turned into the most colourful copy.         
	Last week, I listened in on a news conference where Pietersen was asked about the scheduling of next years first Ashes Test in Cardiff. Normally we lose to Australia in the first Test anyway, so I dont think it matters, he replied. He was joking, and the quote was not used, but in less successful times he could have been pilloried in the next mornings newspapers. Such are the benefits of euphoria.         
	It is an all-pervading emotion. Indeed I do wonder how much it is affecting my judgement. Meeting him for the first time last week, there was genuine shock as to how decent a chap he is. He was approachable, accommodating, cheerful and witty. Yes, he was confident, sometimes to the point of arrogance, and, yes, the first person dominated, but there was a refreshing honesty and also some revealing titbits of self-deprecation.         
	Im just the idiot chucking my arms around on the field, was one, as was the admission that Paul Collingwoods costly miscalculation of Andrew Flintoffs bowling allocation in last years World Twenty20 was his fault. I was in charge of the counting, he says.         
	The maths seems fine now, though. Not when the overs at Lords were reduced, he says, I said to the lads  youve got to help me out here. That doesnt seem to have been too much of a problem.         
	Why is that? Whats the best thing youve done as captain? I ask. He pauses, so I suggest the name of Steve Harmison. Yes, bringing Steve back has been huge but... Thats not the answer he wants to give. Theres something else he wants to tell me. Hes reintroduced the senior players management team, so beloved of former coach Duncan Fletcher. For Test matches it consists of Pietersen, Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell and Alastair Cook. In one-day Internationals it comprises Pietersen, Flintoff, Harmison and Collingwood.         
	Pietersen said, I think it is so important that the senior players run the show. They must show the youngsters how it is. One of the reasons we are so successful at the moment is that the senior guys are training harder than the younger guys. Freddie is on an amazing fitness regime; I always am; Harmy is busting a gut at the moment; Colly is just Colly; Cooky is one of the fittest lads in the team and Belly is pulling his weight brilliantly.         
	What about on-field tactics, though? Is there one decision that has particularly pleased him? Yeah, holding back the powerplay at Headingley, he said. Fifteen overs had passed and South Africa were rollicking along on 91 for one in pursuit of Englands 275. The third powerplay was ready to be taken when Pietersen returned from a comfort break. Something was telling me things werent right, he says. So I sprinted back on and told Simon Taufel, I dont want the powerplay. Samit Patels left-arm spin was introduced. With his fourth ball he bowled Herschelle Gibbs for a crucial breakthrough. With Patels over finished, the powerplay was taken and Harmison rejoined Flintoff in the attack.         
	Whats not been so clever? Mistakes? Pietersen immediately recalls his locum captaincy at Lords against New Zealand. I wasnt myself there, he says, I was really worried about what people said. Now Im going to do it the way I want to do it. Ive got the job for three forms of the game for as long, probably, as I can do it, so Ive got to be relaxed and give it the best go I can.         
	Pietersen has now headed off on a well-deserved holiday. Nobody will find me! he quips. He is already beginning to understand the strains of this extraordinarily burdensome post. After every match Im knackered, he says. The mobile phone never stops. I can see how this job only lasts for four or five years in this country. When youre winning its not too bad, when you lose I bet it gets real hard.         
	It sure does.

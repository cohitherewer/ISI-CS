            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar has been performing the role of mentor to perfection for quite sometime now. And the latest to benefit from his cricketing acumen and vast experience were the Mumbai womens team.         
	The city girls, who have been preparing for the Super League stage of the all-India womens tournament, were a delighted lot after the worlds leading run-getter gave them a pep-talk on Thursday following a request from coach Anjali Pendharkar.         
	It feels so good to be just listening to him, said captain Seema Pujare after the teams practice session at the Mumbai Cricket Association ground here.         
	Tendulkar spent nearly 40 minutes with the womens team. He talked more about mental toughness than cricket skills, coach Pendharkar said.         
	The girls were awe-struck but did not fail to pick on the master batsmans cricket brain. We wanted to know how to handle pressure when wickets fall in quick succession. We have been failing to build partnerships, Pujare said.

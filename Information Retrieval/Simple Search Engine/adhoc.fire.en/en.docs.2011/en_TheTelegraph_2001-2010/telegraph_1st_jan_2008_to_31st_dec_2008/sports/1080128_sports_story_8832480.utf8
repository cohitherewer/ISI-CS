	London: Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo helped Manchester United to a 3-1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur in their FA Cup fourth-round tie on Sunday. United trailed to an early Robbie Keane goal but Carlos Tevez equalised and Ronaldo put them ahead from the penalty spot (69th minute) and finished things off two minutes from time.

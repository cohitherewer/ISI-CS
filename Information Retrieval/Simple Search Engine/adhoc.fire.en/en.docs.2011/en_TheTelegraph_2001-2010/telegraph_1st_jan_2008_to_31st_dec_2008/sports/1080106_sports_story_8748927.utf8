The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saurashtra in trouble against UP
                                                Saurashtra in trouble against UP
                      
	Vadodara: Skipper Jaydev Shah (57) struck a defiant half-century as Saurashtra were struggling at 116 for eight in reply to Uttar Pradeshs 188 all out on Day I of the Ranji Super League first semi-final on Saturday.         
	Rakesh Dhruv (21) and Sandeep Jobanputra (15) were at the crease when stumps were drawn for the day, on which 18 wickets fell and 304 runs scored at the Motibagh ground.         
	Shahs decision to put the opponents in proved very fruitful as Sandeep Maniar (6-88) wreaked havoc, ripping through the UP top order.         
	The visitors were reeling at 15 for three within first 10 overs as Maniar dismissed R. Srivastava (3), Amir Khan (4) and Suresh Raina (2) before a 54-run stand between skipper Mohammed Kaif and Ravikant Shukla steadied the innings. Skipper Mohammed Kaif (80) struck a patient half-century as other batsmen struggled to negate the pace bowling. However, Saurashtra batsmen had a disastrous start courtesy UP pacers Pravin Kumar (3-35) and Sandeep Tyagi (3-43).         
	In the other semi-final in Indore, Delhi were reeling at 49 for three in their first innings after bundling out Baroda for 199 on Day I. Delhis reply began on a disastrous note with Akash Chopra (3) and Gautam Gambhir (2) returned to the pavilion in quick succession. Shikhar Dhawan followed the duo for a duck and the team total stood at five for three in the fifth over before Mithun Manhas and Aditya Jain stemmed the rot.         
	Meanwhile, in Mumbai, local boy Harshad Rawle remained unbeaten with a responsible 89 to help Railways reach 202 for seven on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Plate Division final against Gujarat.         
	Rawle stitched together a near half-century stand with Calcutta lad Sanjib Sanyal (16) and two other 30-plus partnerships later, but a big one eluded Railways and they finished the day on the back foot after winning a good toss.

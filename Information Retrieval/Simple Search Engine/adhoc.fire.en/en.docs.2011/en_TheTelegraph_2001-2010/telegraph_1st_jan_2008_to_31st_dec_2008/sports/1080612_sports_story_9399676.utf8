	Tenero (Switzerland): For Germany, Thursdays Group B game with Croatia in Klagenfurt is not just about qualifying for the quarter finals, it is about proving they are serious contenders for their first title since 1996.         
	Well see what our status is after the Croatia game, captain Michael Ballack said at a news conference on Tuesday. We know were going to have to raise our game to beat them.         
	Germany, three times European champions, beat Poland 2-0 in their opening match but they see Croatia, who overcame co-hosts Austria 1-0 in their first game, as a much more important scalp.         
	They have high ambitions in this tournament  they beat England twice in qualifying  and I think theyll play a much more offensive game than Poland did, Ballack said.         
	If Germany do improve from the Poland game they should be too strong for a Croatia side who did not look overly impressive in their first win over the unfancied Austrians.         
	Germany coach Joachim Loew has 23 fit players and his only real dilemma is whether to include Bastian Schweinsteiger from the start or again keep him up his sleeve for the second half.         
	We have a lot of potential up front, Ballack said. Its going to be a tough decision for the coach.         
	While Germany have never lost against Poland, they have mixed memories of playing Croatia in major tournaments.         
	Germany beat the Croatians 2-1 in the last eight on their way to winning Euro 96 in England but suffered a humiliating 0-3 defeat by them in the World Cup quarter finals two years later.         
	Croatia coach Slaven Bilic, who played in both those games, was confident midfielder Luka Modric would recover from an ankle injury to boost their hopes of a place in the last eight.

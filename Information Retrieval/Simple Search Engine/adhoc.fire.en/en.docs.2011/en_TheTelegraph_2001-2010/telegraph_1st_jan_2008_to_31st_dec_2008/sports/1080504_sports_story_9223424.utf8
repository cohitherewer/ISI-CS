The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkars fitness crucial for Mumbai 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tendulkars fitness crucial for Mumbai 
                  Sachin during practice in Mumbai on Saturday                     
	Mumbai: Rampaging Delhi DareDevils, who have shot to the top of the table and are firing on all cylinders, take on the wobbly Mumbai Indians in the IPL clash at the D.Y. Patil Stadium Sunday in hot and humid conditions.         
	The home team has sorely missed its captain and injured icon player Sachin Tendulkar in their first five matches and the none-too-encouraging news is the Master Batsman is still not feeling 100 per cent fit.         
	A lot hinges on Tendulkars availability for the tie if Mumbai Indians are to stun the high-flying Delhi outfit captained by another icon player in the Twenty20 league, Virender Sehwag.         
	Tendulkar played his first match Friday, albeit against a team made up of his own teammates, after more than a month and fielded for the whole of the oppositions 20-over innings and also batted.         
	He is to take a final call on whether he is fit to play the match only on Sunday.         
	Mumbai Indians, are currently placed seventh. Only a marginally superior net run-rate is keeping them above cellar team Bangalore Royal Challengers.         
	Delhi, on the other hand, have their top-order functioning like a well-oiled machine with Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan all coming good.         
	They have a sound middle-order too with the likes of Rajat Bhatia and Mithun Manhas, two stout-hearted performers in domestic cricket which has won Delhi the Ranji Trophy earlier this season, having enough power in their tanks to bail out the team if the top order fails to get going.         
	The pace attack is top-class with Australian great Glenn McGrath, a largely unwanted man at the auction despite his fabulous record in international cricket, and the highly talented Pakistani Mohammed Asif spearheading it to a nicety.         
	Another factor that could play a big role is the intense heat and humidity. All in all, Delhi DareDevils seem to be carrying too much firepower for the comfort of Mumbai Indians even in a Twenty20 clash and are firm favourites.

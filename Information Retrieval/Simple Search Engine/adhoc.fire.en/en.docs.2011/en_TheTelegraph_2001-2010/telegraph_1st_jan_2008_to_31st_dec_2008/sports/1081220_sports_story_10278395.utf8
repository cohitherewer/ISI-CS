	Mumbai: Mumbai tightened the screws on Punjab after a solid batting performance saw them gain a commanding first-innings lead of 234 runs on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Brabourne Stadium here on Friday.         
	Resuming at 90 for one in reply to the visitors 202, Mumbai rode a patient century from veteran Amol Muzumdar and a contrasting half-century by Test hopeful Rohit Sharma to post an imposing 436 for nine declared.         
	At stumps, Punjab were 18 without loss in their second innings.         
	The first innings deficit meant Punjab, who had a mathematical probability of making it, are out of the reckoning. Mumbai are already assured of a quarter-final berth.         
	Muzumdar, under pressure to retain his place, having scored 229 runs from 10 innings in the season, came up with a dour knock of 113 from 188 balls, while Rohit cracked a sparkling 85 that consumed just 102 balls and contained 14 fours and a six. The duos partnership for the fourth wicket was worth 132 runs.         
	Ajinkya Rahane (80) and Vinayak Samant (65) added 132 runs for the second wicket.

	St Georges: Tight West Indian bowling and a difficult wicket reduced Australia to 213 for five in the second one-day International at Grenadas National Stadium on Friday.         
	Brilliant opening spells from the West Indian pace duo of Jerome Taylor (2/47) and Daren Powell (1/29) denied Australia the brisk start they had hoped for after winning the toss and electing to bat.         
	The West Indies bowlers might have limited the Aussies further were it not for a series of dropped catches by Bravo, twice, captain Chris Gayle and Grenadian local Andre Fletcher.

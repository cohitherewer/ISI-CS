The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seniors dont need to prove credentials, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seniors dont need to prove credentials, says Dhoni
                  Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni during the fitness camp in Bangalore,   which concluded on Tuesday                           
	Chennai: As Indias experienced players drew flak for their lacklustre show in the just-lost Test series against Sri Lanka, ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday came in their defence, saying they did not need to prove themselves.         
	Dhoni, who gave the Test series a miss but is returning to lead the team in the shorter version matches, disagreed that experienced players should be more accountable than other members of the team in the Tests.         
	You cannot ask a Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman or Anil Kumble to prove their credentials, Dhoni said.         
	Indian middle order batsmen were specially under-fire as they failed to put on enough runs on board in the entire Test series against Sri Lanka which India lost 1-2.         
	Asked if he was ready to lead in the Tests as well, Dhoni said: I think you should ask the selectors and the BCCI this question. I am happy with whatever they have in mind.         
	The wicketkeeper-batsman, however, agreed that it was high time India improved to consistently win matches.         
	I think it is just time we should start winning in ODIs consistently. We are a great team and we will start doing well pretty soon.         
	Australia as a team is still far ahead. Yes, we can beat Australia and we have proved that. But to do it consistently we have to improve a lot. I think once we become more consistent we can think of being No. 1, he said.         
	Dhoni said as far as one-day games are concerned, not only bowlers but all departments need to improve.         
	Everyone has to improve. We have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best, he said.         
	The player from Jharkhand refused there was a need of separate sets of cricketers for Tests and the 50-50 or Twenty20 matches.         
	Not at all. A player can be good in ODIs and Tests and T20 as well. Look at Virender Sehwag or Gautam Gambhir.         
	Asked about his man-management skills, Dhoni said he just treated every member as his family.         
	Well, I am a person who goes and thinks by my heart. I do whatever my heart tells me to do. I am not sure what man management is. The team is like my own family. I treat them the way a person will treat his own family, he said I think my team members are obviously there behind me.         
	Dhoni denied that he was robbed off his swashbuckling batting ways.         
	I will play the way the team requires me to play. And I will come into bat whenever the team requires me to do so. It is not an experiment, he said.         
	Asked if he was still on the look out for an all-rounder to win matches, Dhoni said: There is Irfan Pathan who is doing quite well. I am sure that players like Praveen Kumar, Piyush Chawla and others will come off age. Sehwag is bowling really well.         
	Dhoni also said he was satisfied with the bench-strength India has.         
	We have a good 11. And our bench strength is also not that bad. In fact, we have to leave out world class bowlers like RP Singh or Piyush Chawla from a team. Also batsmen like Robin Uthappa, Manoj Tiwary does not find a place in the 11. This certainly shows that we have a good amount of support players.         
	Asked if we should have friendly pitches in all venues in India, he said: I feel we should play according to our strengths. Neither has Australia or England or South Africa changed their pitches for us. So I dont see any reason why should we change our pitches.         
	On his plans for winning the 2011 World Cup at home, Dhoni said he would try for the team not to wilt under pressure of playing at home.         
	We as a team try not to wilt under pressure. World Cup is long-time away. And I am sure that the combination can only be fixed some months before the World Cup, he said.

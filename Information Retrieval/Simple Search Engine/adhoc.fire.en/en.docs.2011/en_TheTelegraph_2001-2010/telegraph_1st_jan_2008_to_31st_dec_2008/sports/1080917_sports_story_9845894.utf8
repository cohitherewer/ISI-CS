The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City decide against the Ronaldo move
                                                                                                                                                                                                     City decide against the Ronaldo move
                      
	Ronaldo, now 31, was quoted saying he had been in contact with City and was impressed by their vision.         
	However, it seems City have now decided against a move for the faded Brazilian striker, who is currently without a club since his release from AC Milan.         
	We had shown an interest in the past in bringing Ronaldo to the football club in the right circumstances and spoke to him and his representatives, confirmed a City spokesman.         
	However, we have chosen not to pursue the matter.         
	That decision would seem to suggest City manager Mark Hughes is being allowed to manage the club his way.         
	Hughes never got involved in the high-profile courting of Ronaldinho during the summer and signing Ronaldo would make even less sense.         
	His stated aim is to bring in players who still have a desire to make an impact at the highest level, a description that would not appear to apply in Ronaldos case.         
	Ronaldo has spent recent weeks in Rio de Janeiro training with former club Flamengo.         
	I like the project that Manchester City have presented me, Ronaldo said on Sunday.         
	They want to make the club one of the best in the world and I feel that I can help. It is the best offer Ive received and it will be very interesting to play with Robinho. Me and him, together, we can score more than 50 goals.

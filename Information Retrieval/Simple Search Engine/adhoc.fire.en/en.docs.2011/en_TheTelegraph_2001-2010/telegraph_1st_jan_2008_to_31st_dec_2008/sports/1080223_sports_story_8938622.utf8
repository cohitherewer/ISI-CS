The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo yet to decide 
                                                     Ronaldo yet to decide 
                  Ronaldo after being discharged from hospital   on Thursday                           
	Paris: AC Milan and Brazil striker Ronaldo said on Friday he had yet to make a decision about his playing career after having knee surgery that will rule him out for at least nine months.         
	I havent decided yet what I should do but Im ready for anything, the three-time World Player of the Year told a news conference before leaving the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris.         
	I have the will to carry on playing, this is what my heart is telling me to do. But my body is giving me signs that it is tiring and needs rest, he added, speaking in Portuguese and Italian, with Milan sports director Leonardo translating.         
	I know that physically and mentally it will be very hard. If at the end of the day, I have recovered and can play again, fine. If not, it will be a very hard decision to make but it will have to be the decision.         
	Ronaldo ruptured his left knee tendon playing for Milan in a 1-1 Serie A draw against Livorno on February 13.         
	The surgeon who operated on the 31-year-old, Eric Rolland, said he would not be able to run before up to five months and not be able to train before nine months.           (REUTERS)

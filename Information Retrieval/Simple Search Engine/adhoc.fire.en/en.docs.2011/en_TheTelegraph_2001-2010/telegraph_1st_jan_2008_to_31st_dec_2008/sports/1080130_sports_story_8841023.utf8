                                                   Kachrapara team gets 5-year ban

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: A six-man Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) junior cricket committee on Tuesday banned Kachrapara CCC for five years for cheating in a CAB junior (110-point) match against Shilpashree Dum Dum CCC on January 17. 
    
	Aditya Mukherjee, coach of Kachrapara CCC, was suspended for five years while the three accused cricketers  Masrum Sarkar, Soumen Ghosh and Abhijit Dey  were each banned for one year. 
    
	The two umpires  Goutam Roy and Dhiman Biswas  also got one year bans while Suman Biswas (who officiated the earlier match between Kachrapara CCC and Naihati and allowed Masrum to play) was suspended for six months. 
    
	Shilpashree Dum Dum CCC were awarded full points. 
    
	 There is no option to appeal against this ban. 
    
	It may be recalled Masrum was listed to play for the Kachrapara team, but they fielded Soumen with a photograph of Abhijit. Soumen went on to smash 301 in 126 balls hitting 32 sixes and 19 boundaries.

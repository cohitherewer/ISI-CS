The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will go to India very hungry: Moores
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We will go to India very hungry: Moores
            NICK HOULT IN COOLIDGE, ANTIGUA                      
	With coach Peter Moores and captain Kevin Pietersen both admitting the team failed to focus completely on cricket during their Antiguan adventure, it remains to be seen whether they were successful in preparing for their most arduous part of the winter, a challenge which involves seven one-day Internationals and two Tests and which will begin as soon as they touch down in India.         
	The Stanford defeat will have to be removed from the system quickly and Moores must ensure his team do not repeat the mistakes of the past week in a country where there are distractions of a different kind. Playing under pressure was the overwhelming theme of the Stanford Super Series and England did not give themselves a chance.         
	It was the first time we had played the Stanford week and I think there was a little bit of confusion over what it was about, Moores said. Having done the week we should look back at it and what we dont want to do is ruin our preparation for the winter.         
	We have to make sure we are clear where we are as an England team. In one-day cricket we are in a very good place. But we are going to go to India and have we learned a lesson? I think in many ways we have in that you can never lose focus on the game. We played against a very hungry and disciplined side and we lost. Looking back on it now, we will be stronger and wiser for it.         
	The Indian board have decided England will play their one-day series at venues not necessarily on the beaten track, which should ensure large crowds for cricket fans starved of big matches.         
	We will go to India very hungry, stated Moores. This [the Stanford experience] is not going to be a problem for us to get over. Everyone is excited about going to India and taking them on because when we look at our team we think we can compete with them.         
	Once we go away from here and go to India the whole focus will change. We have a lot of lads who were on the tour there two years ago and lost quite badly. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

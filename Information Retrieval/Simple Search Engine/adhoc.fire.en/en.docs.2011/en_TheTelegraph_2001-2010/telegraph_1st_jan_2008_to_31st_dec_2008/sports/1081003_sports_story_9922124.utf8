	Hyderabad: Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth on Thursday advised the likes of Rohit Sharma not to lose heart after being ignored for the first two Test matches against Australia.         
	Srikkanth, here to watch Australias warm-up match against Board Presidents XI, was happy with the way Rohit and Virat Kohli slammed centuries against a full-strength Australian attack.         
	Im very happy that the youngsters are doing so well, Srikkanth said.         
	Rohit was brilliant, while Virat, too, played well. Its good to see them getting the exposure of playing against the mighty Australians, he said.         
	 I think we have very good youngsters, which means we have a very good bench strength, Srikkanth remarked.           (PTI)

                                                   Nod to tie, stars kept waiting
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given the go-ahead to Mohun Bagans exhibition match with Bayern Munich, but put Bhaichung Bhutias participation on hold.         
	Maintaining that the May 27 match  which is scheduled to be legendary German goalkeeper Oliver Kahns swansong  would clash with Indias camp for the SAFF championship in the Maldives, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said releasing players for the exhibition tie would be chief coach Bob Houghtons call.         
	The national teams camp starts in Goa on May 30 and so those who will be on national duty are likely to give the match a miss. Its not a question of whether Bhaichung or other Mohun Bagan players will be available, ultimately everything depends on Houghton, Das Munshi said on Monday.         
	For the players, national duty is foremost and we cannot compromise on that, he added.         
	He, however, insisted that the match would be held as planned.         
	The match cannot be cancelled since Ive heard that its going to be Oliver Kahns last professional match for Bayern Munich. I have spoken to (Bengal Peerless managing director) Kumar Shankar Bagchi. They are trying to do something good and have admitted that they were not aware of the rules or the national calendar, so we need to help them, the AIFF chief pointed out.         
	According to him, the match will be conducted by the Indian Football Association.         
	Das Munsi further noted that any person or organisation planning to host such a match had to fulfil four conditions, as per Fifa guidelines.         
	The national association of the visiting team has to be intimated. The financial terms and conditions must be transparent. It should also be stated whether the match is a charity or its being held for a social cause or purely for commercial benefits. Finally, the AIFF and IFA needed to be intimated about the match in advance. This is because if there is any complaint or mishap, the national federation will have to face it, Das Munshi said.         
	In another development, he said some corporate houses have approached the AIFF to float temporary teams for the I-League which might include four to five European players. The AIFF executive committee will take a final decision in this regard, he said.         
	He also dismissed any idea of changing the I-League regulations, saying that the last two teams, Salgaocar and Viva Kerala stood demoted and four clubs from the second tier would be promoted to make next years I-League a 12-horse race. He also announced partnership of top English Premier League clubs Chelsea and Everton with two Indian clubs, without revealing their names.         
	Meanwhile, Hyderabad, and not Delhi, will host the AFC Challenge Cup finals from July 30 to August 10.

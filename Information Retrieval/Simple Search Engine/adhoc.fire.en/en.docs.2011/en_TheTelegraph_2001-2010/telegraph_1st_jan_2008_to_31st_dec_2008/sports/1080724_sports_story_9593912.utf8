                                                                                                                                                                                           Notts set Laxman Friday deadline
                      
	London: Nottinghamshire have given V.V.S. Laxman time till Friday to make up his mind on joining the County.         
	Ive spoken to two players and we need to contact them again if he doesnt come, Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell said. Id like to know by this Friday.         
	Laxman, however, is likely to shun the offer after the Board of Control for Cricket in India asked him and Piyush Chawla not to join counties which have Indian Cricket League players.         
	We thought wed done a deal with VVS, and we thought we had permission from the BCCI, but somebodys spotted something and now they want to question the whole deal, Newell said. Nottinghamshire already have two players in mind in case Laxman backs out.The BCCI has been objecting to the fact that Nottinghamshire have players who have played in the rebel Indian Cricket League.         
	Our Special Correspondent adds from Colombo: Contacted by The Telegraph on Wednesday night, Laxman said: Im awaiting a reply from the BCCI It should come by Friday and I will then get in touch with the County.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Michael has priority in place
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Michael Buchanan                      
	Chennai: He may be a part of the support staff for Kolkata Knight Riders but Michael Buchanans biggest dream is to play Test and one-day cricket for Australia.         
	The 24-year-old son of the illustrious John has been playing for Queensland in the domestic circuit for the past two seasons, and is currently the strength trainer with the Knight Riders.         
	Its hard to say where I go from here I hope I get to a stage where I am picked to play for Australia. Thats my No.1 goal, quot; Michael told The Telegraph.         
	Michael loves to call himself a batting allrounder who also bowls medium pace. I got a few fifties in my debut season. But the last season wasnt very fruitful I broke my hand twice and didnt get to play too many matches. I hope to keep myself injury free during the next season so that I am available for my team, he said.         
	Michael finished a two-year course on strength training from the Australian Institute of Fitness in Brisbane.         
	He has been associated with the rugby academy in the University of Queensland for the past couple of years. Besides, he also worked with boxers in Queensland. Ive been doing all this while playing domestic cricket for Queensland, he said.         
	How has been the experience with Knight Riders? Great Im enjoying my role, he said. The Indian youngsters havent been exposed to strength training. So its a challenge for me to improve on their fitness.         
	Michael has been impressed with the youngsters attitude. Their attitude has been hugely satisfying. Their enthusiasm has been infectious on the whole team.         
	Working with his father has also been a learning experience. Its been excellent. The nets sessions have been useful and weve had a few hits together. Watching his every move is in itself a big thing, said Michael.         
	What has been his fathers influence on him? Hes been helping more mentally than technically. Weve got quite a few good coaches in Queensland and they have been more involved during my formative years. Now that hes no more coaching Australia he often takes a closer look at me.         
	Does he nurture any coaching ambition? If that happens, it will be a later stage Well have to wait and see. For now my priority is to play for my country.

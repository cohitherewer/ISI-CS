The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sekar: Dinda a revelation
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sekar: Dinda a revelation
            A STAFF REPORTER            T. A. Sekar                                   
	Calcutta: T. A. Sekar feels that bowlers have proved they have a role to play in Twenty20 cricket and the notion that it is meant for batsmen has taken a beating.         
	The current technical adviser and vice-president of the Delhi DareDevils has over the years shaped the careers of many a pacer at MRF Pace Foundation as chief coach.         
	Twenty20 is an instantaneous gameIts about change of pace and line and length. In some cases bowlers have been landing balls right up in the blockhole and have ended up getting wickets. The bowlers have also been rolling their fingers over for the slower ones The faster yorkers have also become very prominent. The stress is on variety and not on pace. It makes the batsmen think, Sekar told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	The former India pacer also listed the promising pacers who have made everyone sit up and take notice during the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The following is the list (alphabetically):         
	Ashok Dinda (Kolkata Knight Riders): He has been the surprise package in the IPL. Hes not tall and doesnt have a good physique. Despite his stature he can work up good pace and generate appreciable movement off the wicket. He needs to concentrate on his strengths and pick up from here         
	Manpreet Singh Gony (Chennai Super Kings): Hes an unknown quantity. He has good height and follows it up with a free flowing run up and a fine action. He started off decently in the IPL but has gained in confidence with every game. He lands the ball on the spot and bowls with an average speed of 130-135 kmph. He has enjoyed the right backing from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and has proved to be a really good prospect. He has the ideal physique and the motivation to make it big. He doesnt seem to be too far away from the other bowlers around him.         
	Yo Mahesh (Delhi DareDevils): Hes a proven bowler having played for the national under-19 and A sides. Hes been playing with and against some of the famous international bowlers and this experience will certainly help him. He has picked up wickets but has often been guilty of giving away too many runs. He too has been bowling in the 135-140 kmph speed and has it in to build on this experience.         
	Pradeep Sangwan (Delhi DareDevils): He wasnt in the team for the initial matches but has made the most of the opportunities. He has bowled and has the ability to change the line and length as per the demands of the circumstances. More importantly, being a left-armer he adds variety to the attack.         
	Sekar believes both Mahesh and Sangwan will hugely benefit from working closely with Glenn McGrath. McGrath has been helping them in the nets. The experience will come in handy for these guys. His message has been simple  dont sacrifice line and length in any form of the game.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: George Telegraph coach Raghu Nandy, who had already orchestrated the fall of Mohammedan Sporting and had robbed East Bengal off points, was gutted with his teams loss on Saturday.         
	We played so well, but it all came to nothingWe took the game to them in the second half, but we shouldnt have lost, Nandy told reporters, shaking his head.         
	The George Telegraph boys, including the outstanding performer of the day Suva Kumar, looked visibly distraught at the end of the match.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa didnt hesitate to laud George Telegraph for their spirited performance and work ethic.         
	Bencharifa also said that his sides midfielders and defenders have to lift their game by several notches before facing Manoranjan Bhattacharjees East Bengal.         
	Asked about the availability of defender N.S. Manju for Tuesdays derby, the Mohun Bagan coach said: He is still carrying an injury, but its up to him, if he feels fit enough and recovers in time, he will play a part.         
	Tuesdays match at the Salt Lake Stadium will be the seasons first East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match.

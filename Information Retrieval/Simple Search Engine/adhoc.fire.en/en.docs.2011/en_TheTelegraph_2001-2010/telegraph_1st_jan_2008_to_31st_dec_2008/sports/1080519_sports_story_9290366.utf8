The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal up to 9th spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal up to 9th spot
                      
	Greensville: Arjun Atwal continued to make rapid strides up the leader-board in BMW Charity Pro-am golf tournament, returning a three-under 69 in the penultimate round to grab a share of the ninth spot here.         
	The Orlando-based golfer was 10-under 205 after three rounds, seven strokes off the pace of leader American David Mathis (68) in the nationwide tour event.         
	A 10th tee starter, Atwal was off to a steady start as he parried the first five holes before sinking in a birdie on the 16th.         
	However, a bogey on the 18th meant that Atwal made the turn even-par.         
	The former Asian tour No. 1 made sure that his remaining nine holes were bogey-free besides picking up three birdies  on the fourth, fifth and seventh  to complete another solid performance in the tournament spread across three courses.         
	Atwal teed off at the Carolina Country Club in the third round.         
	The event, which has celebrities playing alongside professionals in a better-ball format, is also being played at the Thornblade Club and Brights Creek Golf Club.         
	Meanwhile, at the top of the leader-board, Mathis was being followed a stroke behind by another American Matt Weibring, who also turned in a 68.         
	Their compatriots Peter Tomasulo (68) and Bill Lunde (67) jointly held the third spot with totals of 13-under 202.           (PTI)

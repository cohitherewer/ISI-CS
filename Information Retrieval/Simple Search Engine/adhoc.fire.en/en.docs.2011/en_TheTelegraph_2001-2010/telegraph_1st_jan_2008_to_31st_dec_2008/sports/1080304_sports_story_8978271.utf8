                                                   IPL will renew bonhomie, hopes Gilchrist

           
	 Adam Gilchrist, who will retire at the end of the tri-series, feels the Indian Premier League (IPL) will revive the relationship between Indians and the Australians who will be playing alongside in the Tewnty20 league. 
    
	I think the situation this summer has got out of hand somewhat, Gilchrist was quoted as saying in Herald Sun. Hopefully, over the next week we see some great cricket, the series will finish and well all just move on and forget the almost tit-for-tat reactions that have been going on, he said. 
    
	The Australian wicket-keeper batsman felt thats where the IPL will play a very big role. Thats where I see something like the IPL is going to be ground-breaking territory. Thats going to be an opportunity for players around the world to get to meet, know and understand opposition cultures and customs. 
    
	I think thats going to be a very positive off-shoot of the IPL. Any World XI team Ive ever played in theres always been a great camaraderie in the rooms, he said. 
    
	Shah warning 
    
	 BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah on Monday said that the unnecessary targeting of Harbhajan Singh by Australian spectators and media could result in a similar treatment for the world champions when they tour India later this year. Harbhajan was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Match Referee after local media reported that the off-spinner had made monkey-like gestures towards the Sydney crowd during the first tri-series finals. 
    
	Let Australia come to us and see what the (Indian) crowd might do, Shah was quoted as saying in The Age. 
    
	Jumpy Hopes 
    
	lThe national selectors could do everyone in the Australian dressing room a favour by promoting James Hopes to open the batting when Adam Gilchrist retires. For while Hopes is good at most things  a former child-care worker with a degree in marketing and business and a golf handicap of three  sitting still is not one of them. Im a bit jumpy, Hopes was quoted as saying by The Age. I normally get padded up when theres two guys out and Im not batting until seven. 
    
	I dont like losing that much, and I dont like doing things at three-quarter pace. I like to go flat out at everything I do. Hopes may not command the attention that follows fellow Queensland allrounders Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson, but he has hustled through the summer at a frenetic pace towards a permanent spot in the team that will try to force a third final against India. 
    
	It has been a very steady journey, Hopes said. When I was dropped last time from the Australian team, I didnt honestly think I would get back. Watson was playing good cricket and I didnt see a spot but in professional sport, a couple of blokes get hurt and you get your chance. 
    
	Livid Lawson 
    
	lPakistan coach Geoff Lawson is furious at what he regards as ill-informed comments from Australian cricketers and is bracing for Cricket Australia (CA) to withdraw from its Test and one-day tour, scheduled to begin later this month, Sydney Morning Herald reported. 
    
	The PCB seems to be pretty negative about (Australias tour progressing), only because the correspondence theyve been receiving from CA has been negative, Lawson said.

            HENRY WINTER AT WEMBLEY            Englands Shaun Wright-Phillips (right) celebrates his goal with Steven Gerrard at Wembley on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	So demanding is Fabio Capello that the Italian even ordered Wembley officials install a hairdryer in the dressing room for his exclusive use. Capello made even more demands of his players last night, asking them to understand a lone-striker system that requires midfielders to make lengthy, lung-shredding runs. Clearly, it will take time for England to look as good and controlled as Capellos hair.         
	There were too many signs of uncertainty to herald Capellos first match as a bright new dawn with no clouds on the horizon, yet there were certainly some welcome rays of sunlight piercing the gloom left by Steve McClaren. Joe Cole impressed, his balance and trickery creating the opener for Jermaine Jenas, David Bentley showed his potential, while Wayne Rooneys touch, vision and work-rate remain pivotal to Englands 2-1 win over Switzerland.         
	If England players are eager to learn from their distinguished visiting professor from Italy, he is quickly acquiring knowledge about them. This 90-minute crash-course of English strengths and weaknesses will have taught Capello that Wes Brown is not an international-class right-back, that Ashley Cole is desperately out of form, and that there is more to Gareth Barrys game than patrolling deep midfield, a role that belongs to Owen Hargreaves.         
	Capello will have discovered that Rooney inflicts most damage when deployed in the deeper pastures, as in the second-half when the Manchester United man conjured up some sublime passes. He will also have appreciated that Englands midfielders need lengthy tuition in the art of racing beyond the lone forward, although the goals for Jenas and Shaun Wright-Phillips, either side of Eren Derdiyok, bodes well for the future.         
	The system worked best when Peter Crouch was the forward lighthouse, showing the paths for the midfielders, and Rooney, to storm into. Capello used to coach rugby union while working at AC Milans multi-sport academy and there was a sense here of the forward unit creating a platform for the midfield runners to make their telling bursts. More practice is required.         
	In a real curates egg of a display, with boos eventually replaced by cheers, Capello will also have detected the old English malaise of misplaced passes, that the centre-halves sometimes freeze in the face of crosses, and that the fans still pine for Goldenballs. Capello ignored the chants of theres only one David Beckham, claiming he had not heard them. Short of getting his translator to explain the mass message rolling down from the terraces, Capello was clearly not bothered by the publics enduring passion for Beckham.         
	What has become quickly evident with Capello is that he is no slave to players reputations, however gilded, and Michael Owen will have left Wembley last night painfully aware that he does not rank high in the strikers pecking order. First Rooney formed Englands spearhead, then Crouch. Owen sat on the bench unwanted; not since Howard Wilkinson kept him in reserve in Helsinki eight years ago has a fit Owen not started.         
	The Owen question will fill the airwaves and back pages for some time. If Capello persists with a system designed to derive goals from midfield, as much as the thin front line, then the worth of a poacher who has netted 40 international goals will be debated.         
	Occasionally, Capello emerged from the dugout to bark out instructions, particularly in the opening stages when Rooney and the others struggled to come to terms with the system demanded of them. For all the euphoria around the camp engendered by Capellos arrival, certain England players had been unimpressed by the new coachs decision to tell them the starting XI so late. Capello had some surprises, notably the decision to use Barry and Jenas instead of Hargreaves and Ashley Young, a contrast to what they had tried in training.         
	Capellos Jenas decision proved inspired, the Spurs midfielder making up for a diffident opening with a well-taken goal just before the break, his first goal in 18 appearances bringing a huge smile to his face and widespread relief to Wembley. Until Jenas finished off a wonderful run by Joe Cole, England had been disappointing.         
	Capellos 4-1-4-1 formation appeared overly cautious, particularly at home, particularly in a friendly. It left Rooney too isolated, certainly in the first-half, but Englands new headmaster is clearly seeking to develop a system that will allow the team to withstand sustained pressure from more demanding opponents.         
	Finally, England began to find some space, some belief, some momentum. A wonderful pass from Bentley, angled down the inside-right channel, released Jenas, but the Spurs man placed his cross too close to Diego Benaglio. Joe Coles run was all in vain. No matter. The pair were soon to work some magic.         
	The frustration proved momentary. England were clearly building steam. Joe Cole drew two saves from Benaglio, but when the Chelsea midfielder came calling again with five minutes before the interval, Switzerlands resistance broke. This was Cole at his most bewitching, running at a right-back, Stephan Lichtsteiner, with balance and technique his deadly weapons of choice.         
	Cole shaped to go inside, then outside. Poor Lichtsteiner. So deceived by Coles movement, the Lille defender fell over, and the way to the byline was clear. Quickly noting Jenas run, Cole crossed with his right foot and Jenas left did the rest from close range. Capellos England were up and running.         
	These were encouraging times for England, and Rooney almost made it 2-0 with a strong shot that deflected wide. Capello decided to ring the changes, changing personnel, but not the formation. Jenas and Joe Cole came off, Crouch and Wright-Phillips came on, yet 4-1-4-1 persisted. Crouch assumed lone striking role, and Rooney went to the left.         
	As England worked out the changes, Switzerland equalised in the 58th minute. Hakan Yakin and Tranquillo Barnetta combined to send their substitute, Derdiek, away and the youngster crowned his debut with a fine strike, placed past David James.         
	England did not panic. They simply looked to regain their lead. Within four minutes, Gerrard was racing down the inside-left channel before rolling the ball across for Wright-Phillips to tap England ahead. England kept moving brightly, with Rooney shining in a deeper position. Crouch almost scored with a volley from another expert delivery from Bentley. England headed off home buoyed by a decent victory, a performance that improved as the game progressed and delight in the excellent new pitch. But more demanding nights lie ahead.

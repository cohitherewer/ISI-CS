                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amla: Well know shortly if its enough
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: Hashim Amla was heading towards another big innings in the third and final Test at the Green Park here on Friday before Ishant Sharma intervened. He later addressed a news conference after Day Is play.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his innings         
	It was not a conscious effort I played cautiously and tried to support the captain. It was a quick outfield and I hit boundaries But with the spinners coming in it became more difficult.         
	Is the total good enough         
	We will only know whether its good enough when we bowl I thought we lost a few more wickets than we wanted to We would have liked to come out and bat tomorrow (Saturday).         
	The nature of the pitch         
	As a player I would like to play on any pitch  You have to adapt to all kind of surfaces It is a wicket where you are never quite in.         
	Ishant Sharmas performance         
	He bowled quite well Cleaned up the later batsman.         
	His predictions         
	I think the cracks will probably open up more and will be encouraging for both the pacers and the spinners

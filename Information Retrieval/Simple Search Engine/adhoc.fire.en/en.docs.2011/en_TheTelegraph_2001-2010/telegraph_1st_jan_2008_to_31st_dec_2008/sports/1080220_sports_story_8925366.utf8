	London: Arsenal urgently need to rekindle the dazzling form that has taken them to the top of the Premier League when they face European champions AC Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday.         
	On Saturday they gave one of their worst performances during coach Arsene Wengers 11 years at the club when they lost 0-4 at Manchester United in the FA Cup at Old Trafford.         
	If they play that badly again in the first leg of their first knockout round tie against the Italians at the Emirates Stadium, they will seriously undermine their chances of advancing to the quarter finals.         
	Wenger said the prospect of facing Milan meant he would not go crazy pondering Saturdays display.         
	What can I do? Wenger said on his clubs website. I never felt we were really in the game and afterwards that can make you crazy. But I have difficulty being crazy today because I am more worried about the consequences it could have on the team.         
	Arsenal will be strengthened by the return to the starting line-up of Emmanuel Adebayor who had scored for nine successive matches before Saturday when he only appeared for the last 20 minutes as a substitute.         
	Arsenal, unbeaten in 17 Champions League home matches, have played some superb football this season centred on the outstanding Cesc Fabregas, and despite Saturdays uncharacteristic loss, they start as favourites to beat Milan.         
	Even though Milans best performances this season have been reserved for their European ties, if Arsenal hit top form with Aleksandr Hleb, Fabregas and Adebayor all working in unison, Milans grip on the trophy could be prised open.         
	The holders are boosted by the return to the squad of 18-year-old Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato, who is available after missing three games with an ankle injury.         
	Kaka returned in Saturdays 0-0 draw at Parma after missing two matches with tendonitis in his knee and the playmaker looks set to float behind either Alberto Gilardino or Filippo Inzaghi against Arsenal.         
	Goalkeeper Dida has been ruled out after injuring his back while sitting on the bench at Parma but Zeljko Kalac, who had recently taken the Brazilians first team place, is in the squad despite dislocating a finger in training.         
	If Kalacs recovery suffers a setback, third-choice keeper Valerio Fiori is poised for a rare start having not played for Milan since the 2003/04 season.         
	Paolo Maldini, 39, who retires at the end of the season and made his 1,000th career appearance at Parma, said: Arsenal await us but we are the champions. We will perhaps have some players back and the atmosphere will definitely be fantastic.         
	Also on Wednesday Lyon welcome Manchester United, who could recall the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and Owen Hargreaves after resting them against Arsenal, with Giggs set to become just the eighth player to make 100 Champions League appearances.         
	The likes of Ryan and Paul Scholes  players with great experience  will play, United manager Alex Ferguson said. Theyll be important for us.         
	Scholes was only a late substitute on Saturday, when Lyon also rested players in a 0-1 loss at Le Mans that cut Lyons lead at the top of the French league to one point.         
	They left out Brazil striker Fred and used forward Karim Benzema and midfielder Jeremy Toulalan only as late substitutes, but are sure to recall them.         
	FC Barcelona already got one bit of luck in the past week and another could put them on the verge of a place in the quarter finals.         
	Barcelona are at Celtic just four days after the award of a dubious late penalty kick helped them to a 2-1 win at Zaragoza that reignited the Spanish title race.         
	Similar fortune at Parkhead could lead to a crucial away goal and even victory over the Scottish champions, who won all their home group games over the past two seasons, but lost all of those away.

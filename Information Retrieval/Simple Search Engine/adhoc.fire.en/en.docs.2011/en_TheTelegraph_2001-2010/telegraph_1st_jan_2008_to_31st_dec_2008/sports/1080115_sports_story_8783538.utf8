	New Delhi: There was drama at the East Bengal camp in Ludhiana after the red and yellow brigade suffered their seventh defeat in the I-League on Monday. 
    
	According to club sources, soon after East Bengal were vanquished 0-3 by JCT at the Guru Nanak Dev Stadium, team coach Subrata Bhattacharya called the players to his hotel room and offered to resign. 
    
	We have lost eight of the 11 matches in the I-League so far. Under the present circumstances, I shall not continue as the coach, Bhattacharya reportedly told the footballers. 
    
	An emotional Bhattacharya, who won the Federation Cup at the same venue only a few months ago, also asked the players to go all out against arch rivals Mohun Bagan at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. I might not be there but I wish you people all the luck, he said. 
    
	Surprisingly, the players, believed to be having a poor relationship with the coach, rejected Bhattacharyas offer and urged him to stay on. We are also to be blamed for the defeats. You please dont resign. We will turn the tide against Mohun Bagan, they told him. 
    
	Their pleas notwithstanding, Bhattacharyas stint in the East Bengal hot seat could still come to a premature end over the next few days. 
    
	Club officials meet for an executive committee meeting on Wednesday to discuss the teams poor performance. One wouldnt be surprised if the committee called for a change of coach midway the I-League.

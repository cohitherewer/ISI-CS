The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger show not over
                                                                                                                                                                                             Roger show not over
            MARK HODGKINSON IN NEW YORK            Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at a promotional event in New York on Thursday                           
	You have to wonder what Donald Trump makes of it all now. The billionaire tennis enthusiast was in the audience at New York Citys Madison Square Garden in March for Roger Federers exhibition match with Pete Sampras  the occasion was about as artificial as Trumps hair colour, but fun all the same, with a celebration of the Swiss, who seemed to be on his way to breaking the American players record of 14 Grand Slam titles.         
	But when Trump takes his VIP seat at Flushing Meadows over the coming fortnight, as he is expected to, he will find that the mood around Federer is a little earthier. Same city, two different Federers?         
	The US Open begins on Monday, and it promises to be fascinating; Federer has not gone a year without winning a Grand Slam title since the 2002 season. He was once as dominant on a tennis court as Michael Phelps is in the pool and Usain Bolt is on the track, and at the start of the year, most felt it was a question of when, and not if, he would break the golden mark of 14.         
	But Federer has been stuck on 12 majors all year, now ranked No. 2 in the world behind Rafael Nadal, and facing growing suggestions that he could fail in his attempt to become the sports own record-breaker.         
	In all this, it has almost been forgotten that Federer will be trying to win a fifth successive title on the New York cement.         
	The US Open should provide some clarity on what is going on with Federer; if he wins the tournament, he will be just one major short of Sampras, but if he does not, that would be a big fat zero for 2008.         
	Lets put it this way, Petes sleeping a little better than he was a few months ago, John McEnroe said. Hes thinking, Maybe I actually have a chance to hold on to this thing. Its not out of the question that 14 is going to be enough. Its not going to be easy to just mow through it the way most of us thought.         
	Roger is still not old, even in tennis terms, Sampras former coach, Paul Annacone, said. I think his most consistent and dominant years may be behind him, but Im not sure if that means that his best is behind him.         
	There is plenty of great tennis left in him, and I see him passing Petes record of 14 majors.         
	Forget about Madison Square Garden. In New York City, what really matters is what happens at Flushing Meadows.

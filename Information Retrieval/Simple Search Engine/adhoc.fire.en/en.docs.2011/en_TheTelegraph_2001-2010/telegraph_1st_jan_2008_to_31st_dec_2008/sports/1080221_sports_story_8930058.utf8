                                                   IPL wont hamper future tours, says ICC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The two-day ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting concluded in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday with several recommendations to be made to the ICC at its next meeting in March.         
	Among the recommendations that will be made are the following:         
	2011 World Cup format: The CEC will recommend that the ICC approves a 14-team format for the next World Cup which will take place in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in 2011.         
	The suggested new format involves two groups of seven teams with the top four from each group progressing to a knock-out phase that includes quarter finals, semi-finals and a final. The new format, if approved by the ICC, would last 38 days, significantly shorter than the previous edition in 2007.         
	Indian Premier League: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that international commitments would always take priority over IPL. No-objection certificates will be required from respective boards as a condition of all players participation.         
	There has been media speculation about creating a window within the Future Tours Programme (FTP) for IPL matches. The FTP is in place until 2012 and there was no suggestion by the BCCI that such a window should be considered or created prior to that.         
	The ICC will consult with the BCCI to ensure that anti-corruption and anti-doping processes are put in place for the IPL and that a code of ethics be established for the owners of the teams.         
	The members were pleased to receive very clear and unconditional commitment from the BCCI that international matches would be give absolute priority over IPL commitments, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed.         
	At the CEC meeting, members confirmed they did not recognise ICL and would not grant permission for their players to take part in it.         
	Greater use of technology by umpires: The CEC unanimously approved a proposal prepared by ICC management on the greater use of technology in decision-making. This proposal, which was drawn up following directions from the ICC Cricket Committee, suggests putting on trial an umpire decision review system during a Test series.         
	Inappropriate comment and abuse: The Member countries have agreed that ICC will take a zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate public comment and abusive behaviour by players, team officials and individual board members, in accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal up to tied 11th 
                      
	Glenview: A flawless back-nine  studded with four birdies  helped Arjun Atwal get over a front nine slump and the Indian turned in a three-under 69 in the penultimate round to rise to the tied 11th spot in the Nationwide Tours Bank of America Open here.         
	With a three-round total of eight-under 208, Atwal is four strokes behind the leading trio of Australias David Mckenzie (67) and American duo of Skip Kendall (71) and Kris Blanks (69) in the $750,000 event.         
	In Dublin, Ohio, Daniel Chopra stuttered to a four-over 76 in the penultimate round of the Memorial Tournament to drop to tied 36th on the leader-board in the $6 million event.

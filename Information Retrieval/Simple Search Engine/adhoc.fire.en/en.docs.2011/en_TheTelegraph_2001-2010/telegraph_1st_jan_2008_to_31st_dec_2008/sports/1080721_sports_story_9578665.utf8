The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karuns first win of year 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Karuns first win of year 
                      
	Hockenheim: Karun Chandhok survived numerous intrigues and soaked tremendous pressure from his closest rival Andreas Zuber en route to his first win of the year in race two of the GP2 series here on Sunday.         
	The 24-year-old from Chennai, driving for Isport International, started from pole position but soon lost his advantage to Renault F1 test driver Lucas di Grassi and spun his wheels too much as the lights went out.         
	To his credit, Karun ran a solid second in the early laps and closed up onto Di Grassis tail before slipstreaming past.         
	He was soon engaged in a wheel-to-wheel battle with Zuber of Piquet sports for the last 20 laps of the race but kept his cool for a fantastic victory.         
	It was Karuns second career victory in the Formula 1 feeder category. His teammate Bruno Senna finished third.         
	It was a good win, because I had to pass Lucas for the lead and was under pressure all the time, but I had good pace. I think the team did a great job for me. Its a fantastic result, Karun said.         
	Karuns next race is at Hungaroring in Budapest in a fortnights time.           (PTI)

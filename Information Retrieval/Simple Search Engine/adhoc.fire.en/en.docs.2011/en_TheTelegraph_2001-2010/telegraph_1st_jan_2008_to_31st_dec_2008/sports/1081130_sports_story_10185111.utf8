            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa downplayed the dip in intensity from his players in the second half of the match against United SC and said he was happy that the objective of securing full points has been achieved.         
	Some of our players today havent played for some time. Few among them are still lacking in confidence. So I am not worried about the performance in the second half, the Moroccan coach said.         
	I wont think about the negatives. The objective was to get three points We didnt concede It was a very difficult round for us. So, I am very happy for the boys.         
	Bencharifa also said he has not yet decided on the two foreigners for the Federation Cup. The I-League allows a maximum of three foreigners, while only two foreign players can take field in the Federation Cup.         
	Addressing the media, the Bagan coach said his boys needed a break before the start of the Federation Cup. Were giving a three-day break. Well again start practice on Wednesday morning, he said.

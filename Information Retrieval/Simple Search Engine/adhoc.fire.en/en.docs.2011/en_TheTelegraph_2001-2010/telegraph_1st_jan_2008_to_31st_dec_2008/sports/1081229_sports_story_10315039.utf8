	Wellington: A blazing century opening partnership by Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum and tight bowling by Daniel Vettori helped New Zealand to a 36-run victory over the West Indies in their second Twenty20 international on Sunday.         
	Ryder (62) and McCullum (59) smashed the West Indies attack all over the ground in Hamilton to give New Zealand a 130-run opening partnership, though the middle order wasted the great start before the hosts reached 191 for nine.         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan scored a composed 53, while Kieron Pollard (38) and Denesh Ramdin (30) produced cameos at the end of the visitors innings after Vettori, debutant Ewen Thompson and Jacob Oram had strangled the West Indies top order.

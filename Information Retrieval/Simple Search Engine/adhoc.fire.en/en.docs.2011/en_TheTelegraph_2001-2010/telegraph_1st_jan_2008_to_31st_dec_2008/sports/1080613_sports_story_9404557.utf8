The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo can win it with a wink
                                                                                                                                                                                           Ronaldo can win it with a wink
                      
	Geneva: Cristiano Ronaldo whines like a toddler. He dives like a swan. He wears a perpetual smirk.         
	You just want to smack him.         
	But hes soooo good.         
	Ronaldo made a typically dazzling run that set up Portugals first goal, struck a laser-beam drive for the second and dashed off on a breakaway for the third in a 3-1 victory over the Czech Republic on Wednesday, putting his team in the quarter finals of the European Championship.         
	And, of course, after he scored, he made one of those trademark winks with his right eye. The wink that says: Aint I great?         
	The wink he displayed after he helped get Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney ejected from a World Cup match two years ago.         
	Ronaldo may be the best player of Euro 2008, Czech Republic coach Karel Bruckner said. No disagreement was heard.         
	If Portugal win their first major football title, the 23-year-old midfielder named after Ronald Reagan probably will be the reason (his full name is Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, and Reagan supposedly was his fathers favourite actor).         
	With swiveling Elvis Presley hips and Houdini-like feet, he embarrasses defenders in a manner not seen since Diego Maradona in the 1980s. One moment, hes on the left. Then, hes on the right.         
	Sometimes he pushes up into a striker position.         
	His play is so elegant, like the rues and places in this cosmopolitan city, far more stylish than the strasses and platzes of Germanic Zurich, Basel and Berne.         
	He sticks out among his peers, like the Jet DEau fountain that spurts water above Lake Geneva in the city centre.         
	No, make that like Mont Blanc, the Alp that towers above town.         
	This has a chance to be his Euros. Germany, The Netherlands and Spain look to be the biggest obstacles in the knockout phase.         
	But the way hes playing, theres no stopping Ronaldo.           (AP)

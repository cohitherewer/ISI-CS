	Pune: Liberian striker Theo-dore Sundays double strike ensured Chirag United a spot in the final round of the second division I-League here on Wednesday. Theodore struck once in each half to seal a convincing 2-0 victory over local outfit Pune FC.         
	The striker opened his account in the 34th minute when he capitalised on the spade work done by Gouranga Dutta. He added a second from the penalty spot in the 62nd minute after he was fouled by rival keeper N. Balaji inside the box.         
	The win took Chirag Uniteds tally to 10 points as they became the second team to qualify for the final round in Guwahati. (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Opener Phil Jaques will return to Australia due to a back injury, according to Cricket Australia media release on Friday.         
	Australia team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: Phil has had a long standing problem with his lower back that has been manageable till now. The point has come where the injury is significantly limiting his ability to play, so he will return to Australia to seek specialist opinion on the best course of action.         
	Andrew Hilditch, the chairman of the selection panel, said: This is obviously disappointing news for Phil. Were hoping the treatment is successful and he can return to cricket as soon as possible. The NSP will be making a decision in a few days time about Phils replacement on this tour.         
	Jaques did not get a chance to play in the ongoing series as Simon Katich has been opening with Matthew Hayden.

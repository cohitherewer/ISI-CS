	New Delhi: Former world champion Garri Kasparov on Thursday hailed Viswanathan Anands triumph over Vladimir Kramnik.         
	Anand retained his world title with a 24-move draw in the 11th and penultimate game of the World Chess Championship in Bonn on Wednesday.         
	A great result for Anand and for chess. Vishy deserved the win in every way and Im very happy for him. It will not be easy for the younger generation to push him aside, Kasparov was quoted as saying by a chess website.         
	Analysing the performances, Kasparov, who lost to Kramnik in 2000 in London, said Anand had been well prepared to counter his opponent who appeared overly defensive.         
	Anand out-prepared Kramnik completely. In this way it reminded me of my match with Kramnik in London 2000. Like I was then, Kramnik may have been very well prepared for this match, but we never saw it. he said.         
	 While Anand is ranked No. 5 on the Fide rating list for October 2008, he is currently No. 2 on the live top list of the provisional world rankings. On both lists he is behind Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria. On the live list he is on 2790.8 points, with Veselin on 2791.

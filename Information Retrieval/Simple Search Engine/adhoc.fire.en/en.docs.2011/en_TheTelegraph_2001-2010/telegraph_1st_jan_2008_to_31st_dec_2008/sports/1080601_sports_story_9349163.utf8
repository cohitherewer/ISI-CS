	Volte-face on 1983   heroes  Mumbai: The BCCI, after remaining silent for months, has finally decided to celebrate the silver jubilee of India's only World Cup triumph by holding a felicitation in New Delhi on June 22. World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev will be invited, president Sharad Pawar said here on Saturday. ldquo;The felicitation for the members of the 1983 World Cup winning team will be held in Delhi on June 22, rdquo; Pawar said after a book launch programme. ldquo;Yes, Kapil Dev will be invited as he was the captain, rdquo; he said when asked whether the great allrounder, who has aligned himself with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), will be invited. Two other members, who are connected with ICL, Madanlal and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, were also part of the history-making squad on June 25 at Lord rsquo;s.    
	Physio in tow  Mumbai: Nitin Patel, who was attached with the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, will accompany the Indian squad to the tri-series in Bangladesh and the subsequent Asia Cup in Pakistan as physiotherapist, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Saturday. He also said that the BCCI has decided to continue utilising the services of bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh for the two tournaments till a permanent arrangement with full contracts was worked out.    
	 Bedi rsquo;s criticism  New Delhi: Former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi on Saturday strongly criticised Twenty20 cricket, saying the game had ldquo;reached its lowest possible denominator rdquo; in the name of entertainment. ldquo;I must say that cricket has reached its lowest possible denominator. May be it is popular because people have a herd mentality. They tend to follow everything blindly that is new to their eyes and taste without any substance, rdquo; Bedi said. Taking stock of the present day scenario in cricket, Bedi came down heavily on sportspersons and not the sport for deviation from its path.    
	 Malik rsquo;s view  Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik feels that pressure of representing one rsquo;s national team is far greater than playing for any team in the ongoing IPL. ldquo;There is more pressure playing for your country than other teams. I don rsquo;t agree that the IPL matches had lot of pressure. Playing more events like the IPL will benefit us in many ways but national duty remains utmost, rdquo; Malik said after home from Mumbai. Malik insisted he was not disappointed at being excluded from the Delhi DareDevils team on a number of occasions in the inaugural Twenty20 tournament.    
	 Berry rsquo;s formula  Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals director of coaching Darren Berry has attributed the team rsquo;s stupendous success in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to the management rsquo;s fine handling of the players and ensuring that all of them are treated equally. Asked about the influence of captain Shane Warne in the team rsquo;s dreamlike passage into the summit clash, Berry said the legendary spinner has groomed youngsters like Dinesh Salunkhe, Swapnil Asnodkar and Ravindra Jadeja.

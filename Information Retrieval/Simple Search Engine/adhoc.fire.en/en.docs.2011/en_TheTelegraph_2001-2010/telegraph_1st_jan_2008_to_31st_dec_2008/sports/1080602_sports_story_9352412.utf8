The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its late, but Kapil is happy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its late, but Kapil is happy
  - Boards decision to felicitate Indias only (senior) World Cup-Winning Squad         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: Happy, not unhappy...         
	That was Kapil Devs rather business-like response when The Telegraph contacted him for a comment on the Boards decision to felicitate Indias only (senior) World Cup-winning squad, in the lead-up to 25 years of that momentous triumph.         
	Its nice that the parent body has decided to recognise our achievement... Feels good, yes... However, theres nothing more to say, added the talismanic Kapil, who was the captain when we had the world at our feet on June 25, 1983.         
	All this while, the Board had been indifferent, wholly because of Kapils involvement with the Zee-promoted rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Its because of that venture, for example, Kapil got sacked as the National Cricket Academy chairman.         
	Kapil pointed out that another former captain and a member of the World Cup-winning XI, Sunil Gavaskar, had been in a dialogue with the Board.         
	As of now, the felicitation will be over dinner in New Delhi on June 22, a day before Kapils Devils and their families fly over to London for a grand black-tie/national dress dinner at Lords on the Big Day.         
	Look, details are still being worked out, but we could have a golf tournament on the morning of June 22... Some other things are planned too, Kapil said.         
	Apparently, Bangalore Royal Challengers owner Vijay Mallya, in the news for much the wrong reasons recently, is one of the sponsors.         
	Asked if he would use the June 22 dinner to talk about the ICL with the host, Board president Sharad Pawar, Kapil replied: No, that wouldnt be proper... Wouldnt be ethical... That evening should only be about the magnificent Indian team which brought so much joy to the country...         
	Besides Kapil, two other members of the World Cup-winning XI  Madanlal and Balwinder Singh Sandhu  are part of the outlawed ICL.         
	Incidentally, Pawars announcement that the Board would honour the 1983 heroes stumped some in the organisation as well. Frankly, I had no idea that was coming on Saturday evening, remarked a very senior official.         
	Its to be seen, of course, whether the latest development (a rethink, really) will also, in some way, lead to a softening of the Boards stand vis-a-vis the players turning out for the ICL.         
	Right now, they arent eligible to represent India.         
	The money-spinning and eyeballs-grabbing Indian Premier League, it may be recalled, was launched after the ICL.

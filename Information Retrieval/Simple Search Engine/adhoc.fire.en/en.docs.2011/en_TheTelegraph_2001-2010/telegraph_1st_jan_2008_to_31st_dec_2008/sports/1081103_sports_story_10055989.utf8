The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolton beat City 2-0 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bolton beat City 2-0 
                      
	London: Bolton scored twice in the last 13 minutes Sunday to climb out of the Premier League relegation zone with a 2-0 win over visiting Manchester City.         
	 Bolton had missed several chances but refused to settle for a draw that would still have lifted them above Newcastle on goal difference and substitute Ricardo Gardner met a cross from the right for his first league goal since December 2002.         
	 City captain Richard Dunne capped a poor performance by his side, which rarely threatened Bolton despite the presence of Robinho and Shaun Wright-Phillips in their line-up, when he scored an own goal in the 88th minute.         
	 Boltons third win of the season lifted them three places, pushing West Bromwich Albion into the three-team relegation zone on goal difference. Newcastle is now in last place, although they have a chance to push Tottenham back down there if they beat visiting Aston Villa on Monday.

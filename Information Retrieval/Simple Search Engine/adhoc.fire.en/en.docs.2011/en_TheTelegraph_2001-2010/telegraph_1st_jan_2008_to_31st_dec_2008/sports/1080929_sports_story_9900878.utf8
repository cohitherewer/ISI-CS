The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US blank India 3-0
                                                                                                                                                                                                     US blank India 3-0
                      
	San Luis Potosi (Mexico): Indian teams hopes of annexing its first Davis Cup title win went up in smoke after it was blanked 0-3 by the US in the semi-finals.         
	As usual, a lot depended on Delhis Yuki Bhambri, but this time the talented teenager, despite fighting valiantly, could not notch up a win.         
	After Saurabh Singh lost the first singles, Yuki stepped on the court in a must-win situation.         
	However, it was not the first time that the 15-year-old player was facing such a situation. In the Group stage  against Mexico and Great Britain  Yuki had found himself in similar position twice and had delivered.         
	This time though, he could not pull it off for India.         
	In the match between the No. 2 players, Saurabh was comprehensively beaten by Evan King, who pummelled the Indian 6-2, 6-0 to give the US a perfect start.         
	Yuki then lost to Denis Kudla 4-6, 7-6(6), 4-6 which made the doubles match a dead rubber.         
	The Indian combine of Saurabh and V.S. Abhishek then went down fighting 3-6, 6-3, 4-6 against King and Raymond Sarmiento.         
	India had defeated Brazil 2-1 to top Group D to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	Both Yuki and Saurabh had come from behind to beat their respective opponents in the singles before the combination of Saurabh and Venkata Abhiskeh Sakleshpu lost the inconsequential doubles rubber.         
	Saurabh overcame a bad start to beat Henrique Tsukamoto 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to give India a good opening.         
	Yuki then sealed the issue in Indias favour by winning the second singles rubber, defeating Guilherme Clezar 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.                 (PTI)

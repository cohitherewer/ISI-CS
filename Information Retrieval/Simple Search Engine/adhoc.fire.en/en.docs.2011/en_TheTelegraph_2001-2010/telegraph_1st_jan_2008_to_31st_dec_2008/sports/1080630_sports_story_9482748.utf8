                                                                                                                                                                                                     WI struggle to reach 223
                      
	St Georges (Grenada): Captain Chris Gayle hit a half-century on Sunday to help a struggling West Indies reach 223 in the third one-day International at the Grenada National Stadium.         
	Gayle hit 53 off 54 balls and got contributions from Xavier Marshall (35), Ramnaresh Sarwan (31) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (32) before a late-order collapse, with the last seven wickets falling for 63 runs.         
	Nathan Bracken led the bowling attack to finish with three for 26 off nine overs, while Brett Lee (1-36) captured his 300th one-day wicket.         
	Gayle and Marshall shared an opening stand of 86 after Australia won the toss and chose to bowl. Gayle hit five fours and three sixes, including his 100th in one-dayers. Marshall had four fours off 65 balls.         
	Australia needed a bit of luck to make the breakthrough when Mitchell Johnson deflected Marshalls straight drive onto the stumps with non-striker Gayle short of his ground.         
	Marshall departed soon after as he charged Shane Watson and edged to Luke Ronchi, who took a one-handed catch.           (AP)

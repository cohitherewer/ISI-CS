          GOING BACK IN TIME: SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING OLYMPIANS                                  
	IRENA SZEWINSKA-KIRSZENSTEIN           Country: Poland  Date of birth: 1946-05-24  Birthplace: Leningrad (USSR)  Discipline: 100m, 200m, 400m, long jump  World records: 10   Olympic Games (7 medals: 3 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze)    
	A glance into the record books will indicate Irena Szewinska-Kirszenstein as the most successful female athlete Poland has ever produced.         
	Numerous Olympic medals in five different events over four Olympiads in 12 years substantiate the widely-held belief that Kirszenstein, as she was known prior to her marriage in 1967, is a track legend.         
	Born in 1946 to Jewish parents in a refugee camp in Leningrad, by the time she was 14 she was already showing signs of the promise which would later help her regularly climb the highest podium places.         
	Endowed with a superb physique (1.76m/70kg)  a perfect compliment to the rigors of the track  Szewinskas methodical training sessions soon began to bear fruit.         
	Her first Olympic exploit came in Tokyo in 1964 as an unassuming 18-year-old, winning silver medals in the 200m and long jump and a bonus when she ran the second leg in the Polish teams shock victory in the 4x100m relay.         
	Four years later in Mexico City, competing as the 100m world record breaker under the name of Szewinska, she finished third behind Americans, Barbara Ferrell and new world record-holder Wyomia Tyus (11.08 sec).         
	The 200m was a different story, however. Benefiting from the legally-allowed 2.0 mps wind on the day of the race, and despite a slow start, Szewinska improved her Tokyo result by winning gold and setting a new world record of 22.58 sec.         
	Munich (1972) proved a less fruitful Olympiad, with a mere bronze in the 200m. A year after Munich, she switched events, running the 400m and displaying her versatility by becoming the first woman to run one lap of the track in under 50 seconds in only the second 400m race of her career.                           
	SHIRLEY STRICKLAND           Country: Australia  Date of birth: 1925-07-18  Birthplace: Northam  Discipline: 80m hurdles, 100m  World Records: 9 (80m hurdles, 100m, 4x100m relay)  Olympic Games (7 medals: 3 gold, 1 silver, 3 bronze)    
	Having equaled the legendary Fanny Blankers Koens world record (11.0 sec) in the first heat of the 80m hurdles event in the 1952 Olympic Games, Shirley Strickland (De La Hunty) became the first woman to officially break the 11-second barrier in the event the following day.         
	Racing to gold in Australian colours, she almost provoked a diplomatic row when it was undecided which of the British and Australian national anthems should be played.         
	Politics aside, the rightful heir to the crown that had been held by such illustrious athletes as Blankers Koen and Mildred Babe Didrikson fully deserved her triumph.         
	Four years earlier in London the 23-year-old from Western Australia had signaled her serious contention for the Olympic sprint title when she came third behind a triumphant Koen in both the 100m sprint and the 80m hurdles. In the English capital she also ran the opening leg for the 4x100m sprint relay team that went on to win Australias first medal in the event.         
	In Helsinki, it was a different story. Blankers Koen pulled out of the race mid-way due to a carbuncle on her leg, easing the passage for the 27-year-old teacher to collect her first Olympic gold medal.         
	Strickland continued her career throughout the 1950s, although by the time the Melbourne Games took place in 1956, she had become a mother and was also working as an assistant physics and math teacher at Perth Technical College.         
	This, however, only helped her campaign. At the age of 31 Strickland calculated her speed correctly to produce her most successful Olympiad, her third, winning Australias first relay gold in the 4x100m and setting a new world record (44.5 sec), while successfully defending her 80m hurdles title with a two-yard margin.                           
	WILMA RUDOLPH           Country: United States  Date of birth: 1940-06-23  Birthplace: St Bethleham  Discipline: 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay  World records: 5 (100m, 200m, 4x100m)  Olympic Games (4 medals: 3 gold, 1 bronze)    
	That Wilma Rudolph even made it to the Olympic starting gate, let alone strike gold, was a major accomplishment in itself. The 20th child in a family of 22 contracted pneumonia and scarlet fever at the age of four, and later succumbed to a mild attack of polio which caused shrinkage in her left leg.         
	The illness forced the American to wear a brace until the age of nine and then an orthopaedic shoe.         
	But a supportive mother and brothers took it in turns to rub down her legs every day and she shrugged aside her physical imperfections to join in the occasional basketball.         
	Athletics however was her forte, and when she was only 16, she made her first appearance at the Olympic Games, returning from Melbourne in 1956 with a bronze medal from the 4x100m relay.         
	Four years later in Rome Rudolph did not let her supporters down, taking the 100m gold in a wind-assisted world record time of 11.0 sec.         
	Nicknamed the Black Gazelle, and an inspiration for future women athletes such as Florence Griffith-Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the tall slim-line athlete lifted two further titles in the 200m and the 4x100m relay, in the process becoming the first American woman to win three golds and ultimately, the first woman to run 200m in under 23 seconds.         
	She retired early at 22, and went on to set up The Wilma Rudolph Foundation, a non profit-making organisation supporting academic and athletic activity for underprivileged children.                                   
	ULRIKE MEYFARTH           Country: West Germany  Date of birth: 1956-05-04  Birthplace: Francfort-sur-le-Main (Germany)  Discipline: high jump  World records: 3  Olympic Games (2 medals: 2 gold)    
	Ulrike Meyfarth became the youngest ever individual Olympic champion at age 16 when claiming the high jump gold at the 1972 Munich Games and is doubly famous for overcoming a long lean patch and winning a second Olympic crown 12 years later at Los Angeles.         
	Born in 1956 into a modest family Meyfarth was hit with the bug to high jump after watching the great Dick Fosbury during the Mexico Games in 1968.         
	Thanks to the revolutionary flop of the American Olympic champion, young Ulrike began to make rapid progress in her chosen event, and was jumping 1.80m by the age of 15.         
	She achieved her first real sporting exploit in September, 1972 at the Munich Games in front of a delighted home crowd which went wild when the 16-year-old cleared the 1.90m bar on her 2nd attempt during the final, while her two adversaries failed.         
	Assured of victory, she asked the judges to raise the bar to 1.92m, and promptly used her third attempt to equal the world record.         
	The West German athlete then stagnated somewhat. After coming from nowhere to reach the summit of her speciality, she suffered mediocre form for almost a decade until 1982 when she won the European title in Athens, setting a new world record of 2.02m in the process.         
	She improved this record the following year (2.03m) in London before her final Olympic parting shot in Los Angeles, where she overcame the giant Italian and reigning Olympic champion Sara Simeoni to take gold with a jump of 2.02m.                      
	JEANNIE LONGO           Country: France  Date of birth: 1958-10-31  Birthplace: Annecy  Discipline: Road (time-trial), track (pursuit)  World records: 38   Olympic Games (4 medals: 1 gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze)    
	With close to 1,000 victories and 30 world and Olympic medals Frances Jeannie Longo earned the nickname of the Cannibal during her long and successful cycling career which saw her perform at the Athens Games at the ripe old age of 45.         
	A perfectionist who was eternally dissatisfied with her performances, Longo gave womens cycling the respect it sorely lacked throughout the 1980s and 90s, and added her own special aura as much by her consistent feats as by her strong personality.         
	Since the introduction of womens cycling to the Olympic programme in 1984, Longo has barely missed an appointment.         
	In 1979, during the period when she was a keen skier, Longo won her first national title, with the following years consecrated to confirming her talent on different surfaces and races  notably in time trials and mountains, two of her favourite terrains.         
	Along with mediocre performances in the Olympic Games of 1984 and 1988, Longo won three Tour de France races, recorded hour records as if they were going out of fashion, and pedaled her talent worldwide before taking a short break from the sport in 1990.         
	Longo came back, however, for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, where she took her first podium place, although the Grenoble native would have to wait until her fourth Olympic participation, in Atlanta four years later, to win the ultimate prize. She completed her Olympic collection with a bronze medal in the time trial at Sydney in 2000.         
	The autumn of her career proved just as successful. At 42 she collected her 13th world title in 2001. Cyclings Joan of Arc seemed irrepressible, but was equally at home on the racetrack as sitting at home in Grenoble preparing vegetarian meals or playing her piano.

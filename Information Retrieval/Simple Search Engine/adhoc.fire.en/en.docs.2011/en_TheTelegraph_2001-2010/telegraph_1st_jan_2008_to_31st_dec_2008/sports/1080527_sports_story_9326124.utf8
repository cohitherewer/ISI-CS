	Manchester: Andrew Strauss struck his 12th Test century on Monday to help England complete a remarkable six-wicket victory over New Zealand on the fourth day of the second Test at Old Trafford.         
	England, who trailed New Zealand by 179 runs in the first innings, reached their victory target of 294 in the final over before tea.         
	Strauss, recalled to the team in March after being dropped last year, made 106 after productive partnerships with Alastair Cook (out for 19 on Sunday), captain Michael Vaughan (48) and Kevin Pietersen (42 run out).         
	England, resuming on 76 for one after dismissing the Kiwis for only 114 in their second innings, also bettered the previous highest fourth innings winning total at Old Trafford. They scored 231 to defeat the West Indies four years ago.         
	The fall of Strauss, caught at slip off Iain Brien, and Pietersen, run out attempting a second run, created brief tension for England as they went from 235 for two to 248 for four.         
	But Ian Bell, unbeaten on 21, and Paul Collingwood, (24 not out), saw them home, despite Brien dropping an easy chance from Bell off his own bowling.           (REUTERS)

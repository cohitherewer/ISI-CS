                                                Technology the only answer: Shepherd
            SIMON BRIGGS                      
	David Shepherd has called for more technological help for officials after the flare-up in Australia. Shepherd, 67, whose total of 92 Tests is exceeded only by Steve Bucknors 120, believes it is unfair that viewers at home have better information than the men making the decisions. He has personal experience of what he calls trial by television  a media storm after an England collapse at Old Trafford in 2001 in which four wickets fell to unnoticed no balls came close to driving him into retirement.         
	Technology has got to be used more, Shepherd said. We are judged by technology and people have started thinking that the technology is better than the umpires. Thats not true: on an lbw appeal, an umpire is better placed to judge whether the ball will hit the stumps. But perhaps the TV could help check whether there was an inside edge.         
	Cricket will lose something of its spirit as more decisions are referred but ultimately it is a game for players, not for umpires, and something has to be done.         
	Shepherds feelings are shared by some of the top men at the ICC. The incoming president, David Morgan, takes a particularly strong stance. Increasingly theres a view that we have to embrace technology more than we are, he said. The executive board will be looking at this at our next meeting in March.         
	Shepherds main concern is that the use of replays and other aids should not add too many interruptions. Perhaps the system where each team can call for a certain number of referrals could be the way forward.         
	Shepherd is also worried about the strain on the umpires. When I see things like this, I think Thank God Ive retired. I went through the wringer with the Old Trafford Test and it nearly finished me.         
	I cant imagine what the guys out in Australia are going through now. Imagine if this had happened in the first of two back-to-back games: someone would have had to turn around and go back out there just a couple of days later.

  - Former world No.1 on adam gilchrists decision to quit         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             Adam Gilchrist returns to the pavilion on Sunday. Despite scoring only 14, he received a standing ovation when he walked in and out of the Adelaide Oval                                 
	Adelaide: World record-holder Adam Gilchrists decision to quit all forms of cricket after the forthcoming tri-series has stunned the fraternity. On Sunday afternoon, The Telegraph spoke to his predecessor and one-time No.1, Ian Healy.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On whether Gilchrists decision stumped him         
	Wouldnt say so... Not really... For the past month, I could sense hed been debating in the mind... Hed been covering up those emotions, trying to battle through them... The emotions came out through the dropped chances and Gilchrist probably worked out that he wasnt covering up too well... Realised he didnt have the energy to recover... I think he timed it well and, as we all say, only the man himself knows that moment. Gilchrist owned up to the feelings within.         
	On whether the media in Australia needlessly went after Gilchrist for the slip-ups         
	He gave the media more than one miss to focus on... He had a bad day in Sydney and he admitted it was a shocker and, then, dropped (V.V.S.) Laxman here... Gilchrist wasnt used to being so critically analysed... He didnt have the energy to put that aside and concentrate only on technique and tactics. Obviously, he wasnt being as diligent as he used to be with his preparations. I think, therefore, he got it right.         
	On whether theres a right time to retire         
	(Grins) Of course, yes, when you havent got the energy to perform to the standards youve set for yourself... You can cover that up for a little while and get away with it, but youve got to quickly bounce back... To do that, you need energy.         
	On his own experience, when he left in 1999         
	As I told you recently, it had become a mental thing... My own game was built around a solid preparation, but Id stopped enjoying training... It became a chore.         
	On the Gilchrist legacy         
	Hes been at the pinnacle of the entertaining style thats Australian cricket... He played with great flair and his legacy is intimidating... Intimidating for the one succeeding him and, indeed, wicketkeepers around the world... If the selectors start looking for too many Gilchrists, then theyll be disappointed. Gilchrist has been a once in a generation keeper.         
	On the selectors, who havent found replacements for Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, probably having another headache         
	It wont be as big an issue as it couldve been had the most likely replacement, Brad Haddin, not been performing so well in whatever international exposure hes been getting and in domestic cricket (for New South Wales)... Id go to the extent that hes closest in world cricket to being Gilchrist... Its a lot different than having to pluck out a 25-year-old almost out of nowhere.         
	On whether the pressure could get to Haddin         
	Because of his experience, no. Hes played ODIs and has been on tours... My advice to Haddin would be that he should play his natural game instead of worrying about the expectations...         
	Finally, on what he told Gilchrist when he telephoned him on Saturday evening         
	That Id thought hed play for a couple of months more and create a gap between him and (Mark) Boucher... But it was obvious Gilchrist had had enough.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev takes four-stroke lead 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev takes four-stroke lead 
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Vienna: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh took a four-stroke lead on Saturday after the second round of the Austrian Open, a tournament reduced to 54 holes after rain ruined the first days play.         
	The 36-year-old 2006 Volvo Masters winner signed off his round of eight-under 63 on Saturday by rolling in a 40-foot eagle putt on the ninth, his 18th hole, to move to 15 under par.         
	Its not very often you can get to 15 under for two rounds and I cant remember the last time I did that, Jeev told reporters.         
	I was pleased with the way I managed myself on the course because when a player gets to a certain score, anxiety can creep in but I didnt get ahead of myself.         
	After compiling a two-round total of 127, Singh heads Britains Simon Wakefield, who carded his 65 by picking up five shots in six holes from the 12th.         
	Australian Peter Fowler, who celebrates his 49th birthday on Monday, is a further stroke back after a 67, sharing third place with New Zealands Mark Brown. Leader Singh collected six birdies to go with his closing eagle to put himself on course for his third European Tour title after two second places this season.         
	Now that the next round is also the last round, I am obviously thinking about winning but tomorrow I shall try to stay in the present and see what comes my way, added Jeev.

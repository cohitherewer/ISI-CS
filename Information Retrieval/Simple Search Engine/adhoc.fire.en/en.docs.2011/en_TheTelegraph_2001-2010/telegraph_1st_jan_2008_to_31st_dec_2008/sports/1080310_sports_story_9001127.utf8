                                                   BCCI gags Harbhajan
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: The BCCI has asked Harbhajan Singh to stop talking to the media on the just-concluded tour of Australia. Yes, we received a mail from Cricket Australia about Harbhajan Singh. He has been told not to talk to the media on the Australian tour. He has to accept our directive, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	Harbhajan has denied to have called Matthew Hayden a liar and Adam Gilchrist no saint, but CA is furious on the reported outburst and has asked the BCCI to take action against the off-spinner.         
	According to an Australian newspaper, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is investigating Harbhajans reported outburst against Hayden and Gilchrist to nip in the bud any open conflict between the BCCI and CA.         
	We are aware of Harbhajan Singhs comments and are in dialogue with the two boards (Australia and India), an ICC spokesman was quoted as saying.

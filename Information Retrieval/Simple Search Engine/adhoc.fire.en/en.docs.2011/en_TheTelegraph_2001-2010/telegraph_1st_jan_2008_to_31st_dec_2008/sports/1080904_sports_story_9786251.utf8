The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary Kirsten has expressed his personal view: Vengsarkar 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gary Kirsten has expressed his personal view: Vengsarkar 
    - Dont think it would be proper to speak on the leadership skills of either Kumble or Dhoni             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Kumble    
	Calcutta: Team India coach Gary Kirstens comment that ODI and Twenty20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was ready for the job at the Test level too hasnt caused a storm, but has definitely created a ripple or two.         
	A coach doesnt have a role in the captains appointment, but hes in an important position and could influence the people who matter.         
	Greg Chappell, for example, did just that for much of his 23-month tenure. Kirstens profile, however, is pretty different.         
	Getting back to what the coach said, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar, for one, chose not to encourage what could become an issue of some debate.         
	Kirsten has expressed his personal view and I dont wish to react, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday morning, he added: As a matter of principle, I avoid saying anything on individuals Also, being the selection committee chairman, I dont think it would be proper to speak on the leadership skills of either Kumble or Dhoni         
	Vengsarkar (a former India captain, by the way) pointed out that, in any case, the captain for the next Test series  a four-match affair at home, versus Australia  would be picked by the new selection committee.         
	Our term ends later this month We wont be appointing the captain for the series against Australia, he stated.                   Dhoni      
	While Dhoni is days away from completing 12 months as the ODI and Twenty20 captain, Kumbles debut (in a full-fledged role) was in November last year.         
	In fact, at one stage, after Sachin Tendulkar declined the captaincy, Dhoni had been favoured to lead in the Tests as well. However, Vengsarkar and Co. felt that the Test captain needed to be somebody with experience.         
	Kumble, it may be noted, has completed 18 years of international cricket  his India debut had actually been only a few months after Sachins  and hes been focusing on Tests alone from after the 2007 World Cup.         
	The recent Test series in Sri Lanka didnt go off well, but Kumble had been absolutely outstanding (on and off the field) during last seasons high-on-profile clash in Australia.         
	We lost that series 1-2, but with some luck (and proper umpiring at the SCG, in particular), the result could even have been 2-1 in our favour.                     
	Dhoni, on the other hand, has registered memorable firsts in the shorter forms of the game.         
	Not that it should be a factor in Test cricket, but Dhoni (27) is a good 10 years younger than Kumble.

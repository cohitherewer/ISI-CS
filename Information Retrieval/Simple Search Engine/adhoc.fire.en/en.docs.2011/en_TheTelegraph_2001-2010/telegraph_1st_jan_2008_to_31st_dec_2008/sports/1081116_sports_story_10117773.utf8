                                                                                                                                                                                                     Churchill held by Mumbai FC
                      
	Margao: A lapse on the part of goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya allowed Mumbai FC to come from behind and hold Churchill Brothers to a 2-2 draw in the ONGC I-League, played at Nehru Stadium, Margao, here Saturday.         
	Mumbai FC took the lead in the 10th minute through Abhishek Yadav which was neutralised by Odafe Okolie in the 20th minute as both the teams led 1-1 at half time.         
	Churchill Brothers, who had the lions share of the possession in the second half, went ahead in the 70th minute through Reisangmi Vashum as his goal-bound cross from the right deflected off rival defender Sanjay Parte and eluded keeper Kalyan Chaubey to find the far post.         
	Mumbai FC equalised five minutes later through a soft goal. Following a flag kick, Wilson floated the ball into the box, keeper Arindam Bhattacharya charged out to collect the aerial ball but failed to hold on to it as the ball popped out of his hand and fell to an unmarked Kulothungan who shot into the empty net from the top of the box.         
	The draw took Churchill Brothers to 13 points from 8 matches. While Mumbai FC have collected 11 points from as many outings.         
	The early domination by the visitors helped them to take the lead when Abel Hammond played the ball to Abhishek Yadav who unleashed a shot that found the net.         
	The goal was a wake-up call for Churchill Brothers to regroup, and they equalised ten minutes later through Odafe Okolie.           (PTI)

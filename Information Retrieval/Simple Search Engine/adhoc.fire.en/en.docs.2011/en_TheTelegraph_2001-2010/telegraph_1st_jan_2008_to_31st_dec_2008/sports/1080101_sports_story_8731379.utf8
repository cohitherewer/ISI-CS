	Perth: Tennis authorities have a tough task to stop match fixing because it is too easy to fix results, said Martina Navratilova. 
    
	Navratilova, the winner of 59 Grand Slam titles, said the sport had to do whatever it takes to put an end to the scandals that rocked tennis in 2007. 
    
	A match involving Russian world No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko in August is one of several under investigation because of irregular betting patterns. 
    
	Several players on the mens tour have admitted being offered money to throw a match but all insist they refused the bribes. Its pretty new this match fixing idea, Navratilova said at the Hopman Cup in Perth on Monday. 
    
	So well see where it goes (but) of course, if it is a problem, its pretty easy to throw a tennis match because its so hard to prove. 
    
	We have to make sure that the sport stays clean, both on the drug side as well as any kind of betting scandal. We have to keep it clean whatever it takes.

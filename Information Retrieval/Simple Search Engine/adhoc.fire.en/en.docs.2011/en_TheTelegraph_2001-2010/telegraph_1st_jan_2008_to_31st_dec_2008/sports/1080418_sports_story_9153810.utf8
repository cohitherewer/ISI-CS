            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Some of Indias leading sportspersons, who took part in the Olympic torch relay on Thursday, admitted that the occasion was reduced more into a tense security operation than a celebration.         
	Hockey star Dhanraj Pillay, who flew down to Delhi on Wednesday night to participate in the relay, said he expected more spectators for the show.         
	 I was saddened by the fact that the lawns on both sides of the road were empty when we ran. Some of the greatest names in Indian sports were there, yet there was hardly anyone to watch them.         
	Pillay, however, said that he enjoyed the show thoroughly. It is an enjoyable experience to be associated with the Olympics. I would have been happy to see more children running with us. They are the future of the country.         
	Long jumper Anju Bobby George also echoed similar sentiments. There was too much security around. I believe no common man was allowed to come and watch the relay. But then, the organisers were not left with any other option. The situation was such.         
	Former superstar Milkha Singh said he was proud to be a part of the relay. All those who were called for the run should have participated, he felt. Yes, there was tight security around. But under the circumstances, that was necessary.

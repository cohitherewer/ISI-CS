The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wet conditions will make it tricky: Chowrasia
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wet conditions will make it tricky: Chowrasia

	Calcutta: Golf-lovers in the city would be hoping for the rain-gods to show some mercy as top Indian golfers, including S.S.P. Chowrasia, lock horns in the Rs 30-lakh prize-money Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) Players Championship at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) from Wednesday.         
	Incessant rain has been lashing the city from Monday night and the weather was on everybodys lips at the RCGC during a news conference, including the players and the organisers.         
	The practice sessions scheduled for Tuesday had already been washed out robbing the golfers of some vital practice.         
	The wet conditions make the course tougher for the short hitters, Chowrasia said.         
	Wet conditions make it more difficult than the normal course. The long hitters definitely get more advantage in these conditions, the local lad said.         
	You have to endure the weather, its irritating.         
	Chowrasia will leave the city on Sunday to play a tournament in Paris and would then play two tournaments in London.         
	The four-day tournament which ends on Saturday, would be followed by a Pro-Am competition the next day. The tournament is the first professional golf event hosted by the city in about two-and-a- half years.         
	Expressing his concern, PGTI Tour commissioner Ajai Gupta said: Its something unfortunate. We decided to organise the tournament now since monsoon generally comes in the city in July.         
	The PGTI would hold four events annually in Chandigarh, Calcutta, Coimbatore and Pune.

	New Delhi: A wrist surgery may have forced Sania Mirza out of action for a month but the Indian tennis ace has still managed to gain a spot in the WTA rankings, rising to the 30th position in the latest list issued on Monday.         
	Sania, whose wrist was operated upon last week in the US, now has 917 points. Sanias doubles standing has also improved by three notches to 19th this week. She has 1830 points in the doubles list.         
	Meanwhile, in the ATP doubles rankings, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi held steady at their 13th and 24th positions respectively. Paes and Bhupathi were seen in action together for the first time since their 2006 Asian Games spat in the Davis Cup tie against Japan last week.

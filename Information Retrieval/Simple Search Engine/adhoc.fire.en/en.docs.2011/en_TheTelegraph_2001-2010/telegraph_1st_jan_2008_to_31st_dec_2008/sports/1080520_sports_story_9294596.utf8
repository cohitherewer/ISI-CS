The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will have to match the Royals freedom and flair
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We will have to match the Royals freedom and flair
    - Though we lost on D/L method, our boys showed skill, enterprise and spirit                   MIND GAMES    John Buchanan                            
	Chennai Super Kings may have batted themselves into a strong position to force a win chasing 150 on Sunday evening but there will forever remain a question mark over the final outcome as first the lights, then the weather intervened to force a decision on Duckworth-Lewis method.         
	Our boys once again showed skill, enterprise and spirit, most visibly Salman Butt, Debabrata Das, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Wriddhiman Saha.         
	Apart from a handful of balls, the bowlers had the ball in the right areas. Stephen Fleming and Parthiv Patel used the hardness of the new ball effectively and had the game definitely poised in their favour but with no certainty of the game finishing that way.         
	So where does that leave us?         
	We are within one victory of fourth place and must win on Tuesday against tournament favourites Rajasthan Royals to remain in the race. This would seem a daunting task as the Royals come here with eight wins from 10 games.         
	Shane Watson, with 333 runs and 12 wickets, has controlled the game at the top of their batting and then with the ball. On the batting front, the less elegant but nonetheless as effective Graeme Smith has compiled over 300 runs in very similar fashion.         
	Add the unorthodox dash of Swapnil Asnodkar, the ferocious hitting of Yousuf Pathan and the middle order work of Ravindra Jadeja, and it is obvious why Rajasthan have won the games they have, especially setting themselves on most occasions to chase totals (where their record is six out of six).         
	Their defence has been based around the likes of Munaf Patel, Watson, Siddharth Trivedi, Sohail Tanvir and Shane Warne.         
	They have used the pace, swing and bounce of the new ball well; through the middle and end they have used their change of pace, the slower bowling of Warne or sometimes Pathan and very good full and yorker balls to force errors from batsmen.         
	Warnes captaincy, as always, is controlled and creative. There is no doubt he reads the game well and injects the bowler or field change which he believes will create an opportunity for his team. As a consequence, the Royals are playing with great team and individual confidence.         
	They come into this game almost into the semi-finals and such confidence gives them the ability to play with complete freedom  they can take risks with team selections, with on-field decisions that other teams are less prone to do owing to the feelings that risks can lead to errors.         
	For the Knight Riders, it is our task to match that freedom and flair  to put the end of season to one side and enjoy the opportunity to play the top side in the competition.         
	And to our King, Shah Rukh Khan I find it amazing that with the tournament almost complete, the anti-corruption unit believe his presence in and around the team has contravened ICC codes.         
	If there is one thing SRK has done it is to ensure wherever he goes, he uses neither position nor privilege to gain special treatment. His presence for our team has been of immeasurable value. And his presence for the IPL and everything he is trying to do is, and will continue to be, a significant factor in the ongoing success of this venture.           GAMEPLAN

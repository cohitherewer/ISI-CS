	New Delhi: I-League leaders Dempo Sports Club, who unexpectedly lost to Mahindra United on Saturday, suffered yet another blow when their coach Armando Colaco met with a road accident in Goa on Sunday night. 
    
	According to club sources, Colaco, who twice led Dempo to victory in the National Football League (NFL), will be operated on his right knee on Tuesday and could be out of action for three months. 
    
	The star coach was returning home on Sunday night when his motorbike skidded off the road in Raia on the outskirts of Margao. Colaco was immediately taken to Vintage Hospital in Panjim. 
    
	The coach has suffered multiple fractures on his right knee, said a source in Dempo. The doctors attending on him wanted to operate on Monday but couldnt do it because of the patients unstable blood pressure and sugar problem. 
    
	Now Colaco will be operated on Tuesday. The doctors have also asked him to take full rest for three months. 
    
	The Dempo coach is believed to have told some of the team members that he might defy doctors advice and go to Calcutta to be present for the match against East Bengal. 
    
	Dempo are currently leading the I-League table with 27 points followed by JCT (25). Also in the race are Churchill Brothers (23) and Mohun Bagan (20).

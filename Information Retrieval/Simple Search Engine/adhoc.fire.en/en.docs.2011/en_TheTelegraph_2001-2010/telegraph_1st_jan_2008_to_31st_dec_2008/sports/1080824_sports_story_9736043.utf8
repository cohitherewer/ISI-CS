The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC may have to defer Champions Trophy
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ICC may have to defer Champions Trophy
  - Pakistans acting president yet to appoint the next board chairman       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            The victorious Aussie team with the 2006 Champions Trophy in Mumbai                                 
	Calcutta: With holders Australia expected to go South Africas way and logistics apparently being an issue in shifting next months Champions Trophy from Pakistan to Sri Lanka, the International Cricket Council (ICC) may have no choice but to defer the tournament.         
	With things so unsettled in Pakistan at this point in time, my gut feeling is that the (September 12-28) Champions Trophy will have to be postponed till next year As we talk, I dont think any other option is feasible, a well-placed source, very closely associated with the ICC, told The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Broadcast partner ESPN STAR Sports, it seems, has strong reservations over a change in venue at this 11th hour and the bit about being able to raise adequate revenue is also now in doubt.         
	Thats significant.         
	The well-placed source said that the broadcast partner had already sent a detailed communication to the ICC.         
	Where the ICC is concerned, yet another teleconference of its Executive Board has been scheduled, this time on Sunday afternoon.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India, one understands, wont mind if the tournament is deferred till 2009. In fact, it could actually propose that.         
	Pushing the Champions Trophy to next year (assuming thats the decision), though, is likely to create its own problems. The second edition of the World Twenty20, after all, is already part of the calendar and many adjustments will have to be made.         
	Clearly, David Morgan and Co. arent in an enviable position. But, then, the ICC is to be blamed for being so indecisive on a critical matter.         
	Things have changed for the worse after Pervez Musharrafs resignation as President It has also left a vacuum in the Pakistan Cricket Board as his appointee as chairman, Dr (Nasim) Ashraf, chose to step down as well. All this has happened in the past few days, the well-placed source pointed out.         
	Till late on Saturday, Dr Ashrafs successor hadnt been named. Ijaz Butt is, of course, favoured to take over.         
	The countrys President (in his capacity as the Boards patron) appoints the chairman and, obviously, acting President Mohammedmian Soomro has a lot on his plate.         
	Meanwhile, with all the tamasha over the tournament, the teleconference to review the umpire referrals experiment has been put on hold.         
	The referrals were on trial during the recent India versus Sri Lanka Test series.         
	According to an ICC spokesman, who was contacted in Dubai, that teleconference will now be held on September 1.

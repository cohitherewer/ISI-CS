The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani clinches title
                                                                                                                                                                                           Advani clinches title
                      
	Chennai: World snooker champion Pankaj Advani survived a cliffhanger of a 285-minute final to win the title 6-5 against a fighting Manan Chandra in the Alliance Group-ASCA Invitational snooker tournament on Sunday.         
	Advani, who won a double (point and time format) in the IBSF World Billiards championship at home in Bangalore last week, led 4-1 in the best of 11 frame final but paid the penalty for slackness as Chandra seized the opportunity to level the frame score.         
	Advani could have claimed the match earlier after having secured a 81 clearance in the fourth frame but perhaps lost his concentration due to the noise created by the spectators in the packed hall.         
	Both the players were error-prone mid-way of the match and the way a majority of the frames were decided on higher colours indicated the closeness of the encounter.         
	Chandra claimed the tenth frame with a decisive and bold approach on the black and in the decider Advani gained some points. (PTI)

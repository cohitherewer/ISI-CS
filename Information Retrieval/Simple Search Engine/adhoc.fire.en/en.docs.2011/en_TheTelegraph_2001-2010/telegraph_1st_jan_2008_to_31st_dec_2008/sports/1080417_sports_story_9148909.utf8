The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC scanner on Kanpur pitch

            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                       
	Calcutta/Mumbai: Close on the heels of Match Referee Roshan Mahanamas thumbs-down to the Kanpur dustbowl where India tamed South Africa in three days, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shot off a letter to the Indian cricket board seeking an explanation.         
	Mahanama was less than impressed after the third and final Test at the Green Park ended with two days to go with the hosts cantering to an eight-wicket win that also helped them level the three-match series.         
	Yawning cracks and uneven bounce made life difficult for the batsmen on the track, prompting Mahanama to submit an unflattering report to the ICC.         
	Reacting on Mahanamas report, ICC sent a letter to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), seeking an explanation.         
	A letter has been sent to the BCCI. The process was initiated by Match Referee Roshan Mahanama and the ICC sent a letter to the BCCI after getting his report. We are awaiting a reply, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Wednesday.         
	BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, however, sought to downplay the event and refused to call it a notice from the ICC.         
	Its a normal process where the Match Referee submits a pitch report to the ICC at the end of the match, a copy of which is also given to the board, he said.         
	This is not the first time that a match ended in three days. Definitely there were suggestions for some corrective measures but I dont think it was a notice to the BCCI, Shetty said.         
	After a match, the Match Referee has to give his assessment of the track and if he finds it unfit or sub-standard, the ICC takes note of that and seeks an explanation from the host board.         
	The BCCI has to respond within 14 days according to the rules, following which it will reviewed by general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson and chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, said an ICC spokesman from Dubai.         
	If the BCCIs explanation fails to convince the ICC, the world governing body can even ban Kanpur from hosting international matches, which is the extreme punishment. They can also let them off with a warning.         
	India coach Gary Kirsten, however, said there was nothing wrong in taking the home advantage as long as the tracks were not dangerous for the visiting sides.         
	Kirsten, who received a cash prize of $75,000 and a shield from Speed on behalf of captain Anil Kumble for India finishing second on the ICC rankings behind Australia, said that different countries offered different conditions and no one should complain.         
	As far as I am concerned, India won the Test match in Kanpur. I have no issues on the pitch. I leave it to the BCCI. There are different (pitch) conditions in different countries. Succeeding away from home is a big challenge, the former South African opener said.         
	Former South African captain Kepler Wessels also didnt see any problem with the Green Park pitch.         
	India played well and I think there was no problem with the pitch. In a foreign country, you expect the hosts play according to their strength, Wessels, who is currently coach of the IPL team Chennai Super Kings, said on his arrival in Chennai on Wednesday.         
	I dont see the pitch as an issue as far as I am concerned. In fact, I was surprised that the two other tracks (Chennai, Ahmedabad) did not turn that much, Wessels, who was part of the commentary team during the series, said.

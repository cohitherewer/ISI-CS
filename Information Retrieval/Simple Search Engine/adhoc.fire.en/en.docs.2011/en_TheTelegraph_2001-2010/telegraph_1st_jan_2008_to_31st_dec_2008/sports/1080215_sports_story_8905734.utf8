                                                     Mahela: Aussies under pressure
                  Mahela Jayawardene                     
	Perth: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene on Thursday said his team would try to capitalise on the vulnerabilities in Ricky Pontings team when the two sides face off in a tri-series encounter at the Waca on Friday.         
	It is a good opportunity for us to go on top of the table. Weve got back into the tournament and the guys can really build up on that, Jayawardene said.         
	Australia are coming off a defeat against India in their last match at the MCG and the Sri Lankan captain indicated that the hosts are low on confidence.         
	They (Australia) are a bit under pressure. In batting, there are two or three guys who have been performing consistently, but the rest havent been.         
	In the past, the Australians have found ways to get back into games. In the last six months I think theyve lost that belief in themselves. If we can push them back, we can create more pressure, Jayawardene said.         
	The form slump in which rival captain Ricky Ponting finds himself also did not escape Jayawardenes attention.         
	Hes had a quiet time and hopefully we can keep him under the same pressure he has been under for the last two months, he said.         
	It is in our interest to keep him like that.         
	Australia have made two changes in the playing XI they fielded against India in Melbourne with James Hopes and Brad Hogg replacing Stuart Clark and Brad Haddin.         
	The last game (against India) was crucial for us and we showed character. Winning the toss was an advantage and even though they batted really well, we planned the chase brilliantly, Jayawardene said.         
	Teams         
	Australia (likely): Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Michael Hussey, James Hopes, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Chamara Silva, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Kapugedera, Ferveez Mahroof, Lasith Malinga, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Tharanga, Nuwan Kulasekera, Chanaka Welegedara, Ishara Amarsinghe.         
	Match starts: 10.00am (IST).           (AGENCIES)

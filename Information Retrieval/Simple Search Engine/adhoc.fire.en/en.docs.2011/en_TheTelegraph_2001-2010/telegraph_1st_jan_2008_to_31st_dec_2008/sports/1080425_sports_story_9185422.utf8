            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan doesnt want to break the winning combination ahead of the teams third outing against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in Chennai.         
	After a two-and-half hour training session at the Eden on Thursday morning, the lanky former Australia coach said that he has no plans of changing the XI that clinched two successive wins.         
	We will possibly keep the same team for the Chennai match, Buchanan said when asked about the combination for the Chennai encounter.         
	On whether West Indies captain Chris Gayle will have any specific role in the tie, the 55-year-old said that the left-hander will be travelling with the team but any decision of him playing will be taken after a fitness test.         
	He will be travelling with the team on Friday, he said.         
	Gayle, the first to hit a century in the ICC World Twenty20, joined the Knight Riders squad on Wednesday morning. He preferred staying in hotel during the days practice session.         
	Yeah, Chris did have a niggle coming from the West Indies He will have to go through the same fitness test that Salman Butt and Umar Gul would be subjected to For now he will be part of the squad, Buchanan said.         
	Meanwhile, skipper Sourav Ganguly along with most of his teammates skipped the days practice but Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, Brendon McCullum of New Zealand and local recruits Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda and Debabrata Das braved the searing heat for a strenuous session.

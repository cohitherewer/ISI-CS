	Calcutta: India collected $75,000 for reaching second spot while Australia, who maintained their supremacy in the ICC Test Championship table bagged $175,000 at a ceremony held in Mumbai on Wednesday.         
	According to an ICC release, the Aussies finished 30 rating points clear of India with four wins, one defeat and one draw in Test cricket during the 12-month period up to 31 March 2008.         
	But the South Africans edged out Ricky Pontings side by a fraction of a rating point to top the ODI table, winning 21 and losing eight during the same 12-month period.         
	While Australia have retained the ICC Mace for a fourth year in a row after finishing as the top Test side, South Africa have picked up the ICC Shield for being this years top-ranked side in the ICC ODI Championship.         
	Australia and South Africa received $175,000 each for their achievements.         
	Pontings side pocketed an additional $75,000 for finishing as runner-up in the limited over Championship.         
	Ricky Ponting, former South Africa captain Shaun Pollock and India coach Gary Kirsten received the cheques in the ceremony.         
	[Ponting, however, said that India posed a serious threat to Australias Test cricket supremacy, adds an agency. India certainly have a great team together at the moment and South Africa have played excellent cricket for a number of years in both forms of the game. So we just have to wait and see, he said after collecting the ICC Mace.]         
	The ICC on Wednesday announced that Reliance Mobile has been roped in as the new sponsor of the ICC Team and Player Rankings through to 2015. The rankings will now be known as the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings and the Reliance Mobile ICC Test and Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Rankings.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Krejza left out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Spinner Jason Krejza was Monday replaced by Nathan Hauritz in the 13-member Australian squad for the second cricket Test against South Africa starting December 26 here.         
	Australias national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said Krejzas axing was prompted by his below-par display in the opening Test in Perth.         
	THE SQUAD: Ricky Ponting (Capt.), Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Matthew Hayden, Ben Hilfenhaus, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Peter Siddle, Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson.

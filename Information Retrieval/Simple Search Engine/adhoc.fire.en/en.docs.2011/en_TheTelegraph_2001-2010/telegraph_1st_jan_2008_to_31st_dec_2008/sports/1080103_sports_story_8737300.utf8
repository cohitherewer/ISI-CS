The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A new year gift: VRV
                                                A new year gift: VRV
                      
	Chandigarh: For Punjab pacer VRV Singh, his unexpected call-up for Down Under to replace injured Zaheer Khan, is a pleasant new year gift.         
	VRV, who is familiar with the conditions in Australia, feels that his experience would help him to deliver the goods.         
	I was in Australia two years back and have some knowledge about the pitches there. I will play according to my strength and will bowl according to the nature of the wicket. I hope to perform and do well, VRV said on Wednesday.         
	VRV said he would make the most of the opportunity and approach the game with a clear mind.         
	You never expect such a call mid-way through the tour. It has been like a godsend opportunity, said the 23-year-old who made his Test debut in 2006 against the West Indies.         
	Asked whether he would be under any pressure to perform, VRV said, I am not going to take any kind of pressure.         
	I am not going there worrying about what has happened in the past. My focus will be on playing my natural game and bowling well, he said.         
	Punjabs Ranji coach Gurcharan Singh was happy about the tall pacer getting a call-up. I am happy for him. He is a very good bowler and has been in terrific rhythm recently. We expect him to do well, Gurcharan said.           (PTI)

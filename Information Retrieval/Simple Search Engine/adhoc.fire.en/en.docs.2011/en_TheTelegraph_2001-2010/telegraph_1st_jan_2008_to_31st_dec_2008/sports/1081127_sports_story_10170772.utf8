The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo edge past EB
                                                                                                                                                                                             Dempo edge past EB
                  Climax Lawrence scored the winner                     
	Margao: Climax Lawerence struck a crucial goal in the second half to help Dempo edge past a fighting East Bengal in the ONGC I-League match at Nehru stadium here Wednesday.         
	After a goalless first half, the all-important goal came in the 78th minute when a move between Roberto Mendes Dsilva and Ranty Martins saw the latter play a pass to Lawerence into the box who shot home past keeper Subrata Paul.         
	Both the teams played attacking football. East Bengal played with more determination as they came up with swift counter moves that caught the rival defence napping but failed to utilise the chances.         
	Dempo who had better ball possession made the first move in the seventh minute but Ranty directed his header off target.         
	The win takes Dempos tally to 17 points from 10 matches, the same as Churchill brothers but are placed fourth because of inferior goal difference.         
	East Bengal remained on seventh place with 12 points from 10 matches.         
	East Bengal had a chance to surge ahead but Yusif Yakubu shot was put out by Dempos custodian Satish Kumar.         
	Dempo launched another move few minutes later through Nicolau Borges and Ranty, who released the ball to Joaquim Abranches but his shot was saved by keeper Subrata Paul.         
	Dempo kept up the pressure on the rival defence and had two chances to score but first Nicolau headed straight into the keepers hand and later Climax misdirected a cross from Ranty.                     
	With the left wing not functioning, Dempo replaced Nicolau and brought in striker Myoyo Iyomi who played upfront with Joaquim Abranches falling back to assist the forward and the Dempo attack looked more purposeful as they made a series of raids, but were unsuccessful as Subrata Paul put up a stiff resistance.         
	The East Bengal citadel finally fell in the 78th minute with a move from the right by Roberto Mendes Silva who relayed the ball to Climax Lawerence whose shot had Subrata Paul beaten.         
	Roberto Dsilva had a golden chance in stoppage time to increase the lead but his well directed shot was put out by a diving Paul.         
	East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario rued the missed chances while Dempo coach Armando Colaco was delighted with his teams victory.         
	We needed a win badly to stay close to Sporting Clube de Goa who are leading the table with 22 points. Although my boys did not play to my expectations it is the three points that matter and I am happy, Colaco said.

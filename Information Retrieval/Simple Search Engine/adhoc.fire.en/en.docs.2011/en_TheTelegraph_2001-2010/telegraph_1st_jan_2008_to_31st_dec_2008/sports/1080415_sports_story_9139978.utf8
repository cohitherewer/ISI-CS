	Karachi: Banned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has accused the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) of covering up acts of indiscipline by other players and victimising him by imposing a five-year ban.         
	The temperamental fast bowler was vocal before the senate standing committee on sports and culture on Monday in Islamabad and accused the PCB of having a separate policy for him and another for other players.         
	I know of instances where established and reputed players have broken the rules. But the captain and manager have covered up those issues. Whereas if I go to a nightclub, even then it becomes an issue, he said.         
	The committee held a hearing into the ban imposed on Shoaib earlier this month for repeated violations of the players code of conduct and a two-year probation.         
	The controversial fast bowler has lodged an appeal against the ban. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 23rd world record by Isinbayeva
                                                                                                                                                                                                       23rd world record by Isinbayeva

	Monte Carlo: Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own record in the womens pole vault and Asafa Powell ran his fastest 100 metres of the season on Tuesday to highlight the Herculis Super Grand Prix meet.         
	The Olympic and world champion bettered her previous world record of 5.03m, set in Rome on earlier this month. Isinbayeva cleared 5.04 meters, succeeding with her third and final attempt to break the mark. She failed at the record height at London last weekend, and again brushed the bar as she went over. This time it wobbled and stayed put.         
	I should stay in the form that I am, especially for the Games, the reigning Olympic champion said.         
	The 26-year-old Russian increased her total indoor and outdoor world records to 23, winning a car for her performance.         
	I hoped to break a world record here in my hometown and its the first competition since I moved to Monaco, Isinbayeva said.         
	Asafa Powell cruised to victory in Monaco with a season-best time of 9.82 seconds, suggesting he has Beijing gold in his sights next month. I am very impressed with my race, the 25-year-old Jamaican sprinter said.         
	The time was eight- hundredths of a second slower than his previous best of 9.74, which set a world record in Italy in September.         
	That record was surpassed by fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt, who ran 9.72 in New York two months ago.         
	Powell beat Bolt at Stockholm, and appears to be reaching his peak form, 17 days before the Olympics athletics program begins in Beijing.         
	Meanwhile, Darvis Patton of the US, who also will compete in the Olympic 100, was second in 9.98. Nesta Carter of Jamaica was third in 10.02. (AP)

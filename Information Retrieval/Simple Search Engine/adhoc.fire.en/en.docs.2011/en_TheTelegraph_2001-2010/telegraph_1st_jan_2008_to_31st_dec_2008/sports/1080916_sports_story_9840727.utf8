The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal seems to have run out of steam
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal seems to have run out of steam

	Written off by critics and experts, the incredible Roger Federer staged a stunning come back to win the 2008 US Open.         
	Stung by the criticism, Federer shed his Alpine calm as he uncharacteristically roared and punched the air to victory for his 13th Grand Slam title!         
	The one-sided final against the fiery Scott Andy Murray saw a cascade of crisp Federer winners that peppered the court and snuffed out Murrays challenge. Federer was once again King of the Castle having overcome glandular fever and the silent challenge of time hanging on to his coattails.         
	It was the triumph of the indomitable spirit of a great champion. Time will ultimately win the battle against Federer, but his effort in the US Open indicates that he could well get past Pete Sampras 14 titles.         
	The expected Rafael Nadal-Federer clash in the finals did not materialise as Nadal lost to Murray in the semi-final in a disappointing match.         
	This was not the same Nadal I had watched at the French Open and Wimbledon. He looked jaded, mistimed his shots, making uncharacteristic unforced errors and also served poorly. His guzzling style of play, which steamrollered the opposition in the French Open and Wimbledon, after a long winning streak seemed to have run out of steam.         
	Two other factors could have contributed to Nadals poor showing: (a) the courts were faster and (b) Murrays tactics of staying well behind the baseline and letting the spin in Nadals shots wear off.         
	It is the vicious and variable spin in Nadals game that unsettles Federers rhythm. Murrays game has improved by leaps and bounds. Since his ear splitting roars at Wimbledon, he seems to have matured, calmed down and is also physically stronger having put on 8/10 lbs. of muscle.         
	His game is tailor-made for Federer and brought the best out of him. Murray has now joined Nadal and Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings. At long last, Great Britain has a contender of Grand Slam levels, who could one day stand triumphantly on Henman Hill at Wimbledon.         
	Assisted by the British Lawn Tennis Association who generously spent 750,000 on Brad Gilbert to coach Murray, the total cost in 2007 of only putting Murray on the top 10 could easily have been more than 1 million (approx. Rs 8.5 crore).         
	Djokovic, fatigued by his very tough matches against Celic of Croatia, Robredo of Spain, and Roddick of the US was a spent force when he faced Federer in the semi-finals, and lost rather tamely in a four-set encounter.         
	With a solid all court game coupled with great mobility, Djokovic lacks a killer shot and needs to be more aggressive. Invariably he has to grind through his matches in the earlier rounds, which leaves him depleted for the later stages.         
	The new star on the horizon is 20-year old 66 Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina. Winning four consecutive titles before the US Open with victories over Roddick, Gasquet and Melzer, he raced through to the quarters of the US Open where he lost a tight four set encounter featuring two tie breakers against Andy Murray. With some more experience he will be right up there in the Grand Slam title chase.         
	There are a few other youngsters close to Grand Slam winning standards such as Gulbis of Lativia, Celic of Crotia and the French trio of Gasquet, Monfils and Tsonga  one wonders if they will have the perseverance and will and the many other qualities required to break into the top.         
	Japans 18-year old Nishikori, the lone Asian with a direct entry into the main draw, caused a flutter when he beat two seeds  Monaco of Argentina (seeded 29) and more significantly David Ferrer of Spain (seeded fourth)  to reach the last 16 where Martin Del Potro defeated him in straight sets.         
	At a time when mens tennis is bristling with talent, the Asian tennis system is not producing any players. The move of the Asian Tennis Federation, headed by Anil Khanna of the AITA, to start an Asian Tennis Circuit is a laudable step in the right direction.         
	The key to success would be good prize money and limited participation of foreign players. The latter is imperative.         
	Without competitive exposure to better players it is not possible to progress. To ensure that foreign players do not take away all the money, the prize money should be boosted in the earlier rounds. Furthermore, it should be enough for Asian players to consider tennis as an attractive and lucrative profession.

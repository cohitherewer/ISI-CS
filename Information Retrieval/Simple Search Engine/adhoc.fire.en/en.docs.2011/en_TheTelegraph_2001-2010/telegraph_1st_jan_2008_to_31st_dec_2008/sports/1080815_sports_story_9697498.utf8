            A CORRESPONDENT            Virat Kohli                           
	Colombo: Rookie Virat Kohli had his first session with the senior national side in Colombo on Thursday. The first of the five-match series gets underway on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts:                 
	First session with the side         
	Very good session, very intense. Had fitness drills too, practice went well. Jelled well with the rest of the team, it was good.         
	If he has been assigned any specific role         
	As such, no specific role has been assigned to me. But I am ready to play anywhere. Will have to adjust according to the situation of the game, depending on what kind of role I am given by the team.         
	The bleep test         
	It was done just to check our fitness. Went well.         
	Tackling Ajantha Mendis         
	He is a different bowler, he is a very good bowler. I am asking my teammates as well who have played him. Have seen videos... But when you are playing in a match, it is all about my mental set-up, how I face him, but obviously I am getting a lot of help from my teammates as well.         
	Playing alongside Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir         
	They are very happy. I have played with them for the Delhi team as well. They are very helpful, its great fun to be with them in the Indian team.         
	Target for the series         
	Will try to do well if I get a chance to play.

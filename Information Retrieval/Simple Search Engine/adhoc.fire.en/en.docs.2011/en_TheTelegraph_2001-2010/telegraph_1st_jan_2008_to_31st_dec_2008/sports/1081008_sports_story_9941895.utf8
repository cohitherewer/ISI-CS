The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo set for   return
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ronaldo set for   return
                            
	Rio De Janeiro: Brazilian striker Ronaldo is set to return inside a month from the knee injury that has sidelined him since February, his physio Bruno Mazziotti said on Monday.         
	Ronaldo, who is without a club, has been undergoing a rehabilitation programme at Brazilian team Flamengo since August.         
	The prediction depends on a number of factors but we think that, within one month or maybe less, he will be able to play again, Mazziotti said.         
	He is in the final stage of the recovery and, from this week, he will be able to train with the Flamengo team as if he were just another player.         
	Ronaldo, who helped Brazil to their World Cup triumph in 2002, ruptured a tendon in his left knee during a Serie A game for AC Milan against Livorno.         
	The problem was similar to two injuries he sustained to his right knee earlier in his career.         
	Last month Ronaldo told the French sports daily LEquipe he had been involved in talks with English Premier League Manchester City.         
	Before the injury Ronaldo had been struggling to find his best form.         
	He has not played for Brazil since the 2006 World Cup when, despite scoring three goals, his performances were widely criticised and he was accused by the media of being overweight.         
	Ronaldo has made 97 appearances for his country, scoring 62 goals.         
	He is the all time highest goal getter in the history of the Fifa World Cup with 15 goals.         
	He surpassed Gerd Mullers previous record of 14 at the 2006 tournament.           (REUTERS)

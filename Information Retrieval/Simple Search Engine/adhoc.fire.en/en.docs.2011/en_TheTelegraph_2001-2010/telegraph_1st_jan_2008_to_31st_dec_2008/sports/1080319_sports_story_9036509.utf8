The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stewart plea to Hamilton
                                                     Stewart plea to Hamilton
            KEVIN GARSIDE            Lewis Hamilton                           
	Sir Jackie Stewart has urged Lewis Hamilton to use his growing influence in Formula One for the greater good of the sport. Hamilton has come under fire from his fellow drivers for his failure to join the Grand Prix Drivers Association, the body through which Stewart fought for controversial safety improvements 40 years ago.         
	According to Stewart, Hamilton is going global in a way that no one ever has before. Certainly no racing driver. Yes, even Tiger Woods may have to take a back seat as the Hamilton effect sweeps all before it. Not even the great Muhammad Ali could match Hamiltons knock-out power.         
	Stewarts verdict was delivered before Hamilton laid waste to the field at the Australian Grand Prix with a drive as mature as any 23-year-old has produced. He now heads to Malaysia for Sundays second round poised to add more lustre to the legend.         
	As much as Stewart admires the young Briton, he believes Hamilton has been ill-advised, and that it is a mistake to ignore the GPDA. There are, argues Stewart, safety issues still to be addressed. Though it is almost 14 years since a driver has lost his life in a Grand Prix, Stewart claims death is inevitable in Formula One.         
	Somebody is going to get killed. It has been 13 years and 11 months since the death of Ayrton Senna. It is like an air crash. You cant go without something going wrong somewhere. And somebody will die. The moment somebody dies there is a new awakening, Stewart said. It is going to be a big shock to this fraternity.         
	These guys dont know how to deal with a death. They have never seen it. They have never been up close. They have never been to a body when it is still in the car, never had to identify a body, never had to pack that persons clothes because the wife or the girlfriend cant face it. I pray to God they never do have to learn that.         
	But the law of averages says that when you are doing 200mph, millimetres apart with mechanical failure or human error, you are going to have an accident. Nowadays thats a plane crash. So far we have been incredibly lucky. We are on the slate to have a big shunt.         
	The removal of electronic driver aids makes the possibility of an impact or collision through driver error more likely. In Melbourne David Coulthard and Timo Glock came to grief in spectacular fashion. Both walked away unhurt. Next time they might not be so lucky.         
	The GPDA has made great strides in the past 12 months in improving medical facilities at test tracks, emphasising the importance of the block voice. Im surprised and disappointed that Lewis has not yet joined the GPDA, said Stewart. The one thing you have to have among the competitors is good communication. Apart from that you are treated as a group on issues. In my day that was a very important element of getting things done. The GPDA did an immense amount of good. It is wrong and complacent of Lewis not to be involved.         
	You have to prioritise your time. He might have to do commercial appearances for Hugo Boss or whoever, but nobody did more of that than I did. Thats why I got mononucleosis, and a duodenal ulcer.         
	The drivers are the ones out there doing it. When you are out there and somebody tells you that, for example, the barriers at Monza do not need to be further from the chicane than they are now, they dont understand that an interlocking wheel suddenly launches a car in the air and you come down upside down on the top of the barrier.         
	Thats how Francois Cevert was killed (at Watkins Glen in 1973). Francois was cut in half. If you have ever seen that you want the barrier further back. That is why the GPDA is important and why Lewis should be in it. I have the highest respect for Lewis. I think he is the best thing since sliced bread but he is inexperienced.         
	Lewis is such a valuable asset to the sport. The media talks to him more than anyone else. One of the reasons I got so much done in terms of safety was because I was the guy at that time.

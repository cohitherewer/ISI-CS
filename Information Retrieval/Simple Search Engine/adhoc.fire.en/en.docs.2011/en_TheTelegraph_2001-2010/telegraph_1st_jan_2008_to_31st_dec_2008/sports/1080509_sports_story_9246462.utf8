The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United may play Russian roulette with Rooney
                                                                                                                                                                                                       United may play Russian roulette with Rooney
            Mark Ogden            Wayne Rooney                           
	Sir Alex Ferguson is considering naming Wayne Rooney as a substitute in Manchester Uniteds decisive Premier League match at Wigan Athletic on Sunday, despite concerns over the forwards fitness.         
	United must beat Steve Bruces team at the JJB Stadium to be certain of retaining the title.         
	With Louis Saha injured and Nani suspended, Ferguson has only two fit forwards in Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	Rooney has missed two matches after suffering a recurrence of a hip injury during the 2-1 defeat against at Chelsea on April 26. The England forward scored Uniteds goal at Stamford Bridge and then waved away his celebrating teammates in pain.         
	He originally sustained the injury in a Premier League game at Blackburn last month and is undergoing treatment to break down congealed blood in the hip joint.         
	With United preparing for the Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow on May 21, Ferguson had been keen to protect Rooney by resting him from first-team duty until the trip to Russia.         
	However, Chelseas dogged pursuit of United means Ferguson is now ready to shelve those plans.         
	United defender Rio Ferdinand, set to be reunited with central defensive partner Nemanja Vidic at Wigan following the Serbians 10-day rest after he suffered concussion, has admitted that the plaudits he has received for his form this season will mean nothing if he fails to win silverware in the Premier League or Champions League.         
	He said: I always strive for consistency and I think that, over the past few seasons, Ive managed to achieve that to a good level. But at the end of the day, its about medals and winning things.         
	If Im performing well and the team is winning, then Im happy. But if were not winning then it doesnt matter how well Im playing.         
	Maybe in the summer Ill look back on the season and be able to say, yeah, Ive been pleased with my form. Until then, the focus is on winning trophies.

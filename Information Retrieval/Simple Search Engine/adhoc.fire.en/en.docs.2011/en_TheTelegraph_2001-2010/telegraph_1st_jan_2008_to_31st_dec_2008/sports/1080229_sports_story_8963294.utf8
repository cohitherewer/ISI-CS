	Gurgaon: Little-known Indian Shamim Khan outshone a glittering field to emerge joint leader with Argentinas Daniel Vancsik at the end of Day I in the $2.5 million Johnnie Walker Classic on Thursday.         
	On a day when stars like Vijai Singh carded a 70 and Colin Montgomerie and Ian Poulter struggled to a 74 and 76, respectively, the 28-year-old Indian, whose world ranking is 1377, wielded his putter like a magic wand share the honours with a superb five-under 67.         
	Vancsik, 31, who recorded his maiden European Tour win last year, sank an eagle on the par-five ninth before rolling in three birdies on the back nine for his 67.         
	World No. 5 Adam Scott and Indias Jeev Milkha Singh suffered late lapses to join a group of 11, including Rahil Gangjee, in third place on four-under 68 while triple major winner and former world No. 1 Vijai was three off the lead on 70.         
	S.S.P. Chowrasia, who carded an even par 72 along with Gaganjeet Bhullar and 22 others, is 49th.         
	I was inspired by Chowrasias win in the Indian Masters, said Shamim at the DLF Golf and Country Club.         
	SSP is an old friend of mine, the caddie-turned-pro said. He has set the tone for us to do well in the international events that come to India. Im concentrating on my game and will take it one step at a time.         
	Besides Shamims heroics, there was a strong Indian showing with Arjun Atwal, Shiv Kapur and Arjun Singh all within striking distance a stroke behind Jeev.         
	Atwal began with a birdie on the first hole (the 10th), but faltered with bogeys on the second and third. He steadied himself with two birdies to end the back nine at one-under 35.         
	I putted well over the first 10-11 holes today and I did fine, said Atwal.         
	Jeev topped the leaderboard at one point but late bogeys prevented him from staying in the lead. He missed a short putt for par on the 16th and found the hazard on 17th.         
	Its a good test, said Jeev. I played solid for 15 holes but caught a couple of bad breaks.         
	Vijai, now world No. 11, shot three birdies and two bogeys.         
	It was very disappointing. I hit the ball really good but didnt putt particularly well and threw away a few shots. I must have hit five or six loose shots out there. Two-under is under-par but its very disappointing, he said.

	Beijing: Georgia may pull its 35-strong Olympic team out of the Beijing Games because of Russian military attacks on its territory, the countrys National Olympic Committee told Reuters on Saturday.         
	Chinese hopes of quick wins were partly met as competition got under way in earnest.         
	A womans weightlifting gold and mens shooting gold came their way, though they lost the first medal to be awarded after the Chinese favourite Du Li finished fifth in the womens 10-metre air rifle.         
	Pang Wei restored home pride in shooting with victory in the mens 10-metre air pistol, while Chen Xiexia won gold in the womens 48kg weightlifting.         
	Michael Phelps set off on his quest for a record eight gold medals, diving into the pool at the bubble-wrap Water Cube building to win his heat in the 400 metres individual medley in an Olympic record.         
	Spains Samuel Sanchez won the mens cycling road race along a gruelling 245-km route from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the Great Wall.           (REUTERS)

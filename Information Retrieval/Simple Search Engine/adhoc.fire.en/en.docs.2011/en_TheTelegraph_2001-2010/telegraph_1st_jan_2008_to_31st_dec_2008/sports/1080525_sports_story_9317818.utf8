            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Oliver Kahn                           
	Calcutta: With only a few hours to go before the much awaited arrival of German soccer giants Bayern Munich, football fever has gripped the City of Joy once again.         
	According to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly, a sold out crowd is likely to be present at the gigantic Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday to watch legendary custodian Oliver Kahn take his last bow on the football field after a glittering career that span over 22 years.         
	The majority of tickets up for sale on Wednesday have already been sold out and the remaining 15,000, Ganguly said, should be exhausted by Sunday. We are confident that there would be 120,000 people at the ground on Tuesday, he said.         
	The last time Salt Lake had a full house during a football match was way back in 1997 when the two Calcutta majors  East Bengal and Mohun Bagan  clashed in the memorable Federation Cup semi-final. Spectators then were treated to some exciting football as an ever-agile Bhaichung Bhutia scored a hattrick for the red and golds.         
	Bhutia, however, would not be around this time to challenge the skill of Kahn or Van Bommel. The Indian captain, on that day, would be away in Chennai to play against Chinese Taipei.         
	The AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, on Saturday tried to heal the wound to some extent by promising to release the Mohun Bagan players who would not be selected for the SAFF bound Indian team.         
	Given the fact that national coach Bob Houghton may announce his final squad only after the Chennai match, there is little chance of Mohun Bagan getting back players like NS Manju or Mohan Raj.         
	On Saturday, Bayern Official Martin Hegel inspected the Salt Lake Stadium pitch and expressed his satisfaction.         
	The German side would arrive in the city around noon on Sunday. The team would be driven straight to the hotel after a small function at the airport lounge as the city police have denied permission to hold any felicitation on the way.

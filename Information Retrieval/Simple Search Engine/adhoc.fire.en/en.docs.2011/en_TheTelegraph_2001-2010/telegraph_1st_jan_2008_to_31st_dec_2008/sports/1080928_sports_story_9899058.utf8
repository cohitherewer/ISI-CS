The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its a relief for Srinivasan
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its a relief for Srinivasan
    - BCCI disowns its own media release on norms for the senior selectors                 Mallya                           
	The rules and regulations of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have been suitably amended to take the heat off N. Srinivasan, who took charge as secretary on Saturday, after the 79th AGM, in Mumbai.         
	According to the new president, lawyer Shashank Manohar, an amendment became necessary as Twenty20 wasnt in vogue when the rules and regulations were drawn up. Specifically, an office-bearers involvement in the IPL and the Champions League wont be seen as a conflict of interest.         
	Srinivasan had been under pressure, largely from former BCCI president and one-time mentor A.C. Muthiah, as India Cements (which owns the Chennai Super Kings) is seen as his company.         
	However, everybody isnt convinced that the amendment has been done in the proper manner. I doubt if the procedures were followed... It could become an even bigger issue in court, the gentleman told The Telegraph.         
	The next BCCI president will be from South Zone (three years from now) and its understood that Srinivasan, who was the treasurer before becoming the secretary, has his sights on that post as well. He may, of course, have to contend with tycoon Vijay Mallya.         
	Mallya isnt an office-bearer of the Karnataka State Cricket Association, but still attended the AGM, thanks to a sharp divide within that body. His movements, so to say, will be keenly watched over the next couple of years.         
	On another issue, Manohar claimed that the minutes of the last working committee meeting (in August), where the norms for selectors were fixed, correctly reflected what had been decided upon.         
	In other words, he disowned the media release put out by the BCCI itself, where it was clearly mentioned that while appointing a senior selector, care will be taken to ensure that he should have retired at least 10 years ago...         
	Had that been followed, Narendra Hirwani (Central) and Surendra Bhave (West) couldnt have become selectors as the former retired in 2005-06 and Bhave played till 2000-01.         
	Manohar emphasised the last appearance of a selector, who had played international cricket, had to be at least a decade ago. Going by what he said, the minutes have exactly that.         
	Hirwanis last appearance (a Test) was in late 1996. As for Bhave, who did limited overs duty for India A, his was in the early 1990s.         
	Why the BCCI didnt correct the media release, emailed more than a month ago, is something only its mandarins can answer.         
	Amazingly, the actual time needed to complete the AGM, scheduled for Saturday-Sunday, was around an hour. There was absolutely no discussion on anything, with everything getting passed, remarked a veteran.         
	Meanwhile, Lalchand Rajput has declined to head the junior selection committee. That he hadnt been bowled over by this sop of sorts was reported in these columns on Saturday.

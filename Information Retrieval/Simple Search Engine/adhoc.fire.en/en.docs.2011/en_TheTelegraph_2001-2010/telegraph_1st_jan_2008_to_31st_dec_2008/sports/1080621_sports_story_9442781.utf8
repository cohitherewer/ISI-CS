The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Germans shatter Scolaris dream
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Germans shatter Scolaris dream
  - Klose, Ballack and schweinsteiger score in 3-2 win       Henry Winter in Basel            German players celebrate a goal during their quarter final match against Portugal in Basel on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	Luiz Felipe Scolaris fears over Germanys tall players were brutally realised on Thursday night as Michael Ballack hit the heights and the semi-finals in style after one of the most enthralling games in European Championship final history. Portugal simply could not deal neither with Miroslav Klose nor Ballack in the air, the pair heading good goals to add to Bastian Schweinsteigers magnificent opener (as briefly reported in Fridays late city edition).         
	Nuno Gomes had made it 2-1 before the break and Helder Postiga 3-2 late on, keeping Portugal in contention, but the Germans always felt in control. Ballack, a Chelsea man ushering Scolari to the Bridge, gave a masterful display of ball winning and play making. Schweinsteiger was not far behind, brimming with blond ambition and lifting over the free-kicks for Klose and Ballack.         
	Until Scolari tucked Ronaldo inside and Gomes breathed hope into Portugal in the 40th minute, the first half had been the stuff of nightmares for the Brazilian and his Portuguese players, who simply could not live with the power and counter-attacking pace of the Germans for so long nor the finishing of Schweinsteiger and Klose.                     
	Even when Gomes struck, the Germans simply flicked at the accelerator in the second half of a wonderful match and made it 3-1 through the outstanding Ballack.         
	 Germanys movement in the opening stages were too fast and decisive for Portugal, Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski dominating the flanks in the manner that Ronaldo and Simao had expected to. Even before Schweinsteiger swept in his memorable goal and Klose headed Portugal further into the mire, the Germans had been in control, on the terraces and on the patchwork-quilt terrain.         
	Their misery intensified four minutes later. When Petit tripped the bearded steamroller called Christoph Metzelder, Schweinsteiger took command of the free-kick 40 yards out and a few strides in from the left-hand touchline. His delivery was as good as Portugals reaction was abject. Ronaldo failed to go with Klose, who rose, twisted his body to meet the ball well, sending a firm header past Ricardo.         
	At that point, any chance of a Portuguese recovery seemed distant. Scolaris moves worked, Portugal making it 2-1 just before the break.         
	Deco and Simao combined to send Ronaldo down the inside-left channel, where he drew a good save from Lehmann. As the German defence raced to reach the loose ball, Gomes reacted first, catching it left-footed and sending it flying into the net.         
	Portugal began to believe in recovery. Ronaldo shot wide. Friedrich was cautioned for fouling Ronaldo, the German full-back then treading on the Manchester United wingers foot. Portugal should have struck an equaliser moments later, but Pepe somehow headed over from Decos flick.         
	The miss seemed particularly profligate when Ballack showed how to finish with a header. After Pepe put in a horrible foul on Klose, Schweinsteiger again drilled in a free-kick. Ballacks push on Paulo Ferreira went unnoticed and the German captain headed almost arrogantly past Ricardo.         
	Postiga headed a riposte, following a terrific cross from Nani, but Ballacks men would not be denied. What a game!

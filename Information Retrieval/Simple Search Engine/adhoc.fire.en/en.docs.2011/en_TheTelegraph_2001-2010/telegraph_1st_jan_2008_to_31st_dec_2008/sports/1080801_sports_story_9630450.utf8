The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayliss:   Guys showed character 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Bayliss:   Guys showed character 
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Galle: Sri Lankan coach Trevor Bayliss wished good luck to centurion Virender Sehwag and was happy with the way his bowlers bounced back.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	On how the first day turned out         
	The guys showed great character. Im not sure about the turn here. Guys think it does not turn as much as it did earlier It could turn a little more than today. They were bowling with a new ball. Im happy with the way they came back.         
	 The rain break         
	It was lunch time anyway The break did help, to rethink and regroup. Early on the intensity was not there as it was at the SSC. At the end of the day, we will have to take the good with the bad. Rain cannot be the turning point Theres still a long way to go, but its fairly even at the moment. Another one or two wickets would have been better.         
	Sehwags batting and his style         
	It proves there is not a lot of difference between success and failure. He tried to play the same way at the SSC. But it did not come off. This time it did... Good players dont make their luck, they take advantage of it. Good luck to him, you dont average 50 without being a good player.         
	If he spoke to Mendis at the break         
	Did not talk to him at all He is a quick learner. Things went his way after the break, he could have had 2/3 wickets in the first session too

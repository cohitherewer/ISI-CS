The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Oram century in drawn Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Oram century in drawn Test
                      
	London: New Zealand allrounder Jacob Oram chose the right occasion and the perfect venue to score his first Test century against England on Monday and played a match saving innings in the first Test at Lords.         
	The Black Caps held an overall lead of only 78 with four wickets down when wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum retired hurt and was taken to hospital after a blow to his left forearm.         
	Oram found a doughty partner in Daniel Flynn, who struggled in his first innings debut, but who now batted with grit and acumen to score 22 in a partnership of 132.         
	Oram scored his fifth Test century from 120 balls, accelerating in the second half, when Ryan Sidebottom bowled him for 101. But by then he had taken his team to the safety of a draw after 153.2 overs had been lost to rain and bad light on the first three days.         
	At the close, the Black Caps were for 269 for six with Flynn on 29 and in good heart for the second Test starting at Old Trafford on Friday.         
	New Zealand, who resumed at 40 for no loss, lost Aaron Redmond for 17 caught at first slip by Andrew Strauss off James Anderson.           (REUTERS)

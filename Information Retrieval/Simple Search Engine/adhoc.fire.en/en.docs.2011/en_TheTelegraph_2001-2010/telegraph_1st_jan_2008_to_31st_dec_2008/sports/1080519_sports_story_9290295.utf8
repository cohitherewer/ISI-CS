The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I dont decide on openers, says Butt
                                                                                                                                                                                                     I dont decide on openers, says Butt
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Seven opening pairs in 11 matches notwithstanding, Kolkata Knight Riders are yet to hit upon the winning combination. Even Salman Butts second half-century of the IPL failed to give the hosts a good start as wickets fell at the other end. Butt said at the post-match news conference that from now on, there is little option but to win all the three matches and hope for the best.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Good knock, but the innings seemed to lose impetus at the end         
	Yeah Our batting form has been patchy and not what it should be on this slowish track. In the end, we were 25 runs short of a reasonable target.         
	The road to semi-finals has become stiff         
	We have no option but to win all our matches and hope for the best.         
	Seven opening pairs so far         
	Well I dont decide on the opening combination!         
	Are you getting into a groove now?         
	Yes It takes time to settle down in Twenty20 cricket. I was playing well in Pakistan and was in good form. I came and sat out a couple of matches. Sitting out does a take a little bit of form out of you

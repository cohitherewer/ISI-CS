  - I-League
  -   Green and maroon brigade to field three foreigners for the first time         A STAFF REPORTER                    East Bengals Sunil Chhetri (picture above, right) and Nirmal Chhetri during practice on Friday at the club ground. (Picture below) Mohun bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia warm up on Friday. Telegraph pictures                            
	Calcutta: Youths turning up at practice decked in club colours. Cheers, best wishes and a pat on the back for their favourite players. Fandom, certainly is no more like it was in the days of yore, but the vestiges of hysteria seen at the Mohun Bagan and East Bengal grounds on Friday, customarily ushered in yet another Calcutta derby.         
	For the record though, East Bengal have laboured their way to the mid-table, while Bagan are second from bottom in the I-League table, without a single win in four matches.         
	Though the Big Two of Calcutta football are being pushed away from the limelight steadily by better performing teams from other parts of the country, a win on Saturday for either team will be a big boost for their campaign. While Bagan have had the better of their foes in recent meetings  they are unbeaten in the last seven encounters versus East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium  East Bengal have a comfortable four point gap over the green and maroon brigade in the League.         
	Of the two times that the archrivals faced each other this season in the Calcutta League, Bagan won the first leg meeting and drew the second leg tie to clinch the title.         
	But this time round Karim Bencharifas side will take the field with the underdog tag firmly affixed, after their poor start to the I-League campaign.         
	The 3-0 win over Vasco in their last match has filled Stanley Rozarios side with hope and a positive air.         
	I sense a good tempo, good spirit among the boys, a confident Rozario said after practice on Friday.         
	Yakubus double strike against Elvis Goess side and his partnership up-front with Sunil Chhetri has been a shot in the arm for the East Bengal faithful. Unlike the local league ties, they will this time take on Bagan with a squad, which has begun to gel together well.         
	Rozario will not have Alvito DCunha at his disposal. Rennedy Singh is still doubtful and unlikely to make the starting line up.         
	At the heart of the midfield, Mehrajuddin Wadoos place is not assured  the man from Kashmir missed the last three training sessions, being away from the city for personal reasons  and Jayanta Sen might step in, to partner Malsawmkima.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi and Mehtab Hossain will start in the wide positions. To keep Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto  the two will be starting together since their Bagans first I-League match  Rozario will be sticking to the winning combination (from the Vasco match) of Suley Musah and M. Suresh in defence.         
	Bagan, meanwhile, are banking big time on the Brazilian duo of Marcos Pereira and Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	 The reputation that Marcos commands was evident in the words of several East Bengal players.         
	Nabi said: Bagan seems to have the edge over us in the midfield with Marcos coming in. He is a very good player who holds the ball well and his distribution is great too.         
	Marcos partner in the middle third though is still to be decided. The consistent Rakesh Masih is racing against time to shrug off his hamstring injury. Masih went through the motions, albeit gingerly in the training session. Lalkamal Bhowmick is tipped to step in, if needed.         
	Ishfaq Ahmed and Malswamtluanga are likely to operate down the wings. Deepak Mondal will fill in at left back (yet another unusual position), Habibur Rahaman will be back at right back, with Anand Vasan and Peter Odafe marshalling the central areas.         
	Barreto, Bhaichung and Marcos look the best bets for Bencharifa as individual brilliance from the trio can turn the game on its head at any given time.         
	But East Bengals organisational superiority and the mere fact that the eleven players taking to the field have played together longer than the opposition, probably swings the balance towards them.         
	But as East Bengal custodian Subrata Paul put it  Derby matches are always 50-50, the form book goes out of the window, the moment players take the field. For the sake of Bengal football, lets hope we have a cracker of a game.

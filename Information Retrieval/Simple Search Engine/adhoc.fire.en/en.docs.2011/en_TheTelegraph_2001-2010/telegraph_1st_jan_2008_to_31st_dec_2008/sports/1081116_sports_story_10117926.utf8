The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Scan reveals no damage
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Scan reveals no damage
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A scan done on Indias swashbuckling left-hand batsman Yuvraj Singhs back has not revealed any damage but it is to be seen if he plays in Indore without being 100 per cent fit.         
	The dashing left-hander overcame a troublesome back on way to an unbeaten 138 off only 78 balls in Rajkot on Friday as India recorded a 158-run victory. He used Gautam Gambhir as a runner for the most part of his innings.         
	The ongoing series is a long one and India would surely think twice before playing Yuvraj in the second ODI.

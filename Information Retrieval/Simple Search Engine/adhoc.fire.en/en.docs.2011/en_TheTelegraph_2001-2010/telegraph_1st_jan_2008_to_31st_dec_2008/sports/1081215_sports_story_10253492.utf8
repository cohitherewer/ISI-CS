	Wellington: Jerome Taylor scored a magnificent maiden Test century on Sunday as the West Indies ensured the rain-affected first Test against New Zealand in Dunedin would almost certainly end in a draw.         
	Coming to the crease with the West Indies in some trouble at 173 for six, still 189 runs behind the New Zealand first innings total of 365, Taylor bludgeoned 17 fours and three sixes on his way to 106.         
	His partnership with veteran Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who was last man out for 76, took the West Indies to a first innings total of 340.         
	At the close New Zealand had moved to 44 for two, with Tim McIntosh on 28 and Daniel Flynn not out four.         
	They earlier lost opener Jamie How bowled by Daren Powell for 10 and night watchman Kyle Mills the very next ball, also bowled by Powell.         
	West Indies began the day at 39 without loss and were never able to get on top of the New Zealand attack until Taylor came to the crease midway through the middle session.         
	One hour later, any hopes New Zealand had of winning the Test were gone as Chanderpaul and Taylor batted them out of the game.         
	Taylors previous best in a Test match was 31, while he had never before passed 41 in first class cricket.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: Ajit Agarkar stressed on the need to get back to winning ways and keep the momentum going after Kolkata Knight Riders back-to-back defeats in the Indian Premier League. At the post-match news conference on Tuesday, the Kolkata Knight Riders allrounder admitted they failed in all departments of the game.                 
	The following are excerpts:         
	Playing against Mumbai         
	I wont call it unusual but it was a different feeling. Not many Mumbaiites have been playing for Mumbai, though.         
	On what went wrong         
	Honestly speaking, everything. We didnt have enough runs on the board. At crucial periods we needed to get a few wickets. The partnership between Robin Uthappa and Dwayne Bravo finally saw them through. We desperately needed a breakthrough at that point.         
	Missing Ricky Ponting and Brendon McCullum         
	We always knew Ricky and Brendon wont be around. But its up to the others to stand up and perform. Salman Butt is already here. Laxmi Ratan Shukla has done well in the last couple of matches. Were looking up to good performances from the Indian guys. I am not sure of Brad Hodge. If he arrives he too will be part of the squad.         
	His own performance         
	I would certainly have liked to contribute more with the bat.         
	Umar Guls fitness         
	Hes fit and available for selection. Hes just come from a one-day series in Pakistan.         
	The teams chances in the tournament         
	There are still ten more games to go. Its a long tournament Weve got to keep the mistakes to a minimum. Its important to get back to winning ways and keep the momentum going. Weve got to work harder.         
	The seniors not being among runs         
	Weve got to perform as a team. You just cant pick on individuals and judge whether they have performed. If A or B doesnt perform, the rest of the guys have to make up for him.         
	Shah Rukh Khans feelings         
	Not aware of at the moment. But he must be disappointed as well.

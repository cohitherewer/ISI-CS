                                                                                                                                                                                                     Vijay Mallya blames it on the car
                      
	Sao Paulo: Vijay Mallya has not lost trust in the race-crafts of either Giancarlo Fisichella or Adrian Sutil and Force Indias flamboyant owner believes it was actually the VJM01 car which let the drivers down this season.         
	Mallya said it was a combination of factors that didnt allow Force India break the duck. I was asked whether I was making any changes to the drivers, and I said no. Once we get the car sorted out, I think these guys will perform, because I think they have the talent to perform, Mallya said.

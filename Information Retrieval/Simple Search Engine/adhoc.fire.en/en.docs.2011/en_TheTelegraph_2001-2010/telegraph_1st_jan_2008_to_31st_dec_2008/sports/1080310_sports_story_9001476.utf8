The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 60 injured in Colombia riot
                                                   60 injured in Colombia riot
                      
	Bogota: Around 60 people were injured during a riot that forced the Colombian derby between America and Deportivo Cali to be abandoned on Saturday night.         
	Referee Wilmer Roldan called off the match in the 82nd minute as riot police attempted to stop a fight among America fans in the Pascual Guerrero Stadium in the south-western city of Cali. Tempers also frayed on the pitch when America coach Diego Umana was seen to punch his Cali counterpart Daniel Carreno while America players, angry at the suspension of the game, chased the referee off the pitch.         
	A Red Cross official told reporters that the injury count was around 60 as the victims were treated at the edge of the pitch.         
	Trouble broke out when members of the America supporters group, known as the Red Baron, began fighting amongst themselves. (Reuters)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     India trounce Malaysia 3-1
                      
	Hyderabad: Drag-flicker Diwakar Ram continued his fine form and scored a brace to give India a comfortable 3-1 victory over Malaysia and semi-final berth in mens Junior Asia Cup hockey tournament at the Gachibowli stadium.         
	Diwakar, who found the target twice in Indias 2-0 victory over Japan in their first match, converted two penalty corners in the 31st and 42nd minutes in a pool A match.         
	For Malaysia, Mohammed Khairil Anurar Isa reduced the margin in the 40th minute.         
	The Indians were attacking for most part of the match while the Malaysians relied mainly on counter attacks. India were also denied by some excellent saves by Malaysian custodian Abdul Hakim Adnan.         
	With two wins from as many matches, India have ensured themselves a place in the semi-final. They play Singapore in their last match.         
	The hosts, who led 2-0 at the breather, dominated the first session. The Malaysians responded strongly in the second half. They got as many as four penalty corners in row in the first five minutes of the second half and managed to reduce the margin in the 40th minute with Mohammed Khairil Anurar Isa sounding the board.         
	Just as it looked like the Malaysians would level the score, Diwakar converted another penalty corner two minutes later to take the game away from the visitors reach.

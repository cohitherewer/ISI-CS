            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The series of bomb blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad last week has caused the Australian media to raise concerns over their tour of India.         
	According to an Australian daily on Monday, the furore over the safety of playing the September Champions Trophy in Pakistan may extend to Australias four-Test tour of India in October.         
	The paper quoted Cricket Australias general manager of public affairs, Peter Young, as saying that a lot would depend on the pre-tour inspection.         
	The BCCI, however, wasnt aware of any such development. I am not aware of anything said Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer.

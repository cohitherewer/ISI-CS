	Margao: An 18th minute goal by Junior Obagbemiro ended Mumbai FCs unbeaten run as Sporting Clube de Goa earned a hard fought 1-0 victory in the I-League match at the Nehru Stadium here.         
	Sporting took the lead when defender Rovan Pereira sent a long cross from the left into the box. Obagbemiro controlled the ball and raced into the box beating an onrushing Choubey to his left with deft placement.         
	Meanwhile, Odefa Okolie will be the man to watch out for as Churchill Brothers take on Vasco at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. (PTI)

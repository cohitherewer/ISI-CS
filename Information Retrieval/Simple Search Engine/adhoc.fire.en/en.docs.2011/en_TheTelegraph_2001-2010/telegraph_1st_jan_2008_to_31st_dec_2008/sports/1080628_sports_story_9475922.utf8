The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proud of my players: Hiddink 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Proud of my players: Hiddink 
                      
	Vienna: Coach Guus Hiddink said Russia were simply worn out by Spain and could only keep up with them for an hour in Thursdays 0-3 semi-final defeat at Euro 2008.         
	Russias exciting run came to an end with a drubbing by the same team that had hammered them 4-1 in the group stage.         
	We could play with Spain in the first half, and part of the second half  we were still in the game, Hiddink told at a news conference.         
	But their plan to tire us by their game possession made our marking a little bit loose in midfield so we had to run a lot.         
	For an hour, we could move but after that it was very difficult to play them.         
	Playmaker Andrei Arshavin, who had caused a stir in the previous two matches with his clever runs and great vision, seemed to be trying too hard and created very little.         
	Hiddink said it was good for him to learn that he was not always going to get things his own way.         
	A lot of people are writing that now he can play top, top, top in all the leagues. Of course, he can but an opponent like Spain focuses on him and then he also has difficult moments.         
	Hiddink refused to use the absence of central defender Denis Kolodin, who was suspended, as an excuse for the defeat.         
	Of course he had a tremendous tournament, said the Dutchman.         
	He said that he was proud of his players for getting so far, with such an entertaining style of play and that they would learn from the experience.         
	Of course the disappointment is now in our heads but when the emotions have calmed down from this game, we are very proud of the way we have played in this tournament, said Russias coach.

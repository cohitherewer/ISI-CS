The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I do not trust the media: Symonds
                                                     I do not trust the media: Symonds
                  Andrew Symonds                     
	Adelaide:Controversial Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds, who made headlines during Indias turbulent tour Down Under, admitted that he is a bit cold towards the media.         
	Generally, Ive shied away from the media If the media has a shot at you and its incorrect, you dont get a right to reply, Symonds said.         
	If you know a bloke is genuinely trying his best or has been dead-set unlucky, and the media is making it appear something its not Thats unfair. Its why Ive tended to be a bit cold towards the press, Symonds said in a recent interview to a magazine.         
	If a journalist is inaccurate, Im still not going to let him off or think highly of him, Symonds said.         
	The same goes for me. If I write something thats not accurate or is rubbish, I expect the same treatment. Im asked for my opinion and its very important that Im accurate and honest.

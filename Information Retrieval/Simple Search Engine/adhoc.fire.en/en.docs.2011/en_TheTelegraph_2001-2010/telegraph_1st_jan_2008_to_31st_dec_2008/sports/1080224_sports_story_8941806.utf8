The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan unhappy
                                                   Younis Khan unhappy
                      
	Karachi: After Australian captain Ricky Ponting, Pakistan batsman Younis Khan has also expressed disappointment at not fetching a bigger bid price in the Indian Premier League players auction.         
	Younis, who is captaining the North-West Frontier Province in the ongoing pentangular tournament, told reporters he was surprised at the low price tag he attracted from the city teams taking part in the IPL Twenty20 event.         
	It is a bit worrying because I was expecting a more attractive price tag, Younis said. But I am confident that it (money) will improve next time with better performance, he said.

	When you talk about a game like Chelsea vs Manchester United, everybody gets excited: the fans, the country, the press, everybody. The players know the importance of these games. Of course they want to play. Of course they want to win. But with these games they know they can also make history.         
	The build-up to these games is always intense. I can say for myself that we are building up to a big match of our own in eight days time: the local derby against Milan. I can tell that the players have begun to really look forward to the game. The excitement is building across the city. And in England it will have been the same thing building up to tomorrows big game.         
	But while everybody gets carried away, the managers stay pretty relaxed. You know in yourself what you need to do. I always looked forward to taking on Sir Alex Ferguson: it was an enjoyable time for me and for him. In three seasons we played so many times against each other.         
	We played in every competition except the Champions League: the FA Cup, Carling Cup, Community Shield and in the league. We played so many times. And the great thing was that the relationship stayed untouchable.         
	I like him very much, I know he likes me. We are friends. So probably we will have the chance to see each other again in the Champions League this season. I havent seen Sir Alex recently. When I was at the coaches meeting with Uefa I could only be there the first day, not the second, while he could only be there the second and not the first. So we didnt see each other. But even though we are now at a distance I know that he wishes me good things  and I wish him good things in return.         
	Of course Sir Alex might have a new rival now in his own city.         
	The takeover of Manchester City by the Abu Dhabi United Group and the signing of Robinho have been big news in the world of football. And the reactions have been strong.         
	Five, six years ago people had the same kind of reaction when Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea. And that was before people realised he was there not to make money. He was there for other reasons  he loved football.         
	He was there because he wanted to be in the game. He wanted to make something great and he did, making the team champions after more than 50 years without that trophy.         
	I think it depends what people want.         
	Roman was always passionate about football. Passion is the right word for Romans approach.         
	Did he make mistakes? Of course. Did he make great things? Of course.         
	Will he make more mistakes in the future? Of course. Him, me, everybody in football makes right choices and wrong choices. The reality is that the pressure is there and you have to deal with it. So these people in Manchester City, if they come to this with a lot of passion, and the objective of making Manchester City a better club, a bigger club, what is the problem?         
	Maybe Chelsea decided that at this moment, We dont want to fight with them so we step out. So I think this is not a problem for football. This is just more competition. The thing that gives me some pleasure in Chelsea is that when I look there, I see so many things we did together. For example, the training ground in Cobham. The money that Roman spent on the training ground, the ideas we all brought to it were invaluable.

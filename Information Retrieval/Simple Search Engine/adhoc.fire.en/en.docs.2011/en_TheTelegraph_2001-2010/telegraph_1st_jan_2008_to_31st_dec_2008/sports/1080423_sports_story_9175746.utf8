The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin set to sit out again
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sachin set to sit out again
                                Sachin Tendulkar    
	Chennai: Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar, recovering from a groin injury, will not be seen in action in the Indian Premier League match against Chennai Super Kings at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium here.         
	I am not too sure whether Sachin will play in our match tomorrow, South African allrounder Shaun Pollock said here.         
	Tendulkar did not play the first match against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday. His team suffered a five-wicket loss in a low scoring match.         
	Talking to the media soon after the teams practice session here, Pollock said: The physio will have a look at Sachins injury.         
	Explaining the importance of the ace batsmans availability in the later part of the tournament he said: We are not pushing him since it is a long tournament. He is a key player in our teams scheme of things and we do not want to rush him.         
	Asked whether Sachins absence would mean added pressure on Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya he said: He is in good touch and he will continue with his form. If he gets going in the initial seven overs, there will be good score on board. He knows how to handle Muthiah (Muralidharan).         
	It will be a case of marginal errors when we play Chennai. They have very good top half. It is going to be a high scoring game, Pollock said adding his side was balanced with a lot of allrounders and had good depth in bowling.         
	We have a balanced side and will be catching on the slog overs, he said. If the top order get going, we will put up a huge total on the board. Our strength lies there.         
	On his bowling, he said, it is very important to have variations to suit the Twenty20 format. In these kind of pitches, variations will yield better results than pace.

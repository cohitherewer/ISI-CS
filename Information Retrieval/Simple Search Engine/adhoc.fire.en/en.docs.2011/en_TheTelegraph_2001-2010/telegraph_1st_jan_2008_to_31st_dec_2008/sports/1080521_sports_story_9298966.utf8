    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former India captain picks the ones for the future             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            
	Calcutta: There are few better judges of talent than former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri. On Tuesday afternoon, he spoke to The Telegraph and chose the rather unheralded desi players whove grown in stature during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a couple of others whod got somewhat lost after much initial promise.               
	The following are excerpts from the one-on-one         
	His top five lesser known Indian players whove made a real big impact         
	1. MANPREET SINGH GONY (Chennai Super Kings, 24-year-old quick): Hes been very impressive Hes tall and has the right physique for a fast bowler Plus, hes got a good temperament. Seems to be a quick learner who has blossomed under Indias ODI and Twenty20 captain (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni Gony is very fit and, because of his height, gets that extra bounce He can only improve with exposure and, for me, is straightaway India material.         
	2. ABHISHEK NAYAR (Mumbai Indians, 24-year-old allrounder): Hes a terrific cricketer for the Twenty20 format However, I think Mumbai are batting him too low in the order Left to me, I wouldnt send him lower than No.5. Hes got the shots and, most important, is fearless That Nayar bowls and fields well is an added asset.         
	3. SHIKHAR DHAWAN (Delhi DareDevils, 22-year-old top-order batsman): A very promising hard-hitting batter with a wide range of shots Clearly, he has matured in the company of (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir I expect Dhawan to soon be pushing for an India place.         
	4. WRIDDHIMAN SAHA (Kolkata Knight Riders, 23-year-old wicketkeeper): An excellent keeper and a highly underrated batsman Like Nayar, though, I think he bats too down the order He can surprise the opposition Is unorthodox Can play big shots Sahas definitely a very good prospect.         
	5. RAVINDRA JADEJA (Rajasthan Royals, 19-year-old allrounder): Has tremendous energy on the park Is a brilliant fielder, with a terrific arm Hes dangerous at No.6 and will become more useful if asked to bowl more. I do see a bright future for Jadeja.         
	Now, the two players with some exposure to international cricket whove made a lasting impression                   Ravi Shastri      
	VENUGOPAL RAO (Deccan Chargers, 26-year-old middle-order batsman): Venu has matured tremendously and Id pick him in the ODI squad Hes exceedingly dangerous down the order and has a smart range of shots Hes a small man, but has hit some of the biggest shots in the IPL Thats an indication of the power and touch he possesses.         
	AMIT MISHRA (Delhi DareDevils, 25-year-old leg-spinner): Mishra has been around for some time, but such spinners are a rarity He knows his strengths, which is important, and has a very fine temperament Hes not afraid to bowl in any situation, plus doesnt lack variety A quality bowler.         
	Finally, on the quality of cricket in the IPL         
	Look at the tournament whichever what way, the IPL has exceeded expectations. I say this with absolute conviction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB set to showcause Utpal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       CAB set to showcause Utpal
            A STAFF REPORTER              Utpal                      
	Calcutta: Bengals eight wicket loss to Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy quarter final in Bangalore on Monday might just have paved the way for some stern action against coach Utpal Chatterjee.         
	Its almost certain that a showcause notice will be served on the former left-arm spinner, a top Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) official said.         
	Utpals comments on the selection of Sreevats Goswami in the squad for the quarter final against Tamil Nadu did not go down well with the CAB office-bearers. The issue will be discussed at the upcoming working committee meeting.         
	The controversy flared up after Utpal questioned the selection of Sreevats. The Bengal coach was not called for the selection committee meeting and the CAB later admitted it to be a lapse on their part.         
	Ive got used to this. Some things dont change. All I can say is that I felt insulted, the coach had said.         
	Utpals ire was mainly directed at chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee. The Ranji Trophy winning captain decided to join the team in Bangalore at the last moment, only after a request from president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	The atmosphere at the CAB office on Monday, after Bengals defeat, was one of disappointment.         
	Everybody seemed to rue the fact that Bengal dominated the match for most part of the three days, but lost the plot on the final day when they lost six quick wickets in the morning session.         
	Losing six wickets for 40 odd runs has no justification. But at least we achieved our primary goal of returning to the Elite group. In that sense, the boys have played well, said an office-bearer.

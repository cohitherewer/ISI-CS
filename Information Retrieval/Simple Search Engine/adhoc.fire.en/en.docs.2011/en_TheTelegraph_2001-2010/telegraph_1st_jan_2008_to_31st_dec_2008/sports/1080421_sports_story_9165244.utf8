	India to tour England in 2011  
	London: India will tour England in 2011 to play four Tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20 International, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Sunday. India will be in England for a return visit after that countrys tour of India in November this year to play two Tests and seven one-dayers. During Indias tour of England, the Tests would be at Lords, Trent Bridge, Edgbaston and The Oval, though the exact schedule will be finalised later. The ODIs will be played in Cardiff, Durham, Lords, The Oval and Hampshires Rose Bowl  but the venue for the Twenty20 International has not been announced yet.

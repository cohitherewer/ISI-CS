The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IHF gets ultimatum 
                                                   IHF gets ultimatum 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The international hockey federation (FIH) on Monday warned that India may lose the right to host the 2010 World Cup if the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) is unable to make progress in FIH-backed developmental projects.         
	The FIH executive board, which met in Lausanne recently, has also decided to look out for alternative venues in case India fail to live up to the expectations.         
	The FIH reconsidered the conditional awarding of the World Cup 2010 to New Delhi, the FIH said. However, the executive board has decided to give India some additional time, as provided for in the MoU signed in November 2007, before taking a final decision, it added.         
	The IHF, however, seems completely unperturbed by the developments. On Monday, no senior IHF official was present when the camp for the four-nation meet started in Bangalore.

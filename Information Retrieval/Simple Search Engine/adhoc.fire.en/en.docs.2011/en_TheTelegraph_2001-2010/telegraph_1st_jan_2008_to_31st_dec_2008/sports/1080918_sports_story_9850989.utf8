The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI: We dont go by what individuals have to say
                                                                                                                                                                                             BCCI: We dont go by what individuals have to say
    - India tour not yet confirmed, says captain ricky ponting           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Calcutta/Melbourne: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is not reading much into Ricky Pontings comments on Wednesday that their tour of India was still not confirmed.         
	A day after Cricket Australia (CA) gave the all-clear for the India tour, the Australia captain said nothing was set in stone and the decision could change depending on the security situation.         
	Anything could happen tomorrow, things change very quickly in the world right at the moment, Ponting told reporters in Canberra. CA will continue to be in touch and the government will continue to be in touch and Cricket Australia will keep us players and the players association in the loop on a daily, if not hourly basis, he added.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah made it clear that individual views dont count in such matters. We dont go by what Ponting or any other individual has to say. CA has said that the tour will go ahead as scheduled... As far as we are concerned, that is the final word, he said.         
	Has CA asked for any special security measures? Nothing in particular, Shah added. The normal procedures that are followed with each visiting side will be adhered to. Neither have they approached us for additional security after the blasts nor have we got in touch with the concerned authorities for extra security cover.         
	Ponting said no player has so far expressed any apprehension about touring India but the final call on the matter will come down to the department of foreign affairs and trades assessment of the situation.         
	As a group we havent been together. Im not sure if Cricket Australia have fielded any calls from individual players or families, but that wouldnt be unusual if that was the case, he said.         
	CA had declared Tuesday that the tour would go ahead as scheduled despite Saturdays serial blasts in New Delhi. CA said it has reviewed its security advice and confirmed that travel to India remains appropriate.         
	Our advice is there are some concerns and to exercise caution, but currently they do not compromise the tour, CA general manager of public affairs Peter Young said in a statement.         
	Accordingly, the four Test tour starting next month will go ahead as scheduled, with the Australian players and support staff due to leave for India on Sunday.         
	In consultation with the BCCI, we have upgraded security in and around the dressing rooms and they will have an escort to the ground, Young said.         
	The team will travel to Jaipur for initial acclimatisation and a practice match, with a second practice match in Hyderabad before the first Test gets underway in Bangalore from October 9, the statement said.         
	CA has reviewed its security advice since the tragic bombings in New Delhi last weekend and confirmed that travel to India remains appropriate, it added.         
	CA was also happy with the security arrangement for the Australia A team which is playing a tri-series in Hyderabad.

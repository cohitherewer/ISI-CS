                                                   Demand to sack Ponting 

           
	Cricket Australia should immediately sack its arrogant and abrasive captain Ricky Ponting and its a surprise that India have not yet called off the tour, a Sydney Morning Herald columnist said. If Cricket Australia cares a fig for the tattered reputation of our national team in our national sport, it will not for a moment longer tolerate the sort of arrogant and abrasive conduct seen from the captain and his senior players over the past few days, the paper said. 
    
	Beyond comparison it was the ugliest performance put up by an Australian side for 20 years. The only surprising part of it is that the Indians have not packed their bags and gone home. There is no justice for them in this country, nor any manners, it said. 
    
	He said the lack of sportsmanship among the Australians hurt their young fans and former players alike. Pained past players rang to express their disgust. It was a wretched and ill-mannered display and not to be endured from any side, let alone an international outfit representing a proud sporting nation. 
    
	The notion that Ponting can hereafter take the Australian team to India is preposterous. He has shown not the slightest interest in the well-being of the game... Not a single mark of respect for his accomplished and widely admired opponents. 
    
	Australian fieldsmen fire insults from the corners of their mouths, an intemperate Sikh warrior overreacts and his rudeness is seized upon. It might impress barrack room lawyers, he said. 
    
	In the past few days, Ponting has presided over a performance that dragged the game into the pits. He turned a group of professional cricketers into a pack of wild dogs. 
    
	 Sunil Gavaskar and Tony Greig accused tough-talking Australia of hypocrisy after dobbing in Harbhajan for alleged racial abuse. 
    
	If the umpires havent heard it, what has happened to the famous Australian saying: What happens on the field, stays on the field  lets have a beer at the end of the days play? Gavaskar was quoted as saying by Herald Sun. 
    
	Is it only when the Australians give it to somebody  what (happens) on the field, stays on the field? When they get it, has it got to be reported? It doesnt stay on the field. 
    
	 The Australian, took a conciliatory tone, but criticised Australias behaviour and the umpires. It is shameful this splendid Test match, won in such a remarkable fashion by the indomitable Australians, has left such a bitter tasteThe standard of play often was outstanding and occasionally exceptional but the standard of player behaviour was questionable and, at times, unacceptable. And the standard of umpiring was poor. 
    
	 Harbhajans decision to pat fast bowler Brett Lee on the bottom during play on Friday had sparked the racial furore, Andrew Symonds revealed it to the ICC on Sunday night. 
    
	When Symonds asked Harbhajan why he had done this, the Indian offspinner  then batting  allegedly called Symonds a monkey, according to a report in Australias The Daily Telegraph. 
    
	This eventually led to Harbhajan being reported for racial abuse, and a closed hearing with Mike Procter .

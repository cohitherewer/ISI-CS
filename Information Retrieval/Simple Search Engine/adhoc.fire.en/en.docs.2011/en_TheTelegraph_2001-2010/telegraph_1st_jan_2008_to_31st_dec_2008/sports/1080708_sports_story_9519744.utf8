Ponting was reviewed by Cricket Australia (CA) medical staff in consultation with Dr Greg Hoy, a wrist specialist. ldquo;Ricky has sustained a tendon injury that requires repair of tissues that hold the tendon in place. This surgery was performed today (Monday), rdquo; CA medical officer said.  Paul rsquo;s view  Melbourne: A cash bonanza it might be for players and administrators, but the Indian Premier League also poses the biggest threat to cricket rsquo;s integrity since the 90s match-fixing scandals, warns International Cricket Council rsquo;s anti-corruption unit chief Paul Condon. Condon feels the IPL may go the Sharjah way. ldquo;...The IPL brings with it the biggest threat in terms of corruption in the game since the days of cricket in Sharjah, rdquo; Condon said.  ZC stand  New Delhi: Dismissing the popular notion that vote politics is at the centre of Asian bloc rsquo;s unflinching support to Zimbabwe Cricket, its under-fire chairman Peter Chingoka asserted that the strong tie is actually based on their common perception of what is good for the game. In an interview, Chingoka rubbished the vote politics angle to ZC rsquo;s bonhomie with the Asian bloc and said: ldquo;All the friends we have are based on looking to do the right thing for world cricket. It is what is best way forward for the game. rdquo;  Vishy backing  Calcutta: On the eve of Sourav Ganguly rsquo;s 36th birthday which coincides with team selection for upcoming Sri Lanka tour, former chief selector Gundappa Rangnath Viswanath made a case for the ex-India captain, saying he still had much to deliver to the national team. On Monday, Viswanath said: ldquo;He had a tremendous career and in fact he is still going strong. He still has a lot to offer to Indian cricket. rdquo;						  CAB meeting   Calcutta: The Board of Trustees meeting at the CAB fell through after only one member turned up on Monday. Chairman Chandi Ganguly was absent due to illness, but Siddhartha Sankar Ray, Goutam Das Gupta and Bhairab Ganguly decided to skip the meeting. Ashok Prasad Ray was the only member present, says A Staff Reporter. ldquo;They have not sent us any details about last year rsquo;s expenditure. So there was no reason for me to be at the meeting only to sign the papers. I don rsquo;t want to be a rubber stamp member, rdquo; Das Gupta said.   Negi second   Philadelphia: Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi put up a creditable show at the World Open Chess tournament but narrowly missed the title after losing to higher-rated Russian GM Evgeny Najer in a tie-break. There was a four-way tie for the top position with Negi, Najer, Slovakian GM Lubomir Ftacnik and GM Alexander Moiseenko of Ukrain, finishing with seven points a piece after the ninth and final round. As per the rules, two players with the best progressive scores fought a play off for the title.

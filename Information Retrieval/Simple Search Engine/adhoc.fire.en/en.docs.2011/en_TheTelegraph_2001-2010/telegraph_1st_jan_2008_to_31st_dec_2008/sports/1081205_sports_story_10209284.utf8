	Tokyo: A flawless Jeev Milkha Singh carded a superb six-under 64 to share the second place after the opening round of the season-ending Nippon Series JT Cup at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club here Thursday.         
	The Indian, who is lying one stroke behind leader local favourite Kaname Yokoo (63), is tied at the second spot with Azuma Yano, Katsumasa Miyamoto of Japan and Thailands Prayad Marksaeng.         
	Jeev, who won the event in 2006 and finished third last year, was error free in his round as he made as many as six birdies with not a single bogey. The Chandigarh pro slotted three birdies each on the front and back nine.

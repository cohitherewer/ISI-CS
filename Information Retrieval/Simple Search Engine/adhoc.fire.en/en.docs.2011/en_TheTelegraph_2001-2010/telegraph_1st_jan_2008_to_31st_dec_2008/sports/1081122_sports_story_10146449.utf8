The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Subrata sees red over refereeing
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Subrata sees red over refereeing
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharjee on Friday expressed dissatisfaction over the standard of refereeing and also accused some officials of conspiring to relegate his team.         
	This kind of refereeing is not acceptable, an agitated Subrata said after the match.         
	 There should be a committee to review the referees performances and if anybody performs like this, he should be suspended.         
	Somehow I feel some officials have decided that United SC and Vasco should be relegated and they are working to that end. Otherwise how do I explain the way the referees are treating my team match after match, Subrata added.         
	Talking about his teams performance, Subrata said: Its true that we missed some goals but that can happen in a football match. The thing is even if I played Samuel Eto and Lionel Messi as strikers we wouldnt have won.         
	The referee would have disallowed our goals saying the scorer was off-side.         
	Mumbai FC coach David Booth refused to comment on the refereeing but said that he was upset with the opponents behaviour.         
	The whole United bench was hurling abuses at me. They should have tried to play better instead of abusing us, he said.         
	Subrata, however, denied the allegation. Yes, we were unhappy with the way the match was going on. But nobody said anything to Booth or the Mumbai FC players, he maintained.

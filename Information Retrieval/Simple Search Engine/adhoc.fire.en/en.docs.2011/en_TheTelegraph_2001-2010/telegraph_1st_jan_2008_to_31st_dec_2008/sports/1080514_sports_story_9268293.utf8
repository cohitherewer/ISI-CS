                                                                                                                                                                                                     Shoaib: I was hungry to perform
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It was a one man show really in Kolkata Knight Riders 23-run win over the formidable Delhi DareDevils at the Eden on Tuesday. And man of the moment Shoaib Akhtar was magnanimous in his hour of glory. Despite a devastating opening spell of 3-0-11-4 that the broke the backbone of the visiting side, the Pakistan tear-away said total team effort was the reason behind this fabulous win. A visibly tired but elated Shoaib took a few questions at the post-match news conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On whether he expected to have such an impact         
	Listen... I have really been backed to the hilt by my Kolkata Knight Riders teammates. They had made me feel comfortable in the dressing room. I have been going through a lot of stress of late and have been under the weather on various fronts. But at the dressing room, the boys were totally by my side and have inspired me to do well... They assured me and helped me put my trials and tribulations behind. I just had to come out and perform.         
	How important is this performance         
	Well I have never played for individual glory... Kolkata Knight Riders are my home team. We are playing at home and I have given my best for my side. I have always given more than 100 per cent whenever I have taken the field. Be it for my country or other sides...         
	Reaction after bagging the first wicket         
	I missed playing, you know... It was four months since I last played... I was hungry to perform. Besides, I had a few niggles and have been battling a lot of stress... So it was really nice to be in the groove. Today I had everything going for me. However, the best thing is that we won the game. We were really charged up today.         
	On the crowd         
	This is my home team and I was playing in front of my home crowd. What can I say? The crowd was fantastic... I love Calcutta, love the crowd at the Eden. They really back you up. They were really fascinating. As a fast bowler, I couldnt have asked for more.         
	On polishing off the Delhi top order         
	We tried hard. Every-body chipped in... Huss (David Hussey), Laxmi (Ratan Shukla). We were determined to do well. It was a total team effort.         
	Chatting with Sourav         
	Well... He was asking for my opinion and I told him that I am ready to bowl the third over on trot.         
	Everything seems to be going right for you now...         
	Kya kahen? Bas Allah ka sukar hain...

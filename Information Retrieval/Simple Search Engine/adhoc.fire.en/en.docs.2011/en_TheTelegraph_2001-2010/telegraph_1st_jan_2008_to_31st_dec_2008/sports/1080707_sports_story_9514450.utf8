	New Delhi: India began their 12-day training-cum-exposure trip in Portugal with a 2-0 victory over Gouveira Select in a friendly match on Saturday (not 3-0 as reported in Sundays Late City edition).         
	India were a dominant side from the beginning of the match and opened the scoring in the 31st minute through midfielder Climax Lawrence, who had a good day in office before being replaced in the second half.         
	India had another chance to increase their lead three minutes before the half time when Sunil Chetri found the target. The referee, however, disallowed the goal, as Chetri was found offside.         
	In the second half, the local side, mainly consisting of amateur players, tried to stage a comeback but the Indian defence, led by Mahesh Gawli, stood firm to thwart the Gouveira attacks.         
	India rounded off the tally in the 85th minute through substitute striker Tarif Ahmed.         
	Later, the city mayor of Gouveira hosted a dinner for the Indian team.

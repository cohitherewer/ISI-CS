  - In Azlan Shah, we beat 3 teams who made Beijing cut
                    Stick-work
      Gurbux Singh        
	After the Olympic Games debacle, we have done rather well in the recently-concluded Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, reaching the final where we lost to Argentina 1-2. Though this is a good result, let us not get carried away.         
	First and foremost, what is most important at the international level is consistency. We have been lacking in this very important aspect for the last 55 years. The achievements of this rather young team (average age of 20 and half-years), and about 50 per cent of them with no prior national experience, have been creditable.         
	The important thing to note here is that though we lost to New Zealand and Argentina, we have beaten Belgium, Pakistan and Canada  three teams who have made the Beijing cut.         
	What it tells us is that though we have the talent to be successful on the international stage, we lack the consistency. We are capable of winning matches and shocking our superior opponents but incapable of winning tournaments which requires sustainable success.         
	For the last 28 years, we havent entered the semi-finals of either the Olympic Games or the World Cup.         
	The closest we came to entering the last-four stage was in Sydney. We were leading 1-0 till the last one-and-half minute when we conceded a silly goal. A draw wasnt enough.         
	Another crucial factor is that we go to every tournament with the hope of claiming the title but hockey powerhouses such as the Netherlands or Spain treat the tourneys as practice opportunities to test their squad.         
	They send their full-strength squad only for the big three  the Champions Trophy, the World Cup and the Olympic Games.         
	While we may not be in a position to emulate their policy, we can at least try to create the right atmosphere for our talents to develop. And that, unfortunately, wont be possible until we invest in a larger way in infrastructure.         
	I have said this before, that while the Netherlands have 3000 astroturf surfaces and by 2009 another 1000 are coming up, we hardly have 25 odd surfaces. The money that has been allotted goes mostly towards the maintenance. We need at least another 30 surfaces on an urgent basis, but wholl bell the cat?         
	I have been trying for the last 12 years to build an astroturf in Bengal. I have been unsuccessful so far in persuading the state government in allowing a plot of 100mx60m. Problems remain. Its unfortunate that we have named hockey as our national game.         
	Moreover, these are turbulent times for Indian hockey. The erstwhile Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), which has now been disbanded, has gone against the taking over by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and has moved the court.         
	The hearing has been fixed on July 6. I hope that whatever result is arrived at, happens quickly because otherwise the game in India would suffer. In July we have the Junior Asia Cup in Hyderabad. Questions remain as to who would select the team. Uncertainty isnt advised for a game that is passing through a difficult phase in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nalbandian ends Murray run
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nalbandian ends Murray run
                  David Nalbandian after his victory on Friday                     
	Paris: Defending champion David Nalbandian kept his Masters Cup hopes alive when he ended world No. 4 Andy Murrays 14-match winning streak with a 7-6 (3), 6-3 win in the Paris Masters quarter finals on Friday.         
	I played almost perfect, Nalbandian said. I think I returned really well and thats important in indoor (tennis). Murrays 14-match winning streak was snapped, and he failed in his bid to win a record third straight Masters title after victories at Madrid and Cincinnati.         
	Argentine Nalbandian will now meet Russian Davydenko in the semi-finals on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, top-ranked Rafael Nadal retired with a knee injury after losing the first set 1-6 against Nikolay Davydenko in the quarter finals, just hours after Roger Federer pulled out of the tournament with a sore back.         
	Nadal said he has never had a similar injury and that he needs further tests before he decides whether to play the season-ending Masters Cup, which begins November 9 in Shanghai.         
	Federer, meanwhile, pulled out shortly before his quarterfinal against James Blake because of a stiff back, but said he didnt have a serious injury.           (AP)

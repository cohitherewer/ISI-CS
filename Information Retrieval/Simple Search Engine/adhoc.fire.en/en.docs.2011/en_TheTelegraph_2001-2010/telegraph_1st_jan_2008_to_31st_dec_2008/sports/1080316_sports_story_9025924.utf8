	Jeju: A wild approach at the 18th hole cost Briton Graeme McDowell the outright lead after the third round of the $2.9 million Ballantines Championship on Saturday.         
	A double-bogey six gave the Northern Irishman a six-under 66, leaving him tied with Indias Jeev Milkha Singh on 18-under 198 in the first European Tour event to be held in South Korea.         
	Jeev fired a sparkling 64 in calm conditions on the honeymoon island of Jeju following two days of gusting winds.         
	Irelands Paul McGinley carded a 67 to claim third position four strokes off the pace at the cliff-top Pinx Golf Club while British Open champion Padraig Harrington was a further two adrift.         
	Jyoti Randhawa managed a 70 to be tied 19th at six-under, while Gaurav Ghei could only compile a 74 to be way down the leader-board at tied 60th place (two-over par).         
	Resplendent in a pair of bright pink trousers, McDowell continued his red-hot form as he tore up the front nine in 30 shots.         
	Four birdies and an eagle on the par-five fourth, where he sank a 20-foot left-to-right putt, put him firmly in the driving seat with only Jeev posing a serious threat.         
	The Indian rattled off five successive birdies from the seventh and kept the pressure on McDowell as the two men went toe to toe in an absorbing duel.         
	McDowell claimed further birdies at 12 and 16 before overcooking his approach to the 18th and having to drop for a penalty stroke after finding a lateral hazard.         
	McDowell, who returned a 64 on Friday, is chasing his third victory on the European Tour, his last win coming at the 2004 Italian Open.         
	But Jeev believes he has the momentum going into Sundays final round.         
	Today was one of those days when I felt I couldnt miss, said the Indian, who arrived here semi-concussed after crashing his golf buggy into a palm tree at last weeks Malaysian Open.         
	I had no idea I made five birdies in a row. I knew Id made a few. I wasnt thinking about it. It was just the momentum.         
	Swedens Johan Edfors (69), who played in the final group with McDowell and Jeev, finished fourth, one shot ahead of Harrington and Webber.         
	World No. 5 KJ Choi failed to mount a charge in front of his home fans, firing his second successive 69 for a total of 209.           (AGENCIES)

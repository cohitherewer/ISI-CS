The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mood within is to drop Dinesh Karthik
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mood within is to drop Dinesh Karthik
    - Hosts confused over retaining grass at the P. Sara Stadium           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar at a practice session in Colombo on Wednesday                                 
	Colombo: While the Indians appear to be in a bind over who should stand behind the stumps in the series-deciding Test, beginning on Friday, the Sri Lankans seem pretty confused on the issue of grass at the P. Sara Stadium.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, generally speaking, the mood within is to drop the out-of-form Dinesh Karthik and give Parthiv Patel his first Test in almost four years.         
	However, those in favour of that change dont quite know captain Anil Kumbles thoughts on the matter and his really will be the final word. Karthik, who replaced Parthiv back in October 2004, is woefully short on confidence and his shoddy work has made it tougher for the bowlers.         
	Incidentally, Parthiv trained longer than Karthik during Wednesdays session, the visitors first after winning the Galle Test and making it 1-1.         
	Its Sachin Tendulkar, though, who sweated it out the most. Two Tests have gone and he still hasnt been able to knock off the 172 runs needed to surpass Brian Laras record.         
	The senior-most pro requires 97 more and, clearly, is intent on getting that many at least during the forthcoming face-off. Indias next Test, against Australia, is in October.         
	Where the Sri Lankans are concerned, their top worry is over the kind of surface to offer. Should grass be retained or, given Ishant Sharmas ability to get breakthroughs, removed?         
	Things werent clear till late in the evening. That veteran spearhead Chaminda Vaas hasnt been effective with a capital E has made it more difficult. The hosts, meanwhile, have retained the 15 and its expected that new-ball bowler Nuwan Kulasekara is going to be dropped. Either Thushara Mirando or Dhammika Prasad will get his place.         
	Both Mirando and Prasad are quick and the Sri Lankans believe that pace could actually stop Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir from getting their team off to terms-dictating starts.         
	In Galle, they put on 167 in the first innings and 90 in the second. Both partnerships proved decisive.

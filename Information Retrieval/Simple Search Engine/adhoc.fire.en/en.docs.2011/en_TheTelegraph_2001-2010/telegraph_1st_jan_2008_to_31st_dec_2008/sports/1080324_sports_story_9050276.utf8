The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella happy with late pace
                                                   Fisichella happy with late pace
                      
	Sepang: Force India driver Giancarlo Fisichella finished 12th in the Malaysian Grand Prix here on Sunday.         
	Switching to hard tyre helped Fisichella overcome a wobbly start and he benefitted from Rubens Barichellos drive-through penalty to gain five places.         
	Fisichellas teammate Adrian Sutil had no such luck and for the second Grand Prix running, the German youngster retired with a hydraulic snag on the fifth lap.         
	The Sepang international circuit thoroughly tested Fisichella, who demonstrated the improved race pace of the VJM01, battling throughout with the midfield pack and setting a string of lap times just over one second from the leaders.         
	At the start, I had a lot of wheel spin and lost a lot of positions. On my first stint I was suffering a lot of under-steer with graining on the soft tyres but then in my stop I adjusted the front flap and went onto the harder tyres and stayed on them for both stints, Fisichella said.         
	I am happy with my race pace later on though, and it is promising for the rest of the season, said Fisichella.         
	Sutil rued: Very early on in the race I developed a mechanical problem. I am very disappointed with this start to the season, especially after I had to stop so soon into the race in Australia too, he rued.

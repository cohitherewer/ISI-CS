The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Success due to individual efforts, says Jwala 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Success due to individual efforts, says Jwala 
    - WE HAVE PROVIDED GOOD COACHES, FACILITIES AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT: BAI PRESIDENT           JAYDEEP BASU                                      Jwala Gutta       
	New Delhi: Jwala Gutta sounded surprisingly bitter, barely 48 hours after winning the womens doubles and the mixed doubles titles in the Bulgarian Open.         
	Indian shuttlers have been doing well on the international circuit but that has hardly anything to do with the overall improvement of the game in India, said Jwala from The Netherlands, where she is taking part in the Dutch Open.         
	Me, Chetan and others have won quite a few tournaments in the last few months, all because of our individual efforts. We have no sponsors, no backing from the custodians of the game (read Badminton Association of India), said the national doubles champion.         
	Indian badminton is on a roll; besides Jwala, shuttlers like Saina Nehwal, Chetan Anand, Arvind Bhatt, Aditi Mutatkar, V. Diju, Shruti Kurian and others have made the country proud in international tournaments.         
	And according to BAI president V.K. Verma, the long list of successful players in international meets is an example of the associations active role in taking the game forward.         
	It is not right to say all players have come only because of their individual efforts, Verma said from Pune. We have provided good coaches, top-class facilities and to some extent, financial support. All these things have resulted in producing so many players.                   Chetan Anand      
	There was a time, he added, (that) India produced a top player once in 10 years like Prakash Padukone, Syed Modi or Gopichand. Today, there are more than half a dozen Indians in the top 50 in the world rankings. The BAI has played a major role in training these players.         
	Pullela Gopichand, the second Indian after Padukone to win the All England Championship, in 2001, holds a similar view.         
	If the sponsors are paying money for the players to go abroad, train and play, that is because of BAIs efforts, he stressed.         
	Saina, Indias top woman shuttler and the world No. 11, who made the quarter finals at the Beijing Olympics, said: I cant say that what I am today is all because of individual efforts. I am working hard but the Mittal Champions Trust is also playing a major role in my success.         
	Going by different versions, Indian badminton appears to be a divided house between the haves and the have-nots. Those willing to toe the official line get rewarded, while others struggle to get the required support.                     
	Last season, Jwala, Shruti and Chetan earned the wrath of the BAI when they refused to attend the national camp, saying they would rather play international tournaments to gain experience.         
	The BAI hit back by keeping them out of the national team. The players did not relent and continued to play outside India but did not receive the expected backing.         
	All our expenses are borne by us, said Chetan, currently ranked 22nd in the world.         
	Verma, on the other hand, claimed that out of the 20 international tournaments Anand played in the past one year, 10 were funded by the government.         
	Arvind Bhatt and Anup Sridhar also played a lot of tournaments, Verma said. In the next one year, India will host the world juniors, the world championships and the Asian meet. It is a team effort to promote an individual game. We are moving in the right direction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to focus on the game
                                                                                                                                                                                           Time to focus on the game
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                    
	Chennai: This series is not just about cricket. For a nation rocked by terror strikes and still grappling to come to terms with reality, the RBS Cup could do much to heal the wounds.         
	The reverberations of the calamity are still being felt. Commandos in every nook and corner of the MA Chidambaram Stadium, empty stands with none around to catch a glimpse of the stars, the eerie silence broken only by the sound of bat on ball and the odd raised voice...         
	Theres no room to breathe as you are thoroughly searched at every entry point. Those nearest to the players, besides the net bowlers, are the gun-totting Rapid Action Force personnel. Welcome to the surreal world of cricket post 26/11!         
	No one seems to complain though.         
	Theres no doubt Englands admirable show of solidarity in this hour of crisis will go a long way in instilling faith in the minds of people. I am grateful to them for coming, Mahendra Singh Dhoni echoed the mood of every Indian on the eve of the opening Test.         
	The time is ripe to focus on the game and both captains tried to put things in the right perspective. You could say we cant lose in this situation There is no nonsense to be said about what has happened. I told the boys this morning that its a case of coming to this series like it would be in England, said Kevin Pietersen.         
	Dhoni was forthcoming, too. We have an important series to play. The best thing that I could give India at this juncture is a good game of cricket. That is what we are here to do as professional cricketers.         
	However hard England might try to forget the one-day series as a bad dream, their dismal record against spin in the subcontinent is sure to put them under enormous pressure. Add to it Indias potent pace attack, a solid opening pair and a team that is unwilling to treat any cause as lost.         
	For India it will again be a chance to regain the No.2 spot in Test rankings after defeating the No. 1 team in the world. Under Dhonis innovative and dashing leadership in his first full series as Test captain, they will also have to contend with the absence of Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly.         
	While Amit Mishra has sealed the spot left vacant by Kumble for the moment, Yuvraj Singh will fill in for Sourav. Despite enjoying a tremendous run in one-dayers, Yuvraj has been inconsistent in Tests  1050 runs in 23 matches. He knows well that he has to be successful to keep other contenders for the spot at bay.         
	And as Pietersen said, England will not let go the opportunity to test him with the short ball.         
	There were words of caution from his captain. The biggest fault will be if Yuvi tries to step into the shoes of Sourav. He should be himself. He is a very different individual, warned Dhoni.         
	Like it or not, much like Yuvraj, Rahul Dravid will also be under pressure. With only two half-centuries in his previous 17 innings, the former India captain has to deliver if he wants to stop the aspersions cast on his place in the team. Dhoni felt Dravid was only one innings away from regaining form, but that is easier said than done.         
	In what has been a respite of sorts, there was no rain for the whole of Wednesday and bright sunshine meant good news for the curator. That, however, doesnt completely rule out the possibility of moisture beneath the surface.         
	Dhoni admitted that England were a better bowling side in the traditional form of the game. With the inclusion of two spinners  Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann, who will make his debut  England have announced a positive intent.         
	Steve Harmison and James Anderson pose more threat with their incisive and varying line along with Andrew Flintoff. Matt Prior will don the big gloves for his first Test in almost a year.         
	A riveting contest between the experienced England top-order and the Indian new ball bowlers could decide the shape of things to come. Both captains, no doubt, will be relying on the age-old tactics of piling on the runs and putting the opposition under pressure.         
	However, given the circumstances, this Test will not throw up a loser.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal hold Salgaocar
                                                East Bengal hold Salgaocar
                      
	Margao: East Bengal survived some anxious moments in the closing minutes to hold Salgaocar Sports Club to a goalless draw in their Round X outing of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday.         
	East Bengal dominated the first half but failed to convert the half-chances. In the second-half, Salgaocar came back strongly but were unlucky for not collecting full points in the dying minutes. Substitute Dipankar Roy made a goal line save off a header by Felix Chimaokwu.         
	East Bengal now have eight points from 10 matches, while Salgaocar have collected five. Salgaocars Fabio Dos Passos was adjudged man of the match. East Bengal came close to score in the first 28th minute when defender Debabrata Roy moved on the left and centred it to Dipendu Biswas into the box whose header missed the mark narrowly. A combined move between Snehashis Chakraborty and Debabrata Roy saw the later sending a cross to Edmilson Marques whose volley missed the target by a whisker.         
	Salgaocar too came up with a few raids. They attacked more aggressively after the change of ends with Boniface Ambani replaced Milagres Gonsalves.         
	Salgaocar nearly took the lead in the 54th minute when Ambanis shot sailed inches over the bar. They piled on the pressure and had the best chance to break the deadlock but Fabio Dos Passos headed out from close after Ambani toed the ball to him after a cross from substitute Nicholas Rodrigues.         
	Salgaocar went all out in the dying minutes in search of the winner but were unlucky when Felix Chimaokwus header was saved on the goal line by substitute Dipankar Roy of a flag kick taken by Joe Rodrigues.

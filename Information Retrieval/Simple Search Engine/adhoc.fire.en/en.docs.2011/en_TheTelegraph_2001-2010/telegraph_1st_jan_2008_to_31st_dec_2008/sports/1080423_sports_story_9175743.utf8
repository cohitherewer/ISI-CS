The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL will give youngsters the right exposure, says Dhoni 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL will give youngsters the right exposure, says Dhoni 
  - We dont want to rush him, says Pollock of Mumbai Indians captain             Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni rides his Harley-Davidson with teammate Partihv Patel, in Chennai on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Chennai: The team that gels well in the league matches would be the ultimate winner of the inaugural Indian Premier League, according to Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Talking to reporters on the eve of his teams second league match against Mumbai Indians, Dhoni said: The teams have played just one or two matches. You cannot make any assessment on this basis. There are lots of matches left. There will be ups and downs. The team which gels well throughout will be the winner.         
	Dhoni said the IPL has got the right kind of start it needed.         
	The start has been great, McCullums batting has been solid one. Fans also got what they wanted. They saw some huge sixes, dance by cheerleaders, teams piling up huge scores and bowlers taking wickets. It provided excitement for the fans.         
	On playing with Hayden, who was involved in some acrimonious face-offs with the Indian team during their recent series Down Under, Dhoni said: Then, two nations were pitted against each other and the Aussies are always known for their aggression. Right now we are concentrating on the IPL rather than the issues of the past.         
	Asked about the dressing room atmosphere especially in the presence of top international players, he said it was a chance to get to know each other better.         
	The players get to know each other better now. It gives an opportunity to understand each others culture well. The youngsters, especially the Under-19 players, will get the right kind of exposure, he said.         
	Dhoni, who left for his hotel from the stadium after the practice session on his new Harley-Davidson bike, ruled out the possibility of his opening the innings.         
	Dhoni stressed on the need to have solid starts and maintain the momentum all the time in Twenty20 format.         
	In ODIs, you get time to settle down and then score. But in Twenty20, you need to score from the start and will not get time to settle.         
	We have openers like Australian Matthew Hayden. Even if he leaves (next month for national duty), we have another opener in Stephen Fleming. They are capable of giving us a solid start. I will be looking to build from that in the slog overs.         
	On the composition of his team for Wednesdays match, the 26-year-old said he would stick to the 16 which played in the last match but will decide on the playing XI before the match.         
	The Super Kings skipper admitted that his teams bowling was weak. We have to make the most of it with the available bowlers. We have to motivate them to bowl in the right areas, he said.         
	Another area of concern, according to Dhoni, was fielding. Its been average so far. Hopefully it will improve as the tournament progresses.           (PTI)

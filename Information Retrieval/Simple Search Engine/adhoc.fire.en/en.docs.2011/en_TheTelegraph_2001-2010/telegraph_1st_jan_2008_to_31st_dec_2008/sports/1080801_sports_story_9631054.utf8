The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chances of a medal from Sania look bleak
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chances of a medal from Sania look bleak

	In media reports, one seldom reads about Sania winning or losing a match. When she wins she storms into the next round and when she loses she crashes. The words create an image of a high-flying superwoman, whose success is always spectacular and for whom defeat is unexpected.         
	Bolstered by an enthusiastic press, she is put in orbit for a landing in the top 10 or 20. Weight of expectation and sponsorship money, based on performance, is a heavy load to carry. So far, Sania, aided by her glamour and spunky statements, seems to have tackled all these things with reasonable success.         
	But 2008 has been a very rough and trying year for her. Her giant-killing exploits have faded out and she is struggling to retain her place in the rankings. Injuries and lack of match sharpness have cost her dearly.                     Sania Mirza      
	At Wimbledon, Sania held four match points against the Spaniard Martinez Sanchez for a place in the third round against Venus Williams, but failed to convert a single one. It cannot be attributed to bad luck. Lack of match play has blunted the sharp edge of her game, but more significantly, she seems to have lost the abandon with which she used to hit her forehand winners.         
	This was what was most feared by her opponents and her greatest strength. Her backhand, movement and consistency have improved but she must learn to use her trump card  the forehand at full blast.         
	On the circuit there are many girls who can keep a rally going on indefinitely. Rallying from the baseline wont get her anywhere. Hit or miss, Sania must continue to fire her fusillade of winners, and put pressure on her opponents by sorties to the net and volleying, especially after she has hit a good forehand.         
	To do this, she has to break free from the pressure of losing her ranking and sponsorships, and just go for it like she did endearingly in the past. All this is not possible unless she is fully fit and injury free. Her team should get the best expertise, take a step back and put in place a long-term plan with reduced selective tournament play, geared for her to peak for the big tournaments.         
	Patch up jobs and rushing back after injuries will not allow her to achieve her full potential. Seventy per cent of tennis injuries are due to overuse of limbs, and tend to spread as other muscles try to compensate for the injured one. One has to emphatically endorse Sanias talent and admire the great effort she is making, but much more needs to be done by her to achieve her potential.         
	It is sad that the Olympics have come at a time when Sania is struggling to climb out of a trough of six consecutive early defeats in tournaments; one in the first round to a qualifier, and five in the second round. Even at her giant-killing best, glimpse of a bronze medal would be a fairy tale for Sania.         
	Now it would be futile to expect a medal from her. Asian womens tennis has taken a giant leap forward with Jie Zheng of China reaching the semi-finals and Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand the quarter finals at Wimbledon.         
	In Beijing, the old warriors Paes and Bhupathi  now in their mid-thirties, are there after a very narrow miss in the last Olympics. The duo are running out of steam. The rhythmic clickety-click of the teams wheels has not been lubricated for a few years. Can aging limbs with cold fusion replace hot youthful chest bumps for a country starved of medals?

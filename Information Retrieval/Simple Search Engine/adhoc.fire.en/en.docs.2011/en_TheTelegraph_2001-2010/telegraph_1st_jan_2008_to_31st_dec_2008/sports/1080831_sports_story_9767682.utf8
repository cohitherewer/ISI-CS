The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our build-up to 2012 Games should start right now
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Our build-up to 2012 Games should start right now

	The Olympic Games in Beijing have just concluded. The 2008 edition of the biggest show on earth has been memorable and a very positive one for India. Notwithstanding the disappointment of our absence in hockey  for the first time ever  it has been a great Olympics for us. Personally, though, I never felt the inclination to go to Beijing because it was very hard for me take that India went unrepresented in the very event that had fetched them eight gold medals in the past.         
	But its time to look ahead and bask in the glory that Abhinav Bindra, Vijender Kumar and Sushil Kumar have brought for us. Let me make it clear though that I will be happy only if the country doesnt suffer from amnesia and forget their performances with alacrity.         
	Not only three, our aim should be to get at least double that amount of medals in London. Its important to strike when the iron is hot. Now is the time to embark on a plan with a vision and find a few dedicated people who will help carry the dream forward which the trio have made possible.         
	Most officials in the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) think their job is over as long as their wards qualify for the quadrennial showpiece. What we need here is a change in attitude, a realisation that these three medals are only the beginning of a more fruitful sporting future.         
	Apart from the three, we could have, with a little bit of luck, got three more medals. Boxers Akhil and Jitender faltered at finish and in badminton, Saina Nehwals nerves failed her due to lack of experience.         
	While congratulating Bindra for winning Indias sole gold medal in individual event, the buildup for London should start right now.         
	Even the medals were more the result of individual brilliance than collective effort. All the three shone because of their will power and despite the crippled system that is in place in India. Bindra had support from his father, whereas most of our wrestlers are still now practising their art on mud!         
	Coming back to hockey, it was equally disheartening to see Pakistan finish on eighth spot. The game in Asia is in doldrums. Germany won the gold because they acted on a meticulous plan. Not only are countries such as Germany, Holland, Spain or Australia ahead of us in terms of infrastructure, the game is in these parts of the world are in the hands of officials with vision and ambition.         
	For instance, we urgently need at least 25-30 astroturfs. . I urge the sports minister to look at this aspect if we are to come anywhere close to the world leaders in hockey. Lastly, the legal tiff between the IOA and the Indian Hockey Federation must stop as soon as possible. Let us all take a collective vow. If China can do it, so can we.

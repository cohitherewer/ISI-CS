	Samuels likely to challenge ban  Kingston: West Indian cricketer Marlon Samuels rsquo; lawyers are contemplating challenging the two-year suspension slapped on the allrounder for his alleged links with Indian bookmaker Mukesh Kochchar.   Jamaican attorneys K Churchill Neita and Delano Harrison, who represented Samuels in the case before the West Indies Cricket Board rsquo;s disciplinary committee, are seriously thinking of applying for a judicial review.  ldquo;From the outset, we wish to make it clear that we proposed to challenge the findings of the majority (3-1) by way of judicial inquiry, as we believe a most grave injustice has been done by their finding of our client rsquo;s liability of one of the International Cricket Council rsquo;s (ICC rsquo;s) disciplinary offences, rdquo; the lawyers said in a statement.   The cricketer was charged with getting benefits of hotel accommodation worth $1,238 from Kochchar and this, according to ICC Code of Conduct, could bring the game into disrepute.     
	 Shoaib hearing from June 8  Karachi: The appellate tribunal that is due to hear the appeal of Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar against his five-year-ban will now resume its proceedings from June 8 instead of June 4, the date announced earlier by its chairman, Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh.  The tribunal has suspended Shoaib rsquo;s five-year ban for a one month so that he could play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) but this grace period ends on June 4 when the regular hearing against the ban was due to start.     
	 Ramiz rsquo;s view  Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Ramiz Raja rued Pakistani cricketers in the IPL have not lived up to the expectations even though he believes the IPL exposure would make them more responsible and better equipped to handle pressure situations.    
	 Modi rsquo;s plan   New Delhi: Lalit Modi would like to see IPL Twenty20 extravaganza taking place twice a year from 2011. While the ongoing inaugural edition of the slam-bang tournament has already proved to be an immense hit, Modi, the IPL commissioner and chairman, is in no mood to pause and bask in the glory.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: The government will not be okaying Team Indias tour of Pakistan, scheduled to begin on January 4. Besides, its quite likely that permission wont also be given to play the Shoaib Maliks at a neutral venue, possibly in the UAE.         
	The situation is very bad and very messy It wasnt as bad even after the attack on Parliament You can, therefore, take it that nothing would be okayed anywhere, a well-placed source told The Telegraph from New Delhi.         
	Speaking on Sunday evening, the gentleman added: In fact, at this point in time, the government is not thinking of cricket Much bigger issues are at play I hope you understand.         
	As first reported in these columns, the Indian cricketers are themselves not keen on touring Pakistan.         
	Agencies add from Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said it would not react to talk that the Indian government had decided not to send Team India to Pakistan.         
	We have received nothing at all from the Indian cricket board, not even verbally, about the tour being called off. So, we are waiting and watching, Saleem Altaf, chief operating officer, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bad blood threatens to spill over into IPL
                                                   Bad blood threatens to spill over into IPL
    - Better if the Australians dont come at all, says a Team India SENIOR           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The bad blood generated during Indias just-ended tour of Australia may just spill over big time into the multi-million dollar Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Thats a strong possibility going by what one of the eight Team India members, who did the full tour (Tests and ODIs), told The Telegraph.         
	Theres uncertainty over whether the Australians will be available for the entire IPL, but who needs them? After what happened (the controversies in Australia), it will be better if they dont come at all, the senior player said.         
	His tone was of absolute disgust and appeared to reflect the mood within Team India. Its another matter that the IPLs promoters, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, wont acknowledge it.         
	The IPLs inaugural edition, from April 18-June 1, will at some point feature at least 12 Australians (including Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, whore through with international cricket).         
	Of the 13 who were auctioned on February 20, only Justin Langer wont be seen in action. He too has quit the big league, though.         
	Some more Australians could, of course, figure in the second auction, planned for next week, and then in the League.         
	The top showdowns, great for the marketing men no doubt, would be when Mumbai (Harbhajan Singh) and Hyderabad (Andrew Symonds) play each other and when Mumbai takes on Chennai (Matthew Hayden).         
	Also when Calcutta (Ishant Sharma) plays Chennai, as Hayden has challenged the quick to a bout in the ring! The Calcutta-Mumbai face-offs too, given that Ricky Ponting and Harbhajan often didnt have pleasant things to tell each other during some of the more heated moments during the long tour.         
	It wont surprise if the Match Referees are kept very busy.         
	The IPLs matches, all Twenty20, will be played on a home-and-away basis.

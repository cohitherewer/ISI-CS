The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF wants fewer foreign players
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AIFF wants fewer foreign players
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to reduce the number of foreign players in club football to promote local talent, according to AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.         
	Speaking to the media during the launch of the inaugural Haryana state league here, the AIFF boss said a new regulation would soon be brought about to restrict the number of foreigners in the clubs.         
	As our chief coach Bob Houghton has pointed out time and again, the presence of foreign footballers in Indian club football is a clear hindrance towards the growth of home talents, Das Munshi said.         
	The coach is currently holidaying in South Africa. Once he returns to India, we are going to sit with him and see what can be done in this regard. Our plan is to gradually reduce the participation of foreigners, he added.         
	Currently, each club is allowed to recruit three foreigners for the I-League. In all other tournaments, the clubs can register two foreigners each. The rule has been criticised by Houghton on several occasions since it prevents Indian players, especially strikers, from playing for their respective clubs regularly. The AIFF president hinted that the process of eliminating foreigners from domestic football has already started.         
	For the first three years, I have advised the Haryana Football Association (HFA) not to allow foreign players in their league, Das Munshi said. The move will encourage the local players to come forward and show their talents.         
	The AIFF president admitted that the federation was yet to make it mandatory for all the member units to organise annual state leagues.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: A confident Bengal will meet dark horse Tripura in their second match of the East Zone National One-dayers at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. Bengal thrashed Assam by nine wickets in their opening encounter on Thursday.         
	A good wicket for batting. A score anything above 260 seems to be a safe target, said a confident Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Friday.         
	He, however, said everyone will have to put in their best effort because Tripura are also a strong opponents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McCullum: Vettori has it in him to be a good captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     McCullum: Vettori has it in him to be a good captain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Brendon McCullum is well known for his big hitting and is expected to play a big part in the Kolkata Knight Riders campaign in the Indian Premier League. The New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman was candid during a press conference at the hotel on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Playing under Sourav Ganguly         
	Sourav has a tremendous record both as a captain and batsman. He is passionate about the game We need such a captain.         
	His thoughts on having to open for Kolkata Knight Riders with either Chris Gayle or Sourav         
	Hopefully we can give a good start to the innings. Both Sourav and Gayle are good strokeplayers. Were looking to put some balls out of the park. The focus will always be on a good start.         
	If Knight Riders bowling is weak         
	The general consensus around is our bowling is a bit weak. But batting is our main strength. The onus will be on the batsmen to deliver. The top-order needs to make runs and thereby give the bowlers a platform to perform.         
	Playing under Daniel Vettori         
	Hes been very good but its early days in his career. He has learnt a lot from Stephen Fleming. He taken over as captain only recently and led from the front in whatever matches he has played. He has it in him to be a good captain.         
	Shane Bonds switch to ICL         
	His unavailability is a huge loss to New Zealand. He was a magnificent bowler. The record speaks for him. New Zealand have done well whenever he has played. It is disappointing but theres nothing we can do about it.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Madhya Pradesh took a 68-run lead in their first innings and then reduced Bengal to 126 for four at the end of day three in their Ranji Trophy Plate division match at Gwalior on Wednesday.         
	Bengal now have a slender lead of 58 runs and with only a day left in the match, need a miracle to bring home any point. Ashok Dinda (who took three wickets on Wednesday) completed his five-wicket haul.

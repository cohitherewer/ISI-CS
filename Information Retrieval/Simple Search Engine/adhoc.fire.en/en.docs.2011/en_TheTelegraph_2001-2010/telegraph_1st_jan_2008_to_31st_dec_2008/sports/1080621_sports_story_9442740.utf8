	 BCCI keen on Test tourney  
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council has received a shot in its arm with regard to hosting a Test championship with the Indian cricket board showing keen interest in the concept. BCCI president Sharad Pawar said Test cricket was their first preference and they were willing to discuss the idea with the games governing body.   
	Meanwhile, Pawar, in a stern warning, said English counties  expected to participate in the Champions League  were free to include players connected with unofficial ICL in their teams but BCCI would have the last laugh when it comes to a final decision.         
	This is not within the BCCIs jurisdiction. They can do what they want. If any country takes any decision on this, they have every right to do so. But then, we also have the freedom to take our decision on the issue later, Pawar said.    
	ICC approval  
	Calcutta: The ICC has agreed to the England and Wales Cricket Board and New Zealand Crickets proposal of an amendment to the standard ICC one-day International playing regulations for the remainder of the NatWest Series currently being played in England.  
	The amendment mirrors the ECBs playing conditions for domestic one day matches in England and allows for the interval between innings to be reduced in weather interrupted matches, according to an ICC release.    
	Ricky unsure  
	 Melbourne: Kevin Pietersens innovative switch hit has found yet another admirer in Ricky Ponting but the Australian skipper has no plans of trying it himself or encourage his teammates to experiment with it as he is uncertain about the shots legality. Im not sure how theyre really going to govern that. Its obviously a great skill, if hes hitting a couple of sixes doing it. Once again, its just something that will be inside the bowlers mind all the time, Ponting was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.                 
	Oration  
	Calcutta: Australia cricket captain Ricky Ponting will become the first player from the present generation of cricketers to deliver an oration at the birth anniversary of Sir Donald Bradman on August 27. The special centenary dinner to be hosted in Sydney, will mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of worlds best-ever cricketer. Ponting said he was proud to be part of the event.    
	Price policy

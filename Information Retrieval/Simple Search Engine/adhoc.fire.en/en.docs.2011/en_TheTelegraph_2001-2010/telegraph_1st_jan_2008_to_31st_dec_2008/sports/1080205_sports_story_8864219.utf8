                                                      Saha, Bose wreck South

   
	Mumbai: Young Tripura spinner Tushar Saha and experienced Bengal medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose helped East Zone skittle out South Zone cheaply to take a handy 109-run first innings lead in their Duleep Trophy League tie Monday.
 
	The 22-year-old left-arm spinner grabbed four for 47, including the wicket of top-scorer Murali Vijay (46), while Bose grabbed two for 61 as South collapsed for 204 in reply to Easts 313 on Day II of the four-day match at the Wankhede.
 
	The duo were given good support by Debashish Mohanty, Shib Shankar Paul and Palash Jyoti Das, who took a wicket apiece, as South folded up just before stumps leaving East to play out one over in which they made five without loss in their second essay.
 
	South batsmen showed sheer lack of application in going about their task after their medium-pacer L.C. Aiyappa got rid off Easts last three batsmen with the second new ball to finish with five for 84.
 
	Overnight unbeaten batsman Haladhar Das fell short of a century by nine runs, caught at deep mid-off by Vinay Kumar, at 290 before the last wicket pair of Paul (17) and Bose (six not out) added 23 runs.
 
	South started their reply disastrously when they lost opener Swapnil Asnodkar for nought with six on the board in the third over.
 
	Vijays 130-ball knock, during which he struck eight fours, and his fourth wicket stand of 59 runs with Arjun Yadav (41, with four fours and a six), were the bright spots in an otherwise spineless display by the South batsmen.

	MCC seeks ban on use of illegal bats  
	London: The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), guardians of the laws of the game, plan to revise rules to make most bats currently used in the international game illegal.  
	The MCC are aiming to clarify the law banning all composite materials used in bats or handles.         
	John Stephenson, head of cricket for the club based at Lords, will present a paper to the MCC members on Wednesday after which a vote will be taken.         
	We are concerned at the moment about the balance of the game between bat and ball, Stephenson told a newspaper on Tuesday. While we do not want to discourage innovation, we want to ensure bat manufacturers make bats made of willow and bat handles of cane, rubber and glue.         
	Venkats role         
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to revamp the list of its elite panel of umpires and monitor their work closely during the next season to promote the cause of deserving candidatesin the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	This decision was taken, following a review of all the umpiring decisions taken during the last domestic season by director of umpires and former India captain S. Venkatraghavan at the umpires committee meeting held here on, the BCCI joint secretary M.P. Pandove said in a media release on Tuesday.         
	Venkatraghavan, has also been empowered to complete the process of redrawing the elite panel list of umpires.         
	IPL salary hike         
	Melbourne: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is all set to scrap the $5 million cap on the players salaries from next season onwards, a move that could see top cricketers earn as much as a whopping $15 million.         
	The IPL had put a cap of $5 million for the franchises this year to prevent the very rich team owners from splurging too much. But with the inaugural edition turning out to be a major success, the players are set to reap the rewards in the next season.         
	If we hadnt done that, I can tell you that our players would already be the highest-paid across any sport in the world, IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph.               
	Patel CEO         
	 Calcutta: Brijesh Patel will replace Charu Sharma as chief executive of the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League, says A Staff Reporter.         
	Charu Sharma has stepped down from the post due to personal reason and Brijesh Patel would now take over the reins. Patel would be in Calcutta tomorrow for the teams match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Thursday, a media statement said.         
	The move is interesting as Vijay Mallya, who owns the franchise, had opposed Patels candidates during the last KSCA elections.

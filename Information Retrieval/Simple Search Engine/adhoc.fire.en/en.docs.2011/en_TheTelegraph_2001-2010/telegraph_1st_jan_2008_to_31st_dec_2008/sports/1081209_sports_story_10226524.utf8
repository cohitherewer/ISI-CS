The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Broad hails England decision
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Broad hails England decision
                      
	London: Former Test cricketer and now International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Chris Broad Monday hailed Englands decision to tour India saying resuming the series was important for world cricket.         
	I think its a terrific decision for cricket in general, said Broad, whose son Stuart, is also a member of the squad.         
	The former England player said it was not an easy decision by the players but in the end, they did the right thing by agreeing to play the two-match Test series in India.         
	Obviously its a tough one for the England players to have made, and the Indian players, of course, because they are also under some kind of threat, but I think its a terrific decision, Broad told a radio station.         
	I think this tour is important for world cricket, he added.         
	The recent Mumbai terror attacks had cast a shadow over the Test tour with the England team, which had gone home after abandoning the last two ODIs, needing a lot of persuasion and security assurances before agreeing to return to India.           (PTI)

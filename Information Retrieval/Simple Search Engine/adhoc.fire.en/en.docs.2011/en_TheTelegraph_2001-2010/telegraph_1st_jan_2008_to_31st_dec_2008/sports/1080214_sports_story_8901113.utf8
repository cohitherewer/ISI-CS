The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adam: IPL is good for the game
                                                   Adam: IPL is good for the game
                      
	Adam Gilchrist believes international commitments will reign supreme and the IPL could become crickets equivalent of a gold watch that discouraged older players from playing on too long for their country. Gilchrist is set to become one of IPLs biggest stars when he bows out of the international game after this tri-series. He insisted money would not motivate the worlds leading players over Tests and other national duties. We see players at my age (36), there is going to be a natural transition from international cricket, he said.         
	Probably when the real professional era has kicked in there has been a bit of a tendency for guys to hang on too long, and we dont see younger guys getting in as young as we used to. It might be the evening out process that there is something for the older guys to move into, he was quoted as saying in The Age on Wednesday.         
	Players to boycott Pakistan         
	Cricket Australia (CA) would face a player revolt if it agreed to tour Pakistan next month. While the tour remains extremely doubtful because of increasing security concerns, most of Australias senior players have made it privately clear they would pull out of any visit to the strife-torn country should it proceed. The Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) and CA both reacted cautiously to the player boycott claim. We are aware of the significant concerns that the players have and they are concerns we share, CA public affairs manager Peter Young was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph.         
	Tit for tat         
	Pakistan may boycott their tour of Australia next year if Ricky Ponting and his men refuse to visit the Southeast Asian country. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf has sent an e-mail to his australian counterpart Creagh Connor, requesting him to send a security delegation after the general election.         
	It would be very damaging to Pakistan cricket and it is not just Pakistan-specific, because no country in the world is safe from terrorist acts, Ashraf was quoted as saying. And if Australia scrap the tour, Ashraf hinted Pakistan might come up with a tit-for-tat response and boycott their 2009 visit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ranadeb, Dinda were splendid, says Laxmi
            A CORRESPODENT            Shukla                           
	New Delhi: A grateful Bengal cricket captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla paid handsome tribute to former India skipper Sourav Ganguly for his huge contribution in the teams qualification for the Ranji Trophy quarter finals in what was his farewell first-class game at the Karnail Singh Stadium here on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the difference made by Sourav Ganguly         
	Of course, he made such a significant contribution even in his farewell game. We were down in the dumps on the opening day but he guided us through the storm. It is a mark of the man that he was there for us when the chips were down. He was the de facto captain in this game. Of course, he showed his humility and greatness in keeping me in the loop all the time.         
	On life in the Bengal dressing room without Sourav         
	He played just this match this season. We are on a good wicket now, with a lot of young talent coming through and playing well. It was Dadis last match for us. We are proud that he chose this platform to bid farewell to the first-class game. We needed him for this game and we know he could have chosen to stay away but we are happy that he played. Hats off to him. I cant think of too many cricketers who would do this.         
	On the disappointment of playing in Plate Division         
	We were runner-up the earlier season and did not play well last season to be relegated. I was captain when that happened. We had done well in the one-day championship. It is a great feeling to be able to lead the team back into the Elite Division.         
	On chinks in the Bengal armour         
	We need to concentrate on our batting as our bowlers have done a real good job so far. We have to work on our batting and are confident that we will be able to improve. Our spinners have faced some blame for not being among the wickets this season but that is because our pace bowlers Ashok Dinda and Ranadeb Bose have done some splendid work.         
	On whether the team is relieved or celebrating         
	Both. We shall concentrate on the quarter final from tomorrow but now we want to enjoy the moment, given that we have earned ourselves a promotion to the Elite Division. I dont want to be dishonest but yes we want to enjoy the moment.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Return of Sachin Tendulkar, four consecutive wins and finally a Sanath Jayasuriya explosion (which was waiting to happen) have definitely boosted Mumbai Indians confidence. But skipper Tendulkar on Thursday said they were concentrating on Fridays game (against Kolkata Knight Riders) and not thinking right now of a semi-final berth.         
	We are not looking very far ahead and concentrating on tomorrows (Fridays) game. That is how we have played the last five to six games Taking one step at a time, Tendulkar said during a news conference.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On having Jayasuriya, Indias nemesis, in the side         
	Its a big relief that Sanath is in our team. It was a treat to watch him on Wednesday. We all know how capable he is. He was not getting the momentum initially but he proved that hes a man for big occasions. The shots he played were very impressive.         
	The comeback         
	When you return from an injury, it has to be timed well. After a long time, I was out there in the middle and it was a terrific feeling. The Twenty20 debut was special. It was a good outing.         
	Mumbai Indians semi-final chances         
	Dont want to look that far. The idea is to go step by step and thats how we have played the last five six games. The focus will be on tomorrows match.         
	The previous Sachin-Sourav showdown was a Ranji Trophy final         
	It was a five-day match. This time it is a Twenty20 match. So it is going to move at a different pace. Sourav, being an experienced campaigner, is going to make it a close call. Both the teams are playing good cricket Spectators are in for a good match.         
	The Shoaib-Ishant pace attack         
	Both are quality bowlers. That doesnt mean that we dont have quality batsmen. To beat them we have to make one run or take one wicket more than them.         
	The Shoaib-Sachin battle         
	I never had these sort of battles between individuals in my career. Its always a battle between two teams of eleven players each  Its a much bigger battle.         
	Finally, if the players are scared after Jaipur blasts         
	Its not true After blasts, all of us are shocked and can feel the pain of those who have lost their loved ones.

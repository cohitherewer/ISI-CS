	Guwahati: Former zonal champions Bengal will open their campaign against hosts and zonal defending champions Assam in the Vijay Hazare Trophy East Zone national one-dayers at the N.F. Railway Stadium.         
	In absence of former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly and Manoj Tiwary, skipper Lakshmi Ratan Shukla will look forward to contributions from everyone in his squad mostly comprising youngsters. Altogether four youngsters will make debut in List A tournament Thursday.         
	While Sourav is out due to personal engagements and will join the squad here for the last two matches on March 3 and 5, Tiwary is currently doing national duty Down Under.         
	I will bank on everyone from No. 1 to 11. It looks like a sporting wicket where it is unlikely to be a high scoring affair. Besides, Assam are strong opponents especially at their home ground, said Shukla after a four-hour nets session Wednesday.         
	Having lost to Orissa in their first match on Tuesday, its a crucial match for Assam. Both Bengal and Assam have strong batting line-ups with regular batsmen up to No. 7 while the bowlers too chip in with good knocks. Arindam Das and Anustup Majumdar are likely to open the Bengal innings. Wicketekeeper Wriddhiman Saha, Debarata Das and Arindam Ghosh are the other useful batsmen.         
	While Bengal will enjoy a psychological edge over the hosts with internationals Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul using the new ball in tandem on a green-top wicket, Assam may bring in slight changes in the batting order to face the Bengal speedsters. Apart from the duo, Bengal have skipper Shukla and Avik Choudhury as medium-pacers.         
	Having celebrated his 29th birthday Wednesday, Bose was apparently struggling with a stiff shoulder at the nets. The team management hoped he would be fit before the match.

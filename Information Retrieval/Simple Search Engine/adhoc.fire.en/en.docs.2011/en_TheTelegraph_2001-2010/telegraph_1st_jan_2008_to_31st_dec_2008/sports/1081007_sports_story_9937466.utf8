The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand ready for battle of nerves
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anand ready for battle of nerves

	New Delhi: Viswanathan Anand says his upcoming World Championship match against Russias Vladimir Kramnik would be a battle of nerves because his opponent is as well prepared as he is for the showpiece event.         
	Anand, who has been giving undivided attention to his match preparation since April, will defend his title against Kramnik in Bonn from October 11.         
	Well, its a challenge you have to enjoy it and give it your best. I have prepared well. I guess there is no better way to answer this question, Anand said from Madrid.         
	I have done both, a physical regimen as well as extensive work. Since its a 12-game match, keeping the nerves till the end will be very important. Stamina and mental fitness will also be something I will be working on, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias hopes rest on spin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indias hopes rest on spin
  - FINAL TEST
  -   Ishant could be the lone pacer; Kumble uncertain         SUDIPTO CHOWDHURY            Virender Sehwag in Kanpur on Thursday                                 
	Kanpur: A cloud of uncertainty looms large over the availability of Test skipper Anil Kumble as Team India gear up for the third and final Test in the three-match Future Cup series against a confident South Africa here at the Green Park on Friday.         
	Though lanky Delhi fast bowler Ishant Sharma has proved his fitness and is almost a certainty, the think tank will decide on the fate of the 37-year old captain on Friday morning itself.         
	Sources revealed that if Kumble fails the fitness test, Ramesh Powar is almost certain to make the XI. The pitch (with the green shaved off and not watered for the last two days) is likely to help the spinners as the match progresses.         
	The hosts, in all probability, would go in with three spinners  Kumble/Powar, Harbhajan Singh and local lad Piyush Chawla  and one pacer in Ishant.         
	Allrounder Irfan Pathan, in that case, would have to sit out and former captain Sourav Ganguly would share the new ball with Ishant.         
	The possibility of Yuvraj Singh making a comeback is also high. More so, as coach Gary Kirsten is not keen on experimenting with the opening slot.         
	That means Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer will open the innings with former skippers Rahul Dravid and Sourav to follow.         
	V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be up next followed by the tailenders.         
	With the home side pinning their hopes on spin to level the series, the visitors will look to continue their fantastic run in the subcontinent.         
	Though the Team India Test captain claimed that the Ahmedabad debacle is history  goings-on during Indias practice session contradicted his words.         
	While a few senior batsmen chose to sit under the shade only after a short knocking at the nets, the bowlers settled for only a couple of overs before the practice session was called off on Thursday.         
	I think we are definitely more confident going into this Test. We are the team under less pressure, South Africa captain Graeme Smith said on Thursday.         
	Beating India in India is always a tough job Only two teams have beaten India in India in the last 20 years. We have waited the whole season to come here and beat Pakistan first and then Bangladesh Now we are well prepared to go into this Test and we will continue to play the same brand of cricket, he said.         
	Smith revealed that his team was expecting a spinning track but said it can backfire on the Indians since the low-bounce would make it easier for Dale Steyn to exploit.         
	The South African skipper declined to reveal his playing XI. Sources, however, revealed that Smith is not keen on breaking the winning combination.         
	In a later development, it was learnt that that left-arm spinner Robin Peterson may just get a look in as the second spinner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella slapped   three-spot penalty
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fisichella slapped   three-spot penalty
                            
	Istanbul: Force India received a jolt ahead of Sundays Turkish Grand Prix with Giancarlo Fisichella copping a three-place grid penalty for exiting the pits under a red light in the first practice session.         
	The infraction occurred at the very start of Fridays opening practice session. The stewards decision means three places will be added to whatever position Fisichella achieves in Saturdays qualifying session.         
	In the morning, Fisichella posted the 15th fastest time, just behind teammate Adrian Sutil. In the afternoon, Fisichella went one place better, while Sutil finished 20th.         
	Both drivers completed 23 laps but Fisichella was just seconds early in exiting the pit lane at the start of the session  crossing the line1 just a fraction before the red light  and was handed the three-place penalty.         
	The Italian, however, was still happy with the timing in the practice sessions.         
	This morning I was really struggling with the balance and with the grip on the circuit, but then we made a few changes on the car and it felt much better, much more consistent so I think it was a good afternoon, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Ferrari led both practice sessions and Heikki Kovalainen rebounded from a violent crash in Spain with the second fastest lap time of the morning session.         
	Two-time defending champion Felipe Massa led Ferrari in the first session with a time of 1:27.323 seconds  the fastest time of the day  before Kimi Raikkonen recovered from a gearbox problem that left him last in the morning session for an afternoons best time of 1:27.543.         
	Kovalainen, who finished fifth in the second session, trailed Massa by just over one-tenth of a second while McLaren teammate Lewis Hamilton was second fastest in the afternoon.

                  Shane Warne                     
	Melbourne: Shane Warne has lambasted temperamental allrounder Andrew Symonds for showing disrespect to the national team and urged him not to throw away his international career and return as a better person.         
	Warne was critical about Symonds gone fishing episode and said the volatile allrounder has let his team down by not attending the important team meeting in Darwin.         
	Symonds was sent packing from Darwin during the Bangladesh ODI series and was also dropped from the 15-member squad for India tour.         
	Warne said Symonds should have lent support to his one-time best friend Michael Clarke especially in the absence of senior members like Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden.         
	I would have thought that if Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke were good friends, then Symo would have more respect for Clarke than that, Warne was quoted as saying in a daily.         
	I think its disappointing that he put a young captain like Clarke in that position.         
	It was disappointing from Symo, especially with the Australian team not having senior players like Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden there.         
	Its not a one-off thing, and I just think Symo has showed lack of respect, Warne said.         
	Warne, who retired from international cricket two years back and is now the coach and captain of the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League, urged Symonds not to quit the game and to regain his lost respect.         
	I would be disappointed if he took the easy option and just threw it away, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City giants look to make amends
                                                                                                                                                                                                       City giants look to make amends
    - I-League 
  -  Sporting Clube de Goa stay on top of the table             A STAFF REPORTER            Sunil Chhetri (left) and Nirmal Chhetri during practice at the East Bengal ground on Saturday                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting are leaving no stones unturned to earn full points from their sixth round face-off in the ONGC I-League, which would take place on Sunday.         
	While Mohammedan Sporting looked a disciplined lot working hard on their strategies on the eve of the match, determination of an all-out performance oozed out of their opponents body language.         
	Although both the teams are far from what they had targeted, they are hoping to make amends and get back to winning ways.         
	The city rivals have met twice this season so far. On the first occasion, in the Calcutta Football League, the black-and-white brigade won 3-1. However, they lost 0-2 in the return leg. In the I-league, however, East Bengal have won all the seven matches against Mohammedan Sporting (including the preliminary round match in the inaugural National Football League in 1996-97).         
	Placed fifth in the table with two wins from five matches, East Bengal on Saturday appeared filled with hope.         
	The 1-1 draw with archrivals Mohun Bagan in their last match seemed to have worked as a morale booster. Stanley Rozarios men, who were down to 10 men in that derby, dominated Mohun Bagan all through and pulled out a dramatic equaliser to share points.         
	We would like to maintain the intensity that was there during the Mohun Bagan match, Rozario said after Saturdays practice session at club ground.         
	Mohammedan Sporting have a good team. Their foreigners are in good form. We need to be cautious, he added.         
	Rozario, who will stick to his striking force of Sunil Chhetri and Yusif Yakubu, is likely to miss custodian Subrata Paul, Mehtab Hossain (both down with fever) and M. Suresh (muscle pull). If Paul is not fit, Abhra Mondal will replace him, while Sanju Pradhan will step into the shoes of Mehtab Hossain. Rozario also does not have Alvito D Cunha at his disposal.         
	Comeback men  Rennedy Singh and Mehrajuddin Wadoo  would be his key players in the midfield along with Jayanta Sen. Syed Rahim Nabi, Saumik Dey, Suley Musah and Nirmal Chhetri would be patrolling East Bengals defence. Dharamjit Singh, after a long injury lay-off, is also unlikely to make the startling line-up.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, meanwhile, are once again banking on Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday, especially after Okoros heroic performance against Mahindra United.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali, aware of East Bengals unbeaten run in the I-League against his team, said that everything depends on the teams overall performance.         
	He (Okoro) is obviously a crucial player and with Sunday back, we will be a stronger side. But everyone has to play well if were to make a match of it, Shabbir said.         
	On paper, they (East Bengal) are the best side of the country. With players back from the national side, they are bound to improve as the league progresses So we need to be cautious, he elaborated.

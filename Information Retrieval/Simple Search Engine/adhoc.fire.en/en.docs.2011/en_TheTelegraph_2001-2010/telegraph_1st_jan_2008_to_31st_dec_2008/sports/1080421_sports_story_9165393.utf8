	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders owner, Shah Rukh Khan, spoke to The Telegraph soon after his teams five-wicket win over the rather highly rated Deccan Chargers of Hyderabad on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Thoughts on the Knight Riders second win in succession         
	Feels fantastic, yaar Its a great team made up of players from different parts of the world Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan This is their home now and theyve done every Calcuttan proud This isnt only Sourav Gangulys home, but Ricky Ponting and Brendon McCullum and Mohammed Hafeezs as well Of course, mine too.         
	On the importance of doing well at home         
	Yes, it was necessary to put up a good performance at the Eden Gardens (After a pause) John Buchanan is a spiritual kind of coach and the team follows his ideology which is to enjoy and have fun, but also put up a good performance on the field Therell be a knight every night in this team of Knight Riders Thats a promise It was McCullum in Bangalore on Friday and David Hussey tonight         
	The fans response         
	Awesome I was telling the IPL people that three matches elsewhere would equal one at the Eden Id like to assure everybody on behalf of my (on and off the field) team that well try and make sure that the ground gets better and better This was the first match here and while everybody gave it their best shot, well definitely try and make it better Id like the whole experience to be nicer.         
	Turning emotional and doing a lap of honour with friends from Bollywood         
	(Laughs) Thats because we were the winning team! Look, the players were tired and their job is to only play cricket Its our job to run, jog and dance Its something I decided on doing spontaneously Actually, my friends and I were to have performed on the stage, but we couldnt because of the screen I apologise for that Because everybody couldnt be seen, I decided against a stage performance Weve got to organise things better That lap of honour was done so that the fans could see all those (from the industry) whod come down to support the Knight Riders. Those who ran are fans too.         
	Whether his heart missed a beat or two when the Knight Riders lost three wickets early         
	I was just walking back from the stage area when those wickets fell The wickets stopped falling when I returned to my seat! Im the energy for this team Sixes, fours All that stuff, not wickets falling.         
	On the awful wicket         
	I dont know much about wickets, but the surface was the same for both teams Deccan Chargers are an awesome side and we did better than them. Thats the bottomline.         
	Having invited around 100 underprivileged kids from different schools to be special guests         
	The scheduling (of his meeting with them) wasnt right I want more and more kids to come and maybe one will meet them before the matches begin I wouldnt say any social work or charity is involved in this, its our duty. Thats the way I see it.         
	Finally, the Gandhi siblings presence in his camp         
	Rahul and Priyanka are personal friends and they came in that capacity.         
	Footnote: In a nice gesture, Shah Rukh took the initiative to meet the members of the losing team. He hugged them (in their dressing room and outside) and obliged by posing for photographs that are bound to remain very special.

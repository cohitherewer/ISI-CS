The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifth win on the trot for Punjab
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fifth win on the trot for Punjab
                      
	Bangalore: The Kings XI Punjab juggernaut continued to roll, crushing a hapless Bangalore Royal Challengers by six wickets for their fifth victory on the trot in the Indian Premier League here on Monday night.         
	After their bowlers had mowed down the hosts for 126 with four balls to spare, Preity Jintas team cruised to 127 for four in 18.2 overs to complete a facile win.         
	This was the fifth consecutive win for the Yuvraj Singh-led side, while Rahul Dravid and his men stuttered to their fifth defeat. During their chase, Kings XI Punjab did lose James Hopes (5) in the second over and captain Yuvraj (1) failed to click.         
	But Ramnaresh Sarwan chipped in with a 29-ball 31 to calm the nerves after Hopes early exit. Shaun Marsh (39) proved that he is not just an exciting talent but has a mature head over his shoulders.         
	The youngster, son of former Australia opener Geoff Marsh, kept going till Zaheer Khan rattled his timber in the 15th over. But it was too late and by then the writing was clearly on the wall.         
	Marshs 34-ball sedate knock included four hits to the fence and a six. Mahela Jayawardene (17 not out) and Irfan Pathan (17 not out) completed the formalities.         
	For the Royal Challengers, Zaheer Khan (2/29) and Praveen Kumar (2/22) shared four wickets each but that did not have any influence on the outcome of the match.         
	Nothing went right for Vijay Mallyas side right from the toss and put into bat, Rahul Dravid stood tall amid ruins with a gritty 66 as wickets tumbled around him.         
	Playing before the home crowd, the Bangalore side put up a pathetic show with just two batsmen  Dravid and Virat Kohli (34)  managing double-digit scores, while five of their compatriots had ducks against their names.

	Colombo: Riding a blistering century by skipper Mithali Raj and a five-wicket haul by off-spinner Seema Pujare, India Friday thumped Bangladesh by 182 runs in womens Asia Cup in Sri Lanka.         
	Mithali was mainly instrumental in resurrecting the Indian innings after her team was reduced to 48 for two and she carried on till the end to raise 250 for three after calling the coin correctly and electing to bat first.         
	Mithalis unbeaten 109 came from 92 balls which included 15 fours and one six.         
	Giving her support at the other end was opener Jaya Sharma (72 off 118 balls with eight fours) and the duo put on 110 runs for the third wicket in 20 overs to put their team back on track.         
	Later, Mithali and Purnima Rau (27 off 35 balls) added another 92 runs in little over 12 overs for their unbeaten fourth wicket partnership.         
	Chasing 251, debutante Bangladesh were bowled out for a paltry 68 in 30.2 overs with only Irin Sultana (19) and Shathira Jakir (12) managing to reach double figures.         
	Seema was the pick of India bowlers with five for 17 while ICC Women Player of the Year Jhulan Goswami claimed four for 18.         
	In another match, Dedunu Silva hit a cautious half-century to script an easy 96-run victory for Sri Lanka over Pakistan. (PTI)

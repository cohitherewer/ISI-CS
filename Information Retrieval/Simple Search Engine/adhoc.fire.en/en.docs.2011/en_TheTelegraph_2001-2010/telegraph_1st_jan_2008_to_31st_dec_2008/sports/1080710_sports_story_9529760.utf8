The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Acid test for England captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Acid test for England captain
                      
	London: England are set to find out just how good a Test side they are during their series with South Africa, according to captain Michael Vaughan, who announced an unchanged team here on Wednesday.         
	Vaughan, speaking at Lords, said South Africa would represent a huge step up in class from New zealand, who England beat 2-0 last month.         
	South africa are obviously a different proposition in terms of their bowling attack. They are a lot more pacey and come at you from different angles, Vaughan explained. They have had a wonderful year. They are a settled team with a good mix of experience and youth.         
	Dale steyn is No.2 in the world and will be a big threat. In terms of their batting, thats going to challenge all our bowlers. But we swing the ball and it should swing here over the next few days, Vaughan said.         
	England, late injuries permitting, are now set to field an unchanged side for a world record sixth successive occasion. Everyones fit, well be playing the same team at Trent Bridge (where England won by an innings and nine runs), Vaughan confirmed.         
	Since the Proteas re-admission into world cricket following their apartheid-enforced exile, Test series between England and South Africa have been tough affairs and Vaughan expects this one to be no different.         
	Theyve always been hard-fought contests. They are up there with the Ashes and over the next five weeks we will find out whether we have developed into a good Test team, said Vaughan.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Royals ride Watson knock
                      
	Jaipur: Shane Watson made full use of two dropped chances to score a blazing half-century which sealed a thrilling three-wicket win for Rajasthan Royals against Delhi DareDevils in their IPL Twenty20 match Sunday. Chasing 157, the hosts overcame early jolts to post a convincing victory with five balls to spare.               
	With this win, Rajasthan Royals went two points clear at the top of the table. They now have 14 points from nine matches.               
	The match, however, was marred by some controversial decisions but the one involving the third umpire over Shane Watsons run out really took the cake.         
	But the DareDevils also have themselves to blame as both Watson and Graeme Smith were dropped.         
	Watsons 74-run-knock came off just 40-balls with the help of five boundaries and five sixes. He was run out.           (AGENCIES)

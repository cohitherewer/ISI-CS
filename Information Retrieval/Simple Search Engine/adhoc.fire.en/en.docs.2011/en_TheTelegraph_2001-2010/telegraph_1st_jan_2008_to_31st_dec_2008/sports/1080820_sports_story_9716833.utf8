            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tuesdays crucial Sahara CFL Premier Division clash between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium was abandoned within half an hour because the pitch was rendered unplayable, affected by a downpour.         
	Expectations ran high before the start as both teams went in looking to pick up all three points. East Bengal looked the stronger of the two sides on paper, with national team members Subrata Paul, Syed Rahim Nabi, Rennedy Singh and Sunil Chhetri getting a start.         
	But the first chance of the match though fell to Mohammedan Sportings Satyajit Bose who dragged his shot wide from within the penalty box. The light drizzle that accompanied the start of the tie soon developed into a downpour.         
	The pitch began to deteriorate as players found it difficult to keep their footing.         
	Despite the conditions an energetic Mike Okoro dazzled at times, showing great control on a heavy pitch.         
	IFA officials have said that the league schedule is likely to undergo further changes after Tuesdays match between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting was abandoned.         
	The rematch will take place on August 25 at the Salt Lake Stadium, subsequently pushing back other matches.

                                      Pataudi vote for Twenty20 cricket  New Delhi: Purists may scoff at it but former India skipper Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi says Twenty20 has helped to re-invent cricket, which would become an extinct sport if it does not undergo such evolutions to keep pace with the changing times.

The source also said that the ACC also discussed the concept of having an Asian Twenty20 league but nothing was finalised.   Gough move  London: Former England pace bowler Darren Gough will retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season. Yorkshire captain Gough, 37, believes the time is right to bow out because he is finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the strain of four-day cricket. ldquo;I have always been confident that this would be my last season, rdquo; Gough said. ldquo;Although Yorkshire had.  Perfect 10  Dubai: Exhibiting an extraordinary performance, left-arm Nepalese seamer Mahaboob Alam claimed all 10 wickets against Mozambique in an ICC world cricket league division 5 match.

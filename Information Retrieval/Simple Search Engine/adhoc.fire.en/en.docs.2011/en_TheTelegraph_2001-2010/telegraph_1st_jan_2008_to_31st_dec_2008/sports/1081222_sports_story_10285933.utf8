The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were out of the Test: Pietersen
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Were out of the Test: Pietersen
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: England captain Kevin Pietersen on Sunday said he was surprised by Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision to call a pie-chucker like Yuvraj Singh to replace Zaheer Khan in bowling in the very third over the day.         
	Zaheer, who dismissed Andrew Strauss in the first over, was taken off by Dhoni and the Indian captain handed over the ball to Yuvraj Singh.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The situation of the match at the end of third day         
	Frustrating to lose wickets at the end of the day. To lose myself and Freddie (Flintoff) was very frustrating. My decision could have gone my way and with Freddie Well its amazing how the light changes in a couple of minutes.         
	On his dismissal         
	I didnt hit it Played down the line of leg-stump could have been given the benefit of the doubt. But I am afraid we are out of the Test, difficult to win the game. Now, we will be happy to get a draw out of the game.         
	On switch hit         
	I dont consider it a risky shot. When the leg side is packed by fielders, you need to take such shots to score. I consider it a scoring shot. That is how I did it in the one-day matches.         
	On Yuvraj bowling the third over         
	I was surprised. When the ball was swinging around, a guy like Zaheer Khan  one of the best bowlers I have ever faced  not bowling and a pie-chucker like Yuvraj bowling is something you dont mind. Zaheer is a fantastic bowler but suddenly you see some left-arm spinner, it makes you feel really good.

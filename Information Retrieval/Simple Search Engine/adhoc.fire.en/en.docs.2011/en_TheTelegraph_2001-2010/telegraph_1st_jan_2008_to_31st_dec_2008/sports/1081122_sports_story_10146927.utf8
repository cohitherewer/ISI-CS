                                                                                                                                                                                                     AIFF polls byend of December
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) will meet on Saturday for the first time since its all-powerful president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was admitted to hospital last month.         
	Das Munshi, who has been on life support since October 13, has been the AIFF president since December 1988. His absence has almost rendered the federation headless.         
	To add to their problems, the elections for the AIFF are due by the end of this year and the executive committee will have to decide on Saturday how to go about the modalities of the polls.         
	In the absence of Das Munshi, senior vice president and union cabinet minister Praful Patel is likely to take charge and will preside over the meeting to be held at the AIFF headquarters.         
	According to sources, the annual general meeting (AGM) and the elections for the new office bearers is set to be held in the last week of December.         
	There is a possibility that elections for all posts, except that of the president, will be held.         
	Under the present circumstances, we would certainly like to postpone the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the elections but it may not be possible constitutionally, said an AIFF member.         
	The AIFF constitution states: The annual general body meeting shall be convened within nine months following the end of the financial year of the AIFF. Given this directive, the AGM has to be called by this December 31.         
	While some of the members feel that the elections should be postponed, others are of the opinion that the elections for all posts, except that of the president, should be held as per schedule.         
	The terms of all the other members (vice presidents, executive committee members and treasurer) will come to an end by December 31, said another member.         
	So, we should hold elections for all other posts except that of the president.         
	The senior vice-president should be in charge till Das Munshi gets well.         
	Das Munshis absence has also caused problems for the staff members of the AIFF, some of whose contracts would be coming to an end on December 31.         
	The list of staffers includes the general secretary, Alberto Colaco, and the issue has been listed in the agenda for the meeting.

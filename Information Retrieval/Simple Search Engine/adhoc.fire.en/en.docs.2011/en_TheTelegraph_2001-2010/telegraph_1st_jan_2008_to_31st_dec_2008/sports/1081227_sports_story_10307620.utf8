The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary pushes TN on the backfoot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tiwary pushes TN on the backfoot
            JOSEPH HOOVER                      
	Bangalore: Manoj Tiwary showed why National Cricket Academy chief coach Dav Whatmore thinks he is a gem of Indian cricket, by scoring his third century of the season at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here Friday against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals.         
	He is an exceptional talent. He is an industrious batsman who can bowl good leg spin. He is a player whom the national selectors need to invest in, Whatmore had said recently.         
	Fridays knock would certainly have endeared Whatmore, who, however, was away with his family when Tiwary produced his best knock this season.         
	 He was absolutely at ease, batting with the certainty and flourish of a seasoned professional, making no bones about the slowness of the wicket and the nagging accuracy of the Tamil Nadu attack.         
	Unlike the tons against Tripura (109) and Assam (101) in the Plate Group, Fridays unconquered 134 came at a time when Bengal needed it most.         
	Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Bengal had lost two wickets for a paltry 45 before Tiwary found able allies in Wriddhiman Saha (53) and Dibyendu Chakrabarty (57) to carry his team to a healthy first day score of 292 for five.         
	While the openers, Arindam Das and Rohan Banerjee, had struggled to work the ball off the square, Tiwary smote the cherry with casual disdain to take the fight to the Tamil Nadu camp.         
	The 22-year-old swept with contempt and often waltzed down the aisle like a ballerina to drive and loft R. Ashwin, winning the mind game hands down against the offie.         
	The only mistake he made (when on 109, with the scoreboard reading 249/4) was when he checked a drive against the wily spinner. But as fortune favours the brave, Ashwin spilled a soft return catch.         
	Wriddhiman Saha and Dibyendu Chakrabarty also played handsome knocks, assisting Tiwary in knitting innings-building partnerships for the third (79) and fifth wickets (127).         
	Those associations frustrated Tamil Nadu skipper Dinesh Karthik, who made innumerable bowling changes.         
	In fact, Karthiks captaincy was as bizarre as the two dismissals, which checkmated Bengals progress.         
	Rohan perished to an unfortunate run out, backing up too far out of his crease to steal a single as Saha drove Laxmipathy Balaji.         
	The ball ricocheted off Balajis fingers onto the stumps.         
	At the stroke of tea, Laxmi Ratan Shukla fell to a sweep shot as the ball flew off Abhinav Mukunds boots to Karthik, giving Ashwin his first wicket of the match.         
	At that stage, Bengal were struggling at 131 for four but Tiwary and Chakraborty batted their side out of the woods, mixing caution with aggression to push back Tamil Nadu.         
	The stocky Chakraborty, who has been consistent in the last four innings, batted with gay abandon, sweeping and hitting the spinners over the top with panache.         
	He could well have continued his productive vigil with Tiwary but he too fell to the sweep, which had claimed Saha in the post-lunch session.         
	While Saha was deceived by a slower delivery by medium pacer Ganapathy, Chakraborty was gobbled up by a lunging C. Suresh at short square leg.         
	Although Tamil Nadu took the new ball in the 82nd over, Tiwary, who seems determined to better his best in first-class cricket (210 vs Mumbai), and Avik Chowdury batted without any problem, ensuring Bengal swell their first-innings total before having a go at the rival batsmen.

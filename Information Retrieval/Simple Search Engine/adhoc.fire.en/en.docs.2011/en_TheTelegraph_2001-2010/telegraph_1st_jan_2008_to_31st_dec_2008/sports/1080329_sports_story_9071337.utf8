	Gurgaon: Smriti Mehra signed off with an even par round to finish tied sixth, while Thai teen Phatlum Pornanong cantered to a wire-to-wire victory at the DLF Womens Indian Open on Friday.         
	Pornanong (212) curbed her aggressive instincts and her final even-par round of 72 was enough to steer four shots clear of Wei Yun Jye (71) of Chinese Taipei and Japanese Yuki Sakurai (72) who shared the second place at even-par 216.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh, who is yet to win a title at the Delhi Golf Club, promised to launch an all out offensive on the concluding day of the Indian Open on Sunday.         
	The conditions are excellent but there are tough flags in the back-nine but thats good, because there should be tough flags. I will stick to my mantra of process and routine, said the top Indian-pro at the end of the third day on Saturday.         
	I will be aggressive and go for it. If I get a good start, I can go for it. Anything is possible, said Jeev, who is currently placed joint fifth in the scoreboard.         
	Jeev said he was particularly encouraged by his own showings on the third day which elevated him to the fifth spot from a poor 17 th.         
	Compared to the second day, today (Saturday) was much better, except on the back-nine, Jeev pointed out. The putting was the main thing today (Saturday). My confidence was up and I was playing. The main idea is to put four good rounds together, he said.         
	On Sunday, the Indian star said, he has a good chance of making a comeback. I will be five behind. If I can shoot a five or seven-under, I would be right up there. I need a good start.         
	Ashok Kumar, who is also placed joint fifth, said he was approaching the final day with an open mind.         
	Its all about being mentally prepared for four days because you cannot predict anything at the Delhi Golf Club, Ashok commented.         
	Even if one has a huge lead at the course heading into the final day, he still needs to play a good round to win, Ashok added.

                                                   Woods claims title, Jeev tied 19th

           
	Dubai: Tiger Woods gave another remarkable display to win the Dubai Desert Classic title on Sunday, his seventh victory in eight tournament appearances. 
    
	The world No.1 started the day four shots adrift of leader Ernie Els but produced a trademark last-day charge as a seven-under-par 65 earned him a 14-under total of 274. 
    
	Jeev Milkha Singh shot a one-under 71 to finish tied 19th while Jyoti Randhawas two-under 70 earned him a share of the 30th position. Shiv Kapur turned in his worst card of the week, a 75, to tumble from overnight tied fifth to finish tied 25th with a total of four-under 285. 
    
	Jeev signed off a shot ahead of Kapur, while Randhawa ended with two-under 286. 
    
	Although he managed the best finish among the three, Jeevs round included two bogeys and a double, which took the sheen off his five birdies  four of which came on the front nine. 
    
	Randhawa, on the other hand, had hardly celebrated a birdie brace on the first two holes before he stumbled to a bogey hattrick from the fourth. He, however, sank a birdie on the ninth and continued the fine run on the back nine. His backward journey, which went bogey free, was studded with two birdies. 
    
	However, it was a nightmare for Kapur who had three birdies against four bogeys and a double bogey. 
    
	Woods, who romped to an eight-shot victory at the Buick Invitational in California last Sunday, celebrated like he had won a major championship after rolling in a long, snaking, 30-foot putt for a birdie at the last. His four at the water-guarded 18th meant the 13-time major champion finished the tournament with the best back nine of the week, a six-under 31. Woods reached the turn in 34 in sunny and breezy conditions at the Emirates Golf Club. A chip-in birdie from just off the 12th green then got his juices flowing and his haul of six birdies on the inward half set a clubhouse target no one could match. 
    
	German youngster Martin Kaymer, who won the Abu Dhabi Championship two weeks ago, was one stroke adrift in second place after a spectacular birdie-birdie-eagle finish gave him a 66. (AGENCIES)

                                                  Australia suffer as Sachin soars
  - Second Test Maestros unbeaten 154, Sourav-Harbhajans half-centuries help India post 532             Harbhajan Singh en route to his 63 in Sydney on Friday                           
	Sydney: Sachin Tendulkar (154 not out) broke his jinx of getting out in the 90s on Friday to help India gain a 69-run first innings lead over Australia in the second Test. The 34-year-old continued his special association with the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) as he not only notched up his 38th Test century, but also guided India to 532.         
	It was a moment of huge relief for Tendulkar as he reached the milestone after being dismissed in the 90s six times in ODIs and once in a Test in 2007.         
	Matthew Hayden (five) and Phil Jaques (eight) were at the crease with Australia reaching 13 for no loss at close on an eventful third day.         
	If the stylish V.V.S. Laxman had set the tempo with his breathtaking strokes on Day II, Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly (67) maintained the flow to thwart Australias push for a record-equalling 16th consecutive Test triumph.         
	Although Yuvraj Singh (12) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (two) failed with the bat, Harbhajan Singh (63) and Ishant Sharma (23) helped Tendulkar add some vital runs to take the Indian total beyond the 500-run mark.         
	It was an emotional moment for Tendulkar as he held his bat and helmet aloft in each hand and looked to the skies after completing his 38th ton, his third consecutive century at the SCG.         
	Tendulkar drove Stuart Clark for a couple in the afternoon session to raise his three-figure knock and in all, batted for 404 minutes, faced 243 balls and hit 14 fours and a six.         
	He shared two stands with Sourav and Harbhajan, the one with the latter being a record stand for the eighth wicket for India against Australia.         
	They put on 129 for the eighth wicket which overtook the 127 Syed Kirmani and Karsan Ghavri had added in Mumbai during the 1979-80 series.         
	No less important was a 110-run fourth wicket stand which Tendulkar managed with Sourav or the contributions he could eke out with R.P. Singh (13) and Ishant for the final two wickets.         
	As many as 187 runs were raised for the final three wickets by the visitors to leave the home attack completely flattened.         
	Sourav thumped Lee for two silken fours through the off-side and when spinners came on to attack, he went to top gear effortlessly.         
	He smashed left-arm spinner Brad Hogg over mid-on, treated Michael Clarke in similar manner and was generally harsh on the spinners.               
	At 345 for seven, India were in danger of conceding a 100-plus lead to Australia when Harbhajan, in the company of Tendulkar, came up with a thumping strokeplay.         
	The off-spinner, who was dropped by Adam Gilchrist off Clark, drove and cut powerfully to frustrate Australia. Harbhajan finally went down to Mitchell Johnson when he pushed at a leg-cutter and spooned a catch to the gully region. He hit eight fours and faced 92 balls.

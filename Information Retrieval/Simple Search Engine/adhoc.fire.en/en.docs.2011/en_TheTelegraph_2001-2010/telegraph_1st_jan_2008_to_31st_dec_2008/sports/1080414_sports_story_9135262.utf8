	Aussies may play ODIs in Pakistan   
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was in talks with Cricket Australia for a one-day series ahead of the Champions Trophy later this year by splitting the tour due by the Aussies after they postponed it last month.  
	Nothing is final as yet but we have discussed the possibility of splitting the tour because of the packed international schedule these days, a PCB official said on Sunday.         
	Australia had postponed their tour last month because of security concerns but have said they are keen to visit Pakistan at a later date.                 
	ICL India  in final
    
	Calcutta: Tejinder Pal Singh (52) steered ICL India to final of the ICL 20s World Series with a 32-run win over ICL Pakistani at the Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hyderabad on Sunday.   
	Singh was declared Man of Match, stated an ICL release.         
	Brief scores

	IPL forces postponement  
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been forced to postpone its national Twenty20 championship due to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting on April 18.  
	An official of the board said no dates had been set for the domestic Twenty20 event although the original plan was to hold it early in the year.         
	All the main players will be going for IPL after the Bangladesh series. And the sponsors dont want an event without the leading names, the official sais.

	Younis denial  
	Karachi: Younis Khans pullout midway from the ongoing ODI series against Bangladesh may have triggered speculation about his future but the senior Pakistani batsman said on Sunday that he has no intention of an early retirement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I-league ties likely in Navi Mumbai
                                                                                                                                                                                           I-league ties likely in Navi Mumbai
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, which recently hosted three Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches including the final, could be a venue for the I-League matches this season.         
	According to AIFF sources, the federation officials have already approached the stadium authority in Mumbai for staging football matches there.         
	The stadium authority are willing to rent out the ground for football matches but would not be able to give it for all the 33 I-League matches that will be played in Mumbai, said a source.         
	Mumbai has three teams this season  Mahindra United, Air India and newly promoted Mumbai FC.         
	According to sources, the AIFF observers, who inspected the Mohun Bagan ground a few days back, have submitted a not too favourable report on the Bagan ground and the Duler Stadium in Goa.         
	In case both the grounds are rejected by the AIFF on the basis of security, flood lights and lack of space for TV coverage, there is likely to be uproar over the choice of Cooperage , which too hardly adheres to the criteria set by the AIFF.

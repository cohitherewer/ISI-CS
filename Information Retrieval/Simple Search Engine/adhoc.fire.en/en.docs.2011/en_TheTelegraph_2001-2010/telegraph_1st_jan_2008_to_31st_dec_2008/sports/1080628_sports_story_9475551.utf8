                                                                                                                                                                                                       Injured Gul ruled out 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Umar Gul                           
	Karachi: Pakistans spearhead, Umar Gul, is out of the Asia Cup.         
	The injury-prone Gul, who went off during his very second over on Thursday, has been advised rest for two weeks. Apparently, he has bruised ribs.         
	Gul was willing to play in the Super Fours, but the selectors and the team management felt any aggravation would keep him out of the game for a long period, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	The team management has, through the Board, requested the tournaments technical committee for Abdur Rauf as Guls replacement.

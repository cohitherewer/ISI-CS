The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer to meet Nadal in final
                                                                                                                                                                                           Federer to meet Nadal in final
                      
	Hamburg: World No. 1 Roger Federer beat unseeded Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-1 in the Hamburg Masters on Saturday to clash in the final with Spains Rafael Nadal for the second year in a row.         
	Second seed Nadal won a splendid three-hour semi-final combat with Novak Djokovic, beating the fast-rising Serb 7-5,2-6,6-2. Djokovic has won the Australian Open and the two Masters Series already this year and would have taken over Nadals No.2 world ranking if he had beaten the French Open champion at the Hamburg Masters.         
	With the retractable roof at the Rothenbaum closed to keep out the rain, there was an extra buzz around the centre court and Nadal and Djokovic wowed the crowd with some breathtaking rallies.         
	The fist-pumping Mallorcan, seemingly able to chase down almost anything Djokovic threw at him, saved 15 of 19 break points against him and broke serve in the first and seventh games of the climacteric set.         
	He locked victory on his fifth match point when Djokovic netted an attempted drop shot at the end of an extraordinary final game lasting more than 15 minutes.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and partner Tommy Robredo went down fighting to second-seeded pair of Daniel Nestor and Nenand Zimonjic in their semi-final encounter.         
	After losing the first set, the Indo-Spanish combo put up a fight to capture the second but could not proceed with the momentum in the tie-breaker to eventually lose 3-6, 6-3, 2-10 against the Canada-Serbia duo.

                                                   Im sure the new year will bring a lot more positive thoughts, says Anil Kumble

	The following are excerpts from what Kumble had to say at the SCG on Tuesday afternoon: 
    
	On the wicket 
    
	It had been watered around five minutes before I saw it... It looks a good surface, but the wicket isnt something we want to worry about too much...We need to take the wicket and conditions out of the equation... 
    
	On the Team India XI 
    
	Weve got time to decide the XI... There are a few things in the mind, but I wouldnt like to share them now. 
    
	On whether Harbhajan Singh, who has a good record against Ricky Ponting, will be introduced as soon as he takes guard 
    
	It depends... Im aware of Harbhajans record... Pontings a key player and I realise its important to get such players out quickly... It could be through Harbhajan, could be through somebody else. 
    
	On whether Rahul Dravid will again open with Wasim Jaffer 
    
	(Smiles) Its 50-50! Ive had a chat with him and he just needs to relax a bit... Im sure hell be able to go out and bat the way he does. 
    
	On his expectations from Sachin Tendulkar 
    
	Whatever he did the last time (an unbeaten 241 in the first innings in 2003-04)... It will be great if he can match or better that. 
    
	On whether the batsmen have recovered from the twin failures at the MCG 
    
	They needed to relax... I thought all the batters had been uptight in the first Test... If the mind is thinking positively, then the running between wickets will also be better... Weve discussed, but not extensively, that they needed to play their natural game... You cant change much in a couple of days, but Im sure the new year will bring a lot more positive thoughts... 
    
	On the new years eve cruise 
    
	It was relaxing... The families were there... 
    
	On having done well at the SCG on the last tour 
    
	Weve almost always done well at the SCG and are looking forward to the contest. 
    
	On whether the past actually has a bearing 
    
	You can think about whatever youve done in the past, but its also important to focus on what can be achieved... Were disappointed with what happened at the MCG, but weve left that disappointment behind and are looking forward to new challenges. Everybodys keen to put up a good show. 
    
	On having to match Australias fierce intensity 
    
	Weve done it in the past... Having said that, we need to match the intensity weve ourselves achieved in the past and need to play our cricket... Need to prepare the way we can best... Weve travelled well in the last few years. 
    
	On having had a break for two days despite losing the first Test inside four 
    
	For some people it may seem that the more youre seen on the field (at nets), the better prepared you are... Some people feel you need a bit of a break... To relax and think about what went wrong... As someone who understands the game, I feel youve got to switch off and think of the positives achieved in the past... One hit at the nets will not make you a better player, nor will not having a practice session make you a bad player. 
    
	Finally, on whether hes now himself relaxed after the big defeat in the first Test 
    
	I am, yes... Im fine.

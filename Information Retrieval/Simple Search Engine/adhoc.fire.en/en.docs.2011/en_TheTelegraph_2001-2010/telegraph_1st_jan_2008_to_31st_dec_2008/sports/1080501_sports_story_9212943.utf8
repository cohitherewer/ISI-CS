The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Does not matter who we play: Alex
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Does not matter who we play: Alex
                  Alex Ferguson is all smiles after the victory over Barcelona on Tuesday                     
	Manchester: The Champions League winners will be from England.         
	After winning the two-leg semi-final against Barcelona 1-0 on aggregate on Tuesday, Manchester United will meet Chelsea or Liverpool in the final on May 21 in Moscow.         
	We are in the final. Thats the important thing and I think weve got a fantastic chance, it doesnt matter who we play. This club deserves to be in the final with its history. Its fantastic, United manager Alex Ferguson said.         
	Manchester United and Chelsea won their home games against each other in the English Premier League this season and drew 1-1 at Wembley in the Community Shield. United swept their two league matches against Liverpool.         
	Whoever is put in front of us were going to have to get past, United midfielder Michael Carrick said. Were happy with anything. Were there, and we can enjoy it now.         
	The final will be just the third involving clubs from the same nation in the 52-year history of the competition. Real Madrid defeated Valencia in 2000s all-Spanish match-up, and AC Milan beat Juventus in 2003s all-Italian final.         
	Ferguson, however, said he was delighted it had fallen to Paul Scholes to score the matchwinning goal on Tuesday.         
	Scholes missed Uniteds 1999 European Cup triumph through suspension, but Ferguson confirmed the long-serving midfielder would be the first name on his team sheet for the final in Moscow after he secured the win over Barcelona.         
	It was a fantastic goal. I dont think we can expect Paul Scholes to score 10-15 goals a season as he used to when he was younger but he certainly delivered one for us tonight, Ferguson told reporters.         
	It makes up for all the goals he cant score because of his age now. It was a marvellous moment for him.         
	He has come through the ranks here and is one of the great players this club has had.         
	Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said he had no plans to resign. Leaving has not entered my head. I have no intention of leaving, Rijkaard told reporters after the Catalans lost the semi-final, second leg 0-1. The first leg at the Nou Camp was goalless.         
	The club and the team needs help and support. Its a time when we need to pull together and stick together. It would be a different thing if the players were saying its time for me to go but thats not the case.

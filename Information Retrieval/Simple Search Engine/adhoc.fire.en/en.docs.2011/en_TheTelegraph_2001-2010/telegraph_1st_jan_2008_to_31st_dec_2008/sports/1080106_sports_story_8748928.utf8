The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla openers in record partnership
                                                Bangla openers in record partnership
                      
	Wellington: Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique both scored half-centuries in an unbroken 148-run partnership to launch a Bangladesh fightback in the first Test against New Zealand in Dunedin Saturday.         
	Iqbal followed up his 53 from the first innings with an unbeaten 72 to cap a highly successful Test debut and Siddique was 69 not out when stumps were drawn on the second day at University Oval. Iqbals score was the highest by a Bangladesh batsman against New Zealand, eclipsing Mohammed Ashrafuls 69.         
	The openers, who are among three new caps for the nations 50th Test, now own the record for the largest partnership by a Bangladeshi opening pair against all opponents, beating the previous record of 132.

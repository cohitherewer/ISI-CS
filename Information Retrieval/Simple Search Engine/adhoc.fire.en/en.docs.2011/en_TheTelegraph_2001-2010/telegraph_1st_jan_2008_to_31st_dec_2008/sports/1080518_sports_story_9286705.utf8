	Hamburg: Top-seeded Roger Federer thumped unseeded Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-1 in the semi-finals of the Hamburg Masters on Saturday.         
	The Swiss world No.1 was only once under tension on his serve and closed out the win in 79 minutes on the red clay court at the Rothenbaum.         
	Federer, a four-time winner in Hamburg, played some incredible shots on Saturday  a drop-shot return and a whipped crosscourt forehand winner on the run the pick of the shots bunch.         
	He said he was very happy to be back in the Hamburg final with the French Open starting at the end of this month, the only Grand Slam he has failed to win.         
	It was a long first set and maybe that wore him out a little bit and set it up for the second, the 26-year-old Federer said at a news conference.         
	Maybe I didnt serve my best today, but I was very solid and consistent from the baseline and played a very good match, the world No. 1 said.         
	Meanwhile, Leander Paes and his partner Tommy Robredo went down fighting to second-seeded pair of Daniel Nestor and Nenand Zimonjic in their semi-final encounter.         
	After losing the first set, the unseeded Indo-Spanish combo put up a vivacious fight to capture the second but could not proceed with the momentum in the tie-breaker to eventually lose 3-6, 6-3, 2-10 against the Canada-Serbia duo.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dravid: Its been a bit disappointing for me
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian batsman Rahul Dravid hinted on Sunday that Anil Kumble was all set to make a comeback and lead India in the third Test from Wednesday.         
	The senior pro also said that he was confident India would win at the Kotla to wrap up the series.         
	Kumble practised today. He bowled and even batted. The physio is positive about his fitness, Dravid said. He should be playing. I remember this is the venue where Kumble captured 10 wickets.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Can you please throw some light on Kumbles fitness?         
	A Kumble practised today. He bowled, fielded and even batted. The physio is positive about his fitness. We are optimistic about him playing here in the third Test.         
	Why was Zaheer Khan not there in the nets? Why did Harbhajan Singh leave after bowling only a couple of overs?         
	Zaheer just took a break and there is no particular reason for him not bowling in the nets. He is very much fit and fine. Tomorrow, he will bowl a long spell.         
	Same with Harbhajan, he had slight pain in the toe but nothing serious. Both of them will bowl longer tomorrow.         
	How confident are you feeling before the third Test?         
	Definitely, we outplayed them in all three departments  batting, bowling and fielding  in the last Test match and we are confident to continue the run. It is hurting the Australians. They have had a lot of success over a long period of time. They have not seen many failures and would be keen to come back. But rather than thinking about them, we will focus on our preparations. They would want to prove a point here but we are ready.         
	What actually were the main reasons for your victory in Mohali?         
	I will put that down to our bowling. Zaheer (Khan) and Ishant (Sharma) have bowled really well, all credit to them.         
	On Zaheer, I must say that people have been talking about his ability to do the reverse swing. But I think, he is hitting the right areas consistently. His rhythm is fantastic. Standing in the slips, I can see how good a rhythm Ishant and Zaheer have. Zak has put in a lot of hard work in his bowling and that is showing now.         
	Why are you struggling with the bat?         
	Yes, it has been little disappointing for me. I played on good wickets in Bangalore and Mohali but couldnt convert the good starts that I got. Generally when I am batting well, I know that runs will come and this is how I feel right now. I will just try and keep batting well, keep the routine and runs will come. My runs-per-ball average is pretty good this series. I think you have to be a little patient and I am ready to be patient.         
	What do you think about the Australian attack?         
	It was certainly better when we played them previously. It is not easy to replace McGrath, Gillespie, Warne or Kasprowicz. But still I wont say the attack is bad, it is just inexperience. But even experience doesnt count for much if you dont put the ball in the right areas.         
	How do you feel about this being Sourav Gangulys last Test in Kotla?         
	Yes, we know it, but at the moment we are not thinking about it. We are concentrating on the match and if we win, Sourav can go on a high. We will think about it in Nagpur.

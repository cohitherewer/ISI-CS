	 Germanys Sebastian Vettel, triumphant at the previous Italian GP in Monza for Toro Rosso, was the third first-time winner of the season after Polands Robert Kubica (BMW-Sauber) and Finlands Heikki Kovalainen (McLaren). All three were on the podium at Monza.         
	 Vettel, at 21, was the youngest driver to win a Formula One race. He was also the youngest to start on pole, having already been the youngest to score a point and to feature in a GP weekend.         
	 Of the 20 drivers on the starting grid in Singapore, 12 are now race winners. BMW-Saubers Nick Heidfeld (146 races) is the active driver who has done most starts without winning.         
	 Ferrari have won seven races to McLarens five this year. Since 1950, the Italian team have won 208 races. McLaren have 161 wins and Williams 113.         
	 Ferrari and BMW-Sauber are the only teams to have scored points in every race this year. Force Indias Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil are the only drivers yet to score a point in 2008 (not including Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson from now-defunct Super Aguri).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Look who is talking, says Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Look who is talking, says Sourav
    - The Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rajasthan Royals post-match bust up in Jaipur             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Jaipur: Rival skippers Sourav Ganguly and Shane Warne were fined 10 per cent of their match fee and reprimanded for their conduct a day after the two veteran cricketers engaged in a public spat following the IPL match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals.         
	The following are excerpts from what both the captains had to say to the media after the match in Jaipur on Thursday that led to both being reprimanded and disciplined by the IPL authorities.         
	Warne has accused you of going against the spirit of the game         
	Look who is talking. All you need is to have a look at his (Warne) career and find the incidents that he was involved with in all these years. He has no moral right to teach what the spirit of the game is. I just want to laugh at what Warne is saying. He should not be talking about the spirit of the game. I didnt know that in cricket taking a dropped catch was in the spirit of the game.         
	You forced the umpire to refer it to the third umpire         
	All I told him (the on-field umpire) that the catch was not taken cleanly. Referring to the third umpire was his decision.         
	You arriving late in both the innings         
	The umpires have not told me anything so I dont know what Warne is trying to say.               
	On what happened between you and Ganguly         
	I was very, very disappointed with Sourav today (Thursday). What he did after that catch was taken by (Graeme) Smith was against the spirit of the game. Smith is no small cricketer. He is the captain of an international side. When he said he took it cleanly, one should have taken his words in the spirit of the game. It was completely against the pledge that we took at Bangalore at the start of the tournament.         
	The player is not actually allowed to ask the third umpire. Sourav asked the Indian umpire to go to the third umpire. He has no right to go the umpire. But he did and almost forced him to refer the matter to the third umpire. He was also wasting time.         
	Our batsmen were waiting for five minutes under the heat to go out and the other team was nowhere to be seen. Then when we came on to bowl, we had to wait for Ganguly. Twenty20 innings has to be finished in one hour 20 minutes, but Sourav was hardly bothered. It was extremely disappointing.         
	I said whats going on and he (umpire) said, I dont know. Where were they? Sourav did not know what he was doing. He wanted extra time, you are only allowed 10 minutes. So I said to him at the start, mate it is not about you. Lets start on time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Monika fails dope test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Monika fails dope test
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Tuesday withdrew weightlifter Monika Devi from the Beijing bound Indian squad at the last moment.         
	While no official confirmation was available till late at night, IOA sources said that Monika Devi, Indias lone representative in the weightlifting competition of the Beijing Olympics, was withdrawn after she failed a pre-departure dope test.         
	The test, sources revealed, was conducted in Patiala last month but the result was only available on Wednesday. Monika, currently camping in Delhi, was preparing to leave for Beijing on Wednesday night.         
	When contacted, the IOA president Suresh Kalmadi neither confirmed nor denied the news. I too have heard about it. But I know nothing about it, he said.         
	Interestingly, no Weightlifting Federation of India (WFI) official was available for comment and their cell phones were switched off.         
	It may be recalled that Monika was selected for Beijing much against the wishes of the WFI, who initially picked up another dope-tainted lifter Shailaja Pujari for representing the country in the Olympics. This was despite the fact that Monika played a big role in India winning a quota for the Olympics during the Asian championships.         
	Monika returned to the Olympic side last month after the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, MS Gill publicly criticised the decision of the WFI.         
	The International Weightlifting Federation once banned the Indian Weightlifting Federation from participating in all international competitions for one year, after three Indian women weightlifters S Sunaina, Sanamacha Chanu and Pratima Kumari were accused of doping offences in various international competitions in a single year.

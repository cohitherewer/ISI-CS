                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leading is a challenge, says Sachin
                  Sachin                     
	New Delhi: Former India captain Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday said he was looking forward to the challenge of leading Mumbai Indians in the high-profile Indian Premier League (IPL) starting on Friday.         
	It is going to be a challenge. I was not expecting it (to lead the Mumbai side). Mukesh Ambani spoke to me and said he wanted me to be the captain. I have accepted it and I am looking forward to it, the maestro said.         
	Sachin refused to accept that his side is one of the weakest in the eight-team League.         
	I am happy with the team. It has a nice blend of seniors and juniors Its a terrific team. Who says we have a weak side? Let the tournament begin and everybody will know, he told a TV channel.         
	He was also excited about opening the innings with Sanath Jayasuriya and facing Shane Warne again.         
	Sanath is a terrific batsman. I am excited to go out and bat with him And itll be a good challenge with Warne. He is going to come back hard and we will be prepared, he said.         
	About the prospect of facing teammates Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and M.S. Dhoni, Sachin said it would be a new but exciting experience.         
	It will feel strange Playing against those who are next to me in the dressing room. It will be a new experience Exciting for players as well as spectators.         
	The maestro, however, has a race against time to be fit for the start of the high-profile League.         
	I am a little disappointed that I was not able to play in the two important matches against South Africa. I am yet to recover fully from the injury.         
	The physiotherapist and the doctor had earlier advised me rest and now they have given me the exercises and I am following their advice, he told another TV channel.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gaisy to debut for EB vs Mahindra
                                                     Gaisy to debut for EB vs Mahindra
  - Manju, Venkatesh to miss tie vs Dhaka Md. Sp.       A STAFF REPORTER             Edmilson will be East Bengals trump card against Mahindra United                                 
	Calcutta: Ghana striker Abeku Gaisy will debut in East Bengal colours in their IFA Shield opening match against Mahindra United at the Barasat stadium on Saturday.         
	Coach Aloke Mukherjee feels that Gaisy, who will pair up with Edmilson in the upfront, could be an answer to his teams problems in the attacking third.         
	Alokes first match in the East Bengal hot seat saw the team losing 0-1 to I-League champions Dempo in the Super Cup, a performance which was characterised by a series of missed chances by the red-and-golds forwards.         
	The Ghanaians inclusion will, thus, give Aloke more options with Syed Rahim Nabi, who played as a striker in the Super Cup, set to return to his wingers position.         
	East Bengal finished sixth on the I-League table, a place behind Mahindra United. However, the Mumbai outfit have a steep mountain to climb following their 0-2 loss to South Africas Santos FC.         
	Although we lost to Dempo in the Super Cup, we played well against them. If we could produce the same display tomorrow, theres no reason why we cannot put it across Mahindra, Aloke said.         
	Mohun Bagan, meanwhile, will take on Mohammedan Sporting at Salt Lake Stadium in a do-or-die floodlit encounter. Having lost 0-1 to Churchill Brothers, the green-and-maroons have to win to stay in contention for a last-four berth. Coach Carlos Roberto Pereira will have a tough job at hand in the sense that injured stopper N.S. Manju (ankle) and central mid-fielder Shanmugam Venkatesh (knee) will miss the match.         
	Mike Okoro (of Mohammedan Sporting) is a dangerous player. Weve not seen much of him but we have to be on our toes, Pereira said.         
	In another match at Howrah stadium, tournament-favourites Churchill Brothers will take on Dhakas Mohammedan Sporting. The Dhaka outfit played out a goalless draw with their Calcutta namesake on Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, miffed at the Armys decision of not letting the club host any match for the next one month, Mohun Bagan had requested the defence ministry to look into the matter.

	Calcutta: Opener Rohan Banerjee is tipped to make his Ranji Trophy debut on Sunday when Bengal take on Services in their second match in plate group B at home.         
	Rohan, who missed Bengals opening tie against Madhya Pradesh in Gwalior due to an injury, will replace out-of-form Arindam Ghosh.         
	The match in Gwalior ended in a draw with Madhya Pradesh bagging three points while Bengal had to be content with one.         
	He (Rohan) is in fine shape now and will play tomorrow, said a Bengal selector, who was present during the practice session at the Eden on Saturday. It was also learnt that the selectors want Bengal to play with three pacers against Services, who are at the bottom of the table with two losses.         
	Consultant Mohinder Amarnath, in a brief interaction with the media, said: We are not looking back Madhya Pradesh match is history and we want to look forward... We are confident that this will be a good match and we will definitely have a positive outcome.         
	Coach Utpal Chatterjee also sounded positive. Calling their opponents the weakest side, the former Bengal spinner said: They have lost both their matches. They seem to be the weakest side of the lot We have to cash in on this chance and use the home advantage to not just win but to grab a bonus point.         
	Meanwhile, Services captain Sumit Tomar feels that a cautious approach will help the side against Bengal. We need to be cautious One bad session in each of the last two matches has cost us. We have to keep that in mind and go session by session, Tomar said.

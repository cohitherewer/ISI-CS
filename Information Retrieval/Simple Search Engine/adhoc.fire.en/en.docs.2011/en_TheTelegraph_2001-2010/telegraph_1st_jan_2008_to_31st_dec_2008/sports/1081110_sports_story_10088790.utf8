The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus will be on the pacers, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Focus will be on the pacers, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni in action in Nagpur on Sunday                             
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni was a happy man after putting India in a strong position with a fighting half-century in the fourth and final Test against Australia. He was in a cheerful mood as he spoked to the media at the end of the fourth days play.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Indias tactics of drying up the runs for Australia         
	It is about winning the game. There have been strategies that are not liked by opposing captains and all those things. What we wanted to do is go out there and look to win games.         
	Did the Aussie batsmen fail to counter the Indians?         
	Of course, they could have done something different if we were bowling far from their off-stump. We did not see any attempt from them to do that. There was no shuffling or trying to hit the ball on the on side. There was no real effort from them. We may have bowled a bit wide but we forced a few edges. It was good for us. We could build more pressure on them with the spinners coming in and bowling in the rough.         
	The target the team had in mind         
	We were looking to set a target close to 360 in 90 overs 382 is a good target.         
	You were limping a bit while running between the wickets         
	Its okay. I got injured on the first day. And after batting and keeping wickets for one and a half days, it was a bit sore. It is okay, nothing really serious. Just that the workload was a bit too much.         
	Is the side trying to win the match         
	The important thing is not to think about the result. As a team, it does not make a big impact for us if we win 1-0 or 2-0. What we are looking to do is to go out there and win the series.         
	The talk during tea-break (the score being 166/6)         
	That was a tough situation for us. We had lost four, five wickets. It was not a scenario that you looked forward to. At the end of the day, we are quite happy with the amount of runs we have got. I think we achieved a good score.         
	On who will be the key bowler on the last day         
	All the bowlers will be important, not just Harbhajan Singh. I think the fast bowlers have done really well in the series. Once again I think the focus will be on them tomorrow. Overall, it will be important that all the four bowlers do well. I think we should include Viru in that and make it five bowlers.         
	Did the team benefit from Australias slow over-rate?         
	We were not in a good situation but we could see that they were supposed to bowl 25-28 overs in an hour and 15 minutes. You know that the part-time bowlers will bowl. We really took on the spinners to get some runs. That was our plan. And we were quite happy to get a few runs on the board in that particular time.         
	If he was happy with the way Harbhajan batted         
	It is good. Every run counts, especially in a scenario like this every run is important. Not just Harbhajans 50, but Zaheers six runs as well. I think it was a brave effort from Harbhajan and he has scored consistently against Australia.         
	If the team has thought of changing Dravids batting order         
	Not really... We were going along nicely after a good start. And there was no reason to send him down the order. Of course, there are tough times in everyones career. Hopefully it is just a phase and he is a great batsman and has proved himself time and again.         
	Would you say that India have outsmarted the Aussies in tactics?         
	I am only focused on what we need to do.         
	How do you expect the pitch to behave?         
	In India, the pitch can change quickly. Even today, we lost a few wickets in the afternoon. That can be in the minds of the batsmen when you are chasing four or 4.5 runs an over. The ball gets soft and there will be more wear and tear on the pitch. I think it is quite tough but not impossible. I think everything is possible in cricket. A lot depends on the kind of start we get tomorrow morning. Hopefully, it will be a nice game of cricket.

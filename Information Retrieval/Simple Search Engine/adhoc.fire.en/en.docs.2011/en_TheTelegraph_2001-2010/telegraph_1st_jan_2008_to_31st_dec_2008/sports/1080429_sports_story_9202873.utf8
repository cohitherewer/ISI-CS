The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Costliest slap in Indian cricket
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Costliest slap in Indian cricket
                      
	New Delhi: When Harbhajan Singh slapped Sreesanth after Fridays IPL match, he could hardly have imagined that he had just delivered what could arguably be the costliest slap in the history of Indian cricket.         
	Harbhajans violent outburst resulted in him being banned for the rest of the IPL, besides inviting a fine.         
	Harbhajan, who had been bought in the auction by Mukesh Ambanis Mumbai franchise for Rs 3.4 crore, will now get just Rs 48 lakh and will forfeit all his match fees from the third game onwards.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi on Monday said, a players fee is divided over 14 matches and Harbhajan will be paid for only the first two matches. (PTI)

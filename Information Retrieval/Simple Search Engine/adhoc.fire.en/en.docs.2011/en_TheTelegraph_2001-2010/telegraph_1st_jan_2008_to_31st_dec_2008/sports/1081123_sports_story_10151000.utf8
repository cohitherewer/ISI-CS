                                                                                                                                                                                           Australia sniff win
                      
	Simon Katich carried his bat through in Australias second innings at the Gabba to set the hosts on the path towards victory against New Zealand in the first Test.         
	The Black Caps, needing 327 to win the Test, were reduced to 143/6 at stumps on day three. The visitors need another 184 runs to win and their only glimmer of hope is Ross Taylor, batting on 67, according to cricinfo.         
	Katich remained unbeaten on 131 as Australia were all out for 268 in their second innings. Stuart Clark picked up three for 23 in New Zealands second innings.         
	Australia are coming off a Test series loss in India which has led to widespread criticism over their performance.

                                                   Jyoti soars, SSP slips
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: Jyoti Randhawa left behind the disappointment of Thursdays two-stroke penalty and placed himself in the title hunt at 11-under after an unfinished second round at Maybank Malaysian Open here Friday.         
	Compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh faces an uphill task to avoid missing the cut while Indian Masters winner S.S.P. Chowrasia is at tied 41st with a five under 139 on a day which saw a storm halting play for two hours.         
	Randhawa, who was penalised two strokes for taking a wrong drop, was 11-under aggregate after 16 holes when play was halted. He was staring at a 10-foot birdie putt at the 17th hole and, along with 48 other players, will return Saturday morning to complete his round.         
	Malaysias Danny Chia and Englishman Nick Dougherty are joint leaders at 12 under 132.         
	Chia carded six birdies against a lone bogey while overnight leader Nick Dougherty of England completed his round of 70 in near darkness at Kota Permai Golf and Country Club.         
	Randhawa, who carded five-under 67 in the first round, looked to seize the initiative as he made six birdies and ten pars. His birdies came on the first, fourth, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.         
	The Indian pro was delighted to stay in the title hunt for the third week in a row. Definitely, especially after what happened yesterday. I played well but got penalised for taking the wrong drop. I didnt know I had to take complete relief from the cart path. But I like where I am now, said the 2002 Asian Tour No. 1.         
	Arjun Atwal and Gaurav Ghei are placed tied 29th at six under 138. While Atwal carded 68, Ghei shot 71. In the first round Atwal and Ghei had carded 70 and 67 respectively.         
	Chowrasia (66, 73) is tied 41st at five under 139 while the projected cut at this moment is four under. Jeev Milkha (70, 71) is currently below the projected cut at three under 141, at tied 70th. Rahil Gangjee (70, 72) is tied 90th at two under 142. Shiv Kapur (74, 69) is a further stroke behind in tied 99th position.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beijing air turns fresh with six days to go
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Beijing air turns fresh with six days to go
                      
	Beijing: Chinas Olympic organisers are hoping to celebrate a week of clean skies on Sunday after recording another day when Beijings normally smog-plagued, poor air quality was officially judged good enough for the Games.         
	Bathed in blue skies and sunshine on Saturday, it was just the sort of weather the Chinese pray will grace their Olympics and banish athletes health fears six days before the big start.         
	Experts attributed a rare day of fine weather in the Chinese capital to overnight rain and  finally  the impact of strict anti-pollution measures such as ordering half the cars off the road and closing smoke-belching factories.         
	Pollution fears have dogged the build-up to Chinas biggest-ever international event. Authorities hope it will display Chinas economic progress and modern face to the world.         
	About half of Beijings 3.3 million cars are off the road, $18 billion has been spent on clean-up measures, and major manufacturers in and around the city have closed down.         
	The average air pollution index was Grade I, or good on Saturday, Chinas official Xinhua news agency said.         
	Many of the more than 10,000 athletes, however, were still delaying their arrival for the August 8-24 games until the last minute to avoid bad air.         
	Another cloud Chinese authorities appeared to be dispelling over the weekend was the international outrage over blocking access to some Internet sites for the visiting media.         
	Having said the Games should help promote rights and democracy in Communist-run China, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was embarrassed last week when arriving foreign journalists found themselves blocked from numerous sites.         
	But after talks with the local organising body, the Beijing Games Organising Committee (BOCOG), some of those sites  including Amnesty International and BBC China  were hastily opened.         
	Away from prying eyes, preparations were underway for the most expensive opening ceremony in Olympic history.         
	More than $100 million is believed to be earmarked for the opening and closing pageants  twice the amount spent on Athens in 2004.         
	Using a Chinese number symbolising prosperity, the Beijing Games will open at eight minutes past eight clock in the evening on the 8th day of the 8th month in 2008.         
	To the anger of Chinese authorities, a South Korean TV crew broadcast footage of a dress rehearsal last week, showing aerial artists floating over the track, Kung-fu formations and whales cavorting round the rim of the steel-latticed Birds Nest.         
	With the start of the Athens Olympics notoriously overshadowed by doping scandals, national federations were frantically testing athletes to avoid embarrassment in China.         
	Two Romanian athletes dropped from their Olympic team on suspicion of doping -- 1,500 metres runners Elena Antoci and Cristina Vasiloiu -- said on Saturday they were retiring.         
	American swimmer Jessica Hardy also withdrew from the Games after failing a dope test at trials last month, her lawyer said.         
	Going back two Olympics, the IOC said the U.S. 4x400m relay team that won gold at the Sydney Games in 2000 were stripped of medals after team member Antonio Pettigrew admitted to doping.         
	It was the sixth American medal from the Sydney Games lost to doping in the past eight months after U.S. sprinter Marion Jones was stripped of five medals following to a doping confession.

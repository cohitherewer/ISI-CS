	73-year-old Butt, who was officially announced as the Chairman of the Board today (Wednesday), said that he would make every effort to clear all the wrong deeds of the PCB.         
	My mandate is for three years and my job is to clean up things and ensure that cricketers who form the backbone of the Board are given more important roles in the set-up, Butt said.         
	An indication of how things will change in the PCB came when Butt arrived at the Gaddafi Stadium with Saleem Altaf, the former director special projects.         
	Also accompanying Butt was another former employee Asif Sohail, whose contract was not renewed by the PCB.         
	Butt said that the governing body of the Board has become active again and he intended to make changes in the governing body with the approval of the chief patron of the Board.

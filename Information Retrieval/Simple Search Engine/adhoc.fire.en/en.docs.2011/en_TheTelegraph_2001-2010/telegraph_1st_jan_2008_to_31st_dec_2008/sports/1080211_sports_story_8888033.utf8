	New Delhi: Indias top golfers believe that S.S.P. Chowrasias victory in the Indian Masters on Sunday is the best thing to have happened to the game in India in many years.         
	While Jeev Milkha Singh felt that more youngsters would now be attracted to the game, Jyoti Randhawa said it was time for the world sit up and take notice of Indian golf.         
	This is what some of the top pros had to say (alphabetically):         
	SHIV KAPUR: It is an incredible victory. I am even happier because I know him personally. I know how great a person he is. Humble, down to earth and great at heart. I think it is a victory for all of us who play golf in India. I wanted to call and congratulate him but I didnt because I knew he would be flooded with calls. Given his class and skill, this win didnt come as a surprise to me. Indian golfers are competent enough to take on the best in the world. Chowrasia proved it emphatically today.         
	JYOTI RANDHAWA: I cant still believe it. It is yet to sink in. I cant describe in words how happy I am. I knew he had the potential to beat the best in the world. Now he has proved it on home turf. The most important thing is that the number of high quality golfers is steadily increasing in our country. This shows that Indian golf is moving in the right direction. I am sure Chowrasias win will make every Indian feel proud. It is time for the rest of the world to take notice of this great achievement.         
	 JEEV MILKHA SINGH: It was a remarkable victory. I have known him for a long time. He is a wonderful guy, great at heart. I always believed in his abilities and today he proved it to me. Some people have been talking about a caddie reaching the top. To me, there is nothing called a caddie golfer or a gentleman golfer. They are all same. It is the competitive spirit that matters. I am sure that more and more youngsters will now be interested in taking up the game. Shiv has given Indian golf a great boost.

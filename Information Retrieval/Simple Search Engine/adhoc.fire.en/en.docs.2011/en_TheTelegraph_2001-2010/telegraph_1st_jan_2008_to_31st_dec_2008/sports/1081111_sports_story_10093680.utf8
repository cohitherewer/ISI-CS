                                                                                                                                                                                                     Diego felicitation at Salt Lake
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: The Salt Lake Stadium will be the venue for Diego Maradonas grand felicitation on December 6, when the legendary footballer and current Argentina coach arrives for a two-day visit here.         
	A fund-raising dinner and auction of memorabilia of the former Argentina captain will also be held on the same day.         
	Ex-wife Claudia will also accompany the maestro on his trip.         
	The recently appointed Argentina coach will lay the foundation stone of the Indian Football School at Maheshtala.         
	Maradona, who led Argentina to the World Cup victory in 1986, will also visit the Missionaries of Charity on December 7.         
	West Bengal sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, who was present during the official announcement of the footballers visit, said the state government would aid the project and not sponsor it. Chakraborty also ruled out the suggestion of felicitating Sourav Ganguly, who retired from international cricket on Monday, at the same function.         
	There is no relation between the two. Sourav is a cricketer, Maradona a footballer. So there is no question of Sourav being present, the sports minister quipped.         
	Asked if any felicitation programme was being planned for Ganguly, he replied in the negative.         
	Everyday, somebody retires. Do you expect us to felicitate all of them, Chakraborty said.

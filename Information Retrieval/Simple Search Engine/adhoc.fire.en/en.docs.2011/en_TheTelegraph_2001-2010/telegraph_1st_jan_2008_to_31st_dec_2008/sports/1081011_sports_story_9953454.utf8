                  Bangladesh players celebrate their win over New Zealand in Dhaka on Thursday                     
	Dhaka: Zunaed Siddique and Mashrafe Mortaza scripted Bangladeshs first-ever victory over New Zealand in one-day cricket with a comfortable seven-wicket win in the opening match here on Thursday.         
	Left-hander Siddique scored a brilliant 85 for his maiden half-century to anchor his teams successful chase of a 202-run target in 45.3 overs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium after paceman Mortaza took four for 44 to jolt the visitors.         
	Mohammad Ashraful notched a return-to-form 60 not out to guide Bangladesh to their first win over the Black Caps in 12 one-dayers, as the home team skipper and Siddique added 109 for the third wicket to upset their formidable opponents.         
	Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak (3/32) set up the sensational win by restricting New Zealand to 201 for nine in their alloted 50 overs, their lowest one-day International total against Bangladesh.

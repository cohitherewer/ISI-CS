	Margao: Odafa Okolie struck once in each half to end Sporting Clube de Goas winning streak as Churchill Brothers scored an emphatic 3-0 victory in their I-League match at Nehru Stadium on Sunday.         
	Besides Odafa, who scored in the 15th and 54th minutes, Thokchom Naoba Singh found the target in the 68th minute for Churchill.         
	Churchill now have seven points with two wins and one draw from three matches, while Sporting remained on nine points from four matches.         
	Churchill controlled the match throughout with the midfield striking a good rhythm along with their strikers and Odafa posed a threat whenever he had the ball and he put his team up in the 15th minute.

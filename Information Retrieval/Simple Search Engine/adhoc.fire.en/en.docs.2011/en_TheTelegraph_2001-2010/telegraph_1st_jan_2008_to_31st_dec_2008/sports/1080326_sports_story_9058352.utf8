The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to blood juniors for long season ahead

	Football administrators in India dont like being compared with their cricketing counterparts. They take it as a deliberate attempt to undermine them and show up the game in poor light.        
	Yet, as someone who has spent his life as a humble student of the beautiful game, I feel cricket officials are always better off in one respect. They know how to sustain and cash in on the success of the national team.         
	Here is an example: last September, the national football team received unprecedented publicity when they won the Nehru Cup in Delhi. It was an achievement as big as the cricket team winning the tri-series in Australia or a Test match in Perth.        
	But did the federation make an effort to maintain the tempo? No. Ask Bob Houghton. He never even got the opportunity to meet his winning combination for the next six months.        
	I know there is a vast difference between football and cricket calendars. Cricket these days is all about internationals, while in football domestic matches are of huge importance. Also, international matches cannot be fixed without Fifas approval.        
	But then, where there is a will there is a way. I wonder why the national team cant play tournaments and friendlies even when the I-League is in progress. I do understand that the federation has an obligation towards its local sponsors but priority should always be given to the interests of the national team.        
	Moreover, I like the idea of a full house watching an India-Bangladesh or India-Cambodia match rather than a Mohun Bagan versus Dempo match being played in front of empty stands.        
	Now that the national camp is beginning in Goa, Houghton, I am sure, should be very happy to get his wards together for the first time in six months. It is also an excellent idea to call up some youngsters first before the seasoned campaigners join the camp.        
	Since India have a long season ahead  starting with the SAFF Cup in June and followed by a preparatory tour of Portugal and the AFC Challenge Cup in Hyderabad  it is high time some juniors are inducted into the squad.        
	I may be misunderstood again but I am impressed by the manner in which the ODI side for Australia was selected recently.        
	The Indian team urgently needs substitutes at several positions. Although players like Bhaichung Bhutia, Mahesh Gawli, Deepak Mondal or Climax Lawrence are still good enough to carry the team, there is a need for back-up footballers who will be equal to the task in important matches. Houghtons biggest challenge now will be to prepare a new bunch of players for the future.        
	Fortunately, there are several who looked fresh and promising in the I-League. I was particularly impressed by goalkeeper Karanjit Singh (JCT), defenders Robert Lalthlamyana (Churchill Brothers), Nirmal Chetri (Air India) and Mohan Raj (Mohun Bagan) and striker Thoi Singh (Mahindra United). They have the potential to play for India.        
	Unlike some other coaches, I do agree with Houghton on one point. The national team needs players with better height and physique. Without that, it is impossible to succeed regularly in international competitions.        
	The team that won the gold medal in the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta is certainly the best ever in Indian football history. Take a close look at it and you will find that at least eight players in that XI, including yours truly, had the right height and physique required in international football. Technique is important but that alone cannot always win matches at that level.        
	When Rahim Sahib mooted this idea in the early sixties, not many were convinced. This time, I sincerely hope that Houghton succeeds in his mission to bring about a change in Indian football.

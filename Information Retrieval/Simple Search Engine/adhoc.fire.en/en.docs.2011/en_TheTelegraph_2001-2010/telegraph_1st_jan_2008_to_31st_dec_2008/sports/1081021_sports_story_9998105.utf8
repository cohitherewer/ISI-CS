The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS
                                                                                                                                                                                                     DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir put up their third 150-plus opening stand in Test cricket. The pair also bettered their own previous best stand at this ground, which was 113 vs Pakistan in 2004-05.         
	On 134, the Sehwag-Gambhir opening pair moved past the pair of Gaekwad and Gavaskar (1722) to No.2 in the list of most successful Indian openers. The duo now have 1771 runs in 17 Tests at the average of 65.59. Chetan Chauhan and Sunil Gavaskar with 3010 are by far still the best Indian opening pair.         
	On 165, the pair went past the highest first wicket stand for India at Mohali. The previous best was 164 by Aakash Chopra and Sehwag vs New Zealand in 2003-04.         
	For Sehwag, it was only the second time that he has been dismissed in the nineties. He was also dismissed on 90 vs Pakistan in Lahore in 2003-04.         
	Gautam Gambhir brought up his second Test hundred and first on home soil. His only other century (139) had come against Bangladesh in Chittagong 2004-05.         
	Gambhir also became the third Indian left-hander to score a hundred against Australia. Sourav Ganguly (144 in Brisbane, 2003-04 amp; 102 in the first innings of this Test) and Nari Contractor (108 in Bombay, 1959-60) are the others.         
	The target of 516 set by India is the biggest they have ever set for an opposition in a Test match. The previous biggest target India set for any opposition is 509, which they set for Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad in 2005-06. Sri Lanka made 249 and lost by 259 runs.         
	Harbhajan Singh has now dismissed Hayden eight times. That now makes him the bowler to have dismissed Hayden on most occasions.         
	COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to win something for Galaxy, says Becks
                                                  Want to win something for Galaxy, says Becks
                  David Beckham                     
	Carson (California): After an exasperating summer, David Beckham has one expectation for his first full season with the Los Angeles Galaxy.         
	To win something, he said as the Galaxy opened training for the Major League Soccer season Monday.         
	Los Angeles finished fifth in the six-team Western Conference last season and missed the playoffs after losing to Chicago on the last day of the season. We cant afford to be in the position we were in, where we ended up chasing it, Beckham said. Thats not good for the players or for a team. Weve got to get it right from the first game and carry on right through the season.         
	Beckham also experienced personal frustration. He arrived in Los Angeles in July with a sprained left ankle, then sprained his right knee about six weeks later.         
	He played in just eight MLS and tournament games, made four starts and finished with one goal and three assists.         
	Hopefully, Ill stay a lot more fit than I was last year, said Beckham, who trained with Arsenal in London last month. Im just looking forward to this season. Its a fresh start for us; its exciting.         
	The fresh start includes new coach Ruud Gullit, a former star player for AC Milan and the Dutch national team who coached in England and the Netherlands. He replaced Frank Yallop, who resigned to join the San Jose earthquakes.         
	Ruud brings an ability to deal with players in an equal way and get the most out of them, whether its a young draft pick or the most famous player in the world, Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas said.         
	Landon Donovan and Carlos Ruiz are not training with the Galaxy. Donovan is with the US national team, who play Mexico in Houston Wednesday. Ruiz is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. I feel Im 80 per cent fit, Ruiz said. I dont feel any pain, just a little swelling. The team doctor wants to check me this week and after he checks me, we can decide whether Im ready or not.         
	Los Angeles opened training camp without two of last years starters, goalkeeper Joe Cannon and defender Chris Albright, both of whom were traded. Lalas said the team is not finished dealing while trying to remain under the salary cap. Beckham, Donovan and Ruiz consume nearly half of the teams cap.         
	Therell probably be some other moves well have to make to become competitive, Lalas said. There are some difficult decisions still to be made.         
	The Galaxy signed former Newcastle United defender Celestine Babayaro, who trained Monday but will not play until he receives his work visa and his transfer papers clear.

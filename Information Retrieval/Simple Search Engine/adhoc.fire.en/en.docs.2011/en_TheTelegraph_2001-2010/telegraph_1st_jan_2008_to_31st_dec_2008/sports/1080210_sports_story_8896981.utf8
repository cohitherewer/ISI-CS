	 Karachi: CA dealt a severe blow to the chances of Ricky Ponting amp; Co. playing in Pakistan in March-April when it informed the PCB in writing that it had been advised by security experts not to play in the South Asian nation. CA chairman Creagh Connor has sent a letter in this effect to his PCB counterpart Nasim Ashraf.

	Mumbai: Steered by an allround show by skipper and pacer Jhulan Goswami, India A lifted the inaugural Womens Challenger Trophy defeating India C by three wickets in a closely fought encounter here on Tuesday. Bating first, India C were bundled out for 198 in the allotted 50 overs.    
	CA schedule   
	Sydney: Australia will host Bangladesh in three ODIs in the countrys Northern Territory later this year, it was announced on Tuesday. CA said the three ODIs would be played at Marrara Stadium in Darwin on August 31, September 3 and September 6.    
	Counties rsquo; fear  
	London: Chief executives of the 18 English Counties here believe that the cash-rich IPL will make it difficult for them to attract foreign players. The BCCI and ICC-backed IPL has enlisted several foreign players who currently play in different Counties, including Australian spin legend Shane Warne, who is seen as the biggest loss for County cricket.    
	Elliott quits  
	Sydney: Former Australia Test opener Matthew Elliott announced his retirement from first-class cricket on Tuesday, ending a 16-year professional career. The 36-year-old said he would consider playing in the rebel ICL.

	Gay party
    
	Calcutta: Hours after the five-wicket loss to India, some of Australias cricketers, including Brett Lee, Adam Gilchrist, Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds, let their hair down in a reunion party thrown by Shane Warne at a gay-friendly nightclub here, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.    
	Jones rsquo;s view  
	Calcutta: Former Australian cricketer Dean Jones feels retired players should take up umpiring to improve the standard.

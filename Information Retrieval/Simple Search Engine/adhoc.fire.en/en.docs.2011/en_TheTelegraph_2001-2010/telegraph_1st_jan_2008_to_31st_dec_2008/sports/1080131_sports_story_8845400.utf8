                                                    Additional security for Harbhajan Singh

         Harbhajan Singh 
          
	Melbourne: Harbhajan Singh has been provided with additional security with the authorities here fearing the Indian off-spinner could be subjected to taunts and insults by hostile Australian fans. 
    
	Harbhajan, who managed to shed the racism slur and get a three-Test ban lifted by appeals commissioner John Hansen on Tuesday, will now move with an extra security ring around him. It was learnt that four security personnel would be giving him protection. 
    
	The spinner, meanwhile, appeared upbeat on arrival here this afternoon. Relieved that he has been freed from the quot;racial quot; charge laid against him, Harbhajan said, quot;I am very happy, the right decision was made. I am glad its over. 
    
	Accused of racially abusing Andrew Symonds in the Sydney Test, Harbhajan was initially slapped a three-match ban by Match Referee Mike Procter, a decision upturned by appeals commissioner John Hansen. 
    
	However, Australian captain Ricky Ponting, it is learnt, was far from happy. 
    
	Ponting reportedly decided on his own to have the racial abuse charge against Harbhajan downgraded after a series of secret meetings with lawyers during the Test in Adelaide last week. 
    
	But he wasnt happy when Harbhajan escaped with just a 50 per cent fine of his match fee. 
    
	Ponting agreed to go with the deal effected between Cricket Australia (CA) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after he realised there was no actual evidence of Harbhajan having used the word quot;big monkey quot;. 
    
	It is learnt Symonds, after the judgement, said, quot;I cant believe this is happening. 
    
	 quot;Im telling you the truth. Thats what I always do. I know what I heard. You know I am a team player quot;. 
    
	CA had clearly told Ponting that justice Hansen wouldnt take Symonds words to make a decision or those of his teammates Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden. 
    
	New evidence from Channel Nines stump microphone also failed to pick up Harbhajans comment, only the one of Symonds quot;go and yell at your teammates... You called me a monkey again quot;. 
    
	Once Ponting agreed to lower his stance in Adelaide, Harbhajan was happy to plead guilty.

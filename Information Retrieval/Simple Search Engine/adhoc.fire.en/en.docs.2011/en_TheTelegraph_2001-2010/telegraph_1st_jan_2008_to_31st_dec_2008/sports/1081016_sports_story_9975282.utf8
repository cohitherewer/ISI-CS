The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Decision on Clark today
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Decision on Clark today
                      
	Mohali: Pacer Stuart Clarks elbow injury kept him out of Australias practice session on Wednesday and team physio Alex Kountouris will assess him on Thursday to find out if he could be fit in time for the second Test against India starting on Friday.         
	Clark was nursing his inflamed elbow joint when his pace colleagues Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and the rookie duo of Peter Siddle and Doug Bollinger sweated it out in the nets at the PCA Stadium ground.         
	In case Clark fails to recover in time, either Siddle or Bollinger is virtually assured of winning their first Test cap.         
	Asked about Clarks chances of playing the second Test, Lee said, Im not going to make any prediction, its best left to Alex Kountouris, our physio.         
	The thing is he was in little discomfort and didnt practice on Wednesday. But we are hoping him to get fit for the second Test.         
	A Cricket Australia spokesman said Clark would be assessed on Thursday.         
	Alex will keep working on Clark tomorrow and assess him, he added.         
	The injury restricted Clarks contribution in the Bangalore Test and he bowled just 17 overs in Indias first innings.         
	Though he bowled in the second essay as well, the discomfiture was all the more evident with Clark under-arming his throws from the boundary.         
	After Glenn McGraths retirement, Australia have relied on Lee, Clark and Johnson to deliver the goods. Clarks injury would be a setback for the visitors.

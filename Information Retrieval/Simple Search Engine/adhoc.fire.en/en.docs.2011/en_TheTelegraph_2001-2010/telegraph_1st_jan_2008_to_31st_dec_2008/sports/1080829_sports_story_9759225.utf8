	New York: Venus Williams kept favourites on the fast track at the US Open, overwhelming Rossana de Los Rios of Paraguay in less than an hour to reach the third round on Thursday.         
	The seventh-seeded Venus won on her fifth match point after 59 minutes. Thats mostly been the pattern so far at Flushing Meadows, with the big names facing little trouble.         
	The 28-year-old Venus, who won her fifth Wimbledon singles title in July, squandered four match points on her serve at 5-3 up before finally claiming victory on the fifth.         
	In the third round, Venus will meet Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine, the 27th seed who defeated Sabine Lisicki of Germany in three sets.         
	Through the early action on Day IV, only two top players had been upset  No. 8 Vera Zvonareva and No. 10 Anna Chakvetadze.         
	Plucky Russian Dinara Safina, the No.6 seed, Agnieszka Radwanska, Alize Cornet, Dominika Cibulkova and Nadia Petrova all won in straight sets, while Nicole Vaidisova  seeded No.20  lost to Severine Bremond 5-7, 3-6.         
	Among the men, No. 10 Stanislas Wawrinka swept past Wayne Odesnik of the US.         
	Safina overcame a couple of concentration lapses en route to her win. She established a 3-0 lead in the opening set and a 3-1 advantage in the second but each time seemed to lose her focus, allowing a scrambling Vinci to break back and threaten a fightback.         
	However, Safina averted the danger by outclassing Vinci with her powerful serves and searing groundstrokes.         
	The 22-year-old Safina has won 17 of her last 18 matches, losing only to Elena Dementieva for the Olympic gold medal.         
	Venus, after teaming with sister to win Olympic gold in doubles, stayed on course to play Serena in the quarter finals here.         
	Radwanska beat Mariana Duque Marino of Colombia 6-0, 7-6 (7-3) and fittingly won the final point at the net. Last year, the Polish teen made a splash at the US Open when she startled Maria Sharapova, often walking halfway to the service box and hopping before backing up to receive.         
	That breakthrough win over Sharapova came in the third round. This time, Radwanska will play Cibulkova in the third round.         
	Cornet rallied in the first-set tiebreaker to fashion a 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 win over Bethanie Mattek of the US. The 18-year-old Frenchwoman took advantage of Matteks four straight misses to close out the opening set.         
	Mattek is known for her outlandish outfits  she started out last years Open in a revealing, metallic gold Wonder Woman get-up and later wore a leopard-print ensemble.         
	Her attire for this match was downright conservative by her standards, featuring a white top that was wide open in the back and a black skirt.         
	Now ranked No. 44 after a successful season, Mattek lost in her first match-up with Cornet. The American came to the Open without a coach and sometimes uses YouTube to scout players shes never faced.         
	Cornet stayed aggressive, highlighted by a sequence in the first set when she hit so many overhead slams in succession, the linesman keep retreating to give Mattek more room to manoeuvre.         
	On Wednesday, second seed Jelena Jankovic and former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova had to work much harder than expected to shake off their opponents in the second round.         
	Jankovic squandered a match point in the second set before scraping past Swede Sofia Arvidsson 6-3, 6-7, 7-5 and Russian Kuznetsova overcame a slow start to beat Romanian teenager Sorana Cirstea 7-6, 6-1.         
	Olympic champion Elena Dementieva, however, had no complaints about not playing to her potential after completing a 6-2, 6-1 demolition of Pauline Parmentier of France.         
	Jankovic, who reached the last four at the U.S. Open in 2006, needed two hours and 45 minutes to subdue the 63rd-ranked Arvidsson on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.         
	The 23-year-old Serb twice served for the match in the second set and also led 3-0 in the tiebreak before the Swede pegged her back with a series of stinging ground strokes.         
	Kuznetsova, who clinched the 2004 title in an all-Russian final with Dementieva, trailed world number 53 Cirstea 4-2 in the opening set before raising the level of her own game.         
	Serbian third seed Novak Djokovic, beaten in last years final by Roger Federer, survived an injury scare before beating Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the mens event.         
	Fifth-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko made even smoother progress, charging into the second round with a comfortable 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Israels Dudi Sela.         
	In the final match of the night session, big-serving local favourite Andy Roddick, the 2003 champion, powered down 15 aces to ease past Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.         
	I was really excited about the way I was playing and glad with the way I served because I havent been serving that well, the eighth-seeded American said.         
	If I can do that, I like my chances of holding which puts pressure on the other guy.         
	In mixed doubles first round action, Leander Paes and Zimbabwean partner Cara Black defeated Melanie Oudin and Donald Young of the US 6-3, 6-2.         
	However, in mens doubles, Rohan Bopanna and his Pakistan partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi lost 5-7, 3-6 against Marc Gicquel and Sebastien Grosjean.

  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
  -   Record-Scripting coach on his most special Tests and ODIs         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            John Buchanan    
	Calcutta: Shane Warne may not think too highly of John Buchanan, but his is an absolutely lonely voice. Buchanans record as Australias coach (69 wins and 10 defeats in Tests; 160 wins and 46 defeats in ODIs), after all, will take a lot to beat.         
	Perhaps, it wont be bettered. For the record, he remains the only coach with two World Cups (2003, 2007) under his belt.         
	Buchanan, who will be coaching the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League, spoke to The Telegraph and listed his 5 most special Tests and ODIs during his tenure (October 1999-April 2007) as coach.         
	First, his 5 most special Tests (chronologically):         
	 Australia vs Pakistan in Brisbane (November 1999): That was my first Test as coach and in front of my home crowd, at The Gabba Will always remain very, very special Id wanted to play for Australia but that dream remained unfulfilled. Nevertheless, I made it to the dressing room as coach That was also Adam Gilchrists debut Test Off-hand, I cant recall too much though, its a bit of a blur What I can recall is that I had so many talented players at my disposal The Waugh Brothers, Warne, Glenn McGrath         
	Result: Australia, captained by Steve Waugh, won by 10 wickets.         
	 Australia vs Pakistan in Hobart (November 1999): It was quite an amazing Test, with Pakistan scoring almost 400 in the second innings and Justin Langer and Gilchrist putting on 238 (for the sixth-wicket) to take Australia to victory Thered been a time when Pakistan had the Test all wrapped up, but we won back control         
	Result: Australia, captained by Waugh, won by 4 wickets.         
	 Australia vs India in Calcutta (March 2001): Having taken a massive first innings lead, wed been in a position to win the Test That wouldve been our 17th on-the-trot We continued to play the way we believed we should be playing, but ended up being outplayed by Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman (who added 376 for the fifth-wicket in the second innings) We could still have saved that Test but, well, werent good enough. Full marks to India and it took us time to get over that defeat         
	Result: India, captained by Sourav Ganguly, won by 171 runs.         
	 Australia vs England in London, at The Oval (August 2001): That was the last Test of my first Ashes campaign and in England and we won Again, will always remain very, very special for the reasons Ive listed         
	Result: Australia, captained by Waugh, won by an innings and 25 runs.         
	 Australia vs England in Adelaide (December 2006): Another incredible Test and when the last day got under way, either team couldve won England looked to draw the Test, we chose to win it and we did         
	Result: Australia, captained by Ricky Ponting, won by 6 wickets.         
	Now, his 5 most special ODIs (chronologically):         
	 Australia vs India, the March 2003 World Cup final in Johannesburg: We came up with such a dominating performance, starting with the batting India won the toss and put us in which, I think, was a fair decision by Sourav as there was something on offer in the wicket Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden took the match away from India straightaway and, then, Ricky and Damien Martyn consolidated beautifully At the start of the tournament, wed expected India to make at least the semi-finals. They did one better         
	Result: Australia, captained by Ponting, won by 125 runs.         
	 Australia vs India in Calcutta, the TVS Cup final (November 2003): It remains very special because of the atmosphere at the Eden There were around 90,000 fans and it was a big moment for those who hadnt played there before Wed done well throughout that tournament, but some had still seen us as the underdogs that night         
	Result: Australia, captained by Ponting, won by 37 runs.         
	 Australia vs New Zealand in Wellington (December 2005): We made 322 for five, with Andrew Symonds getting an awesome 156 New Zealand almost got there  all out for 320 with one ball remaining I remember it was quite an emotional win         
	Result: Australia, captained by Ponting, won by 2 runs.         
	 Australia vs South Africa in Johannesburg (March 2006): Id been very keen that we be the first team to score 400 in an ODI and that got achieved In the midst of that euphoria, the South Africans, who didnt have anything to lose, did even better! So, for us, there was jubilation and despair all in one match. Imagine, scoring 434 (for four) and still losing Having become the first team to score over 400 actually became a distraction in the second half of that match. As for the buzz that night, it was unbelievable         
	Result: South Africa, captained by Graeme Smith, won by 1 wicket.         
	 Australia vs Sri Lanka, the April 2007 World Cup final in Bridgetown: It was the perfect finish to an incredible tournament, which wed dominated right through It was also my last match as coach At the start of that season, wed set ourselves a target of winning the Big Three  Champions Trophy (in India), the Ashes (at home) and the World Cup  and the hattrick was accomplished. It was, really, an incredible run over a period of six-seven months         
	Result: Australia, captained by Ponting, won by 53 runs (D/L Method).         
	Finally, his most abiding memory as Australias coach         
	(After a pause, with a hint of emotion): I had an incredible journey When I started off Id asked my players to look at climbing Everest Of course, then, I didnt know where the journey would take me and the team Id also used the word invincible Id been keen on raising the bar and its my good fortune that I got to work with such wonderful and gifted players A journey to cherish.

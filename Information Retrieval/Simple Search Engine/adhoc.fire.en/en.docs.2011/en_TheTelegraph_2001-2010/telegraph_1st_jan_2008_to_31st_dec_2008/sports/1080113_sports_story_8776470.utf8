      STAR RACER
                  
	Calcutta: All roads may not necessarily lead to the racecourse on Sunday  the Derby Day. Some of them may be diverted to the Brigade Parade Ground for a political rally. However, the expected action at the RCTC may draw sports lovers early in the afternoon to its grounds. A good day of racing is on the cards, particularly in the 2,400m Derby Stakes event which looks wide open with four of the seven in the line-up having a fair chance of landing the spoils. 
     
	The four in contention are Classic Sky, the only filly in the field, and three colts  Star Team, Steal The Glory and Regal Connection. If Classic Skys classic kitty is taken into the account, the Daniel David-trainee stands head and shoulders above the rest. The Placerville-Imperial Satsuma daughter is a winner of three Classics, including the Calcutta Oaks, the Ladies Derby. However, she beat none of consequence in any of the two Calcutta Classics.
     
	Steal The Glory, the stablemate of Classic Sky, does not boast of beating any higher-ranked opposition either while walking away with the two monsoon Classics, including the 2,000m Derby. 
     
	The Classic strength of Daniels third ward, Star Team, is equally poor because of his hard-earned victory in the Calcutta 2,000 Guineas over Regal Connection  trainer Vijay Singhs hope in the field. However, both horses had finished a length and half ahead of Steal The Glory in that race. The Derby arithmetic, however, does not always work that way but the fact is that Steal The Glory was a tiring horse against superior company and Star Team cashed in on Regal Connections in-experience, albeit narrowly. The close scrutiny of all, therefore, suggests that it is going to be a straight contest between Classic Sky and Regal Connection. In fact, it looks like a toss-up between the two but my money rides on the Vijay-trainee who may translate his brilliant track work into a victory. C. Alford partners the Mr Mellon colt.
     
	Yet, anything can happen in the Derby as its the 13th day of the month and the 13th race meeting of the season. But looking at it from a another angle, two negatives do make a positive.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

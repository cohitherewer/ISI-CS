      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
           
	Margao: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on Wednesday inaugurated the AIFF Training Centre that will henceforth house all the national teams during preparatory camps. 
    
	Situated just opposite the Nehru Stadium here, the huge and impressive building  that has reportedly cost the AIFF close to Rs 2 crore  has the capacity to accommodate 32 at a time. 
    
	Inaugurating the centre, the AIFF president said the federation has plans to build three more such centres in the near future. Ideally, there should be one centre every two years. 
    
	The next three centres could be in places like Guwahati, Calcutta and Chennai, Das Munshi said. I am going to Assam on January 22 and will hold talks with the state government to get land for this project. 
    
	The National Football Academy (NFA), which is still looking for a sponsor, will come up in Gurgaon. 
    
	AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, national coach Bob Houghton and captain Bhaichung Bhutia were present at Wednesdays function.

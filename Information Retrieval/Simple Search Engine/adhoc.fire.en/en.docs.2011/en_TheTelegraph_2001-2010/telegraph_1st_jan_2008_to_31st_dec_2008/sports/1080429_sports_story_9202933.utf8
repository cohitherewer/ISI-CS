                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangalore go down to Chennai by 13 runs 
                  Michael Hussey of Chennai Super Kings en route to his 47 against Bangalore Royal Challengers in Chennai on Monday                     
	Bangalore: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni joined Michael Hussey to exhibit some lusty hitting as their fourth-wicket stand of 95 took the Chennai Super Kings to 178 for five in 20 overs against Bangalore Royal Challengers in the IPL Twenty20 meet on Monday.                 
	A dramatic collapse in the 15th over saw Bangalore Royal Challengers lose by 13 runs. Chasing 179, Bangalore were going great guns before Palani Amarnath sent back Wasim Jaffer and Ross Taylor .               
	Electing to bat first, Dhoni (65) gave ample demonstration of his class superseding his Australian partner as the two consolidated the position after the Super Kings were struggling with 83 for three at one stage. Dhoni got his eye in before unleashing a fierce assault on the Royal Challengers in the later overs.         
	He plundered 45 runs off 16 deliveries at one stage disfiguring the bowlers analysis to a great extent before trying for another big hit only to be caught in the last over.         
	Dhonis contribution in the last 45 runs he added with Hussey (47) was 43 and his 65 came off 30 balls with 9 fours and three sixes. He had reached 50 in 24 balls.

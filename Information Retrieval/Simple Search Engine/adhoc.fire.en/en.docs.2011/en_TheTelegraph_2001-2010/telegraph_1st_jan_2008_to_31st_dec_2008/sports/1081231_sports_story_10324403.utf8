The five-day tie to decide the national cricket champions for the 2008-09 season would feature the winners of the two semi-finals to be held simultaneously from Sunday.  Thirty seven-time winners Mumbai, boosted by the inclusion of Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan, are to take on West Zone rivals Saurashtra in one of the two semi-finals at Chennai.  The other semi final would see Tamil Nadu fight it out with Uttar Pradesh at Nagpur.  Malik tenure  Karachi: Shoaib Malik rsquo;s two year tenure as Pakistan captain expires Wednesday, but in all probability the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is likely to retain the allrounder for another year.

Malik took up the top job from Inzamam-ul Haq after the 2007 World Cup.				   ER beat Tolly  Calcutta: Eastern Railway beat Tollygunge Agragami by eight wickets in a CAB league match on Tuesday.

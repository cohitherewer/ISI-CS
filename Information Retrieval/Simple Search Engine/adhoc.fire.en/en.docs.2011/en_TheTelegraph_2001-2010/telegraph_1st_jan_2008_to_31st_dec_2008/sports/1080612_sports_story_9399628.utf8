The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We cant take Bangla lightly, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                       We cant take Bangla lightly, says Kirsten

	Dhaka: Bangladesh may be woefully out of form, but India coach Gary Kirsten on Wednesday cautioned his team against taking the hosts lightly as even a hint of complacency on part of his wards would spell disaster for them in the final league match of the cricket tri-series here on Thursday.         
	Wed like to think that we are not (complacent). Were a professional outfit and our preparation for each game will be as diligent and efficient as the one before, Kirsten said.         
	They (Bangladesh) are a different set of players. We respect them and were not going to take anything for granted, he said. As per our policy we are looking to rotate players. Where ever we feel theres an opportunity to rotate, were going to look at it, he added.         
	When asked specifically on whether Robin Uthappa would be drafted into the playing XI, Kirsten said: Its difficult to single out individuals. We havent made a decision on who is going to be rotated.         
	The coach said Indians were lucky to have good bench strength, which has been consistently doing well in the absence of senior players. Were experimenting. Were going to rotate players so were experimenting with different combinations and options.         
	Its a luxury that India have at the moment with a lot of young players coming through. Were trying to find the best combination. Were certainly not going to look at keeping things the same for too long, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB yet to receive Asif documents
                                                                                                                                                                                             PCB yet to receive Asif documents
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mohammed Asif                           
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is awaiting Mohammed Asif-related documents from the authorities in Dubai.         
	The speedster, it may be recalled, had been detained in that Emirate for 19 days last month. That followed the presence of a banned substance in his wallet, when he was on the way back home after turning out for the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League.         
	Weve already instituted a fact-finding committee, but we havent yet received the relevant documents from Dubai... We still arent clear of all the details, the PCB chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf, told The Telegraph.         
	The three-member committee is headed by the PCBs chief executive, Shafqat Naghmi. The other members are Zakir Khan and Nadeem Akram.         
	Speaking on Sunday, Dr Ashraf added: A formal request has been made for the documents... As far as we are concerned, Asif is innocent till proven guilty...         
	The chairman clarified that Asif hadnt been deported. Technically, he was repatriated... The media got it wrong... Also, it needs to be noted that he didnt fail the drug tests in Dubai.         
	Dr Ashraf reiterated that the PCBs stand was one of zero tolerance on doping and indiscipline. There should be no confusion on that score, he signed off.

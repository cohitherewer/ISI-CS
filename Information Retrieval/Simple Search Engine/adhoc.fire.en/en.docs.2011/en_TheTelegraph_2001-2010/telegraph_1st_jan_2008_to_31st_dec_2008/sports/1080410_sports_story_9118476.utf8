The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anfield furnace singes Arsenal 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anfield furnace singes Arsenal 
            HENRY WINTER                      
	It is not how you start games, but how you finish them and Liverpool certainly finished in style on Tuesday night, sparking tumultuous scenes on the Kop. Arsenal began beautifully, handing Liverpool a lesson in possession, but there is such resilience to Rafa Benitezs team in Europe that they settled the tie with Steven Gerrards penalty with four minutes remaining. Ryan Babels fourth simply rubbed salt in Arsenals gaping wounds.         
	It had to be a penalty that defeated Arsenal. As they congregated at Anfield, the visiting fans had prayed the game would not go to penalties, because they would be denied all five by the referee.         
	Resentment lingered over the two spot-kick appeals turned down at the Emirates in the first two games of this epic trilogy, and they railed against the award of Liverpools penalty here.         
	Yet Kolo Toure was all over the back of Babel, who duly fell to earth, granting Gerrard his chance from 12 yards. So calm, Liverpools captain never looked like missing, and his emphatic conversion sent a roar of delight rolling around Anfield.         
	Familiar foe lie in wait in the semi-final, with another high-octane collision with Chelsea pending. Liverpool will not be short of confidence, not with Fernando Torres leading the line, not with Benitez seemingly an alchemist in Europe.         
	As the party intensifies in Liverpool, the wake will be long and bitter in north London. Questions will swirl around Arsene Wenger. His failure to strengthen a young side, to dip into a war-chest rumoured to contain 60 million, now looks an incredibly expensive mistake.         
	The great and the good had flocked to see this compelling entertainment. And no wonder. The touch-paper for a night of footballing fireworks was well and truly lit in the 13th minute when Alexander Hleb slid the ball down the inside-right channel to Abou Diaby.         
	Travelling at speed, Diaby controlled the ball effortlessly with his first touch before his second sent it flying between Pepe Reina and the Spaniards left-hand upright. Any criticism of the keeper for being beaten at his near post overlooks the velocity of Diabys strike.         
	If less elegant in construction, Liverpools equaliser on the half-hour was equally emphatic. When Gerrard bent over a corner from the right, Hyypia eluded Senderos by dropping his shoulder, sending his marker totally the wrong way. As the ball dropped, Hyypia rose determinedly to meet it, heading it firmly home.         
	As Liverpool fans in the directors box punched the air in delight, Sir Alex Ferguson busied himself scribbling notes in a pad, in preparation for Sundays engagement with Arsenal at Old Trafford.         
	Sitting next to the Manchester United manager was Fabio Capello, doubtless intrigued by the sight of Gerrard deployed on the left and Peter Crouch up front in a 4-4-2. Crouch fashioned a chance for himself as the second half unfolded, but Manuel Almunia was equal to his low shot.         
	The game still waited for the leading lights, for an Emmanuel Adebayor, Gerrard or Torres to impose their undoubted talent on proceedings. The game did not have to wait much longer. As the digital clock by the Kop showed 69 minutes, Torres swooped.         
	Again Senderos was at fault, failing to get tight to Torres as Crouch flicked on Reinas goal kick. Torres turned, drew back his deadly right foot and sent the ball racing past Almunia. As the ball climbed into the net, Arsenal hearts fell. As the Kop went wild in celebration, William Gallas grabbed the ball and sprinted towards the centre-spot, desperate to accelerate the re-start.         
	In amazing late scenes the newly-arrived Walcott pounced on an air-shot from Gerrard to race fully 80 yards, eluding Alonso, Javier Mascherano and Hyypia before squaring for Adebayor to give Arsenal a second away goal.         
	Liverpool had to score. Oblivion beckoned. But then came Gerrard, taking responsibility when Toure took out Babel. Calmness personified, Gerrard stroked the spot-kick past Almunia. Arsenals agony was compounded when Babel added a breakaway fourth in stoppage time.

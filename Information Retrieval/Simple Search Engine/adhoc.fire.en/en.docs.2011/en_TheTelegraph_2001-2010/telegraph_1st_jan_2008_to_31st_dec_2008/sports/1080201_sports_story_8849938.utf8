	Mumbai: Most of Mumbais regular racegoers do not think very highly of the 2008 Indian Derby  billed for Sunday  but trainer S. Padmanabhan (Paddy to his friends), does not agree. Its a star studded Derby, said the trainer.
     
	When have you seen the likes of Dettories, Kinanes and Hughes lined-up in an Indian Derby? he posed. Padmanabhan, whos horse Retribution scored a runaway victory in the Hyderabad Derby last Sunday, has a point. In his opinion, Derby favourite Bourbon King is not an ordinary horse. The unbeaten horse has been winning his races in a workmanlike fashion. King does not like to expend energy with runaway victories  producing as much as is needed to clinch the issue. In Paddys view, Calcutta challenger Regal Connection is improving with each run. And finally, the Hyderabad filly, Ruby Queen, also came in for a rave review by the trainer.
     
	There are 19 horses in the Derby line-up and as many as nine foreign riders are doing duty. While Frankie Dettori rides Retribution, Mick Kinane partners Hotstepper. Jockey Colm Donoghue will be associated with his regular ride, Bourbon King. Asked who would win the Derby, Padmanabhan said: Obviously Retribution. He is not only the best stayer, hes also the best performed horse in the field and he will be ridden by the best jockey in the world.

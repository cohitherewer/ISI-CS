	Kanpur: Former Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly was hit on the back of his helmet while he was fielding at forward short-leg in the 31st over on Day I.         
	Harbhajan Singh was bowling to Hashim Amla (18), who swept powerfully only to find Sourav on his way.         
	Trying to avoid the hit, Sourav turned away and got hit on the back of his helmet.         
	He was down on the ground was attended to by team physio John Gloster. The Prince of Calcutta had to leave the ground and was replaced by 12th man Mohammed Kaif.         
	Sourav, who later said he was absolutely fine, was off the ground for a couple of hours. I am fine and there are no problems Dont worry, he when asked about the hit.         
	Afterwards, Sourav, who returned to the ground also held the catch of AB de Villers off local talent Piyush Chawla and also had a couple of good saves.

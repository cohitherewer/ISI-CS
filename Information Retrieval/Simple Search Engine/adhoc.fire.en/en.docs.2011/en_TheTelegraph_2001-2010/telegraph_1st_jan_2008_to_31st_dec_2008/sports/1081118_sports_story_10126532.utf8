            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The worst seems to be over in respect to Pyrexia  a kind of equine virus as a result of which the body temperature shoots up  that had brought racing in the city to a standstill. The early part of the winter season has already been lost and the focus is now on the New Years Day races.          
	However, the RCTC stewards are keeping their fingers crossed. Addressing media-persons on Sunday, the RCTC chairman, Cyrus Madan said: The club has managed to tackle the very serious incidence of Pyrexia of unknown origin that struck many horses in the RCTC stables. The club has also decided that the cost of treatment rendered to all horses due to pyrexia will be borne by the club.          
	The Club may also pay towards the maintenance cost of the horses during this period as an advance money which will be recovered from the horseowners at a later date.           
	The chairman was, however, not in favour of pushing horses into racing. We have worked out certain plans. We are regularly monitoring the horses. No horse will be allowed to go out on the track, unless cleared by the veterinary team; said Madan. The respiratory tract of each horse will be scanned thoroughly. We have already acquired a scanner and are also updating other equipment; added Madan.          
	Madan, however, failed to give a definite date to the start of the season.          
	Races postponed: Mondays Hyderabad races were postponed to Thursday, owing to heavy rain. RCTC will conduct inter-venue betting on that day.

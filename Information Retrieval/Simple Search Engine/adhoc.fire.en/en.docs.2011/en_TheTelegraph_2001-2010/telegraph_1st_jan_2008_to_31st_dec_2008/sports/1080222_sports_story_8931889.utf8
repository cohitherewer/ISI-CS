The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI clout worries Border
                                                   BCCI clout worries Border
                      
	Melbourne: The Indian Boards financial might is a worry for Australias World Cup winning captain Allan Border who believes they have just too much say in everything. Erapalli Prasanna lashed out at the high-profile auction which, according to him, has left players being mere commodities with a monetary tag attached to their names.         
	The following are the reactions:         
	BORDER: The BCCI has probably had too much to say in matters even though they do have a fair say financially in the global game. Even the ICL wasnt good for the game globally. Hopefully common sense will prevail and the individuals concerned want to play for their country rather than just for money.         
	PRASANNA: Cricket is not going to change, but the unfortunate side is that cricketers have become commodities ... Just commodities. If I look at you like some sort of vegetable, is it good for you? You should be looked at for your quality, as a cricketer... A talented cricketer. It will hamper the domestic circuit because after 40 days (of IPL) who is going to play domestic cricket.         
	JONTY RHODES: No, I wouldnt pay $900,000 for Jacques Kallis  Id pay $1 million for him. Cricketers are probably among the most underpaid of professional sportsmen, especially when you consider what tennis players and golfers earn. When you consider the size of the Indian cricket market, a million dollars is a drop in the ocean.

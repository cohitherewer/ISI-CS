                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ghei gears up for tough defence 
                      
	Beijing: Defending champion Gaurav Ghei hopes to battle his way through a strong Japanese field to defend his title at the Pine Valley Beijing Open which tees off on Thursday.         
	Its great to be back here. Returning to an event which I have won before is always special, said Ghei.         
	The top Asian Tour stars who will be seen in action at the event tri-sanctioned by the Japan Golf Tour, the Asian Tour and China Golf Association  include Korean youngster Noh Seung-yul, who finished runner-up at the Maekyung Open last week, former Asia No. 1s Thongchai Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant, fScott Hend and local favourite Zhang Lian-Wei.         
	The Japanese contingent will feature their winning stars  Tetsuji Hiratsuka, Katsumasa Miyamoto, Hiroyuki Fujita and Sushi Ishigaki.         
	Defending a title is very tough but no one can take away the fact that I was the first-ever winner of this event last year. There is a strong Japanese field here and that would make it a real challenge out there so well see what happens, said Ghei, who won the 2006 Mercuries Taiwan Masters that ended his 11-year drought on the Asian Tour.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has gained three more places in the Reliance Mobile ICC Players Rankings for Test batsmen and now sits second after top-ranked Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara.         
	Chanderpaul, who scored 442 runs at an average of 147.33, in six innings including two centuries and three fifties in the series against Australia, moved ahead of Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey. He is just three ratings points behind Sangakkara, who moved top due to Husseys indifferent form of late.         
	The group is very tightly bunched with just 16 ratings points separating Sangakkara from South Africas Jacques Kallis in sixth spot.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan is still heading the Test bowlers.         
	West Indies allrounder Dwayne Bravo has moved up to two places and broke into the top five in the rankings for Test allrounders.

                                                   We werent competitive enough: Mahela 

      A CORRESPONDENT 
           
	Hobart: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene told reporters in a post match news conference that his team was not competitive enough and didnt deserve to be in the tri-series finals after losing to India by seven wickets in a must-win match on Tuesday. 
        
	The following are excerpts 
    
	The teams performance 
    
	We dont deserve to be in the finals because we havent been consistent in this tournament. Our bowling has been pretty decent but the concern has been our batting. It is not just technical It has also something to do with confidence. The batsmen are not spending time in the middle, they are getting out before they are getting in. 
    
	Getting out for 179 on a good batting surface 
    
	We knew it would be tough in the morning. We got a very good start, but another collapse in the middle pegged us back and it was difficult to recover. We were not competitive enough We needed 260 or 270 to make a match of it. 
    
	No success since making the World Cup final 
    
	The standards have come down. We have done well in Test matches but have not been consistent in the shorter version of the game. We need to find the right formula to start winning again. 
    
	On-field exchanges 
    
	That is part of the game as long as you dont cross lines. It is up to the individuals to realise that they dont go above the law and be stupid. 
    
	Thoughts on the finals between Australia and India 
    
	It should be interesting. The first game will be very important. These two teams have been going at each other for quite some time now, almost two months. Australia have not played to their standards and they still keep winning, while India have shown form in the later part of the league phase. Whoever gets the first game will have the edge in the best of three finals.

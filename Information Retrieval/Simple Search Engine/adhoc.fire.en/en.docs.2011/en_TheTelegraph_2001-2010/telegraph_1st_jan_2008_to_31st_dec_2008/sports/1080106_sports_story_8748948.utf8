                                                  Bhowmick set to be Salgaocar TD
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Subhas Bhowmick                           
	New Delhi: Subhas Bhowmick, who twice guided East Bengal to the National Football League summit, is set to join Salgaocar Sports Club as their technical director (TD).         
	Former champions Salgaocar, with just four points in their kitty, finished the first leg at the bottom of the 10-team standings. They knocked on Bhowmicks doors with a request to haul the team out of relegation zone.         
	Salgaocar secretary Raj Gomes confirmed on Saturday that Bhowmick will join as the technical director. Savio Medeira will remain the chief coach, while Mathew DCosta will continue to assist him.         
	Bhowmick, however, said he would finalise the deal only after talking to the Salgaocar players and the team management.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Saturday, the Calcutta-based coach said: Shivanand Salgaocar spoke to me on Friday. But I havent yet given my consent.         
	Bhowmick said he would be going to Goa on Sunday. On Monday Ill watch Salgaocars practice session and the day after, their match against East Bengal in Margao before taking a decision.         
	Medeira, an AFC Professional License holder, has quite a few admirers in the fraternity, including Bhowmick.         
	I have always maintained that Savio and Sukhwinder Singh are two of the best coaches in the country, Bhowmick said. Itll be embarrassing to replace one of them. I suggested appointing me as technical director and keeping Savio in his position.         
	National coach Bob Houghton also has high regard for Medeira. It shouldnt come as a surprised if the genial Goan joins the national team staff once Houghton starts preparations for the SAFF Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup.

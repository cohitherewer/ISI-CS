                                                   Goa academy runs into rough weather
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federations ambitious project of setting up a National Football Academy in Goa has run into trouble, a mere five days after being given the approval by the state government.         
	The Rs 100-crore project has run into rough weather mainly because of resistance from the local people.         
	So much so, that the AIFF on Tuesday put the project on hold and has now decided to resume it only after they manage to pacify the agitating residents of Cuncolim. There is a little hiccup, said the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. Once we manage to convince the local people, the project will start in full swing.         
	On March 6, the cabinet in Goa decided to allot the land, measuring approximately 1,26,000 square metres in Cuncolim, which is around 20km from the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	The proposed state of the art academy will be financed fully by Bharti Enterprises, who has a deal with the AIFF to this effect.         
	The cabinet decision also revealed that the AIFF has asked for the transfer of the land from State Urban Development Agency (SUDA) on a long lease basis for 99 years.         
	The rent is to be fixed by the SUDA board in consultation with revenue authorities.         
	According to AIFF sources, a large number of people in the area opposed the move by the state government as they felt there was no need for such an academy in the first place.         
	While some sought to know whether the entire land should be used for the academy only, a few felt the Goa government was in undue haste to clear the allotment of land. They also demanded 25 per cent job reservation for the locals in the academy.         
	The land has been cleared by the Goa government on the insistence of state urban development minister and Cuncolim MLA, Mr Joaquim Alemao.         
	A younger brother of Churchill Brothers supremo Churchill Alemao, Joaquim is the president of the Goa Football Associ- ation (GFA) and a close friend of Colaco.         
	Sensing trouble, Joaquim Alemao on Monday called a public meeting in Cuncolim, which was also attended by Colaco and Bharti representatives.         
	While Colaco explained the need for setting up the academy, it was decided that AIFF and its sponsors would come back with a detailed and modified blueprint of the project to seek the approval of the residents.

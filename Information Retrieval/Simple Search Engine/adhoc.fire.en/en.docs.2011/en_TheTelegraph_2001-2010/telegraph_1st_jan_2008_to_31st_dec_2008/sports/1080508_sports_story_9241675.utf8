	Mumbai: Resurgent Mumbai Indians excelled with a superb allround display to stun leaders Rajasthan Royals and recorded a comprehensive seven-wicket victory, their third successive after four straight losses in the IPL .         
	Helped by some pathetic batting display by the visiting team, who went into their seventh tie with five successive wins behind them, the hosts bowled purposefully and fielded brilliantly to skittle out Rajasthan Royals for a meagre 103 in 16.2 overs.         
	Mumbai Indians romped home in 15.1 overs .           (PTI)

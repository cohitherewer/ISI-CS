The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger, Rafa locked in gripping epic
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Roger, Rafa locked in gripping epic
                  Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon on Sunday                     
	London: Defending champion Roger Federer staged an incredible fightback to square the Wimbledon final with Rafael Nadal at two sets each on Sunday.         
	Federer saved two championship points in a nerve-racking fourth set tie-break, one with an amazing backhand pass, before taking it 10-8 on his second set point.         
	The Swiss world No. 1 trailed 4-6, 4-6 against the Spanish powerhouse but hung on grimly to win a third set tie-break after an 81-minute rain break.         
	Federers hopes of winning a record sixth Wimbledon title were hanging by a thread after an inspired Nadal seized his chances in the opening two sets while the Swiss squandered his.         
	After a 30-minute rain delay, the final began with Nadal dominating the early exchanges with his forehand doing most of the damage.         
	The second seed, bidding to become the first Spaniard to win the title since Manuel Santana in 1966, broke Federers second service game when the Swiss completely missed a backhand in the difficult, windy conditions.         
	It was only the third time all tournament that the 26-year-old had dropped a service game.         
	Federer had an immediate chance to break back but wafted a forehand over the baseline.         
	Nadal peppered Federers backhand throughout the set to keep the Swiss world No. 1 on the back foot but he did not have things all his own way.         
	Federer had another two break points when Nadal served for the set at 5-4 but failed to convert them and then netted a backhand to hand the Majorcan the lead for the first time in the three Wimbledon finals they have contested.         
	Federer nailed a forehand pass to move 2-0 ahead in the second set and looked to be back in his customary groove before Nadal retaliated to break back in the seventh game.         
	Nadal fended off a break point to level the set at 4-4 with Federer showing real signs of stress when he wastefully lashed a simple drive volley over the baseline at deuce.         
	With the momentum back on his side Nadal applied the thumbscrews on Federer in the next game with some rock solid baseline play, going 0-40 up before breaking serve with a forehand winner.         
	Federer again had chances to break back but his backhand let him down at vital moments. Federer dumped another lame backhand into the net and slouched despondently back to his chair.         
	Nadal seemed on the verge of victory at 3-3 in the third set when Federer fell 0-40 down on his serve but he found some fight to serve his way out of trouble.           (REUTERS)

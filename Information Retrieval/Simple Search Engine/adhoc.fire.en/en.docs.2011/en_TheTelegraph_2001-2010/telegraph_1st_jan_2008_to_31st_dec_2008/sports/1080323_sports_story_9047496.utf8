	Miami: Australian Geoff Ogilvy held off the challenge of world No. 1 Tiger Woods to lead by a shot after the second round of the WGC-CA Championships on Friday.         
	Ogilvy, the 2006 US Open champion, followed his seven-under 65 on Thursday with a bogey-free five-under 67 to stand at 12-under overall.         
	Another Australian, Adam Scott, was three shots behind Ogilvy having been level with Woods before bogeying the final two holes  both par fours.         
	Three players were tied in fourth place at six-under  Swedens Robert Karlsson, Indias Jeev Milkha Singh and Denmarks Anders Hansen.         
	In the opening round on Thursday, Jeev had fired four-under 68 to be tied ninth. Calcutta pro S.S.P. Chowrasia carded 73 on Day II, following his two-over 74 on the first day which had placed him at the 63rd spot.         
	Woods, looking once again in top form, fired two eagles in his round of 66 -- the best of the day -- and finished with a putt of more than 23 feet for a birdie on the ninth hole.         
	It was a contrasting end to Thursdays round when Woods bogeyed the 18th. I was trying to make sure that I didnt drop any shots like I did on Thursday. You dont want to end a good round dropping a shot, said the American.         
	Looking for his 10th win in 11 tournaments, Woods eagled the par-five 12th  chipping in from the bunker  and the first after a 329-yard drive off the tee followed by a superb second shot that landed less than seven feet from the hole.         
	He has managed to seamlessly bring his winning form from the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, where he sizzled at the weekend to win after a disappointing opening two rounds.         
	Ive hit the ball well this week. You basically have to with the wind blowing this hard, if you dont the wind is going to take it. It was nice to build on what I had done over the weekend, he said.         
	Ogilvys score was all the more impressive given that he only hit the fairway three times.           (REUTERS)

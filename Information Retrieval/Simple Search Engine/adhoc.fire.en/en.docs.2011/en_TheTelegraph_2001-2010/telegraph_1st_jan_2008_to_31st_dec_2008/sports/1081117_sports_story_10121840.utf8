	Calcutta: Bengals Day I hero, pacer Sourav Sarkar feels that constant work on his line, length and pace has helped him hone his bowling skills. That was evident on Sunday at the Eden.         
	I put emphasis on my pace and worked on the line and length also, Sarkar said on Sunday after claiming the second 5-wicket haul of his career.         
	Today I tried to maintain a good line and length while altering the pace I was trying to bowl in-swingers and keep the batsmen under pressure And that worked, he said.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla said: The toss was crucial It was a total team effort.

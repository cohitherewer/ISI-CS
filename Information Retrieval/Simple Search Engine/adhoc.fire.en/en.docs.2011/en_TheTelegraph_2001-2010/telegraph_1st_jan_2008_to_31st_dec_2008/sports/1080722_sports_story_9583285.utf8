	Karachi: The PCB is counting on support from India to prevent the ICC from shifting the Champions Trophy to some other venue in view of growing security concerns.         
	The ICC board will decide this week whether to allow the event to go ahead as per schedule in Pakistan in September or shift it to some other venue.         
	Sources said PCB was confident of hosting the mega event because India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe are supporting the board.         
	Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa are the four countries which have taken a strong stand on having the tournament in Pakistan in September due to the security situation here, a source said.           (PTI)

    - INTERNAL ROW OVER SRI LANKAS TOUR OF ENGLAND IN THE SUMMER OF 2009           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      (from top) Ranatunga, Rajapaksa, Jayawardene                                  
	Calcutta: Besides looking into matters of state, Sri Lankas President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, will also have to decide whether Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) should go ahead with the tour of England next April-May or call it off.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, SLC chairman Arjuna Ranatunga (a World Cup-winning captain and a Member of Parliament) has more or less left it to the President to give a ruling as the top players want that period off.         
	Their argument: The tour coincides with the second edition of the moolah-raining Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	In fact, one learns that the Mahela Jayawardenes approached the President even before Ranatunga did, in all probability during last months reception hosted by him to felicitate the team for winning the Asia Cup.         
	That didnt go down too well with Ranatunga and some others in SLC as, following protocol, the players should have first discussed the issue with the parent body.         
	Ranatungas point is that SLC, which is only just coming out of the red, desperately needs the handsome sum it will earn (at least $2 million) by touring England.         
	A related point, and as valid, is that only the big names gain from the IPL and that theres nothing in it really for cricket in Sri Lanka.         
	Basically, the larger picture should be kept in mind.         
	For the record, the feisty Ranatunga has declared that hes not in the chair to become popular and that he sees himself as the custodian of cricket in the country.         
	The President, incidentally, has appointed Ranatunga.         
	While the outcome of the row in Sri Lanka is awaited, there could well be other instances of players being more than just inclined to choose the IPL over country.         
	Intriguing times, perhaps, lie ahead.

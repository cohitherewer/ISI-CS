	Baghdad: Iraq cannot take part in the Beijing Olympics because it disbanded the countrys Olympic Committee although a comment from the IOC, which organises the Games, suggested the ban might not be final.         
	Iraqs government disbanded the committee in May because of a dispute over its formation. The IOC had given Iraq a deadline to reinstate the body, but the government has refused to back down.         
	Iraq had planned to send a small team despite the war that has killed more than 100 athletes in the country since 2003.         
	At least seven Iraqi athletestwo rowers, a weightlifter, a sprinter, a discus thrower, a judoka and an archer had won places at the Beijing Games.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi: Three days after Paes-Bhupathi duo crashed out of the doubles event of the Beijing Olympics, Leander Paes has decided to step down as the captain of the Indian Davis Cup team.         
	According to All India Tennis Association (AITA) sources, former Davis Cup player, S.P. Misra has been appointed as the non-playing captain for the crucial World Group play-off tie against Romania to be played from September 19 to 21.         
	Rohan Bopanna, who played a huge role in taking India to the World Group play-off with a sensational win over Japans number one player Kei Nishikori in the Davis Cup tie last April, has been dropped from the squad.         
	Young Somdev Dev Varman, who made his debut against Uzbekistan in Delhi last February, has been drafted in place of Bopanna.         
	While the AITA secretary Anil Khanna maintained that Somdev was in better form, it was clear that the AITA did not like Bopannas stance in leading a revolt against Paes after the Uzbekistan tie.         
	Paes remains a part of the five-member team which also includes SP Misra, Mahesh Bhupathi, Somdev Dev Varman and Prakash Amritraj.         
	In a statement, AITA said: Indias number one Davis Cupper Leander Paes informed Anil Khanna in a meeting held in Beijing just after the tennis event that he would like to step down as captain of the Indian Davis cup team for the tie against Romania.         
	While AITA affirmed that Paes decided to step down as he wanted the best Davis Cup team to represent the nation, sources indicated that the association had already made up its mind to bring a change after the Olympics.

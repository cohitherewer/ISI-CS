            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will lodge an official complaint against East Bengal for breaking the Indian Football Association (IFA) rule of playing at least one under-19 player throughout the Sahara Calcutta Football League Premier Division encounter.         
	The red-and-golds played without an under-19 player for at least five minutes. Coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee had substituted both under-19 players  Sanju Pradhan and Nirmal Chettri  by the 49th minute and realised his error later.         
	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said they were planning to introduce a system of armbands for the under-19 players to avoid such mistakes.

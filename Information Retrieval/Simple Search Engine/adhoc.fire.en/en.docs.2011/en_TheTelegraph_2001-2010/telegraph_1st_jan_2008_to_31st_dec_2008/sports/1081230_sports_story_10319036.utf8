The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan rubs salt in Aussie wound
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Harbhajan rubs salt in Aussie wound
                      
	New Delhi: Relishing every moment of Australias misery against South Africa, star Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said the Aussies needed to talk less and play better and any team is capable of beating the world champions.         
	An eternal thorn in Australias flesh, Harbhajan could not hide his glee as Ricky Pontings men stare at a series defeat on home soil against South Africa which also jeopardises their status as the number one Test side in the world.         
	Any team can beat Australia. Its not that they are superior to others or they are the world powers or whatever. Other teams are getting better and its nice to see people dominating them, said Harbhajan who had umpteen run-ins with the Australian cricketers.         
	In the second Test in Melbourne, South Africa, leading the three-match series 1-0, require another 153 runs on Tuesday with all 10 wickets in hand to wrap up the series.         
	Harbhajan could not help taking a dig at the under-pressure Australians and advised them to talk less and rather concentrate on improving their game.I think they concentrate a lot on talking when others just concentrate on the game and do the basic right, he told a television channel.         
	Former captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi also felt that the era of Australian hegemony is over and India would emerge as the new super power in the world of cricket.         
	Every side goes through this up and down. I think with the retirement of (Glenn) McGrath and Shane Warne and Steve Waugh and some other top class players  yes, I would say the total dominance is gone now. Its shifting gradually towards India, Pataudi said.         
	Perhaps a little bit of self-introspection is required for Australia, said the former India captain.           (AGENCIES)

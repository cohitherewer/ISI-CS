	Brussels: Italy coach Marcello Lippi equalled the world record of 31 successive international games without defeat after Luca Toni equalised in the 54th minute to secure a 1-1 draw for the world champions in their friendly against Greece on Wednesday.         
	The former European champions had taken the lead through Fanis Gekas four minutes earlier.         
	The draw in Athens took Lippi  in his second stint with Italy  level with Javier Clemente of Spain and Alfio Basile of Argentina and also saw him beat the Italian record of 30 set by Vittorio Pozzo between 1935 and 1939.         
	Among the pick of the other friendlies, Maradona began his stint as Argentina coach with a 1-0 win over Scotland, Brazil crushed Portugal 6-2, a late header from captain John Terry earned England a 2-1 win against old foes Germany, European champions Spain swept Chile aside 3-0 and Robin van Persies brace helped the Netherlands beat Sweden 3-1.         
	Despite gifting Germany an equaliser, England skipper Terry made amends with a header six minutes from time to secure a 2-1 win over Germany in Berlin and give coach Fabio Capello his fifth successive win.         
	England took the lead midway through the first half when German goalkeeper Rene Adler missed an attempted punch from a corner, leaving defender Matthew Upson to prod the ball home.         
	But after the break Terry chose to shepherd the ball back toward Englands replacement keeper Scott Carson, who hesitated and allowed Patrick Helmes to nip in and help himself to an equaliser.         
	Luis Fabianos hattrick powered Brazil to their biggest win over Portugal, a 6-2 rout outside Brasilia. Maicon, Elano and Adriano also scored for Brazil, while Danny and Simao Sabrosa notched up goals for Portugal.         
	The Spanish continued their good form since becoming European champions with a convincing 3-0 win at home to Chile.         
	David Villas penalty, a neat finish by Fernando Torres and Santi Cazorlas deflected shot leaves Spain unbeaten in 28 games and top of Fifas world rankings.         
	Van Persie scored twice and Dirk Kuyt added a third as the Dutch ran out easy 3-1 winners against Sweden who netted through Kim Kallstrom, but there was disappointment for France who were held scoreless by Uruguay in Paris.

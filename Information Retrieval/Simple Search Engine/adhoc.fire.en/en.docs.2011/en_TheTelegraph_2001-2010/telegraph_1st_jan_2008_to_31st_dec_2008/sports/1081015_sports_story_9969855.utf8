                                                                                                                                                                                           Ghosal falls in first round
                      
	Manchester: National champion Saurav Ghosal lost to Shahier Razik of Canada in the first round of the World Open squash. Ghosal, the lone Indian to make the main draw, put up a fight but fizzled out as Razik won 12-10, 12-10, 11-4 in 56 minutes.         
	With Ghosals defeat, the Indian challenge ended.         
	Former national champion Ritwik Bhattacharya was a step away from the main draw but Frenchman Mathieu Castagnet beat him 11-5, 11-6, 9-11, 3-11, 11-5 in the qualifying finals.         
	In the third game, I started to go back to basics, playing a straight game and in the next, I was really playing extremely well, all my shots were coming in, Ritwik, who turned 28 on Tuesday, said.         
	But in the fifth, I started getting again, what I thought, were awful calls. I dont normally complain but I truly believe the referee made the difference in the match.         
	Also losing in the qualifying finals was Siddharth Suchde, who went down 7-11, 5-11, 4-11 to Jorge Ferreira of Canada.         
	In the womens section, Joshna Chinappa lost to Malaysias Delia Arnold 4-11, 12-14, 11-9, 11-9, 12-10 in the qualifying finals.           (PTI)

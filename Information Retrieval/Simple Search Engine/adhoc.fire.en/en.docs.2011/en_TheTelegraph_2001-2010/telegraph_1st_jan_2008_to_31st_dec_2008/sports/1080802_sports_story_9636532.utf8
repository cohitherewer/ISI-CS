The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Too early for him to depart: Ajit
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Too early for him to depart: Ajit
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Mumbai: Former India captains Chandu Borde, Ajit Wadekar and Dilip Vengsarkar led the group of cricketers, who paid their tribute at the sudden demise of Ashok Mankad.         
	The following is what they said:         
	Borde: He was a wonderful cricketer and an asset to youngsters. He was also a good bowler. I remember when we were playing against a team containing Mansur (Ali Khan Pataudi), (ML) Jaisimha, Abbas Ali Baig and Abid Ali in their ranks, in Moin-ud-Dowla tournament in Hyderabad and he took five wickets with his off breaks. Unfortunately, he could not succeed in Test cricket. The fact that he was converted into an opener could be one of the reasons. He was also a very good captain, a knowledgeable cricketer.         
	Wadekar: Its too early for him to depart from us. Perhaps he could have done better had he continued to play in the middle order. He was a perfect team man who kept the team members in good humour in the dressing room. It created a great atmosphere in the dressing room when the team were in trouble in the West Indies and England in 1971. He was a shrewd captain and a very good judge of players. He was a good reader of the wicket, opposition and his own teammates. After all he was the son of Vinoobhai. I suppose the MCA (Mumbai Cricket Association) and the BCCI could have utilised his experience and knowledge somewhat better.         
	Vengsarkar: His service to Mumbai cricket has been phenomenal. He was an excellent captain also. He was a very humorous character who kept the dressing room very lively. His death came as a big shock. Its a great loss to Mumbai cricket. He played with a lot of pride for Mumbai. He was always a fighter and played for a win.         
	Mankads passing away was also condoled by former India spinner Bapu Nadkarni, who said: He was a wonderful middle order batsman who was not allowed to fulfil his potential in his Test career because he was converted into an opening batsman for which he was not well equipped. As a middle order batsman he was solid, on the lines of Polly Umrigar and Chandu Borde. But he got converted into an opener and succeeded too initially. He was also a fine captain, a good tactician and a very knowledgeable cricketer. Fate has been so cruel to him.         
	The BCCI president Sharad Pawar also expressed his regards for Mankad.         
	He said: Ashok Mankad had a great cricketing brain and was regarded by one and all as being a great tactician. He represented Mumbai Cricket Association in the Ranji Trophy, and his contribution and records in Domestic Cricket are unmatched. After retirement from First Class Cricket, he served the game as a Coach and nurtured the careers of many youngsters. He was associated with the National Cricket Academy. In the passing away of Ashok Mankad, the cricketing fraternity has lost a great friend, philosopher and guide.

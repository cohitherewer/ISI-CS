            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sporting Clube de Goa are counting on the return of midfielders Micky Fernandes and Wilton Gomes and Mahindra Uniteds miserable form to get back to winning ways when they clash in the ninth round of the I-League match on Wednesday.         
	The league leaders missed the services of Fernandes and Gomes as also that of Joseph Pereira in their 1-3 away loss to East Bengal over the weekend.         
	The Goan outfit will still miss Pereira, who is recovering from a knee injury, but coach Vishwas Gaonkar was confident that his wards would be able to retain their position at the top of the table where they are currently with 18 points.         
	Jo is still not fully fit and I dont want to risk him, Gaonkar said on the eve of the match at the Cooperage.         
	Sporting have been on a roll, drubbing Mohammedan Sporting (3-0) and Mohan Bagan (2-0). We are confident. We have no stars and team spirit has been the key to our success.

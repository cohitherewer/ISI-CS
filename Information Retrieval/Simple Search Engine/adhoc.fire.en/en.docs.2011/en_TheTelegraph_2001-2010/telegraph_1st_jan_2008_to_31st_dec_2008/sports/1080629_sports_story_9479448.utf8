The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjun Atwal misses cut 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arjun Atwal misses cut 
                      
	Clarksburg (Canada): A mundane second round of one-over 72 was just not enough to keep him afloat and Arjun Atwal missed the cut by seven clear shots in the Ford Wayne Gretzky Classic here.         
	After a poor opening round of 73, Atwal needed something special to finish inside the cut line but all the Orlando-based Indian could manage was one-over 73 and his two-day total of 145 was way below the cut line set at 138.         
	Playing at the Georgian Bay Club, Atwals fate was sealed when he bogeyed the third and 16th hole with a string of 12 par shots in between and though he signed off with a birdie, his campaign was all over by then.

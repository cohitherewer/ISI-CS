            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After a convincing victory over Nepal in the opener, India are now gearing up to seal a berth in the semi-finals when they take on Pakistan in the SAFF Cup group league match in Male on Thursday.         
	India, who havent played against Pakistan since their humiliating 0-3 defeat in a friendly in Lahore three years ago, are likely to go all out against their traditional rivals as a victory would secure them a place in the last four stage.         
	The defending champions, however, will be without key defender N.S. Manju, who pulled a hamstring in the match against Nepal. The team doctor has advised a weeks rest for the wing back though there is no guarantee that the Mohun Bagan player would be able to take further part in the tournament.         
	According to information received here, though chief coach Bob Houghton is yet to announce his final line up for Thursdays match, Samir Naik, a last minute entrant in place of an injured Surkumar Singh, is likely to replace Manju. Stopper back Gourmangi Singh, who too suffered a thigh injury against Nepal, is fit and likely to play. On Wednesday, the Churchill Brothers defender participated in the training session and said he was feeling fine.         
	Ironically, on Wednesday, Pakistan improved upon their Fifa rankings and moved up by one place to stand at 160. India, who were 151 in the previous rankings, have slipped down the ladder and is placed 153.

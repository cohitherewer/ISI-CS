  - Senior-most pro says hell walk if he nicks       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Sydney: If Thursday was V.V.S.Laxmans day, Friday belonged to Sachin Tendulkar. The maestro spoke to the media in general after stumps on Day III and, later, also took a few questions from The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On whether, having also got three Test hundreds at the SCG (like Laxman), there should be a Sydney-specific label for him         
	(Laughs) If Laxmans the Sultan of Sydney, then let the label be with him only... He deserves every bit of praise as he laid a fantastic foundation for us.         
	On averaging over 300 at the SCG         
	Yes, its one of my favourite grounds... Its one of those grounds where it feels good.         
	On doing well against Australia         
	Theyre the best and its a challenge... It has been so for some years.         
	On having been quite emotional on getting to his 38th Test hundred, an unbeaten 154         
	It felt different this time... From Ireland last June, Id missed a lot of hundreds (seven dismissals in the 90s in both Tests and ODIs) and didnt want that to continue... Wanted to move on from the 90s and the start of 2008 was important... The year has begun well and Im quite relieved... The hundred came at the right time and, yes, Im happy.         
	On dedicating his hundred         
	Not to anybody in particular...         
	On whether hed been looking at the scoreboard during his 129-run partnership for the eighth-wicket with Harbhajan Singh         
	No... I was only sharing my thoughts with him on extending our partnership... The focus was on that alone, not on getting a hundred... The partnership kept me preoccupied and I didnt look at the scoreboard at all.         
	On Harbhajan getting 63         
	Ive always believed Harbhajan could bat...Obviously, he had more belief in himself... I told him this was the time to prove himself by chipping in with some runs. He played an extremely important role and didnt disappoint anybody.         
	On whether Harbhajan was a calming influence when he was in the 90s         
	(Laughs) For a change, yes.         
	On the spat between Harbhajan and Andrew Symonds         
	I dont think it was an issue... Its okay as long as the players dont cross the line...It (the exchange) seemed to be about friendship...         
	On having been the darling of the SGC crowd         
	Im very pleased with the way the crowd has supported us... Australians are known for that.. They enjoy good cricket, enjoy competitive cricket... They make a players outing worthwhile... Its a pleasure being out in the middle at the SCG and scoring some runs... Support is always appreciated... The more, the better.         
	On comparisons with the late Sir Donald Bradman         
	I dont think anyone can be compared to Sir Don.         
	On Brett Lee too (after Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath) calling him the No.1 batsman         
	Its wonderful that great bowlers have such high regard for me... I also have the highest regard for them. Theyre wonderful people as well and the friendship goes beyond the cricket field.         
	On the stroke-packed start to the day by him and Sourav Ganguly         
	We played our normal game and both of us are stroke-makers... If there was a ball which had to be put away, we were prepared to do so... Yes, it was a critical period in the morning.         
	On having changed his game somewhat after four wickets (Sourav, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Anil Kumble) fell in a heap         
	I changed to a higher gear... I did have to rethink once those wickets fell...         
	On Yuvraj and Dhoni failing yet again         
	I dont think we should worry too much... Theres no doubt that they will soon score...Theyre confident guys... This (phase) can happen to any player.         
	On having shown faith in No.11 Ishant Sharma         
	It was part of my strategy, taking singles because of the field placements... Ishant scored 23 and we added 31... The partnership was important, not who took the initiative.         
	On Team India having made such a strong comeback after the rout at the MCG         
	We believe in our abilities and knew that one bad match didnt mean we couldnt bounce back... Were prepared to be mentally tough on whats a tough tour.         
	On whether he was determined to set an example as his promise of fighting hard at the MCG didnt materialise         
	Well... Id said that, yes... We didnt fight there, but have fought back hard here...         
	On whether hell walk         
	(Laughs) When it has to happen, Ill decide... Sometimes you get bad decisions too... Ill walk if I nick, I wont if I dont.         
	On the role being played by Brad Hogg         
	Hes a bubbly character... You need guys like him in the team... He adds value... Its a challenge facing him.         
	On the direction the second Test is taking         
	One cant take anything for granted and its evenly poised... Theres plenty of cricket left... We need to put the ball in the right areas tomorrow and back it up with good fielding. Thats our priority... Wed like to live in the present, not look at what may have to be done in the fourth innings. Indeed, weve got to keep winning sessions and the more, the better.         
	Finally, on whether he intends appointing Laxman (whod predicted big things for him) as his personal astrologer         
	(Laughs) Did he actually say I would surely get a double hundred?

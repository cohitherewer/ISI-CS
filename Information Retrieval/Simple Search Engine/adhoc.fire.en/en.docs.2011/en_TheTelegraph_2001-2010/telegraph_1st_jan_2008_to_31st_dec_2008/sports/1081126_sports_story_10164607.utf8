The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barabati pitch promises bounce and carry
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Barabati pitch promises bounce and carry
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: A bruised and battered England might have something to cheer about when they take on India in the fifth ODI here on Wednesday as the pitch at the Barabati Stadium is expected to offer a fair amount of bounce and carry.         
	On the eve of the match, the pitch still had a sprinkling of grass on it and according to curator Pankaj Patnaik it will favour both the strokeplayers and the bowlers equally.         
	275 will be a good score on this ground. There will be something for both bowlers and batsmen on this pitch, Patnaik said.         
	The last ODI here  between India and the West Indies in January 2007  was a low-scoring affair.         
	Batting first, India had managed to score only 189, being all out in 48.2 overs. But they came back well to bundle out the opposition in the same number of overs for 169 only. There are no chances though of a repeat of such a low-scoring match, insisted the curator.         
	The organisers are also taking no chances this time with the security arrangements, keeping in mind the unpleasant incident which took place during the last international match here. Greg Chappell, the then coach of the Indian team, was allegedly slapped by a Kalinga Sena activist at the Bhubaneshwar airport after the match.         
	A three-tier security arrangement has been put in place and the Orissa Cricket Association has also issued accreditation passes for its officials to enter the ground on Wednesday.

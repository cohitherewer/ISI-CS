The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia showing signs of fatigue and decline
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Australia showing signs of fatigue and decline
  - World champions resources are as thin as they were in 1981 and 1985         Scyld Berry            Andrew Symonds was dropped from the squad that will tour India                                       
	England end this soggy non-summer in rude health: in every format they have the right mixture of experience, youth and scope to grow under a captain who pursues excellence with an un-English zeal.         
	Australia have not only passed the peak that was personified by Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, they are showing further signs of fatigue and decline. England to regain the Ashes in 2009? Steady on. Lets just say, at this stage, there could well be only one game in it, not five.         
	We may have been too self-absorbed to notice  too busy being dragged down to New Zealands Test level  but in late May an amazing event occurred. It is one of the givens of cricket that Australians, whatever their weaknesses, can always bat and can always field. But in the second innings of their Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica, Australia collapsed to 18 for five. Admittedly, one of those wickets was a nightwatchman; nevertheless it still represented Australias worst statistical start in more than 70 years, since they had been 16 for five in the Ashes series of 1936-37. And whatever was done by the raw West Indians, Fidel Edwards and Daren Powell, England have several bowlers who could do better.         
	The Australians, therefore, have already creaked at the seams, and that process looks likely to accelerate this winter. This is because some of them are serving two masters, both of them pretty greedy, so instead of being fit and raring to peak against the Poms by July next year, they will be as knackered and injured as England have been going into the last 10 Ashes series  except for 2005.         
	Their first masters, the Australian board, have drawn up a schedule, which is as crazy as anything that Englands board has ever conceived. Thanks partly to another accident, the postponement of the Champions Trophy, England are now enjoying a nice break before late October, and have another month off before going to the West Indies in late January: the right sort of place to tune up for an Ashes series which is sure to be dominated by pace.         
	Australia, meanwhile, are off to India at the end of this month, and their feet wont touch the ground again until mid-April, by which time they have to cram in 12 Tests, 15 internationals, five Twenty20s  and mainly against prime opposition, away to India, and home and away to South Africa.         
	Their second master, for about half of the Australian Test players, is the Indian Premier League. When they finally end their season in South Africa in mid-April, they will be expected to whizz off to their franchises for the rest of April and much of May, then turn up in England in June for the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	The demands of the last IPL did for Matthew Hayden: he picked up a heel injury playing for Chennai Super Kings and has not played since, although he has been selected for Australias party to India, subject to fitness.         
	It was in his absence that Australia collapsed to 18 for five: their new openers, Phil Jaques and Simon Katich, are good batsmen, not match-winners and tone-setters like Hayden and Ricky Ponting. How many Ashes series have been won in the opening hour by Hayden or Michael Slater demoralising Englands opening bowlers? Too many.         
	Australias packed programme might throw up a decent spinner but, as they stand, their resources are as thin as they were in 1981 and 1985 when England won.         
	For their tour of India they have dug up a leg-spinner who might well be quite promising but Bryce McGain is 36 years old; and an off-spinner, Jason Krejza, whom the Australians themselves trashed when he turned out for Leicestershire in 2005.         
	Quality used to be the objective of Australian cricket. Now, it seems, their boards objective is to cosy up with India and cash in. Australia were rescued at Sabina Park by Andrew Symonds  the same Symonds who was sent home in disgrace from Darwin earlier this month, dropped from the touring party to India and sent for counselling.

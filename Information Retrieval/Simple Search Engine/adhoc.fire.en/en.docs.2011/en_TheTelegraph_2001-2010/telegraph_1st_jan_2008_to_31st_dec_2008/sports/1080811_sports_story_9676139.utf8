            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Everything seems to be going right for India in their quest to earn a place in the final rounds of the 2011 Asian Cup in Doha.         
	On Sunday, after the AFC Challenge Cup final was shifted to their favourite hunting ground, the Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi, because of continuous rain in Hyderabad, there was yet another good news for the Indians later in the day.         
	In the final to be played in the capital on Wednesday, Tajikistan will miss the services of their key striker Davrondzhon Tukhtasunov, who was suspended for two matches by the AFC for hitting North Koreas Yun Yong Ill on the head in the semi-final.         
	While Tukhtasunovs suspension came as a huge setback for the defending champions, the Indian camp should be happy to find the skillful striker not taking the field against them on Wednesday.         
	Tukhtasunov will not be eligible to play in the final against India and any subsequent official match of the Tajikistan national team. He has no right to appeal, an AFC spokesman said.         
	In the press conference held in Hyderabad on Saturday, Indian coach Bob Houghton said the Tajikistan striker should be the player to watch out for in the rival side in the final.         
	On Sunday, the AFC team of officials, along with their AIFF counterparts, inspected the Ambedkar Stadium and found it fit to host the third place play off match and the final on Wednesday.         
	While the play off between Myanmar and DPR Korea will start at 4pm, the final will be played under lights at 7 pm.

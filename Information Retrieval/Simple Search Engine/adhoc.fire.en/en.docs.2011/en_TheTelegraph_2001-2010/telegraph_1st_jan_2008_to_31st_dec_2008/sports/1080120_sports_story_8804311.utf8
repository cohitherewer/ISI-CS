                                                   This win right at the top: Kumble 

           
	Team India captain Anil Kumble said on Saturday the team was determined to fight back in Perth after the controversy-ridden Sydney Test, adding that he would cherish this win as the best of his career. 
    
	The following are excerpts from Kumbles news conference after the third Test: 
    
	Is it the best ever Test you have played? 
    
	Yes, considering the fact that no visiting team gets any kind of chance in Perth and we were 0-2 down in the series. 
    
	You have been part of many overseas wins. Where will you place this Test? 
    
	Its right at the top. When you look at the victories Ive been involved in both at home and away, this will probably be the best. 
    
	Did you expect such a remarkable comeback after what happened in Sydney? 
    
	Oh, yes. The confidence has always been there the kind of bonding we have within the team is very special. We had our moments both in Melbourne and Sydney. Im really happy that we could grab those opportunities here, especially in the first innings bundling out Australia for 212. I think that was the key and our batting in both innings were exceptional. 
    
	How will this win impact the final Test? 
    
	Im delighted we have won the match and will take this confidence to Adelaide Looking forward to winning the match there and levelling the series. We know Australia will come back hard and we look forward to that challenge (in Adelaide). 
    
	Was it extra special following what had happened in Sydney? 
    
	We wanted to show that the Indian cricket team is a good Test unit and Im happy that we proved that here. We showed it in Sydney also but unfortunately didnt get the results. Its a very special win in that it came on whats regarded as the home turf of Australia. 
    
	Was revenge on your mind? 
    
	There was no revenge or ill-feeling in the mind. We just rallied around ourselves. Cricketwise we were 0-2 down. We could have lost the series here. So it was important to come back in the match and we did exactly that. 
    
	How significant was it to deny Australia the record win the second time? 
    
	That was not the thinking (for us). Our focus was to win the Test here and give ourselves a chance to level the series. Its great that we have taken the first step. 
    
	Were all the pre-match talks around the Perth wicket a worry? 
    
	We came here fully prepared what to expect. People had other things on their mind in the way they had looked at the pitch but we knew its not going to be that kind of quick, bouncy wicket 
    
	What kind of influence did Gary Kirsten have? 
    
	His inputs of playing against Australia and in Perth were certainly useful. Those inputs were a positive help in the dressing room. In whatever time we have spent in the last week, he has been exceptional its nice that he has come into the team and we won. 
    
	Its been eventful since you took over the captaincy 
    
	It has been a tough and challenging time. I never expected I would be made the captain. Having beaten Pakistan at home, which had not happened for about 20 years, and then coming here to challenge Australia after what had happened in the past couple of weeks its been a challenge and I enjoyed it personally. The kind of support I have received from the team and everybody else is tremendous. Ive learnt to be calm and to ensure that one takes the right decisions. The game is ultimately bigger than anybody and it should move on Thats the bottomline for me. 
    
	You got a Test hundred last summer. You have been made captain, India beat Pakistan at home after a long time. Is it time for you to walk into the sunset? 
    
	I always believe you need to be at the top of your game no matter what time, what age and what kind of cricket you are playing. Im really glad things are working well and the team is doing well. This acts as an added motivation. When things are tough and the team is doing well, you feel extra motivated. Im really happy to see whatever is happening around me at this time.

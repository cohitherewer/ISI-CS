                                                     Kapil: Must not let injury break form
  - Yuvraj shouldnt take place for granted             Yuvraj Singh                           
	New Delhi: Former captain Kapil Dev on Thursday said out of form batsman Yuvraj Singh should be given a long rope to rediscover his touch but said the left-hander should not take his place for granted.         
	He should doubtless be given enough chances but he must also remember that players earn their places owing to their performance, the 1983 World Cup-winning captain said.         
	When you play, you are blocking someone elses place. If you play well, nobody can drop you. If you are not playing well, naturally you cannot be in the team, he added.         
	The former allrounder heaped praise on the young Indian bowlers for their excellent performance in Australia but advised them to stay free from injury.         
	They are bowling excellently in Australia. They have proven that they have the talent to unsettle the best batsmen in the world.         
	They are all young and in order to sustain their top form they should take care of their physique so that they stay away from injury, Kapil said.         
	He was speaking at a function to announce the sponsorship of Indian athletes for the Beijing Paralympic Games in September.         
	My message to the young bowlers is that when you are injured, the country suffers. Indian bowlers have been injury-prone for a long time. They have to take care of themselves and see that injury does not break their peak form.         
	Kapil said he didnt know how the injury-hit players coped with being sidelined as he himself did not have any serious breakdown in his career.         
	Fortunately, I did not have any serious injury in my career which forced me to sit out for long. My advice to the youngsters is that they should pay attention to their fitness.         
	The former captain also said sledging in cricket is bad but would leave it to the respective boards to decide on how to handle the issue.         
	Some people said it is gamesmanship while some others say it is hitting below the belt. Personally, I think it is bad but it is up to the respective boards to decide on how to deal with the issue.         
	Kapil, who recently filed an affidavit in the Delhi High Court against the BCCI for withholding his pension, also took a dig at the board.         
	The BCCI has lots of money but they should see how the people here (Paralympic committee) are running the game without money but with passion.         
	Most of the games in the country, except for a few such as cricket, have little money but are being sustained by the passion of officials and sportspersons.         
	I am not against private sponsors investing heavily in cricket but I feel that if 10 per cent of what has been spent on cricket is poured in other games, Indian sports would be in a much better shape, he said.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhat upsets Persson
                      
	Hong Kong: Arvind Bhat stunned world No.8 Joachim Persson of Denmark in straight-games as India made a solid start to their campaign at the Hong Kong Super Series with all the shuttlers winning their singles opening round matches on Wednesday.         
	Olympic quarter finalist Saina Nehwal started the proceedings for India beating Thai Salakjit Ponsana 21-19, 22-20.         
	Arvind Bhat then pulled off a stunner, beating the sixth seed Joachim Persson 21-17, 21-17 to advance to the second round.         
	Persson could not negotiate the smashes of Arvind as the world No. 41 wrapped up the match in just 29 minutes to emerge victorious.         
	Chetan Anand also made it to the next round but unlike Arvind he had to break some sweat before unsettling Czech Petr Koukal 21-18, 17-21, 21-13 in a 50-minute gruelling battle.         
	India had just one disappointment, when Saina and her doubles partner Anna Rice of Canada were handed a straight-game defeat by the Malaysian duo of Chiou Hwee Haw and Pek Siah Lim.

	Centurion: JP Duminy scored a career best 79 not out to guide South Africa to victory in the first one-day International against the West Indies on Sunday. 
    
	South Africa won by six wickets with 12 balls to spare after scoring 176 for four in reply to the West Indies total of 175. Rain reduced the match to 36 overs a side. 
    
	Runako Morton, who scored 41, shared 69 runs with Sammy for the seventh wicket after the West Indies had slumped to 81 for 6 in the 22nd over. 
    
	The stand was broken in the 34th over when Morton was run out by Pollocks hard, flat throw from long-on to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 
    
	The West Indies endured an abysmal final over when Ravi Rampaul (2) and Sammy were run out, and Daren Powell (0) was bowled off his pads by fast bowler Dale Steyn.

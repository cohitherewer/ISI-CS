	St Johns: The West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan scored a patient and determined 128 on Tuesday to take his side to a draw on the final day of the second Test against Australia.         
	Australia, 1-0 up in the three-match series, retained the Frank Worrell Trophy.         
	After Ricky Ponting declared before the start of play, setting the West Indies an unlikely victory target of 372, the hosts were struggling at 95 for three at lunch but recovered thanks to a gritty partnership from Sarwan and fellow Guyanese batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul.         
	The pair put on 143 for the fourth wicket before Sarwan was caught off Mitchell Johnson with the first delivery of the new ball.         
	When Dwayne Bravo (1) quickly followed, Australia felt they had a chance of victory but Denesh Ramdin joined Chanderpaul to see the innings through until five overs from the scheduled close when Ponting signalled he would settle for the draw.         
	Chanderpaul was unbeaten on 77. With survival their only realistic goal, the West Indies struggled to 95 for three at lunch.         
	Brett Lee, who took five wickets for five runs in a superb spell of swing bowling on Monday, got the early breakthrough with just four runs on the board as Devon Smith (0) chopped a rising delivery to Mike Hussey at gully.         
	Then the other West Indies opener, Xavier Marshall, was caught behind off Stuart Clark for five as the hosts tumbled to 19 for two.         
	Sarwan and Runako Morton steadied the innings before Lee returned for a second spell and trapped Morton leg before for 14.         
	Meanwhile, the West Indies could not escape a fine for maintaining a slow over-rate.         
	Roshan Mahanama, the ICC match referee, imposed the fine after Ramnaresh Sarwans side were ruled to be one over short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	Sarwan was fined 10 per cent of his match fee while each of his players received five per cent fines.           (AGENCIES)

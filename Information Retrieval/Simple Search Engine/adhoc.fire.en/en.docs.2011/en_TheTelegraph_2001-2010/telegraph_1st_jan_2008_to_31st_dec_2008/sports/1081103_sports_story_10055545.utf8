The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We sorely missed Yakubu: Rozario
                                                                                                                                                                                                     We sorely missed Yakubu: Rozario
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A despondent Stanley Rozario said Yusif Yakubus absence made the biggest difference in their I-League match against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday.         
	We sorely missed Yakubu today At least four of my first XI players were missing Subrata Paul, Mehtab Hossain, M. Suresh and Yakubu We need to find someone who can score goals, the East Bengal coach said.         
	Yakubu had to be replaced because of a sudden bout of fever. Once Yakubu started warming up he complained of feeling feverish.         
	He couldnt continue beyond 20 minutes. With Edmilson and Asim Biswas already out, I had to rely on Praveen Kumar Its very difficult to continue like this, Stanley said.         
	Yakubu has been admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake and his condition is stated to be stable.         
	Blood tests have been done and the reports will be known tomorrow (Monday), said a club official.         
	The East Bengal coach said they were working on a third foreigner as Edmilsons replacement.         
	Weve got to focus on a forward. Sunil (Chhetri) was the only one upfront today. It was a one-man show. True he didnt score but he created chances, Stanley said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said he was satisfied with the players performance.

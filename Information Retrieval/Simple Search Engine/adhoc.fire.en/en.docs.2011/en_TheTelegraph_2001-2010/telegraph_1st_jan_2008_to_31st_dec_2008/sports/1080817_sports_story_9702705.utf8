The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians come a cropper
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Indians come a cropper
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Beijing: On a day Usain Bolt etched a world record 9.69 in the 100m, Indian performance in athletics continued to disappoint.               
	Pramila secured 983 points in 100m hurdles, 903 in high jump, 639 in shot put, 894 each in 200m and long jump, 692 in javelin and 777 in 800m to finish with a total of 5771.         
	Sobha totalled 5749 (1033+795+732+922+922+735+725), while Sushmita aggregated 5705 (963+867+613+948+948+663+808).         
	Sushmitas total fell way below what she had hoped to achieve  6000 points.         
	Not one event here was to my satisfaction, to what I had set out to achieve, she told The Telegraph. I will now look ahead to the 2010 Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and step up my practice, she added.         
	Ukrainian Nataliia Dobrynska won the gold with an aggregate of 6733.         
	Mandeep Kaur failed to qualify for the semi finals of the womens 400m. Mandeep could not repeat her career-best 51.74 and timed 52.88 to finish sixth in the seven-athlete heat two and overall 33rd.         
	Vikas Gowda also faltered in the qualifying round. He hurled the discus to 60.69m to finish 11th in Group A and 22nd overall, a performance way below his personal best and national record of 64.96m.         
	On Friday, the first day of athletics, Preeja Sreedharan finished 25th in the 10,000m final.         
	The discus thrower duo of Krishna Poonia and Harwant Kaur came a cropper with shows nowhere near their personal best. Poonia, an Asian Games bronze medallist, cleared 58.23m to finish 24th while Harwants effort was a dismal 56.42 which brought her a 30th place.         
	Poonia may have qualified for the final if she had repeated her Asian Games bronze medal winning performance of 61.53m in December 2006. Here however, Poonia managed a best of 58.23m on the second of her three throws, the others being 57.31m and 58.15m.         
	Also making an early exit was Kaur. Her best of 56.42m was way below the 61.09m she touched at the 2008 National Inter-state Athletics Championships at Madurai to make the berth for Beijing.         
	Meanwhile, in shooting, Gagan Narang and Sanjeev Rajput failed to qualify in the 50m rifle prone event on Friday. Rajput (591) finished 26th and Narang (589) finished 35th in the 56-shooter field.

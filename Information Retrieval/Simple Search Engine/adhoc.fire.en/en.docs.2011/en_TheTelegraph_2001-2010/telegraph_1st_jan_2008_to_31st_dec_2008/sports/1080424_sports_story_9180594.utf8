The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riises howler gives Chelsea upper hand
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Riises howler gives Chelsea upper hand

	Advantage Chelsea. With almost the last touch of the game, deep into stoppage time, Chelsea gained a lifeline in this Champions League semi-final with John Arne Riises terrible own goal cancelling Dirk Kuyts first-half strike. Chelsea returned south last night with a precious away goal and a belief that they can reach the final in Moscow.         
	Lacking inspiration for long periods, Chelsea rarely troubled Pepe Reina, but kept pressing to conjure up only the fourth goal Liverpool have conceded at Anfield in 15 European semi-finals on a night of drama on and off the pitch.         
	Forget Tom Hicks versus Rick Parry. The real duels were on the pitch, compelling collisions between Gerrard and Claude Makelele, Fernando Torres and John Terry, while Didier Drogba and Jamie Carragher enjoyed a battle royal.         
	Yet the most significant dogfight of the first half erupted between Kuyt and Ashley Cole. Liverpools Dutchman shaped the fortunes of the opening period, constantly running down the right, keeping the usually buccaneering Ashley Cole rocking back in his starting blocks.         
	Kuyt was terrific, taking his seventh goal in 11 European games this season with real conviction. Kuyt did not merely play the executioner two minutes from the break. He was fully involved in the build-up. Xabi Alonso was clearly under instructions from Benitez to deliver long balls early, turning Chelseas defence.         
	When Torres was fouled by Michael Ballack, Alonso swept the free-kick down the line for Kuyt to chase. Pausing momentarily for support to arrive, Kuyt chipped in a cross that the diving Terry headed clear. Frank Lampard gained possession, but dithered and Liverpool pounced. Kuyt put him under pressure and Alonso nicked the ball, back-heeling it to Javier Mascherano.         
	The Argentine mis-hit the ball but it dropped invitingly for Kuyt, who had darted into the box. As Petr Cech advanced, Kuyt did brilliantly to keep his balance and drive the ball through the keepers legs. As Kuyt slid in celebration across the pitch, Chelsea players looked around in horror.         
	They had not deserved this, frequently being the more imposing side in the first half, although Liverpool fashioned the better chances. Drogba had immediately begun imposing himself on Carragher and Martin Skrtel, holding the ball up as well as flicking it on for Joe Cole. Florent Malouda, a surprise inclusion ahead of Salomon Kalou, was also getting in on the act, cutting in from the left and unleashing a shot that was deflected for a corner.         
	Gerrard hit back, testing Cech with a first-time strike that the Chelsea keeper gathered at the second attempt. Belief spread through Liverpool. Alonso was looking for the quick release ball, looking for the pace of Ryan Babel and Kuyt, whose 12th-minute run almost brought reward. The Dutchman wasted the moment, allowing Cech to advance and smother. Torres, unmarked inside, screamed in frustration. Kuyt was to make amends.         
	Chelsea seized control briefly, midfielders such as Michael Ballack creating moments of fear for Liverpool. The German flicked one ball on to Drogba, whose low cross craved a touch from a man in blue but Reina pounced. Then Lampard chipped the ball through to Joe Cole, but the England international could not adjust his body to meet it properly.         
	Liverpool need to find a higher gear, and Gerrard gave Babel a quick lecture on the demands of the occasion. Gerrard was trying to escape from Makelele in the middle, and seemed to have one eye on a fussy official, knowing that a caution would rule him out of the second leg.         
	After Liverpool survived a brief scare when Drogba tumbled in the box under a fair challenge from Carragher, the hosts conjured up a wonderful chance with 30 minutes gone. After good work by Babel and Mascherano down the left, Gerrard struck the ball beautifully to Torres.         
	Here was the situation that the pacy Spaniard loves best, running through one-on-one with a goalkeeper. Torres first touch dragged Gerrards pass forward, his second nudged it, setting up the shooting chance. That feared right boot then came down, powering into the ball, which accelerated goalwards.         
	The Kop, all standing, all singing, prepared to celebrate Torres 31st goal of the season, but they had forgotten about Cech. Chelseas keeper spread himself well to block Torres shot.         
	But Liverpool had found their stride, and were beginning to test the strength of the ramparts around Cechs goal. Kuyt made the breakthrough.         
	Chelsea seemed to lack life, all conviction draining from them. Ballack struggled. Lampard appeared distracted, understandably so given his mothers illness. Running on to Drogbas cutback after 64 minutes, Lampards first touch was surprisingly poor and the ball ran out into a crowing Kop.         
	Lampard slowly showed signs of his undoubted class, lifting in a free kick to Ballack, whose flicked header was well saved by Reina. The England international then found Malouda, whose shot was deflected wide by the sliding Carragher.         
	Drogba, released by Lampards pass, tried to smuggle the ball around Carragher, who stood his ground superbly. Cech superbly pushed over Gerrards volley and Torres also went close to making it 2-0, but there was a twist of fate at the end, Riise inadvertently heading home Kalous cross.

	Out of 54,435 votes that were counted online on Sydney Morning Herald website, only 27 per cent responded with a no to the question if it was right to sack Ponting for his role in the monkey affair.         
	The poll was in response to a column by Peter Roebuck, demanding Pontings sacking.           (PTI)

                                                   Chelsea to help Vision India project 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: English Premier League giants Chelsea FC are all set to join hands with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to help and develop the Vision India project.         
	According to AIFF sources, AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam met Chelsea chief executive officer Peter Kenyon recently and discussed the extension of the top English clubs support to Vision India.         
	Chelsea FC signed a four-year deal with the AFC last year to become the confederations official football development partner in China and since then have helped the nation in launching five city leagues.         
	Under the Indian programme, Chelsea will directly be involved in developmental projects in Manipur, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the Vision India project has already been launched. Calcutta, however, will not be benefited from the scheme as Bengal has not been included in the Vision India project.         
	Apart from supporting various events like city leagues and school leagues, the English club is also likely to send their instructors to India for coaching young footballers at the school level.         
	Like it was in China, the Roman Abramovich-owned club is also expected to invest more than one million dollars in the Indian project.         
	In China, Chelsea played a major role in the success of the city leagues in Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chengdu and Zibo. They even spotted some youngsters from the school level and took them to England for advance training. In India, Chelsea will also hold workshops for the clubs where relationship with the community, media, and other entities will be explained.         
	Its an encouraging development for Indian football, said AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco on Friday.         
	We had a preliminary discussion with the Chelsea officials sometime back and we made a presentation before them, Colaco added.

	New Delhi: India under-19 captain Virat Kohlis commitment to the teams cause is unmatched, even in the worst hour of grief. 
    
	Delhi Ranji Trophy players would remember the day in December 2006 when Kohli decided to see his team through to safety even after losing his father the previous night. 
    
	Kohli, then only 17, was 40 not out overnight and was fighting hard with Puneet Bisht to save the follow-on against Karnataka. 
    
	In the morning, when the Delhi team management was planning to send the next batsman in place of the youngster, Kohli reported in the dressing room. I want to bat, he insisted and went on to score a fine 90 before getting out to a controversial decision. 
    
	The then Delhi skipper Mithun Manhas and coach Chetan Chauhan were so overwhelmed by Kohlis gesture that they termed it as one of the most courageous actions they had experienced on a field. Hats off to his attitude and determination, Manhas said. 
    
	The rival team, too, was all praise for the youngster. The entire team walked up to Kohli to offer their condolences. It was a great knock, Karnataka coach Venkatesh Prasad said. 
    
	Kohli hasnt forgotten his friends and advisers. Moments after the memorable triumph in the under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur, he called up Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya and senior cricketer Aakash Chopra to share his joy. 
    
	He is a boy whose feet are firmly on the ground, said Kohlis long time coach Raj Kumar at the West Delhi Cricket Academy. Immediately after India reached the final, Kohli called up his acquaintances in Delhi and arranged an air ticket for the coach to come over to Kuala Lumpur and watch the final.

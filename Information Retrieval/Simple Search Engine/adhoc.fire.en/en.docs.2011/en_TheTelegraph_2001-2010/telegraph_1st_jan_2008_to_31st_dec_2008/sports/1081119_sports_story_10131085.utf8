	Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose believes that Tuesdays thumping win against Serivces will help Bengal perform better in their upcoming Ranji Trophy matches.         
	Its always good to win matches We required this win. It will be a boost for us and hopefully we can carry the momentum into our upcoming matches, Ranadeb Bose said after Bengals resounding victory against the weak Services side.         
	The lanky pacer, however, didnt accept that Services were a weak side. You cannot take the credit away from us They are not that weak Actually we played a great game of cricket and thats where we were leading, he said.         
	Hailing the whole team for an outstanding performance, the 29-year old also said: Actually everybody performed Everybody contributed Starting from Sourav Sarkars five-wicket haul Then Rohan (Banerjee), Shukla both hit centuries Everything went our way We played superbly We outplayed them.         
	Ranadeb was also hopeful that both batsmen and bowlers will continue their good show in the upcoming matches.         
	Look, both bowlers and batsmen have performed very well and it seems that they have gained the touch and it will be great in the next matches And if Shib Shankar Paul is fit again, then it will be a great side, Ranadeb said.

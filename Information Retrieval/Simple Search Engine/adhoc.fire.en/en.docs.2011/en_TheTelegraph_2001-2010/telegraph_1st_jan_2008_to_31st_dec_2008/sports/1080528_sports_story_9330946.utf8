            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bayern Munich outgoing coach Ottmar Hitzfeld is quite impressed with Mohun Bagans P.C. Lalawmpuia and Ishfaq Ahmed after their friendly at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Hitzfeld, who addressed the post match press meet on Tuesday along with mid-fielder Mark van Bommel, also showered praises on Mohun Bagan.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Ottmar Hitzfeld         
	How was your stay in Calcutta?         
	We had a nice experience here. I am very happy with the reception here and the hospitality and the friendliness of the people here. The soccer emotion here is great.         
	On Mohun Bagan         
	They are a good side. Their defence was organised and they played good football They are a tactically good unit much better than the Indonesian national side.         
	Impressed with any of the Bagan players?         
	No. 9 (Lalawmpuia) and 11 (Ishfaq) impressed me a lot. They were quite good today and were impressive... I liked their game.         
	Happy with the result?         
	In an international friendly this is a general result. It was expected         
	The fracas between Breno and Branco Cardozo         
	I was quite distant from the place where the incident occurred. So I really have nothing to say.         
	Last match as Bayern Munich coach         
	Yeah it feels sad         Mark van Bommel  
	Your experience playing here         
	It was quite hot and humid out here. But the ground was nice and we are happy.         
	On the huge crowd         
	The atmosphere was nice... We thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya: Im no magician, dont have a magic wand
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dalmiya: Im no magician, dont have a magic wand
    - cab chief gets calls from those in the bcci who had been keeping a distance           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jagmohan Dalmiya at the CAB on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: Having regained control of the Eden, Jagmohan Dalmiya reached home around 4 am on Wednesday, but just couldnt sleep for more than a couple of hours.         
	The phones started to ring from so early in the day... I had to accept the greetings of well-wishers, Dalmiya told The Telegraph on the morning after a stupendous win in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections.         
	Overwhelmed, yet aware that a steep task lay ahead, he added: The expectations are so high... Its assumed that Jagmohan Dalmiya will set things right overnight, but Im no magician and certainly dont have a magic wand.         
	If the expectations indeed are high, its because of Dalmiyas excellent record at every level, be it international or within the country.         
	Look, Ill need a few days to settle down... Im aware that plenty needs to be done and, as I told you last night, nothing personal is a priority... The one priority is getting the states cricket back on track... Quickly too...         
	Ill be seeking the views of colleagues, its not that Ill function as an autocrat, he pointed out, as the landlines at his residence kept ringing.         
	The Dalmiya groups assessment is that the ousted lot pushed cricket in the state back by 10 years. Thats an awful lot of catching up to do and the next season isnt far away.         
	Among other things, Dalmiya must quickly appoint the next coach (Mohinder Amarnath is an inspired choice No. 1) and finalise wholl sit in the two chairs reserved for the assistant secretaries.         
	Those posts dont figure in the elections.         
	Its almost taken for granted that Naresh Ojha will occupy one chair, but there are at least half-a-dozen hopefuls and Dalmiyas skills will be tested.         
	Despite the very high margin (24) of his victory over Prasun Mukherjee, Dalmiya cant afford to antagonise voters whore looking for a tangible reward, not only a thank-you.         
	Weve won as a group and the matter, Im sure, will be settled within... I dont see a problem on any front, he said.         
	Incidentally, despite being in the chair from January 2007, Mukherjee (a former commissioner of police) got fewer votes this time  47. Back in 2006, when hed tried to unseat Dalmiya, hed collected 56.         
	Embarrassing, to say the least, and an indication of the complete disillusionment across the CAB.         
	Moving away from the CAB, it will be interesting how the ruling group in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as a whole reacts, over time, to Dalmiyas comeback  19 months after being banished, an act seen as vindictive.         
	Dalmiyas an old hand... Anybody who is a legitimate representative of an affiliated unit can attend meetings... Why should we react to the CAB elections? Its not necessary, asserted a key office-bearer of the BCCI.         
	As the CAB is a member of the working committee, August 23 will mark Dalmiyas return in a BCCI forum as thats the date for its next meeting, in Mumbai.         
	The Lalit Modis may not be looking forward to again sitting in the same room as Dalmiya, but one learns that some from the ruling group too have already called in person to congratulate the comeback man.         
	The D-Factor cant be ignored.         
	Footnote: Dalmiya will be calling on the venerable B.N. Dutt on Thursday. A former BCCI and CAB president, Dutt is no longer active in the Maidan (son Subrata is) but its pretty important to have his blessings, even if its indirect.

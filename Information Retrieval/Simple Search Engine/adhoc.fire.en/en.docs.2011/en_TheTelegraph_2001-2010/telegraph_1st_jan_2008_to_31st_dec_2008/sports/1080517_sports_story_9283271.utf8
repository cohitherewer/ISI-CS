The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nothing went right: Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nothing went right: Sourav
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan said Shaun Pollocks devastating spell blunted the gameplan of the Sourav Ganguly-led squad.         
	The following are excerpts from what Buchanan and the others had to say on the match:         
	SOURAV GANGULY: Nothing went right for us today. They bowled well and Shaun was exceptional. He bowled in the right areas and we didnt bat well If we can still win the remaining four matches we will be in with a chance. Weve got to accept it and move on In cricket there are bad and good days.         
	JOHN BUCHANAN: There was a gameplan but all credit should go to the Mumbai Indians. Pollock did exceptionally well and we could not recover after that. We went out there looking for chances to win the game and tried to claim wickets and kept attacking but a score of 67 is difficult to defend.         
	SHAUN POLLOCK (MoM): We never thought we would get them out for such a low score, but after the last game they (curators) had added some water to the wicket. We knew that if we bowled well we had a chance. We have lots of confidence and momentum now and theres a good vibe in the team. Sanath (Jayasuriya) has struck form and Sachin is back (after his injury lay-off), but we are not looking too far ahead.

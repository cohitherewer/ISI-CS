The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I hope to witness attacking soccer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I hope to witness attacking soccer
  - No side appear outstanding but several footballers could capture imagination
                        FREE KICK
     P.K. Banerjee        
	A few days ago I read a newspaper report which quoted Germany coach Joachim Loew as saying that the Euro 2008 beginning on Saturday could be the most difficult tournament ever. According to him, all the teams are powerful and anyone can beat anyone.        
	Having been associated with the game for more than 50 years, I could guess what was going on in Loews mind when he uttered these words. Germany are regarded as one of the favourites but Loew knows how unpredictable this tournament could be. It is clear that the major nations, the ones that start as favourites, do not always have it their way.        
	In 2004, when most of us were expecting one of the heavyweight teams to win the Cup, Greece, an 80-1 choice of the bookmakers, stunned the 16-team field to take the crown home. So much so that they beat hosts Portugal twice, once in the group stages and then in the final. In 1992, Denmark were complete outsiders yet they bagged the title.        
	So, while current world champions Italy, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain appear front-runners, it wont surprise if rank outsiders such as Romania, Turkey or even Czech Republic walk away with the trophy.        
	The European Championship, I think, was probably at its best in the 1980s when West Germany, France and Holland played classical football to claim the title. With highly talented players in their ranks, these teams were a cut above the rest. Now with the advent of the English Premier League and the Champions League, Euro has been overshadowed to some extent.        
	But, then, I am not suggesting that the 2008 edition would be devoid of excitement. While it is being said that there is not one outstanding team in this tournament, there are several players vastly capable of capturing the imagination of the audience worldwide.        
	If Cristiano Ronaldo tops the list of footballers who would be followed with great interest, Fernando Torres, Michael Ballack, Miroslav Klose, Luca Toni, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Thierry Henry would not be far behind to dazzle the field in Austria and Switzerland.        
	At the same time, there are fresh talents such as Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, Croatias Luca Modric and perhaps Swiss teenager Erin Derdiyok.        
	Coming back to favourite teams, I have a lot of faith in Roberto Donadonis Italy despite their early hiccups in the qualifying round that included a 1-1 draw against Lithuania.        
	I know they have no Francesco Totti in the side and the injury to Fabio Cannavaro would have hit them hard but the presence of the Buffons, Pirlos and Tonis is enough to take them to the top.        
	Like the Italians, the Germans, too, havent changed their squad too much and Loew would mainly be dependent on experienced players such as Klose and Ballack. The Chelsea striker is charismatic, skilful and in great form. I am sure Loew is banking on Ballack. It will make his job easier.        
	Then there are France, Spain and last but not the least, Portugal with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks. While all of us would be hoping to see Ronaldo start from where he left with Manchester United, we shouldnt forget the fact that their coach Big Phil Scolari, who already has a World Cup title in his pocket, would be desperate to add the Euro to his CV.        
	Lastly, I feel sad that England wont be there in the tournament which would have given David Beckham the final chance to write his name on the coveted cup. All I hope to see this time is attacking football and not the kind of game that Greece played four years ago to win the crown.        
	There should be football to savour throughout the month.  
	PK's pick  GERMANY  With the tournament being held right across their borders, the Germans have geography on their side. They haven rsquo;t won a single game in the Euro Cup since 1996, but now have emerged as a free-scoring unit. Miroslav Klose and Michael Ballack are proven players and the side is as attacking and aggressive under coach Joachim Low as it was under Jurgen Klinsmann in the 2006 World Cup.  Ballack could be the key factor in the German gameplan. He is certainly their finest and has been in great form for Chelsea for the past few months. Though he is bound to feel the fatigue after ending up on the losing side for the second time in the Champions League, his skills to torment the rivals almost single-handedly can never be doubted.
  Mind you, Ballack is not the only one on whom Germany is dependent upon. They have Lukas Podolski, Torsten Frings and Christoph Metzelder as well as new talents such as Mario Gomez, Simon Rolfes and Piotr Trochowski. Germany have a real chance of going all the way.  Fortunately, Germany are placed in a relatively easier group and should qualify with Poland .  PORTUGAL  I would put my money on Portugal simply because of Cristiano Ronaldo. After two extraordinary seasons at Old Trafford, he is certainly one of the most exciting players in the world.   With the defence safely in the hands of Ricardo Carvalho, Portugal could be the most dangerous attacking side. They have Nani, Ricardo Queresma and Simon, who are capable of destroying any defence. To add to their advantage, Portugal are in a group which should not bother them too much.  Apart from Ronaldo, the presence of Luiz Felipe Scolari would be the biggest advantage for Portugal. He is a master at his art and I am sure the Brazilian will be desperate to go one better than what he did in the last Euro Cup four years ago. For a team which reached the final of the Euro Cup and the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup, all that is needed is self belief to initiate the final push.   Only thing that worries me is that Scolari is yet to settle on a striking pair to lead the line and Deco rsquo;s injury problems might give the coach another headache. But then, time and again Scolari has proved himself quite effective at this stage and with so many skilled ball players in the midfield, he won rsquo;t allow the opportunity to go.  ITALY  Every tournament has a group of death and so is Group C here. A look at the group quickens the pulse, but though Italy have an extremely difficult chore to perform in the first round, which also has France, the Netherlands and an unpredictable Romania, I am confident the World Cup winners are too strong to be stopped so early. Italy could emulate what France did in 1998 and 2000 by winning the World Cup and immediately following it with the European Championship.  Italy has a new coach in Roberto Donadoni. He is being criticised for not having much experience but that is unfair. I think it is a completely new tournament and the experiences of winning the World Cup in 2006 would not be of much help here.   Donadoni, I believe, would play in the 4-3-3 formation but unlike the Netherlands, his two forwards would not play as wingers. They would play more as strikers to support Luca Toni, who was in terrific form for Bayern Munich in Bundesliga this season.   
	Players  
	Cristiano Ronaldo 
  (Portugal )  
	 Arguably the world rsquo;s best player at the moment, the Manchester United striker will hog the limelight. I have a personal liking for him because of his incredible skills. On his day, Ronaldo can single-handedly turn the fortunes of a match. After a remarkable season at Old Trafford, the Portuguese winger should be ready to write his name on the Euro Cup. His tricks and flicks are sure to dazzle spectators, but don rsquo;t be surprised if he bags his fair share of goals as well. After all, Ronaldo is a kind of player who loves to shine on the big stage.  
	 Fernando Torres 
  (Spain )  
	 This man will definitely be Spain rsquo;s focal point in attack as he can turn a game on its head with his goals. What I like of Torres is his lightning pace, movement and incredible finishing. He has the quality to write his name in the list of great strikers and will be a threat against any team. I believe that Torres should be supremely confident since he had a fantastic debut season for Liverpool with 33 goals, including 24 in the Premier League. Like many others, I don rsquo;t consider Spain as one of the favourites for the title, but if Torres displays the same EPL form Spanish fans may finally hope to end their title drought.  
	 Karim Benzema 
  (France)  
	 France have thrown up quite a few new stars in the recent past and this 20-year-old boy could be a new addition to the list. Benzema has the potential to emerge a hero as he has really come out of the shadows this season. If newspapers reports are to be believed, a whole load of major European clubs are vying for him after he finished top scorer in the French League for Lyon. I am not yet sure whether he would earn a place in the starting line up as Thierry Henry, Nicolas Anelka and Bafetimbi Gomis are all there, but given a chance, he has the ability to deliver the goods.

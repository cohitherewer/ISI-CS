                                                    Australia make solid start after India post 526

	Adelaide: Indias tail wagged merrily to pile up 526 in the first innings of the fourth and final Test against a frustrated Australian side which began its response with a cautious 62 for no loss here on Friday. 
    
	Skipper Anil Kumble led the way with a spirited 87 after overnight centurion Sachin Tendulkar had fallen for a splendid 153 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16) also perished cheaply in the pre-lunch session, which threatened to derail the innings. 
    
	The Australians, leading the four-match series 2-1, laid the foundation for the run chase by negotiating the 21 overs before close on Day II with Matthew Hayden (36) and Phil Jacques (21) at the crease. They still trail India by 464 runs. 
    
	It was Kumble who frustrated the home team the most as he put up 107 runs for the eighth wicket with Harbhajan Singh (63) and then teamed up with young Ishant Sharma to add 58 more runs for the last wicket on a good batting track at the Adelaide Oval. 
    
	Kumble was the last man out, caught behind by Adam Gilchrist off the bowling of Mitchell Johnson, but not before giving his team a big total to push for a series-levelling victory. 
    
	The Australians had themselves to be blamed for dropping quite a few catches with Kumble and Sharma being the beneficiaries. 
    
	Adam Gilchrist, who had dropped a catch of V.V.S. Laxman on the opening day, claimed four catches to earn the Test record for wicketkeeping dismissals, his tally of 414 one ahead of South Africas Mark Boucher. 
    
	Sharma (14 ..) was given three lives, including a simple return catch to Michael Clarke, when he was on four. Kumble was dropped by Phil Jaques on seven. 
    
	At one stage, it did not look that India would be able to post a big total when Sachins superb knock ended on 153, an effort which contained 13 boundaries and three sixes. 
    
	Kumble appeared in sight of his second Test century before he was dismissed in the final session, having batted for 260 minutes and faced 205 balls, hitting nine fours. 
    
	Still, India were well served by their lower half after the overnight batsmen Dhoni and Sachin didnt quite rattle up big runs against their names this morning. 
    
	Tendulkar had just thumped Brett Lee through extra cover to move past 153 when an attempted pull off the next delivery saw him edge the shot painfully to his left knee. 
    
	The impact left Sachin squirming in agony and as help was rushed from the dressing room, an early drinks was taken. 
    
	On resumption, Sachin, still hobbling, tried to pull the first delivery and only succeeded in sending it high up for the squarer of the two fine legs, Brad Hogg, to rush forward and accept the chance. 
    
	In all, he batted for 338 minutes and hit 13 fours and three sixes from 205 balls in his knock of 153 runs. 
    
	Dhoni once hit Mitchell Johnson over his head for a four and then tried to upper cut a rising delivery which, with the impact of the stroke, carried to the sweeper Andrew Symonds to the cover fence. 
    
	Australia were then held up by the eighth wicket pair of Kumble and Harbhajan who batted well into the second hour of the afternoon session. 
    
	Both Harbhajan and Kumble batted cautiously and aggression, if any, came only from the off-spinner who occasionally clouted a few hits deep in the ground. 
    
	Harbhajan completed his half-century with an off-drive and made dramatic gestures, including running towards the dressing room, pointing towards the boards logo on his shirt and then waving his bat for the rest of the stands. 
    
	This is his second successive half-century against the world champions, following his 59 in Sydney. 
    
	Next man in Rudra Pratap Singh didnt trouble the scorer, flicking one off his legs straight to the mid-wicket fielder. 
    
	But the fire of fight still burned in the Indian resistance and the last man Ishant Sharma helped Kumble push the score past 500 runs. 
    
	Kumble played an exemplary knock, staying put and never yielding an inch of his ground, before reaching his half-century with a back drive to Symonds for a brace. 
    
	Last man Ishant Sharma showed very fine technique in staying put to the extent that the tea break was advanced by half an hour as the last wicket pair refused to budge.

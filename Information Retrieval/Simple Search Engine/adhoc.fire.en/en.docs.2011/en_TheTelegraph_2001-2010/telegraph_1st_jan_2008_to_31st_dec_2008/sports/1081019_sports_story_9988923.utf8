                                                                                                                                                                                                     Will cherish this century: Sourav
  - People will remember you for what you do in Test cricket, says former captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mohali: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who will retire after the ongoing series against Australia, said he had taken the decision to quit since he doesnt want to play anymore.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His century         
	Not the most memorable, but definitely something which I will cherish.         
	If the decision to retire was wrong         
	No, no I think it is the right decision. And no regrets.         
	Why he was retiring         
	I just dont want to play anymore. To be honest, I have been playing well for the last two years, not just this series. Except for the Sri Lanka series, I thought I had an outstanding two years. But it is just that I feel the time has come to go.         
	If he will reconsider his decision if India need his services         
	We will cross the bridge when it comes. At the moment, I am going to retire after this series.         
	If anybody pressurised him into retiring         
	It is a personal decision.         
	His thoughts about retirement         
	Just happy to get runs. I still hopefully have five innings to go.Will try and do well and just finish off well.         
	His approach to the game         
	I have prepared the same way I did even when I used to play regularly in both forms of the game. What I try to do is, before the game starts, I make sure mentally I have done everything needed to be successful.         
	On Amit Mishra         
	He has done very well. It is just the beginning. He has to do it day in and day out for a number of years as someone like Anil or Harbhajan has done. He has definitely put us in a position from where Australia will be under pressure tomorrow (Sunday).         
	If Test matches hold primacy in modern day cricket         
	Yes, you will be remembered by what you have done in Test matches. First, Test matches and then one-day cricket. People will remember you as a player according to what you do in Test cricket.         
	If asked to compare this hundred with the one in Gabba         
	It was under different conditions. There was more bounce in the pitch. They had attacking fields, so for every good shot, I got value. It was different here. This one is a more patient hundred.         
	Mood of the Fab Five         
	It is going to be an individual decision for everyone and honestly, age is no bar. It is the runs you get. People like Laxman, Sachin and Rahul have been scoring runs. So I think they should be judged completely on the basis of their performance.

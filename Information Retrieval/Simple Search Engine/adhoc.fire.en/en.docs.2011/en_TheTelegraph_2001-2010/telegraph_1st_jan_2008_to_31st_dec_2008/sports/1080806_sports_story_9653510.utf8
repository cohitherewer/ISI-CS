                                        IPL better in marketing, says Kapil  Bangalore: Indian Cricket League chairman Kapil Dev on Tuesday admitted that the rival Indian Premier League has overshadowed ICL in their market blitz but ruled out joining forces with the IPL. He insisted that ICL churned out fantastic, unbelievable matches and was ahead of IPL in onfield action. Asked by reporters if ICL has been overshadowed by IPL, the skipper of India rsquo;s 1983 World Cup campaign said, ldquo;in marketing, yes; in cricket, no rdquo;.   Shoaib waits   Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will have to wait anxiously to prove his fitness before the national selectors after heavy rains on Tuesday disrupted the first of three practice matches, which would form the basis for selection of the Pakistan squad for next month rsquo;s Champions Trophy. The inclement weather has also cast a shadow on the chances of the second match on Thursday.   Task force   Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board is reluctant to receive the ICC special task force, which will review security arrangements for the Champions Trophy, before the Independence Day of the country.   The PCB on Tuesday refused to reveal when the task force will come to Pakistan but sources said that it would reach Pakistan on August 10 on a four or five-day inspection visit.   PCB to help   Karachi: Taking a U turn in their approach towards troubled Mohammed Asif, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday said it would consider helping out suspended pacer if he approaches them for help in his doping case. Nadeem Akram, PCB director (human resources) said, ldquo;Until now neither he nor his lawyer, Shahid Karim, have approached us for any assistance in securing visas for Switzerland or otherwise. If they do request us for assistance we will consider helping him rdquo; He insisted that the board had not deserted Asif after his Dubai detention or the positive test in the IPL.   Ejaz resigns   Karachi: A senior member of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Ejaz Butt has resigned from a PCB sub-committee, set up to oversee a multi-million dollar hotel deal with the national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines. Butt confirmed on Tuesday that he had resigned from the sub-committee as he was not happy with the way the deal was being conducted and implemented.   Trophy shared   Calcutta: Ireland and the Netherlands shared the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier trophy after the final was rained off without a ball being bowled at Stormont in Belfast, Ireland on Tuesday, according to A Staff Reporter. Ireland won a delayed toss and decided to field but persistent showers prevented the groundsmen from removing the covers from the square.

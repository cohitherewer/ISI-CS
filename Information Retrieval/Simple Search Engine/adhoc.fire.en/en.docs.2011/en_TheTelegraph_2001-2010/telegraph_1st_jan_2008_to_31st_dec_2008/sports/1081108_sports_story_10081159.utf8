The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB to honour Sourav 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     CAB to honour Sourav 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB has decided to honour Sourav Ganguly at Eden Gardens on December 7. It has been under fire from all quarters for going unrepresented during the BCCI-organised felicitation in Nagpur on Thursday.         
	We had waited till the last minute and hoped that Sourav would reconsider his decision to retire from international cricket. But during the function in Nagpur on Thursday, we saw that he had firmed up his mind. We fully respect his decision and CAB would felicitate him in a befitting manner, Jagmohan Dalmiya said.         
	This felicitation, Dalmiya said, is not only an acknowledgement of a glittering international career, but is also an appreciation of Souravs contribution to Indian and Bengal cricket for over a decade and a half.         
	It was learnt that since the invitation for the Nagpur function came from the Vidarbha Cricket Association, the CAB decided against sending a representative. Had the invitation come from the BCCI, we would certainly have considered sending someone, a top official said.         
	Secretary Arun Mitra, however, was at a loss to explain why no one had represented CAB in Souravs last Test. Asked why the felicitation was being organised almost a month after his retirement, Mitra said: Its being done on a grand scale. We need time to prepare and invite guests. Hence

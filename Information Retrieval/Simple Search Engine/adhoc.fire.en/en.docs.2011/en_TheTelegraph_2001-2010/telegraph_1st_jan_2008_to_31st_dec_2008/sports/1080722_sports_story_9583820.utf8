	ANECDOTES         
	Vertigo         
	A bronze medallist in diving in 1964, American Larry Andreasen achieved notoriety 24 years later for an unusual stunt. He dived from a bridge in California 48.5m high believing it to be a world record. Unfortunately not only was the record 53m, but Andreasen got himself arrested in the process.         
	Costly prank         
	A few days after winning her third straight 100m freestyle title, Australias Dawn Fraser found herself in hot water. Along with others she tried to steal the Olympic flag which was flying above the Imperial Palace. Despite being pardoned by the Emperor himself, she failed to escape the wrath of the Australian federation who banned her for 10 years for what they considered unexplainable and dishonourable behaviour in their colours.               
	SUMMARY         
	The 1964 Games in Tokyo were the first on Asian soil and featured a number of performances by athletes who will be forever remembered in Olympic folklore.         
	However the failure of the hosts to land the prized judo heavyweight crown left a sour taste in the mouths of the Japanese and deprived them of a title they assumed winning was just a formality.         
	Judo had been specifically introduced in 1964 to appease the Japanese who consider the discipline their national sport.         
	In the athletics competition, there were a number of memorable performances. American Bob Hayes blew away his rivals to take the 100m dash, while his compatriot Al Oerter took the third of what would become four consecutive discus titles.         
	Peter Snell of New Zealand pulled off the rare feat of taking the 800m and 1500m crowns, Ethiopian Abebe Bikila successfully defended his marathon title won four years earlier in Rome, this time wearing shoes, while Soviet star Valeri Brumel lept higher than the rest to take high jump gold.         
	The Olympic swimming pool was also host to some wonderful displays.         
	A closer look at the history books will also show the exploits of Czech gymnast Vera Caslavska who won three gold medals while in the boxing ring a certain fighter named Joe Frazier battered his way to the super-heavyweight title.

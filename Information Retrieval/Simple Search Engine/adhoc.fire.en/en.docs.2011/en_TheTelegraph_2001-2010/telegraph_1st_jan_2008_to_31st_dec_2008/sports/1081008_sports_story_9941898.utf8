The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Marcos stand-off takes a new turn
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Marcos stand-off takes a new turn
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The ongoing controversy over Marcos Pereiras transfer to Mohun Bagan took a new turn on Tuesday when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided to refer the matter to the Players Status Committee.         
	According to AIFF sources, all the relevant papers regarding the Brazilian striker have been sent to the members of the committee, including letters from Mohun Bagan and JCT. The committee members have been asked to voice their opinion on the subject as soon as possible.         
	The members are likely to take a decision on Pereiras transfer by the 12th of this month, sources said. No meeting has been convened but the members will send in their individual opinion to the federation.         
	The federation, it seems, is quite disturbed by the growing number of disputes over transfer of players at the start of the new season.         
	It started with Steven Dias and N.P. Pradeep and now we have to solve this Marcos Pereira problem, sources said. Though the Players Status Committee members are yet to take a decision on the subject, certain facts may put the Punjab side on the back foot.         
	The very fact that JCT do not have any written contract with Marcos Pereira for the new season may go against them.The federation has also received a letter from JCT about the sudden disappearance of their new Brazilian recruit from the team hotel in Goa. The footballer had left the hotel a couple of days back without informing the team management.

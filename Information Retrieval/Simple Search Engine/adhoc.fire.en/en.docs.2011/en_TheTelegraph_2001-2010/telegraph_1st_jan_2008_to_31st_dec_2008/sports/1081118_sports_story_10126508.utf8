The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drogba not to fight charge
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Drogba not to fight charge

	London: Didier Drogba will not contest the Football Associations violent conduct charge for throwing a coin back into the crowd during a League Cup game against Burnley.         
	Drogba, who had just scored, picked up a coin which had apparently been thrown by a Burnley fan and hurled it back into the crowd during Wednesdays match.         
	Drogba has responded to the FAs charge of violent conduct and will not contest it, Chelsea said Monday.         
	The FAs regulatory commission will hear the case Tuesday and consider video evidence and written submissions. If found guilty, Drogba is likely to be fined and banned for three games.                     
	The FA said last week that referee Keith Stroud gave Drogba a yellow card for going towards the Burnley supporters to celebrate but had not seen him throw the coin.         
	The game ended 1-1, and Burnley advanced to the quarter finals after winning a penalty shootout. Burnley could also face disciplinary action as a result of the coin-throwing incident. Police are also investigating.

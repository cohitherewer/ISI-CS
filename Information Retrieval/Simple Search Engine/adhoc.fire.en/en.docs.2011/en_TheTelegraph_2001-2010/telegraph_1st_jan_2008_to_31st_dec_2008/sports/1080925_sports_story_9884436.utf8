	Churchill sack Emeka
    Panaji: Churchill Brothers sacked coach Emeka Ezeugo just days ahead of the I-league which commences Friday. Emeka had a strained relationship with some of the senior players and did not report for training since the Durand Cup final which they lost to Mahindra United, forcing the club management to sack him, stated Churchill Brothers patron Churchill Alemao. ldquo;There is nothing wrong in Emeka rsquo;s coaching methods but the players had complained about the Nigerian World Cupper rsquo;s arrogant ways. They were not happy training under him, rdquo; Alemao said. 
    Ghosal through

Adhiban, who hails from Tamil Nadu, now has a clear one point lead in the tournament and in all probability will emerge as the champion.

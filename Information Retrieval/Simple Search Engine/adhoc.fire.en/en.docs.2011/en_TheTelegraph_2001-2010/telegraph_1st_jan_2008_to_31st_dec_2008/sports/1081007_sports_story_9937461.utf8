	Madrid: Manuel Fernandes second-half goal gave Valencia a 1-0 victory at Valladolid on Sunday to reclaim top spot in the Spanish league. While Sevilla used an emphatic win to stay with the leaders, Raul Gonzalez twice rallied Real Madrid for a 2-2 draw against Espanyol.         
	Portugal midfielder Fernandes took David Villas backheel pass and sent the ball low into the net in the 54th minute. The win gives Valencia 16 points and they lead Villarreal on goal difference.         
	Earlier, Sevilla trounced Athletic Bilbao 4-0 for their third straight league win to trail the leaders by two points.         
	Sevilla have 14 points after an impressive start, while Madrid joined FC Barcelona at 13.         
	Raul Tamudo and Luis Garcia twice gave Espanyol the lead but Raul replied for Real each time to stretch Madrids unbeaten streak to seven games in all competitions and deny Espanyol their first win at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in 12 years.         
	Juanma Mata, who had a volley saved in the 23rd, nearly added a goal in the 73rd but his hard shot from just inside the area rolled wide.         
	In Sundays other league games, it was: Getafe 2, Almeria 2; Recreativo Huelva 0, Malaga 4; Mallorca 0, Sporting Gijon 2; Osasuna 0, Racing Santander 1; and Deportivo La Coruna 1, Numancia 0.

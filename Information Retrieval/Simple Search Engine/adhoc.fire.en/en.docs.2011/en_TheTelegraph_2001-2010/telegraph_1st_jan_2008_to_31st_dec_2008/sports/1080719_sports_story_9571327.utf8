The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England on the back foot
                                                                                                                                                                                                       England on the back foot
                  Morne Morkel appeals for the wicket of Alastair Cook at Headingley on Friday                     
	Leeds: Pace bowlers Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn claimed four wickets apiece to help dismiss England for 203 on the Day I of the second Test at Headingley on Friday.         
	Morkel took four for 52 and Steyn four for 76 before the home team hit back in the final session to reduce the Proteas to 101 for three at the close.         
	Andrew Flintoff, in the thick of the action on his Test comeback after 18 months, took a catch and a wicket.         
	Hashim Amla (18) and Ashwell Prince (9) were the not out batsmen as South Africa trailed England by 102 runs. The first match in the four-match series at Lords was drawn.         
	Amla was almost the fourth man out when his leading edge was caught by a diving Michael Vaughan at mid-off off Flintoff. But after reaching the end of his walk back to the pavilion, he was instructed by captain Graeme Smith to wait for the third umpires decision, which gave him a reprieve.

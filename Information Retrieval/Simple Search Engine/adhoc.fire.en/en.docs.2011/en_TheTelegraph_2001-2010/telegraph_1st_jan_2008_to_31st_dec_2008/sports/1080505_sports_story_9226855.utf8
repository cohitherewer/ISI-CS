	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League (IPL) on Sunday announced that it had fined the Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Ishant Sharma about ten percent of his match fees for abusing ground equipment.         
	According to a press release, Clive Lloyd, the match referee hauled up Ishant under level 1 (clause 2) offence as per the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Code of Conduct after the Delhi pacer kicked down the stumps during the Kings XI Punjab and the Kolkata Knight Riders match at Mohali on Saturday.         
	The IPL is being played as per the ICC playing conditions and rules and is set to follow the guidelines in letter and in spirit.         
	The IPL had earlier booted out Mumbai Indians off-spinner Harbhajan Singh for slapping Kings XI Punjabs bowler Sreesanth at the same venue.

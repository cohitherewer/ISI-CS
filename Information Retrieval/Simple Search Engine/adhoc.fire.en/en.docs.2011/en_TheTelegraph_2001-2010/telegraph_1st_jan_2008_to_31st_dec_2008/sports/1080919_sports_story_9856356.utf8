The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting does a volte-face
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ponting does a volte-face
  - Circumstances in India and Pakistan are different, says Aussie captain             Ricky Ponting                           
	Melbourne: Captain Ricky Ponting did a volte-face on Thursday, defending Cricket Australias decision to go ahead with the India tour despite recent bomb blasts in New Delhi. The Australian captain said the department of foreign affairs and trade and independent security experts have given them green signal.         
	Terming the decision serious, Ponting told an Australian daily: Department of foreign affairs and trade have obviously been in very close contact with CA over the last few days.         
	As we all know and has been outlined already, these are very different circumstances between India and Pakistan right at the moment and the Board has made that very clear.         
	He added that both as captain and player of the team he is comfortable to visit India on the advice of CA and the Australian Cricketers Association.         
	The Australian captains comments followed an outburst from Pakistan alleging favouritism by Cricket Australia in proceeding with a tour of India after twice refusing to tour Pakistan this year because of safety and security concerns.         
	Ricky Ponting had earlier said that nothing was set in stone and the decision could change depending on the security situations.         
	Anything could happen tomorrow, things change very quickly in the world right at the moment, Ponting had told reporters in Canberra.         
	Cricket Australia will continue to be in touch and the government will continue to be in touch and Cricket Australia will keep us players and the players association in the loop on a daily, if not hourly basis, he had added.         
	CA had declared on Tuesday that the tour would go ahead as scheduled despite Saturdays serial blasts in New Delhi.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had also not paid much attention to Ricky Pontings comments on Wednesday that their tour of India was still not confirmed.         
	BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah had made it clear that individual views dont count in such matters.         
	We dont go by what Ponting or any other individual has to say. CA has said that the tour will go ahead as scheduled... As far as we are concerned, that is the final word, he had said.         
	Shah had also said that the CA had not asked for any special security measures.         
	The normal procedures that are followed with each visiting side will be adhered to. Neither have they approached us for additional security after the blasts nor have we got in touch with the concerned authorities for extra security cover.

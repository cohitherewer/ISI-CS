 Vermeulen cleared
 Harare: Former Zimbabwe Test player Mark Vermeulen has been cleared of arson attacks on the Zimbabwe cricket board rsquo;s headquarters after a court found he was suffering psychiatric problems, his lawyer said. Eric Matinenga said Mishrod Guvamombe, the presiding magistrate at Wednesday rsquo;s hearing in Harare, had delivered a ldquo;special verdict rdquo; which meant Vermeulen had not been in control of his actions when he carried out the attacks. ldquo;A special verdict is retained when a person commits an offence while they are not well up there. rdquo;

 Malik move
 Lahore: The Cold War between captain Shoaib Malik and leadership aspirant Shahid Afridi came to the forefront when the captain took an inexplicable decision to promote Fawad Alam ahead of the allrounder who is just one six away from creating a new world record. Afridi needed just one six to hold the record for most number of sixes in Wednesday rsquo;s fourth ODI against Zimbabwe but Malik left spectators disappointed. The crowd was expecting Afridi to march in after Malik was dismissed with 37 runs still required for victory. But surprisingly, Alam marched in.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     ICC okays umpire review system
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricketers could soon be able to challenge decisions made by umpires during Test matches. The International Cricket Councils cricket committee announced Tuesday that a trial on an umpire review system will be used in a Test series this year, including the hawk-eye technology used in tennis.         
	Under the proposal, each team would be limited to a maximum of three unsuccessful challenges per innings, the ICC said in a statement.         
	The committee also stressed the importance of Test cricket amid a boom in Twenty20 competitions during its two-day meeting.         
	The committee was chaired by former India captain Sunil Gavaskar and included former Australia captain Mark Taylor, South Africa coach Mickey Arthur and ex-West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding.         
	In March, the ICC board approved the trial of an umpire review system during a Test series to take place this year. Following a lengthy discussion on this subject, the committee agreed a proposed set of playing conditions for the trial. The main elements of the playing conditions should include:         
	 Umpires should still be permitted to refer line decisions or boundaries to the third umpire as normal without a player requesting him to refer that decision         
	 The players should be permitted to ask the on-field umpire to review any aspect of any other decision in consultation with the third umpire         
	 Each team should be limited to a maximum of three unsuccessful referrals per innings         
	 The process should take the form and order of: on-field umpire gives his decision; affected batsman or fielding sides captain asks the umpire to review that decision; the on-field umpire(s) and third umpire consult; the on-field umpire gives his final decision         
	 The committee recommended that Hawk Eye technology could be used by the third umpire but only for the purposes of determining the actual path of the ball up until the point that it struck the batsman and not the predictor function of the technology         
	The ICC cricket committee has also recommended the following changes to the playing conditions:         
	 Substitute fielders should only be permitted in cases of injury, illness or other wholly acceptable reasons. It was the opinion of the committee that wholly acceptable reasons should be limited to extreme circumstances and should not include what is commonly referred to as a comfort break         
	 In ODIs, the timing of one Powerplay should be decided by the batting side and three fielders should be permitted outside the fielding restriction circles for both the second and third Powerplays         
	 The on-field umpires should be permitted to consult the third umpire as to whether a catch has been taken cleanly before making the final decision themselves         
	 The bowl-out in the event of a tie in the ICC World Twenty20 or ICC Champions Trophy should be replaced by a one-over-per-team play-off         
	 These proposed amendments to the playing conditions, if approved, will come into effect at the ICC Champions Trophy 2008, which will be held in Pakistan from 11 to 28 September.

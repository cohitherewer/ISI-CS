	Jakarta: Jeev Milkha Singh missed his second European Tour title and settled for second place after a final hole bogey dashed his hopes at the Indonesia Open on Sunday.         
	Jeev held the lead for a while but bogeys on the 16th and 18th holes allowed Chiles Felipe Aguilar (68) to clinch the title and bagging $200,000, at 18-under 262. Though a second European Tour title slipped through his fingers, Jeev (67) was richer by $1,33,330 after finishing second at 263.         
	Even after the bogey on the 16th, Jeev seemed on his way to force a sudden-death play-off with Aguilar but dropping another shot on the closing hole put paid to his hopes.         
	Had Jeev been able to lift the trophy, it would have been Indias second European Tour title in as many weeks after S.S.P. Chowrasia won the Indian Masters in Delhi last week.         
	Jeev began the day trailing Aguilar by two shots but was quickly on the charge starting with the sixth hole where he sank in for an eagle.         
	Thailands Prom Meesawat returned with a 67 to share third place with South Africas James Kamte while New Zealands Mark Brown and Joost Luiten of the Netherlands were tied for fifth on 264.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Jyoti Randhawa (266) signed off with a sensational round of 62 to finish tied seventh, one shot ahead of Arjun Atwal (67) who was tied 10th.

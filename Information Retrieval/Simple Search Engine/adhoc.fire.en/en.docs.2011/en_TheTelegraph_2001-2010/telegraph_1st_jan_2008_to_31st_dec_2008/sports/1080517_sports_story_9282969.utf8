The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella set for 200th race
                                                                                                                                                                                                         Fisichella set for 200th race
                  Giancarlo Fisichella                     
	New Delhi: Force India driver Giancarlo Fisichella is all set to make his 200th Formula One appearance when he hits the track at the Monaco Grand Prix next Sunday.         
	By the end of this season, Fisichella, who will become the ninth driver to reach this rare milestone, will move up to overall fifth in the rankings of all-time starts.         
	In the course of the current season he will overtake Jean Alesi, Nelson Piquet sr, Andrea de Cesaris and Gerhard Berger.         
	The Italian looked back on his debut in Australia in March 1996.         
	It was interesting what happened. Ten days before the Australian GP, I was a Test driver for Minardi and was also driving in the International Touring Car Championship and the DTM for Alfa Romeo.         
	Minardi called me and said Giancarlo get ready, you are coming to Australia. Bring your helmet and bring your overalls.         
	I said, Ah thats nice, Im happy to come and see Australia and see the first race. He replied, no no, its not to see the first race, youre going to do it! I couldnt believe it and asked if he was joking, he recalled.         
	I was really shocked because 10 days before the race I really didnt expect to race in Australia, but the team had had a problem with a Japanese driver who didnt pay. It was bad for him, but I was really, really happy, he said.         
	At 35, and now in his 13th season, Fisichella feels as motivated as ever. I dont think Ive changed much, but I hope I am a better driver than when I started. Ive learned quite a lot, how to manage the race, how to manage the qualifying session, and to put more attention on testing and talking with the engineers and mechanics, he said.         
	When Fisichella signed for Force India, it was the sixth time he had changed teams. Adrian Sutil is the 11th teammate he has had during his F1 career.         
	The others were Pedro Lamy, Ralf Schumacher, Alex Wurz, Jenson Button, Takuma Sato, Ralph Firman, Felipe Massa, Zsolt Baumgartner, Fernando Alonso and Heikki Kovalainen.         
	Fisichella has won three Grands Prix so far. The first victory was with Jordan in Brazil in 2003. His two other wins were with Renault in Australia in 2005, and in Malaysia the next year. Both were achieved from pole position.         
	He has scored a total of 18 podium finishes, including six second places and nine third spots. Three of his second places came behind Michael Schumacher (Belgium 1997, Canada 1998, Brazil 2000), two behind Mika Hakkinen (Monaco 1998, Canada 1999), and one behind Kimi Raikkonen (Japan 2005).

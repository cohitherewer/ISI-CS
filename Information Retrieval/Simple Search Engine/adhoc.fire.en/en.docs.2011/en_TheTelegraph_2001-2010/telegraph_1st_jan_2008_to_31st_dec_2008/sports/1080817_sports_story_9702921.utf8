The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Norms to be fixed on Saturday
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Norms to be fixed on Saturday
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: Saturdays working committee meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will, among other things, decide on the criteria for appointing paid selectors from 2008-09  specifically after next months AGM  and the panel to scout for those most suited.         
	Thats the plan, as of now, the chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking exactly a week before that meeting in Mumbai, he added: There was no agreement on the norms when the decision to bring about a change was taken Some favoured a certain number of Test and ODI appearances which had to be mandatory, others held a different view That should be settled in a weeks time         
	Prof. Shetty confirmed that the zonal system would continue. Also that both the senior and junior selection committees would be paid. Everybody will be covered and its going to be a full-time job for each one of the selectors.         
	According to the top official, the selectors could have a maximum tenure of four years. The initial appointment, however, would be for 24 months.         
	The BCCI has, of course, already amended its constitution to allow for the change in a critical area of its functioning.         
	Unless Dilip Vengsarkar and his colleagues are asked to pick the squad for the first Test against Australia (in Bangalore, from October 9), that task would be the paid senior selection committees first.         
	Baptism by fire, really.         
	Incidentally, the Pakistan Cricket Board introduced the system of paid selectors after a disastrous 2007 World Cup. Not that it has made a difference on the field.         
	Its to be seen whether the change being effected by the BCCI, after much dilly-dallying, is more rewarding.

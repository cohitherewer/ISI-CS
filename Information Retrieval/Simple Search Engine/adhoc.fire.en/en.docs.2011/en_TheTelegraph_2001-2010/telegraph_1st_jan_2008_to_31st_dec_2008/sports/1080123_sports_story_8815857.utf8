                                                   Maria ousts Justine in straight sets

           
	Melbourne: Reputations count for little in Grand Slam tennis as champion Serena Williams and world No. 1 Justine Henin found on Tuesday, both put to the sword at the quarter final stage of the Australian Open. 
    
	Henin had not lost a match since Wimbledon 2007  a run of 32 matches  but was brought to her knees under the night sky by a rampant Maria Sharapova 6-4, 6-0. It was the first time the Belgian had lost a set 0-6 since 2002. 
    
	Its funny because I felt like I was in my own bubble today, the statuesque Sharapova beamed. 
    
	Its amazing when you go out on the court and feel youre doing the right things to beat such an amazing player as her. Its just incredible. 
    
	American powerhouse Serena had earlier relinquished her title with little more than a whimper when she was jettisoned 6-3, 6-4 by Serbias wounded animal Jelena Jankovic. 
    
	I had some issues but I dont like to make excuses, Serena said. Definitely a problem all through the day, but nothing life-threatening, so its fine...I felt I was gonna do better than this but I guess I was wrong... cant always be right. 
    
	Her misery was compounded when she lost in the womens doubles paired with sister Venus. 
    
	In mens draw, Rafael Nadal continued his assault on the first Grand Slam of the season with a muscular win over Finn Jarkko Nieminen. 
    
	The Spanish powerhouse wore down Nieminen for his 7-5, 6-3, 6-1 victory and a place in the Australian Open semi-finals for the first time. 
    
	The three-time French Open champion saved two set points before winning the first set and gradually turned the screw. 
    
	Its the third match that I have had set points against me in the first set so Im very happy about (coming through) that, Nadal said. 
    
	Nadal next meets unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who upset 14th seed Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 7-5, 6-0, 7-6 to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final. 
    
	With Serena already defeated, Henin took to the court a strong favourite to win the title she bagged in 2004. 
    
	Her fifth-seeded foe was in an ebullient mood, however, smashing 30 winners as she took a tight first set and ripped through the second to line up a semi-final against Jankovic. 
    
	Runner-up to Serena in Melbourne last year, Sharapova had lost six of her eight meetings with Henin but the results record counted for nothing. 
    
	Herself a former world No. 1, Sharapova ran amok and left Henin wondering what might have been. 
    
	I think that I have no excuse. You know, she won the match. Shes been the best, Henin said. I can tell I wasnt at my best level, and thats for sure. But the story is she won the match, and Im going back home now. So its kind of a disappointment for sure. Its very hard to be at your best level all the time, and Ill have to think about that and build again for the future. 
    
	Three-time champion Serena was out-fought and out-thought on Rod Laver Arena, beaten 6-3, 6-4. 
    
	Soon afterwards she, along with sister Venus, was out of the womens doubles too, following a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 quarter final defeat by Chinas Yan Zi and Zheng Jie. 
    
	For Jankovic, who is recovering from surgery and plagued by niggling injuries, the 99-minute victory was sweet revenge for last years fourth-round defeat at Melbourne Park. 
    
	Im like a wounded animal, I still keep going, the third seed smiled. The most important thing is that I fight on the court, and I always give my best and I never give up. 
    
	Serena is known to be one of the most fearsome fighters in sport, but under clear blue skies she was impotent. Her shots lacked punch, her serve lacked bite and her tactics unravelled. (Reuters)

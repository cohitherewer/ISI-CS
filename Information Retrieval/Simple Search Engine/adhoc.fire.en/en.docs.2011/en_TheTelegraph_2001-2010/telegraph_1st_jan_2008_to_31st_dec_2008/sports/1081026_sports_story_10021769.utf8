The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not easy being   a Bagan player now: Bencharifa
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Not easy being   a Bagan player now: Bencharifa
            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal scorer Syed Rahim Nabi                                 
	Calcutta: One could sense the pressure on Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa as he walked in for the post-match press conference with a sombre face. His team have managed a meagre three points from five games and are still without a win.         
	Though Bencharifa insisted that hes a professional and the result wont affect his or the teams morale, he couldnt help but admit that Saturdays derby draw against East Bengal was disappointing.         
	He said: I am very disappointed with the result, but the point is not bad for the long run. It was after all, the first game that I had my full team, including all three foreigners. I am disappointed with the result but not with the team, he clarified.         
	While asserting his faith on the players and club officials, Bencharifa repeatedly spoke about the pressure on his team. Theres tremendous pressure on the players. Its not easy to be a Mohun Bagan player on the pitch at the moment, the Moroccan spelt out.         
	When asked about Marcos Perreiras contribution, Bencharifa said: Theres no doubt that Marcos has quality Its just that Marcos, Bhaichung and Habibur were all lacking match sharpness.         
	The Bagan coach singled out over confidence as a possible factor for not capitalising on the one-man advantage that his side had over the opposition. We got overconfident after East Bengal were reduced to 10 men, while they motivated themselves to do well, Bencharifa signed off.         
	Bagan skipper Bhaichung Bhutia dismissed Surkumar Singhs shove as something that happened in the heat of the moment.         
	Bhaichung, at least, seemed more hopeful of his sides chances than his coach did. Other big teams havent started very well either, so theres still hope for us I can guarantee you this much that the I-League will be won by a team from Bengal this year, Bhaichung signed off.         
	The man at the helm of East Bengal, Stanley Rozario seemed thoroughly pleased with his first derby outing.         
	It was a fantastic experience, the spectators encouraged us so much And I am satisfied with a point. Rozario was full of praise for his team and singled out Yusif Yakubu for special mention. He (Yakubu) was outstanding, it was almost a one man show!         
	Asked if he was satisfied with his teams tally of seven points from five matches, Rozario answered: 10 points would have been better.

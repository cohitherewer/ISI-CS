The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I did not select the squad: Gurbux
                                                   I did not select the squad: Gurbux
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: National selector Gurbux Singh has said he was unhappy with the squad that took part in the Olympic qualifiers in Santiago.         
	The Calcutta-based selector said he could not intervene in the selection process because he didnt attend the meeting that finalised the 30-member probables for the national camp in January.         
	Gurbux had earlier made his surprise clear at the exclusion of in-form Arjun Halappa and forward Sandeep Singh in the Santiago-bound squad.         
	While Player of the PHL Halappa was ignored, Sandeep was there among the probables.         
	The latter, however, did not attend the national camp that preceded the five-match Test series against Belgium in Chennai. From the camp, 24 were picked for the Belgium series that India won 3-1.         
	My intervention (after having not attended the selection committee meeting) would have created controversy. So I preferred to stay away I had expressed my surprise during that time though, the member of the 1964 Olympic gold medal-winning team told The Telegraph. We had authorised coach Joaquim Carvalho to select the squad for the qualifier which was picked after a practice tour in Australia.         
	In any sport, you cannot include a player from outside if he isnt selected for the camp, he added.         
	A saddened Singh, however, admitted mere presence of the duo would not have ensured a Beijing berth.         
	Im not saying that if the duo were there we would have won Nobody knows that. But unlike Carvalho, whos blaming the umpires, I feel we played badly after having conceded two goals in first 10 minutes, said the head coach of the 1976 team that finished seventh in the Olympic Games.         
	On whether he should own up and quit, Gurbux said: You want me to resign? Am I responsible for the defeat?         
	When India failed in the ICC World Cup in the West Indies, did the cricket selectors resign? If Ive done something wrong, I would definitely quit. Lets not start the blame game. In India we wake after something happens. We should instead look ahead and take lessons from this.

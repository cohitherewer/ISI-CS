The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik could land in trouble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Malik could land in trouble
                      
	 Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik could be in trouble for his comments that he enjoyed playing in the IPL more than the recent home series against Bangladesh with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) looking into whether he had violated the PCB code of conduct. Malik, who plays for Delhi DareDevils in the IPL, has also drawn flak from the media here over another comment at a TV show on Friday that he got more love from the people of India than what he got in his own country. A senior PCB official said they couldnt do much about what was a personal opinion from the national captain but they were looking into his statement where he had devalued the international series against Bangladesh. If it comes under the preview of the code of conduct then certainly we will think of taking some action against him, the official said.  
	DareDevils fined  
	 Calcutta: Delhi DareDevils were fined $500 for slow over-rate during their match against Chennai Super Kings in Chennai on Friday, says A Staff Reporter. According to a media release, the match referee would decide the fine.  
	Md Yousuf restrained  
	 Mumbai: An arbiter on Saturday passed an interim order restraining Pakistan player Mohammed Yousuf from participating in the IPL, an Indian Cricket League (ICL) lawyer said. Justice (retd) B.P. Saraf passed an interim order restraining Yousuf from participating in IPL in any manner, said ICLs lawyer Hitesh Jain. Jain said now there would be a final hearing, which is likely to commence in July.   
	Two ties may be shifted  
	 Mumbai: Two IPL matches scheduled for May 14 and 16 at the DY Patil stadium in Navi Mumbai are likely to be shifted to the Wankhede Stadium, according to BCCI sources. The Mumbai franchise owners (Reliance Industries) want them to be shifted and the D Y Patil authorities do not have any objections, they added.         
	Mumbai Indians, the team representing the home franchise owners, are to play against Chennai Super Kings on May 14 and then clash with Kolkata Knight Riders on May 16.   
	Malhotra surprised   
	 Calcutta: Former India cricketer Ashok Malhotra has expressed surprise at being appointed the batting coach of the National Cricket Academy (NCA), says A Staff Reporter.         
	Malhotra, who held this assignment earlier in the Bangalore-based academy for two years, said: I dont know what youre talking about         
	Ive not any received any communication, so I cant say much about this.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sosa: Void hard to fill
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sosa: Void hard to fill
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sosa                           
	Calcutta: Bayern Munich medio Jose Ernesto Sosa believes Oliver Kahns quitting will create a big vacuum.         
	Sosa, who spoke to The Telegraph before Tuesdays friendly against Mohun Bagan, said: Like every other football fan in the world, I would like to reiterate that he is one of the greatest players I have ever seen in my life. I have seen him from close quarters and respect and admire him a lot.         
	He is not only a great goalkeeper but also a nice human being. And his absence will create a big gap in the club, the 22-year old Argentine said.         
	Yeah we have good replacements in the form of Michael Rensing and Brend Deherer. There will be a vacuum after his retirement. Both Rensing and Deherer have to go a long way to match Kahn. It will take some time, he added.         
	Asked how much he enjoyed his stay here, Sosa, who started playing soccer at an early age of five, said: I learnt a lot about Calcutta on the Internet before coming here. Its an amazing city I liked the joyride on river Hooddggghhleee (Hooghly) and found the city quite interesting. Next time I am here I would like to visit other places also, the Argentine, who made his debut for the national team in April 2007, said.

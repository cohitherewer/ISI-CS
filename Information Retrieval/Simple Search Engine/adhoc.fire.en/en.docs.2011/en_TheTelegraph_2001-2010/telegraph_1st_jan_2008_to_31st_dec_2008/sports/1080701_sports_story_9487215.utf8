The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irfan is fit, says manager
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Irfan is fit, says manager
  - Afridi, Wahab set to be axed       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Irfan Pathan                                 
	Karachi: Irfan Pathan chose to present himself at the optional nets on Monday, in the lead-up to Wednesdays Super Four clash against Pakistan, and shaped up well.         
	He looks fit and will be available for selection (for the first time in this Asia Cup), Team India manager Arindam Ganguly told The Telegraph.         
	Irfan has missed three matches owing to a right side strain/stiffness.         
	Its to be seen whether the allrounder will make a comeback at brother Yusufs expense or Rudra Pratap Singh will have to sit out.         
	Meanwhile, according to well-placed sources, Shahid Afridi will finally be dropped. Theres also talk that Wahab Riaz will be out of the XI.         
	While Umar Guls replacement Abdur Rauf could well take Riazs place, either Fawad Alam or opener Nasir Jamshed will come in for Afridi.         
	If Jamshed makes the XI, then captain Shoaib Malik will bat down the order.

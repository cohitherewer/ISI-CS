The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni mum on Vijay
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Dhoni mum on Vijay
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Murali Vijay Krishnas surprise call-up has raised a few eyebrows. How come this rookie in the Indian team is a question many are asking on the eve of the final Test, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not fielding any of those.         
	When asked whether he had a say in the selection of the Tamil Nadu player as a replacement for the prolific Gautam Gambhir, Dhoni evaded the question.         
	I dont want to talk about selection matters. If you have anything to ask, please ask the selection committee chairman, Dhoni told reporters.         
	Dhonis reply could be interpreted to mean that either he wants to strictly follow protocol or that he would have preferred a seasoned opener for a series-deciding Test.         
	Interestingly, rival skipper Ricky Ponting had this to say when asked how the Aussies assessed Vijay: We dont have any video footage. All that we know is he scored a double hundred in his last match. But I expected Wasim Jaffer to come in. He did well against us (made 93 in second innings) in the warm-up match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raleng the key man
                                                                                                                                                                                             Raleng the key man
            JAYDEEP BASU            Raleng                           
	Srinagar: Gone are the days when the armed forces in India used to produce the best of footballers. Who can forget the mercurial Puran Bahadur, the first Indian to score a hattrick in international football or the stylish Moloy Lahiri, whose individual brilliance once transformed the National Defence Academy cadres to a crack side in the 1950s.         
	On Sunday, at the Bakshi Stadium here, Services will try to regain their lost glory when they cross swords with defending champions Punjab in the final of the Santosh Trophy.         
	This time Services can dream of regaining the title for the first time in 48 years. They have the man in Sochungmi Raleng, who has created quite a stir by scoring 13 goals in the tournament so far.         
	The Manipuri striker has struck against every team he has played here, including Punjab in the quarter final league, which Services won 2-1. No doubt Raleng has turned out to be the star of the tournament.         
	The two Calcutta majors are already running after him for the next season and he, too, has expressed his willingness.         
	All the state team coaches here are unanimous in opinion that the youngster should immediately be called for the national camp.         
	Defending champions Punjab are definitely nervous about Raleng and are chalking out a special plan to keep the striker under check. Be sure, Raleng will not touch the ball against us, said Punjab coach Jagir Singh.         
	On Paper, Punjab are a more compact side while Services would rely more on individuals like Raleng and Shaji DSilva.         
	Meanwhile, a series of grenade attacks in the city by extremist forces on Saturday has forced the organisers to tighten security in and around the Bakshi Stadium for the final.

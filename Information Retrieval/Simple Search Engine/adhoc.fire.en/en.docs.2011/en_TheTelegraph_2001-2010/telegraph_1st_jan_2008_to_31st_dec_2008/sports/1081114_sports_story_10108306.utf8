The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra looking to spread wings vs AI
                                                                                                                                                                                           Mahindra looking to spread wings vs AI
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United will be looking to shrug aside injury problems as they seek a morale-boosting win when they take on Air India in the eighth round of the I-League at the Cooperage here on Friday.         
	With just two wins from seven matches, Mahindra have hardly done justice to their reputation this season. And they would be handicapped by the absence of India footballer Ajayan as well as his midfield partner Mohammed Rafi. Besides, overseas signing Djidjia Douhou Pierre is also doubtful with a right thigh strain.         
	Air India too have fitness concerns. Soccor Velho, the fulcrum in the midfield, is out with two yellow cards while defender Napoleon Singh (calf muscle), forward Kailash Patil (hamstring) and the man in form, Michael Tayo (ankle), are all highly doubtful.

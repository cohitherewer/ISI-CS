	New Delhi: The runners-up finish at the Miami Masters failed to lift Mahesh Bhupathis doubles standings in the ATP ladder as he remained static at 13th even as his former partner Leander Paes tumbled four spots to 24th in the list issued on Monday.         
	Bhupathi reached the final in Miami last week partnering Bahamas Mark Knowles but lost to defending champions and top seeds Mark and Bob Bryan. The Indian ace has 3050 points now.         
	Meanwhile, in the WTA rankings, Sania Mirza, nursing a wrist injury that forced her to pull out of the Miami Masters, retained her rank on 31st position with 917 points.

	Houghton is simply lying: Nayeem  New Delhi: The present and the former national coaches mdash; Bob Houghton and Syed Nayeemuddin mdash; were involved in a bitter battle of words on Monday with the latter calling the British coach a liar, who hasn rsquo;t done anything for Indian football in the last two years, says Our Special Correspondent.  The controversy started a day after India lost to Maldives in the SAFF Cup final in Colombo. Describing India rsquo;s defeat as shocking, Nayeemuddin publicly called for Houghton rsquo;s resignation. Reacting to Nayeemuddin rsquo;s statement, Houghton said that he was surprised by the Dronacharya rsquo;s volte face.  ldquo;I don rsquo;t know why he is attacking me, rdquo; Houghton said. ldquo;He is the same person, who met during the Nehru Cup and said he wanted to come and watch my training and learn from my training style. He even asked me whether he can become my assistant, rdquo; the British coach said.  ldquo;Houghton is simply lying, rdquo; Nayeemuddin said. ldquo;I never told him that I wanted to become his assistant, rdquo; Nayeemuddin said. ldquo;All I said that I wanted to learn from him. rdquo;    
	 Jeev, Shiv tied 21st   Paris: Delhi lad Shiv Kapur signed off with four-under 67 to finish 21st, a place he shares with, among others compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh (69) after the final round of the Open de France Alstom here.  Fellow Indian Jyoti Randhawa returned 69 to finish a lowly tied 66th at 10-over 294. Of the Indian trio in fray, Shiv made his mark most and could have finished even higher but for that last hole bogey. Spain rsquo;s Pablo Larrazabal won the title with a final round of 67 for a 269 total.    
	 Daniel Chopra tied 17th  Grand Blanc (US): Daniel Chopra rsquo;s hope of his second PGA tour title this year went up in smoke with an erratic final round of 75 and the Swede of Indian origin eventually had to settle for a disappointing tied 17th at the Buick Open.  Instead, it was Kenny Perry (269), who produced a scintillating six-under 66 to walk away with his second title of the season.

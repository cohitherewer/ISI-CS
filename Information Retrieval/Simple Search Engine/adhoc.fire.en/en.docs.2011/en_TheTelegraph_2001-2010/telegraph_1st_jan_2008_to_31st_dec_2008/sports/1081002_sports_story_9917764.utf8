The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella happy with Grand Prix effort 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fisichella happy with Grand Prix effort 
                      
	Singapore: He couldnt get the elusive first points for Force India yet again despite running as high as second at one stage but far from being disappointed, Giancarlo Fisichella says he is thrilled to have at least made a mark at the Formula Ones first-ever night race  the Singapore Grand Prix.         
	It was good to be third, especially starting from the pitlane. I was able to keep guys who were much quicker than me behind me. We were a little better than we showed in the qualifying session, Fisichella said.         
	I was quite confident, I was pushing like crazy to do my best. It was good, so Im happy about how it went, he added.         
	After his single planned stop, he dropped down the order, but the anticipated break with another safety car didnt come in the chaotic race that was marred by a couple of crashes.         
	By the time it did  ironically after teammate Adrian Sutil crashed the other Force India other drivers had pitted and felled to the flag, so there was no benefit for Fisichella.         
	He also struggled with low tyre temperatures after the restart, which cost some time, and eventually crossed the line in 14th place.         
	We changed the strategy to one stop, which was much slower. It was very hard to keep the tyre temperatures warm, so it was so difficult for me.         
	If we had the second safety car earlier, we could maybe have got in the points. But it was an interesting race to be there for a while in second position.         
	I really enjoyed the weekend, so Im looking forward to going back to Singapore next year, he said.         
	Force Indias next stop is Fuji, where Fisichella was fifth for Renault.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton is leading the Formula One drivers championship race at the moment.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 433-run loss for East
                                                   433-run loss for East
                      
	Rajkot: Defending champions North Zone defeated East Zone by a huge 433-run margin to enter the final of the Duleep Trophy here on Thursday.         
	North secured five points and are leading the table with 10 points.         
	Resuming at their overnight 28 for one, East Zone, which managed just 143 in their first essay, once again caved in against the disciplined bowling of VRV Singh and leg-spinner Amit Mishra and were bowled out for 243.         
	They were set an unlikely target of 677 to win the match after North Zone scored 360 and 459 for two in their two innings.         
	Only Anustup Mazumdar 82 (150 balls, 14x4) and Manish Vardhan 83 (132 balls, 17x4) put up some resistance.         
	The duo came together after departure of East Zone skipper Shiv Sundar Das (33 runs off 70b, 6x4) and raised hopes of a draw by adding 168 for the fourth wicket stand.         
	But the departure of Mazumdar, who was run out, triggered a batting collapse as East Zone lost their last five wickets for the addition of just five runs.         
	Niranjan Behera did not bat in the second inning too due to a sustained fracture.         
	VRV Singh who did not bowl on Wednesday because of fever, on Thursday returned with three for 46, while leg-spinner Mishra took two for 37.           (PTI)

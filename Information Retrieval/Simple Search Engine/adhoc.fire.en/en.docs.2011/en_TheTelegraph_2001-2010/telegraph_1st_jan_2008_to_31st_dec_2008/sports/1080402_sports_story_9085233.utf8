                                                     SA plan chin music for Viru
                  Virender Sehwag                     
	Ahmedabad: Still smarting from the caning their bowlers received from Virender Sehwag in the series opening Test in Chennai, the South Africans are planning to pepper the Indian opener with short balls into his body and cramp him for space in the second Test starting here on Thursday.         
	Proteas coach Mickey Arthur, while maintaining that Sehwag played a fantastic innings, said the Delhi marauder, who scored the fastest triple hundred in Tests in the drawn first Test, would be in for some chin music in the second.         
	We had a look at Sehwags fantastic knock. We saw that he played his first pull shot after scoring 312. He cuts the ball very well. We plan to target him with short balls into his body and cramp him for space and see how he takes it, Arthur told reporters after his teams first practice session in Motera on Tuesday.         
	Asked how his faster bowlers would make the plan work if the wickets do not respond, Arthur said, we will have to wait and watch for the first ball to be bowled. At the moment, it looks good with some grass on it. But it may be a bit slow. The heat is dry and we are used to similar conditions at home, like in Cape Town and Johannesburg.         
	Arthur also tried to put behind the issue of the SG balls that is being used in the Test series and said since the team has been here for 15 days the players have hopefully become used to it.         
	Its a contentious issue. I cant say whether we have got used to them. We have been here for two weeks and hopefully got used to it. It would be interesting to see how the ball behaves here on the lush green outfield, whether it reverses. Hopefully the pitch will help the seamers, he said.         
	Praising his batsmen for their fine display in Chennai, Arthur said the Proteas line-up had gained from their previous tours to the subcontinent and was now comfortable playing spin.         
	We have played a lot in the subcontinent. We have kept the same top six in the batting order. We are comfortable playing spin bowling, he said.         
	Arthur termed his teams bowling attack as well balanced.         
	We have a very balanced attack. We have also a very good spinner in Paul Harris who is probably the most under-rated spinner. He was a bit nervous in Chennai, he said.         
	Arthur maintained that the visitors were not under any psychological pressure after the blitz from Sehwag.         
	We have probably taken more positives from the first Test. The top order performed. We have bowlers who can take 20 wickets, he said.         
	Arthur said in Yuvraj Singh, who was benched in Chennai, and Mohammed Kaif, brought into the squad here as replacement for the injured Sachin Tendulkar, the Indian team had enough reserve strength but the point of interest would be whether the home team will field five frontline bowlers.         
	Yuvraj was waiting in the wings and Kaif, i have noted, has scored lot of runs in domestic cricket. They have lot of back-up.         
	It will be interesting to see whether India play five bowlers with (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and an allrounder (Irfan Pathan) coming in at six and seven or six batsmen (like in Chennai), he said.

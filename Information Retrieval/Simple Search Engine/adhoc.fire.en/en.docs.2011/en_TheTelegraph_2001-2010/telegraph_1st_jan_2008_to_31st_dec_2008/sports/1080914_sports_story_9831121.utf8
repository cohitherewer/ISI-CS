            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal ended all speculation over Manoranjan Bhattacharjees future at the club on Saturday by appointing Stanley Rozario, assistant to national coach Bob Houghton, as the new club coach after Bhattacharjeee resigned citing personal reasons.         
	Bhattacharjee, who has been regularly abused by a section of the East Bengal supporters for the under-par performance of the club this season, tendered his resignation this afternoon.         
	The red-and-gold coach, peeved at the supporters ire, had hinted at resigning on Thursday after his side drew 1-1 with archrivals Mohun Bagan, ending third- in the Sahara CFL Premier Division.         
	Rozario, who has an AFC A coaching licence, will officially take charge on Monday, Majumdar said.         
	I am a professional coach and was looking for an assignment after I quit the Indian Army last month. Vasco club, too, were talking to me but when the offer came from East Bengal, I decided to take up the challenge, Rozario told The Telegraph from Bangalore.         
	Asked if Rozario would be able to handle the pressure of coaching a high-profile club like East Bengal, Majumdar said: We do not want a high profile coach. We want an effective coach who can deliver the goods.         
	According to reports, East Bengal are planning a seven-day residential camp under the new coach at the SAI, Eastern Centre from Tuesday.

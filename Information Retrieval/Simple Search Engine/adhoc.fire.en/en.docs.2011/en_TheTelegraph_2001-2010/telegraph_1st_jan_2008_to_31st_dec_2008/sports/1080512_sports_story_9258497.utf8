	Colombo: India clinched their fourth successive womens cricket Asia Cup title after thrashing Sri Lanka by a massive 117-run in the final at the Welagedara Stadium in Kurunegala on Sunday.         
	The two teams clashed in the final for the fourth successive time and once again it was the Indians who emerged champions.         
	Player of the match Asha Rawat fell short of a well-deserved hundred by three runs, while skipper Mithali Raj once again starred with a 66-run knock to help India put on 260 for seven in 50 overs.         
	The defending champions then bundled out the hosts for 83 in 35.2 overs with Pujare Seema and Neetu David picking up three wickets apiece.         
	Electing to bat after winning the toss, the Indians were dealt an early blow with opener Jaya Sharma departing in the second over without scoring a run.         
	Rawat then joined Kavita Jain (28) to steady the innings before the latter was also sent back by S. de Alwis with 75 on board. Mithali and Rawat then made sure there were no further hiccups until the 38th over as the two steered the Indians towards a big score.         
	While Rawat struck 12 boundaries and a six in her 114-ball knock, Mithali hit six fours in her 72-ball stay at the crease.         
	Amita Sharma also chipped in with a quick-fire 31-ball 50 to take India to what eventually turned out a winning score.         
	Four of the Lankan batsmen were sent back for nought and only two managed to register double-digit scores with P. Kumarihami being their top scorer labouring to a 63-ball 23.         
	Seema and David wrecked the hosts line-up as India cruised to their fourth successive title triumph.         
	Player of the Tournament allrounder Rumeli Dhar and pacer Jhulan Goswami also picked up a wicket each.           (PTI)

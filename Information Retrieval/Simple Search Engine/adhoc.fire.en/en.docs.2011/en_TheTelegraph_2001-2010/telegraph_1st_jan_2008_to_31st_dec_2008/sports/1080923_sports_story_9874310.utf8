The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Curtain falls on the Faldo show
                                                                                                                                                                                             Curtain falls on the Faldo show

	Who let the dogs out? They should put four posts around Valhalla and rope it off. The last three days have given us a primal punch-up in plaid, standing on its head the idea that golf is a civilising force.         
	Im not the type of player you saw right there, I guarantee you that, said the 41-year-old in the red corner, who, until the bell went for the 37th Ryder Cup, was known as Steve Stricker. There I was fist-bumping. Me fist-bumping? This thing will make you crazy.         
	For the most part, Faldo is a pin cushion for golfing malcontents. Given a hint of an opening, he gets it. Witches got a fairer hearing in medieval Europe. He is paying the price for a lifetime of self-serving, a leading figure in the cult of the individual.         
	Faldo waved off his players down the first tee Sunday, whispering in their ears victory, victory, visualise, visualise. Behind him the British colony in the stands shouted: Faldos on the telly, Faldos on the telly, tra la la, la! He was tickled pink.         
	Thats what it is all about, Faldo said.         
	That was not the reaction that greeted his decision to hold back the might in the singles. Poulter, Westwood, Harrington at 10, 11 and 12 went down like Gary Neville in the Anfield Road End.         
	With the scoreboard glowing red in the early exchanges, USA two up in three of the first five pairings, one up in another 90 minutes into the piece, Faldo was a lampooning waiting to happen. From the sandwich list to the drunken uncle pitch at the opening ceremony, the pickings have been rich.         
	He has cast himself as the star of this Ryder Cup epic. The view through hands that covered faces as he introduced his family to the world was a torture so exquisite that the toes of steel-capped boots from Louisville to Welling Garden City curled in appreciation.         
	Embarrassment ought to bring him down. Virulent self regard blinds him to it as he wanders permanently in a Faldo wonderland. Or at least that is how it used to be. The Ryder Cup experience has loosened hinges. The career tramlines that brought him to the doors of Valhalla in glorious straight lines have warped in the emotional heat. At times he has been all over the place, tears welling at a hundred paces at the mere sight of Muhammed Ali.         
	On the other side of the captains table, Azinger was looking like a man that might be drug tested for genius. USA was heading for golfing rehab when he assumed the armband from Tom Lehman. Three successive defeats and no Tiger Woods. The Last Post was playing.         
	Azinger overhauled selection policy, rolled out a course to suit his men, switched the foursomes to the morning session and sent out a team in the image of Kentucky, good ol boys led by Boo know who.The de-selection of Faldos marquee men, Westwood and Sergio Garcia, on Saturday morning, was beyond the reason of most. Poulter, Westwood and Harrington risked going to the first tee festering in dead rubbers. Europe were down in eight matches when Harrington teed it up. The momentum swing of Saturday fashioned for Faldo an opening he didnt look like getting when play started that day. When the team sheets were pinned up on Saturday night, Azingers were not the hands trembling.         
	There is always room for miracles in sport. Faldo needed something to happen. The dog house beckoned.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

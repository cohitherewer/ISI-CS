The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uniteds European tradition at stake
                                                                                                                                                                                             Uniteds European tradition at stake
    - Red Devils hold psychological edge over Blues in Moscow                 Michael Ballack has started to play superbly after a low-key first 18 months at Stamford Bridge                           
	Moscow: Manchester United go into Wednesdays Champions League final against Chelsea with the psychological advantage of having pushed the London club into runners-up spot in the Premier League.         
	For the second successive season, United face Chelsea in a Cup final as newly crowned English champions and they will do all they can to ensure Chelsea do not mug them again.         
	Almost exactly a year after Chelsea shattered Uniteds domestic double hopes by beating them in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium, Englands top two teams clash for the far bigger prize of the European Cup.         
	What a global television audience desperately needs to pray for though is that the match at Moscows Luzhniki Stadium bears no relation to last years tedious Wembley game in which little of note happened until Didier Drogba scored the only goal four minutes from the end of extra time.         
	A year on and there is still little to chose between the two teams and an equally close game is in prospect with both defences tough to break down.                   United are capable of playing the more expansive and open football and have scored 109 goals in all competitions this season, a tight, evenly balanced match looks likely. Chelsea prefer a more patient build-up with an incisive, dagger-like pass splitting open the opposition.         
	All that, of course, could be changed by an early goal or by a touch of genius from any of the outstanding talents on display.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo has spearheaded Uniteds assault on the Premier League and Champions League this season with 41 goals in all matches.         
	Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez scored 57 of Uniteds 80 league goals between them and have contributed 78 of the overall total.         
	No one has been as prolific for Chelsea with Frank Lampard topping their scoring charts this season with 19 goals while Drogba had a relatively tame season with 15.         
	United will not under-estimate Chelseas midfield threat, though, as Joe Cole and Michael Ballack, who could prove to be a key player in the game, are always capable of scoring.         
	Ballack, after a low-key first 18 months at the Bridge, has started to play superbly, as he proved against United three weeks ago when he scored both goals, one from the penalty spot, in their 2-1 home league victory.         
	United can provide goals from midfield too of course as Barcelona can testify after Paul Scholess 25m screamer that decided their semi-final tie at Old Trafford last month. The contrast between the teams is not confined to their styles of play; there could hardly be a greater contrast between the coaches.         
	Alex Ferguson has been in charge at United for nearly 22 years and has overseen 151 Champions League matches with them plus another 12 in the old European Cup with Aberdeen. He has already won 28 trophies with United and first tasted European success with Aberdeen 25 years ago.         
	Chelsea coach Avram Grant has experience of 15 Champions League games  11 with Chelsea and two each with Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa  and has been in charge of Chelsea only since taking over from Jose Mourinho last September. He has yet to win his first trophy with the club.         
	Grant, whose future as Chelsea manager is in doubt even if the Blues win on Wednesday, believes the club has built a reputation as being one of European soccers giants and will maintain it.         
	We are a big team now already, but we are creating a tradition here, he said. Chelsea didnt have a tradition, so that started a few years ago when (Claudio) Ranieri reached the semifinal  the clubs first semi-final of the Champions League. When you want to be a big club, you have to be between the lions of Europe. Now we want more and you will see in the next years that this will not be the last time we will be in the final.         
	United also take the baggage of their past with them to Moscow. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster that all but wiped out the Busby Babes team.         
	It took Matt Busby, who survived the crash, 10 years to re-build the club and his team, taking them to a first European Cup victory 40 years ago this month when they beat Benfica at Wembley Stadium.         
	Ferguson emulated Busby when he led United to their astonishing last-gasp triumph over Bayern Munich in Barcelona in 1999.         
	The players also have to contend with a playing surface which could be a major problem. The artificial surface normally used in the stadium has been removed and replaced with natural grass. But the first replacement surface was too bumpy and ripped up. Matt Frost, an Englishmen called in to produce a field worthy of a final, had only 15 days to replace it.         
	On Tuesday, the surface resembled a patchwork quilt and many of the strips of turf had different shades of green. There are fears the turf could be cut up badly once the game kicks off.         
	Ferguson, however, said he was confident about the state of the pitch. I havent seen it yet but we have no worries about the pitch, Ferguson told a news conference before the team trained on the eve of the match.         
	Chelsea captain John Terry also said the players would not let any doubts over the state of the pitch concern them. Ive heard its not been laid too long and not bedded in but it will be the same for both sides, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Chelseas Ashley Cole had his ankle strapped after suffering an injury in training on Tuesday.         
	Cole went down under a sliding challenge from French teammate Claude Makelele during a game of one-touch football and immediately called for assistance.         
	The England defender hobbled off and had fresh strapping put on before rejoining training, grimacing, several minutes later.

	Trivia         
	 Both teams have won every European final they have played though this is Manchester Uniteds third appearance in the competition but a first for Chelsea.         
	 Manchester United have not played a fellow-English team in European competition for more than 40 years. The last such tie was against Everton in the third round of the Fairs Cup in 1964-65, United winning 3-2 on aggregate.         
	 By contrast, Chelsea are constantly drawn against English opponents. They have played Liverpool eight times in the last four seasons, all in the Champions League, and met Arsenal twice in the same competition in the 2003-04 season. Before that they beat Manchester City at home and away in the 1971 Cup Winners Cup semi-finals.         
	 United have never scored in the first half of a final. Five of their eight goals in previous finals came in the second half, including, famously, two in time added on to beat Bayern in 1999, and three came in extra-time against Benfica in 1968.         
	 Chelsea have never fallen behind in a final. They went ahead in both of their 1971 games against Real Madrid and scored the only goal against Stuttgart in 1998.         
	 The two teams will end the season as they started it back in August  playing against each other. They met in the Community Shield curtain raiser at Wembley on August 5 when United won 3-0 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.         
	 United manager Alex Ferguson will become the 16th man to win the European Cup more than once if United triumph, following his success in 1999. He won his first European trophy, the Cup Winners Cup with Aberdeen in 1983.

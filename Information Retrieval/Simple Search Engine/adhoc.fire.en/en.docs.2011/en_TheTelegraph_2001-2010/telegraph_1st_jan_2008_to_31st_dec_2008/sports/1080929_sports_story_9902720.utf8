                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leander, Lukas clinch title
                    Lukas Dlouhy and Leander Paes                
	Bangkok: Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy won their first ATP title together beating the American pair of Scott Lipsky and David Martin in straight sets in the doubles final of the $576,000 Thailand Open.         
	The top-seeded Indo-Czech pair defeated their unseeded opponents 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) in one hour and 16 minutes to emerge champions in the hard court event.         
	The winners played a solid service game and converted two of the four break points en route to their win.         
	Paes, who now has 40 ATP doubles title to his credit, had earlier won the Thailand Open along with Australian partner Paul Hanley in 2005.         
	Paes and Dlouhy had joined forces for the first time at Roland Garros in May and have since reached the finals of Halle and the US Open.         
	They also reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon.         
	Paes praised his partner saying he was learning from him.         
	Its always special stepping on the court with Lukas because not only does he complement my style of playing but hes also teaching me things.         
	Its interesting that, after playing for so many years, to have a partner whos also teaching me a few things is really beautiful, Paes said after the win.         
	It is special and I think that one of the things I like to do is see my partner win a lot more. This is the challenge for me because I know if hes winning Im winning too.         
	Im trying to step up Lukas, this is the fifth one that hes won, so now Im trying to step up his wins because then mine will go up automatically, he added.         
	Paes and Dlouhy had stormed into the summit clash after inflicting a straight-set defeat on Fabrice Santoro and Jo-Wilfred Tsonga on Saturday.         
	Paes-Dlouhy thrashed the unseeded French pair 6-4, 6-2 in the last-four match of the $576,000 hard court event.         
	Earlier on Thursday, Paes-Dlouhy beat Rohan Bopanna and Aisam ul Haq Qureshi 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 10-7 in the pre-quarter finals.           (PTI)

	Chennai: A brace by midfielder N.P. Pradeep helped India draw their second and final football friendly match against Chinese Taipei on Tuesday.         
	The tournament is part of Indias preparation for the SAFF championship to be held in the Maldives and Sri Lanka next month. In the first friendly in Goa on Saturday, India had defeated them 3-0.         
	Taipei shot into the lead in the fourth minute when Po Liang-Chen sent in a left footer from inside the box after the ball bounced back off the post.         
	Indian players, particularly captain Baichung Bhutia, then made frequent forays into the rival citadel.           (PTI)

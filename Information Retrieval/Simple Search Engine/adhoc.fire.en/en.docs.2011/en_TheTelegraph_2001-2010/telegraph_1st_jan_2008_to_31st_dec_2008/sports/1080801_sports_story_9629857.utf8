                                                                                                                                                                                                     We failed to utilise chances: Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali refused to agree that his sides complacency in the second half led to Port Trusts late equaliser. Shabbir said, The boys didnt utilise the chances that we got, particularly in the first half. In the second half, we lost the grip on the gamebut I dont think it was because we were over confident.         
	A disappointed Shabbir said that losing Roque Barreto early on in the second half, to an injury proved costly as Mohammedan Sporting lost their dominance in the midfield.         
	Biswajit Bhattacharjee meanwhile was full of praise for the club officials. He said: I have received unending support from the Port Trust officialsall of us have tried to make the players stronger, both physically and mentally.         
	Speaking about his strategy, the Port Trust coach said, We deliberately allowed them to play in the negative zones but not in the positive zones, where they could have hurt us.

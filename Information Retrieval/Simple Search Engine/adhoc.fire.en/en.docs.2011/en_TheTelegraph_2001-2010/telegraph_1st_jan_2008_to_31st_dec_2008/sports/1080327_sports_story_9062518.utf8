The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jyoti, Kapur miss berths
                                                     Jyoti, Kapur miss berths
                  Randhawa                     
	Sentosa: Jyoti Randhawa and the other Indians cut a sorry figure as none of them could lay their hands on four British Open tickets on offer in the International Final Qualifying Asia that concluded here on Wednesday.         
	Malaysias Danny Chia (138) earned his second appearance at the British Open after winning the qualifying with a second successive three-under 69 and he will be joined by Adam Blyth (139) at Royal Birkdale in July after the Australian carded a sparkling 66 at Sentosa Golf Clubs Serapong Course.         
	Lam Chih Bing (140) of Singapore and Filipino Angelo Que (140) survived a thrilling play-off against Japans Tomohiro Kondo (140) to earn the last two berths.         
	Among the Indians, the trio of Randhawa (77), Digvijay Singh (75) and Gurbaaz Mann (82) did not turn up for the second round after their disastrous opening round, while Rahil Gangjee (144) carded a vastly improved five-under 67 to finish tied 19th.         
	It, however, was of little consolation to the Calcutta pro whose goose was cooked by a nightmarish opening round of 77 Tuesday.                   Shiv Kapur       
	A opening round of 75 meant Shiv Kapur (147) was never actually in the hunt and the Delhi pro turned in 72 today to finish tied 31st.         
	For Amandeep Johl (153), it went from bad to worse and the Chandigarh pro finished tied 51st after rounds of 74 and 79. The 35-year-old Chia sank crucial birdie putts on the 16th and 17th to lead all qualifiers on six-under-par 138, securing a second trip to the sports oldest major after playing in the 2005 Open at St Andrews.         
	I didnt putt well today but I played good, Chia said. I played within myself and made two birdies coming back when I needed them the most. Its going to be very exciting to go back to the Open.         
	Blyth, who will be appearing at his first major, fired a bogey-free 66 to finish a shot behind Chia, while Que and Lam emerged from a three-man play-off after signing for two-day totals of 140 in a share of third place.

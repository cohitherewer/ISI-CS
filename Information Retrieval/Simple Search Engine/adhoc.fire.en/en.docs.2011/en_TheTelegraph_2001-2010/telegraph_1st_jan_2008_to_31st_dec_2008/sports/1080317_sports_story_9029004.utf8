  - AUSTRALIAN GP 
  -  Force India drivers exit quickly; Heidfeld second, Rosberg ends third         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Melbourne: Lewis Hamilton steered clear of the chaos at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix to get his campaign off to the best possible start.         
	At Albert Park on Sunday, the McLaren driver was sensationally fast and totally focused on the complicated business of winning in what is regarded as the worlds most glamorous and difficult course. Hamilton dominated from the start in his McLaren to beat Nick Heidfelds BMW Sauber and Nico Rosbergs Williams.         
	The spills and thrills of the circuit were not to be missed as was the noise and the enormity of the whole occasion. The sweltering heat and humidity  the temperature on the track was as high as 52 degree Celsius  took its toll as only seven of the 22 cars that started managed to make it to the chequered flag.         
	It was a frustrating day for Kimi Raikkonen, who came off the worse in a duel with McLarens Heikki Kovalainen on the 30th lap and later spun off in another overtaking manoeuvre on German Timo Glock. Raikkonens race ended four laps from home when his car came to a stop at the top of the pit lane.         
	Force India drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil were also forced to pull out. Fisichella, starting 16th on the grid following Glocks 10-place penalty, was the victim of an incident packed first lap that also involved Glock and Nelson Piquet. The resultant damage spoiled his Force India debut.         
	Adrian Sutil was going great guns after starting from the pit lane. The German graduated to 13th position by the eighth lap but a hydraulic pressure problem on the following lap brought about a premature end to his hopes.         
	A very disappointing first race for Force India and obviously a great opportunity to score points missed. Fisichella was unlucky at the first corner He just had nowhere to go.         
	With Sutil we had a hydraulic failure, a result of having to rebuild his car from Saturday and not being able to do any installation checks, which was a shame as he was running very competitively. But overall a positive weekend in terms of car pace and we remain optimistic, said Force Indias chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne.         
	Having overcome the initial disappointment, both drivers are also hoping to make it memorable in Kuala Lumpur.         
	With 17 more Grand Prix to go, Hamilton puts himself in prime position to improve on his amazing rookie year. Like many past occasions the outcome was decided during Saturdays practice and qualifying sessions. Hamilton claimed the pole position and with it a mortgage on the race.         
	He shoved his McLaren Mercedes into the notorious first corner on the Albert Park circuit a breath in front of Robert Kubica and there was no looking back. The only time Hamilton lost the lead was during his two fuel stops, but not the control.         
	Kovalainen could have finished second but for his luck with the safety car. It came out for the third time at exactly the wrong time for the Finn.         
	Kovalainen had to pit for fuel and tyres while the safety car was out, and dropped to the back of the pack. He recovered to finish fifth losing out in an exciting battle with Fernando Alonsos Renault in the last two laps.         
	It was a disastrous race for world champions Ferrari. Massa retired shortly after his collision with David Coulthard following an engine failure.         
	This track has been merciless over the years said someone in the know of things. This is just the early part of the season. Most of the cars are going through a trial and error method. It will take at least two-three races to set up things.         
	Albert Park is a temporary street course in the picturesque setting of Melbournes 555 acre Albert Park Reserve. The track features 16 turns over its 5.30km and is a compromise circuit in its layout.         
	Teams have to temper their desires for low downforce down the straights, with higher downforce requirements through the turns.         
	High lateral forces are generated through several corners meaning high levels of energy and heat are dispersed through the tyres. As the facility is only used once a year as a race circuit, there is low level of grip.

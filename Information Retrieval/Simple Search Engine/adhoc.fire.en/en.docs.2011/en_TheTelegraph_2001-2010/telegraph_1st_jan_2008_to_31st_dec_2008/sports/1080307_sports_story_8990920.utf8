The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Neuer heroics takes Schalke through to quarter finals
                                                   Neuer heroics takes Schalke through to quarter finals
                      
	Berlin: Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer performed heroics on the pitch to take Schalke 04 through to the Champions League quarter finals but the 21-year-old showed his heart was firmly with the fans.         
	Neuer saved spot kicks from Bruno Alves and Lisandro Lopez  the second a brilliant one-handed block, high to his left  to help Schalke to a 4-1 win over Porto on penalties following a 1-1 draw over two legs.         
	Schalke have reached the knockout round for the first time in three attempts.         
	Lisandro had given 2004 champions Porto a 1-0 lead on the night in the 86th minute with an unstoppable shot on the turn to force extra time but missed his teams final spot kick.         
	Neuer kept Schalke afloat with a string of saves before denying Bruno Alves and Lisandro in the shootout.         
	Jermaine Jones then steered in the final spot kick to start his teams celebrations at the Dragao stadium.         
	That was a real fighting display, Schalke coach Mirko Slomka told Premiere TV. We gave everything.         
	It was a super performance from Manuel Neuer, and not only in the penalty shootout. He also made fantastic saves during the match.         
	While Slomka and the rest of the team were extolling Neuer to reporters, the goalkeeper himself climbed into the crowd to celebrate with his friends.         
	Neuer, Gelsenkirchen born and bred, was in the crowd at the old Parkstadion for the first leg of the 1997 Uefa Cup final, when a 1-0 win over Inter Milan gave Schalke a good result to take to Italy.

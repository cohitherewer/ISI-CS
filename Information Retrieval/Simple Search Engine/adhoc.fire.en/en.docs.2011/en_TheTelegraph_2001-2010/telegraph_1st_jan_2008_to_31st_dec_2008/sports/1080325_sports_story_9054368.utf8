                                                   Sarwan keeps WI afloat
                      
	Miami: Ramnaresh Sarwan marked his return from a six-month injury lay-off by scoring 80 as West Indies struggled to 186 for six at tea on Day III of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Georgetown on Monday.  
	 The West Indies reached the interval still 290 runs in arrears after Sri Lanka had compiled 476 for eight declared on the first two days.  
	 Sri Lanka bowlers displayed great accuracy and discipline on the slow-paced pitch and gradually chipped away at the West Indies rsquo; batsmen.  
	 Pace bowler Thilan Thushara, playing his second Test, had both Devon Smith (14) and Marlon Samuels (5) caught behind early on the third morning to put the hosts under pressure.  
	 Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan also picked up an important wicket minutes before lunch when Shivnarine Chanderpaul was caught at short cover off a leading edge for 23.  
	 Straight after lunch Muralidharan deceived Dwayne Bravo (8), who had been dropped before the break on one at slip off the offie, with a quicker delivery and won a leg-before decision.

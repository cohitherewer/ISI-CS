The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taming DareDevils will be difficult for the Riders
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Taming DareDevils will be difficult for the Riders
                    MIND GAMES    John Buchanan                      
	After the last two games, we have found ourselves back in the winners circle. I must say, while losing gives us the capacity to learn more about ourselves, there is nothing like a winning dressing room. The mood bubbles; the comments and jokes reverberate off the walls; the highlights of the match are relived; everybody enjoys the post-match replays on TV; and no one is really concerned about how tired they feel, about injuries or parts of the performance that were not up to par.         
	A quick reflection on the game against Bangalores Royal Challengers showed that we again disappointed at the top of the order being two down for 25 after rain shortened the game to 16 overs and therefore the power play was limited to four overs.         
	We stabilised and regained some momentum in the innings, but just as we had rebuilt the launch pad, two run outs in two overs saw us back in trouble at four for 64 with seven overs left. Further disaster struck in the 12th over when both Taibu and Shukla were dismissed by Steyn.         
	However, the current master of rearguard actions, Wriddhiman Pops Saha, was joined by Murali Kartik and they added 40 runs in the last five overs with 28 coming from the last two. I thought this left us at least 20 runs short of a total that would prove difficult to chase down.         
	Again David Hussey showed himself to be one of the premier batsmen in this tournament, till the run out. I was very pleased with the energy, the running, and innovation from Taibu; and Laxmi Ratan Shukla showed a glimpse of how dangerous he can be.         
	There was no doubt this was one of our best fielding displays with Brad Hodge, who missed out with the bat again, leading from the front. His run out of J. Arun Kumar was critical to our victory, plus he put doubt in the minds of batters when the ball was in his vicinity. Taibu was the same, spread-eagling himself on many occasions to save runs, and these efforts helped uplift everyone in the field.         
	With Brad being called up for Australia duty, we have replaced him at the top of the order with Salman Butt who I think may take another game or two to adjust to this format; plus he and Aakash Chopra will be the sixth opening combination in eight games, not a formula for lending stability and consistency to a batting innings.         
	Against the Deccan Chargers, the most obviously pleasing feature of our performance was the batting. After the early loss of Salman, Aakash played a very important role in giving an increasingly confident and aggressive Sourav Ganguly all the initial support he needed. His run out brought David to the crease who once again read the game superbly  feeding Sourav to begin with, and then taking command of the innings in the final overs. It is amazing what can be done in this format given a solid start, as our innings moved from two for 89 at the completion of the 13th over to four for 204 at innings end.         
	The Chargers had little choice but to attack from the outset, although this is the natural style of Gilchrist and Gibbs. Fortunately we were able to dismiss both through their own aggression inside the power play. And though runs were flowing, we picked up wickets to have the Chargers at four for 70, requiring 135 from the remaining 11 overs. Sharma and then Rao tried valiantly, but the task proved too big.         
	Again, I was very pleased with our fielding effort, while on the bowling front, all bowlers contributed, with Laxmi finishing off the bowling innings as he had done with the bat  knowing what was required and delivering with precision.         
	Shoaib has made progress since he has been here, but whether he can make sufficient progress for Tuesdays game against Delhi, is still a question. I know he is keen to get back on the field. And while we all want his presence there, rushing him into the side before he is ready will not do him, or us, any good.         
	Delhi Daredevils have an imposing top order headed by Sehwag, Gambhir, Dhawan, de Villiers, and strong middle order of Dinesh Kartik, Malik and Tiwary. Support this powerful batting with McGrath, who has yet to be challenged by a batting group in this competition; the talented Asif; one of the emerging allrounders of the tournament in Mahroof; and an exciting leg-spin prospect in Mishra. It is no wonder that Delhi were one of the front-runners, and will be an extremely difficult assignment for the Knight Riders.         
	Both teams will approach this game as a finals match as we close in on the business end of the tournament. It should be a night of great excitement and drama.           GAMEPLAN

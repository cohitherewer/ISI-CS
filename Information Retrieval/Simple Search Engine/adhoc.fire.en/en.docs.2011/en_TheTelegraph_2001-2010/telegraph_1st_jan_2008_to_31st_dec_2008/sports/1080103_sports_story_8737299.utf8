                                                Zaheer Khan to return home
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: Spearhead Zaheer Khan, who had to be left out of the Team India XI for the second Test owing to a recurrence of his left heel problem, is returning home.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, he will be replaced by Vikram Rajvir Singh, whod been in the frame when the Test squad was picked on December 12.         
	For now, apparently, Zaheer only requires rest. He could leave by Friday.

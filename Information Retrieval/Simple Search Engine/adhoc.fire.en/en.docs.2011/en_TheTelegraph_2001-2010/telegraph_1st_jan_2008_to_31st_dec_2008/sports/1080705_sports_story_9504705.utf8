The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PK flays Houghton
                                                                                                                                                                                             PK flays Houghton
            A STAFF REPORTER            P. K. Banerjee                           
	Calcutta: Former India captain and coach P. K. Banerjee on Friday came down heavily on national football coach Bob Houghton. Speaking on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony for young footballers, P.K. criticised Houghton for his recent comments on Indian football.         
	Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, president of the All India Football Federation, was also present and did not support Houghton either. Ive heard whatever Houghton has said and Im also aware of the reactions of the state associations. Ill tell Houghton whatever I have to say. But I believe Houghton should focus on his job, was his answer to queries on Houghton.         
	PK said: I wont give Houghton more than 50 out of 100 as the India coach. Hes been given many more facilities than his predecessors. Nobody got to play so many practice matches ahead of a tournament.         
	Nayeem and I were forced to take the team to SAFF Cup with a just a weeks preparation. Yet we won the title, the legend pointed out.         
	He also refused to rate the Nehru Cup win as Indias best performance in the recent past. We defeated Syria in the final, who are not high-quality opponents. I think the best victory for us in recent past was the one against UAE in 2001, he remarked.         
	Houghtons remarks against the IFA is also unfortunate. He doesnt know the history of Indian football and the IFAs contribution to it, he added. PK did not spare Bhaichung Bhutia either. Bhaichung hasnt seen Milovan. Thats why he feels Houghton is the best coach India had in the last 40 years, he said.         
	Meanwhile, 16 aspirant young footballers of the country were felicitated ahead of their trip to Rio De Janeiro for the week-long (July 7-12) Coca-Cola International Football Camp. The camp will be organised by the Brazilian Football Academy. Six of the 16 kids are from the city.         
	Jo Paul Ancheri will go as the coach.

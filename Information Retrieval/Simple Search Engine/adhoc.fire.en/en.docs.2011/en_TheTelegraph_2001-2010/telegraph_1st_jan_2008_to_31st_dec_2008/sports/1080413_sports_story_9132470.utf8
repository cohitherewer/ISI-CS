	Kanpur: As both teams toiled under a scorching sun on Day II during the third and final Test between India and South Africa on Saturday, tempers soared high in the 52nd over when Dale Steyn was bowling to Yuvraj Singh.         
	After being hit for two boundaries, Steyn banged in a short one to Yuvraj who ducked. Styen appeared to have lost his cool and a bit of tension between the duo was witnessed. But umpire Billy Doctrove intervened just in time to keep things under control. When asked later, South Africa coach Mickey Arthur said nothing serious had happened.         
	There is nothing serious. You know boys will be boys There were no chat regarding this in the dressing room.

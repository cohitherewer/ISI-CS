The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB decision on Test series in 48 hours
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ECB decision on Test series in 48 hours
  - England don rsquo;t want to play in Ahmedabad
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Lalit Modis can keep making unilateral announcements, but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is still undecided on returning to India for a two-Test series.         
	First things first... We, in the ECB, must first decide on whether to go back to India or not... I expect this to be clear within 48 hours, but no decision would be taken in haste, a top ECB source told The Telegraph on Sunday evening.         
	The Kevin Pietersens returned home late on Saturday, after the last two ODIs (Guwahati, Delhi) were called off, following the terror strikes in Mumbai.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis Team India won the truncated series 5-0.         
	Speaking from London, the top source confirmed that even if the ECB decided to send the team back to India, there were very strong reservations about playing the first Test in Ahmedabad, from December 11.         
	We definitely have issues with Ahmedabad, especially after what happened in Mumbai, which isnt far off... If I may add, we wouldnt like the three-day match in Vadodara (from December 5) either... All this would be taken up with the BCCI if its decided to return for the Test series, the top source maintained.         
	The second Test, scheduled from December 19, has already been moved out from Mumbai to Chennai.         
	That change was made before England left for home, via Bangalore, after spending an extra day in Bhubaneswar.         
	Chennai is fine... We could ask for Bangalore as the other Test venue and, ideally, we would like the tour match to be held in the same city as the first Test... That way, the travelling would be minimised, the top source said.         
	Calcutta may also be talked about as an alternative for Ahmedabad.         
	Perhaps Mohali too.         
	Even if the ECB gives the go-ahead, theres every chance that some of the players could make themselves unavailable.         
	Given the unusual circumstances, such a decision wouldnt invite penalties.

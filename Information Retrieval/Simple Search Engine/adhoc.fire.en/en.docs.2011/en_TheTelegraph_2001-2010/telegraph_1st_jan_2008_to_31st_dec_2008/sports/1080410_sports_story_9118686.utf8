	London: Max Mosley will face a vote of confidence as president of the FIA by a secret ballot, the association said on Wednesday. Mosley, the subject of lurid newspaper revelations about his private life, had asked the FIA last week to call an extraordinary general meeting in Paris on the matter. Responding to that call, the FIA issued a statement saying that the meeting will be held on June 3, 2008, in Paris. The general assembly will include a vote of confidence by secret ballot, the statement said.        
	Barcelona: Barcelona are using player injuries to hide the fact that a number of players have been sidelined for indiscipline, a high-ranking official at the club said on Wednesday. Look at these gentlemen who arent working, who arent doing anything, who havent played for quite a few weeks. Well, they were sidelined by the club some weeks ago, president of the clubs economic commission Xavier Sala Martin told Catalunya Radio.        
	London: Players competing in the Davis Cups World Group will get ATP ranking points for the first time starting next season. The ITF and the ATP said on Wednesday that they had made the decision to begin awarding points in order to encourage more top players to participate in the team event.    
	Points will only be awarded for live matches, however, meaning once the best-of-five series has been decided, the remaining matches will not count toward the rankings. Besides earning points for a win, players can also get bonus points for winning a certain amount of matches throughout the year.

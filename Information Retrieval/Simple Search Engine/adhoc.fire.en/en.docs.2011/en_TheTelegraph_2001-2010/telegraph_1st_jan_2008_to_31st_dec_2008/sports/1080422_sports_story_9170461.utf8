The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Watson hits royal knock
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Watson hits royal knock
                      
	Jaipur: Shane Watson smashed a blistering unbeaten 76 to steer an inexperienced Rajasthan Royals to a six-wicket victory over a star-studded Kings XI Punjab in their Indian Premier League match at Sawai Man Singh Stadium here Monday.         
	Chasing 167 and reduced to 19 for two in the third over, Watson plundered five sixes during his 49-ball knock to help his side bounce back after their nine-wicket defeat at the hands of Delhi Daredevils in their first match. The Australian allrounder fittingly hit the winning runs, a four off Sreesanth, to reach 168 for four with 11 balls to spare.         
	He changed the complexion of the game after his side began on a disastrous note with opener Mohammed Kaif dismissed by Sreesanths first ball in the second over of the innings and Pathan falling cheaply to Brett Lee.         
	Watson was menacing throughout the innings and hit two sixes off James Hopes and one each of Piyush Chawla, Sreesanth and Wilkin Mota, besides five fours.         
	Young Ravindra Jadeja contributed a valuable 25-ball 36 with the help of five boundaries and a six.         
	Watson shared two crucial partnerships, first a 39-ball 51 with fellow Australian Darren Lehmann (17) for the fourth wicket and the unbroken 36-ball 69 with Jadeja.         
	Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who took field within hours of landing here, played a cameo of 15 from 10 balls which included a huge six off Lee, before perishing to Hopes.         
	For the Punjab side, Lee, Sreesanth, Hopes and Irfan Pathan claimed a wicket each.         
	Earlier, Royals captain Shane Warne produced a supreb spell of three for 19 to restrict the Punjab side to 166 for eight.         
	The Australian spin legends act of leading from the front overshadowed a chancy but strokeful half century by his opposite number Yuvraj Singh (57) who won the toss and decided to bat first.         
	The visitors would have been in a worse position had Yuvraj not been dropped twice when he was on 15 and 27, the first time off Warne and the second off Siddarth Trivedi.         
	Warne, however, removed Yuvraj, who was caught and bowled while trying to sweep the retired spin legend. Yuvraj struck 27 fours and three huge sixes in his 34-ball innings.         
	Warne also cut short Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkaras explosive but short innings of 20 made from eight balls and studded with six fours, besides removing opener James Hopes (16).

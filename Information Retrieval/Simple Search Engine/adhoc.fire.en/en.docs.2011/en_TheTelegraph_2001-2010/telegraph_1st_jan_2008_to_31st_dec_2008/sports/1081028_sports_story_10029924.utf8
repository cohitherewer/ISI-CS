                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seniors need to   stand up: Clarke
    - We are taking the positives from the last two matches           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sourav Ganguly at the Kotla on Monday                                       
	New Delhi: Two days before the start of the third Test, Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke made it clear that his team would go all out at the Kotla to level the series against India.         
	Speaking to the media at the end of the training session on Monday, Clarke said: The break after the second Test has refreshed the boys.         
	Our preparations have been fantastic Everyone is in fine touch and excited. Now we have decided to go out and give it our best shot.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q How you are approaching the third Test?         
	A See, we are 0-1 down in the series. We have to win here and have to play good cricket.         
	On India having a very good record at the Kotla         
	We are taking the positives from the last two matches and looking forward to a great Test match. We are not concerned about Indias record here.         
	Can Australia bounce back         
	Hopefully it would not get too difficult. India are playing very good at the moment but our preparations have been fantastic and we are looking forward to another great Test. Any match against India, that too in India, is always tough but our preparations have been excellent and we did everything possible over the last two days.         
	Stuart Clarks fitness         
	I spoke to the physio, and at present, he is looking good for the match. We would still have a look at him tomorrow and see how it goes.         
	Own batting form         
	Definitely I would have loved to score a few more runs. Im happy that I managed to gets some runs in the second innings of the Mohali Test but I guess all the guys in the side would love to score more. Im certainly going to take a little bit more responsibility in my own performances. Its crucial for us to win in Delhi, and important for the senior guys to stand up.         
	The Kotla ground         
	The ground is indeed fantastic. But the main concern is the smog. All the guys have noticed it. I think its okay with us. Its not much of a problem.

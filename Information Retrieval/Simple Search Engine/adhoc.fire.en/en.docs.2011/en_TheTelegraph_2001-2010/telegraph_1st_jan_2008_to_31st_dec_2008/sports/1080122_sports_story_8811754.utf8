                                                      I was approached to fix match: Bhupathi

   A STAFF REPORTER 
        Mahesh Bhupathi 
   
	Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi on Monday added more weight to the match-fixing controversy in tennis by disclosing that he had been approached to fix a tie.
 
	Bhupathi, who turned pro in 1995 and has won 10 Grand Slam titles, said that he was contacted over telephone by an unknown caller very early in his career.
 
	I was contacted (to throw a match) very early in my career but I did not entertain the caller, he said.
 
	The tie in question was a Davis Cup World Group first round clash with The Netherlands, played at the Jai Club, Jaipur, from February 9-11, 1996.
 
	India won the tie 3-2 to advance to the quarter finals with Bhupathi playing a key role. He won both his singles matches against much higher-ranked opponents mdash; Jan Siemerink and Jacco Eltingh.
 
	Bhupathi added that there wasnt another recurrence of the same. Asked if he had contacted the authorities, he answered in the negative.
 
	Bhupathi, currently playing mens doubles and mixed doubles at the Australian Open, refused to give further details. 
 
	I wont comment any more, otherwise it will become another scandal, he added.
      
	The 33-year-old lauded the efforts of the ATP and WTA in combating match-fixing.
 
	Sports should be clean. The games governing body is right in punishing (guilty) players and being very strict with them, he said.
 
	Asked what was coming up next for him after the first Grand Slam of the year, Bhupathi said he would return home and then decide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL outing will help: Michael
                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL outing will help: Michael
                  Michael Hussey                     
	Jaipur: Australian middle-order mainstay Michael Hussey is yet to play a Test on Indian soil but is confident of succeeding in the toughest challenge of his career, riding on patience and the experience gathered during his Indian Premier League stint.         
	I have not played a Test on Indian soil but I feel patience is the key. I may have not played a Test here but have played other forms of cricket, Hussey said.         
	The experience of playing IPL will come in handy. The IPL made us play on different kinds of Indian wickets, but Test cricket is different and it is not easy to make a smooth transition from one form of cricket to another, the left hander, who played for Chennai Super Kings, said.         
	The Test series against India on Indian soil is considered tough. It is the toughest series but it gives you immense satisfaction if you are able to notch up a victory here, said Hussey.         
	Harbhajan Singh has been a dreaded name in the Aussie camp due to his stranglehold over their line-up, but Hussey said veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble and the Indian pace battery had an equally important role to play.         
	Why only Harbhajan Singh? Anil Kumble and other Indian bowlers are also good In fact they have a good balanced attack, Hussey said.         
	You have to have a clear game plan on how to play spin. (Matthew) Hayden, (Ricky) Ponting or (Michael) Clarke have their own game plan to tackle spin. They will deal with it in their own way. So will I, but you have to be clear how you are going to tackle it, quipped Hussey.         
	Hussey said former India coach Greg Chappell, who is now an assistant to Aussie coach Tim Nielsen, would also be giving his inputs in the teams strategy for the four-Test series. He knows the conditions here well and would certainly help us, he said.

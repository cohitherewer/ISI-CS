The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wonder coach of little Cuba
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wonder coach of little Cuba
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For the next three days, in the dusty, unkempt town of Bhiwani in Haryana, Jagdish Singh is likely to remain wide awake all through the night.         
	The reason  Jagdish, the well known chief coach of the Bhiwani Boxing Club, has three of his wards in the Olympic quarter-finals in Beijing and they may call up any time to seek his advice.         
	I have to be on guard, after all three are standing on the threshold of history, said Jagdish proudly, whose three students  Akhil Kumar (54kg), Jitender Kumar (51kg) and Vijender Kumar (75kg)  are a step away from winning Olympic medals.         
	Never before in the history of Indian boxing, three pugilists have reached the last eight in a single Olympics. And it is all due to Jagdish, an employee of the Sports Authority of India, who has been doing a stupendous job in Bhiwani.         
	Thanks to Jagdish and some other coaches, boxing is now Bhiwanis most popular sport and produces scores of boxers at the national level. So much so, that Bhiwani is now called the little Cuba in the boxing circle.         
	Jagdish is certainly thrilled by the prospect of his students winning medals, but feels that Akhil and Vijender have the best chance to progress further in the competition.         
	Jitender is also a fine boxer but he is bit inexperienced, Jagdish told The Telegraph. Akhil has lots of experience. Vijender is highly intelligent. Have a good look at him. He can finish off a bout by receiving least number of knocks on the body.         
	Akhil, who will be taking on Moldovas Veaceslav Gojan on Monday, is the senior most of the three boxers and the most disciplined one, according to Jagdish. He has been training under me for 14 years. I dont remember when he last spent a night at home. His dedication is simply amazing. Jitender is his cousin and emulates Akhil in every way.         
	Among the three, Vijender is the most handsome and flashy. He has already modelled for two fashion magazines, including the Indian edition of Maxim.         
	Jagdish, whose club has 120 students including a dozen girls, was travelling in a public bus from Gurgaon to Bhiwani when The Telegraph caught up with him. Out of the five Indian boxers in Beijing, four are his students.         
	I dont have any regret as such that I wasnt taken to Beijing, said Jagdish. I am in regular touch with all the three boxers. Akhil called me up only a few minutes ago. I told him the entire nation is waiting to see you on the medal podium. He is capable of it, said the coach confidently.

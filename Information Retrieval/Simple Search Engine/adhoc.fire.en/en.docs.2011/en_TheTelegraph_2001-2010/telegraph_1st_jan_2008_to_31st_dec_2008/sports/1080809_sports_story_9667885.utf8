The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis remains a mystery for Indian batsmen
                                                                                                                                                                                             Mendis remains a mystery for Indian batsmen
                  Dammika Prasad                     
	Colombo: The Indian middle order failed yet again but opener Gautam Gambhir (72) and a 51-run last wicket stand helped the visitors post 249 against Sri Lanka even as mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis picked five wickets on the opening day of the third and final Test on Friday.         
	Besides Mendis, debutant Dammika Prasad snared three early wickets and spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan picked two as India failed to take advantage of winning the toss on a bouncy Premadasa track here. Sri Lanka were 14 for the loss of one wicket at close with Michael Vandort (3) and night watchman Chaminda Vaas (0) at the crease.         
	Malinda Warnapura was the only Lankan wicket to fall, bowled by pacer Ishant Sharma minutes before stumps.         
	Earlier, hostile fast bowling by Prasad put India on the back foot even as Gambhir ploughed a lone furrow with his patient half-century.         
	Later, Mendis ended up with a figure of five wickets for 56 runs and Muralidharan took two for 58 runs to send India packing.         
	Interestingly, most of third umpire review decisions were in Indias favour on Friday.         
	Trying to weather the initial bounce, openers Virender Sehwag and Gambhir tried to keep the scoreboard ticking through some crafty drives. But Sehwag was the first to go after he failed to cash in on a dropped catch by Malinda Warnapura off the bowling of Prasad at short leg and was finally out for 21.         
	The Indian innings was in a shambles, but a matured last-wicket partnership between Zaheer (32) and Sharma (17), the highest against Sri Lanka, saved the visitors from further humiliation.         
	Sehwag and Gambhir gave an explosive start to the Indian innings, scoring 50 in just 34 minutes of 6.5 overs.         
	Sehwag (21) was the first one to return to pavilion after he was caught by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off Prasad, however, his partner Gambhir continued from where he left in the second Test.         
	Gambhirs sixth half-century came off 58 balls. He also shared a 50-run partnership with former skipper Sourav Ganguly (35) off 16 overs after Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar got out cheaply.

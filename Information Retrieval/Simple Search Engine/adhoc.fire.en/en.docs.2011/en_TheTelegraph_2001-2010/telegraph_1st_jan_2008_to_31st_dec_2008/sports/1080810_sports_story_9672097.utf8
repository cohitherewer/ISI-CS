	Colombo: Ace Indian pacer Zaheer Khan believes that the game is still evenly poised and stressed on the need of getting Sri Lanka out early on Sunday.                 
	The following are excerpts:         
	The P. Sara pitch         
	Its a good Test match wicket, the batsmen will have to concentrate hard for their runs and the bowlers will have to bowl the right line and length to do well and bend their back.         
	Ishants injury         
	We will have to wait and see. We are hopeful he will be okay tomorrow (Sunday). Have to see how it goes. The physio is having a look at him.         
	On Indias position         
	The game is evenly poised. We need to get them out early. Will have to wait and see how things go. We gave our best, things could have gone either way. A few decisions went here and there.         
	Sangakkaras innings         
	Important innings he played today (Saturday). From their point of view to hang in there and continue was important.         
	Is there any tension due to the injuries?         
	We will have wait and watch and see how it shapes up. We will give 100 per cent as we did today (Saturday).         
	On his batting in the first innings         
	Applied myself, things went my way, played each ball. Took one ball at a time.         
	On Ajantha Mendis         
	Early days. He has had a good series.         
	The conditions         
	It is a good wicket, run in and give your best, be patient and wait for batsmen to make mistakes. Bowl in the right areas.         
	Target for Lanka         
	First thing first, not let them take a big lead, first session is crucial, have to put a good total and they have to bat last.         
	On the injuries         
	I cant comment as I was on the field.               
	Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss said both teams have a lot of hard work still left in the match and the third day would be a tough day for Test cricket.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	On Sri Lankas position at the end of Day II         
	It was a tough day for Test cricket today (Saturday). Tomorrow (Sunday) will be the same. We will be looking to try and get as far ahead as we possibly can and bowl them out again. Still a lot of hard work to be done for both teams in this match.         
	The P. Sara pitch         
	Its got a little bit of turn in it but it is not difficult if you apply yourself once you get in. And if you are confident and positive, its not impossible to score runs, thats for sure.         
	Sri Lankas strategy from here on         
	We will take any lead we get and then look to bowl as well as we have done in the previous five innings.         
	On the situation of the match after Day II         
	Take the Galle Test  they took the last five wickets for less than ten runs, I think. If that happens, its fairly even. Any lead for us will be gladly accepted.         
	Sangakkaras batting         
	He held our innings together all day long. We needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did today (Saturday). The concentration he showed in batting for long periods of time is what makes him world-class. In difficult conditions, he showed that if you apply yourself, you could score runs. He might have been a little out of runs but he was not out of form. A quality player like that, when he is striking the ball well, it wont be too long before he is going to start scoring runs.         
	If the referral system has been successful         
	Pretty much, there are obviously some things that will have to be reviewed about it. We have had a number of decisions turned around in our favour. The other way of looking at it is we could be sitting here complaining about seven or eight wrong ones. From that point of view, I think its doing its job. Obviously, there are one or two areas where it has to be worked out a little bit better, but we are happy with the way it has gone.         
	LBW referrals         
	I dont see why not lbws. Everyone says its is a batsmans game. The review system might be a little bit of a comeback for the bowlers. There will be more outs than not outs. All the bowlers should be pretty happy that the system is in place.         
	Vaas performance with the bat         
	Its not the first time Vaas has done that as a night watchman. He not only took the shine off the ball but went on to make some very handy runs as well. He plays the quicks very very well. Watches the ball very closely, probably one of the best watchers of the ball in our team.

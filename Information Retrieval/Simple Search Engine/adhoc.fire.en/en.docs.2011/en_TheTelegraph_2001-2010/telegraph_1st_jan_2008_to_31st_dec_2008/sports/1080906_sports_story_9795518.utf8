	Bangalore: Marcus North hit 88 as Australia A fought back in the second innings after following on against India A in the three-day tie that ended in a draw here on Friday.         
	After being bowled out for 116, adding just three runs to the overnight score of 113 for eight, the visitors raised their game several notches to come out with a far more creditable performance in the second outing.         
	MB Parmar took four for 37 and Piyush Chawla three for 39 to impress with the ball at the M Chinnaswamy stadium.         
	Simon Katichs team, who conceded a first innings lead of 168 runs, ended day three at 263 for seven in 81 overs with top-scorer North hitting ten fours in his 149-ball knock of 88 that helped his side keep the home team at bay.         
	He was well supported by Katich who made 56 with seven fours and one six while Phillip Hughes (43) and George Bailey (29) chipped in with useful contributions to deny India a win. In fact, Hughes and Katich put on 88 runs for the opening wicket

	Hokkaido: After last weeks ecstasy, Jeev Milkha Singh tasted agony on the Japan tour, failing to make the cut at the Sun Chlorella Classic on Friday.         
	Winner of last weeks Sega Sammy Cup, Jeev followed his poor opening round of 75 with a horrendous 77 to miss the cut by two shots.         
	Takuya Taniguchi (72) shares the top slot with Tetsuya Haraguchi (71) at two-under 142. (PTI)

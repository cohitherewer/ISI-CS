	Calcutta: A mentally tougher Sreevats Goswami owes his success to coach Dav Whatmore and has said he is looking to represent Bengals senior side, following his role in Indias successful under-19 World Cup campaign in Kuala Lumpur.         
	Its been a fantastic experience for me A leaning curve for all of us. I think I am mentally tougher now after the triumph in Kuala Lumpur, Sreevats said after returning home from Bangalore on Wednesday.         
	The Cricket Association of Bengal is planning to include Sreevats into the one-day squad this season. The news excited the teenager who said he was keen to prove his mettle in the senior side as well.         
	I will be honoured if Im included in the Bengal side. I am determined to give off my best. I want to play for the senior Team India side before I turn 25, he said.         
	The wicketkeeper-cum-opener maintained Whatmores batting tips helped him perform well in the under-19 showpiece event. Full credit goes to our coach  He was instrumental in our win, the 18-year-old said.         
	Sir (Whatmore) pointed out a few adjustments to me about my batting. I used to shuffle across and that was creating some problems. He told me to pay attention to the backfoot movement and his advice helped me immensely, he said.         
	Sreevats, who scored 152 runs from six matches in the World Cup, continued: I know expectations will be more now. But I am pretty focused on my goal. I am not feeling any pressure. I know I have to work hard to reach my goal.

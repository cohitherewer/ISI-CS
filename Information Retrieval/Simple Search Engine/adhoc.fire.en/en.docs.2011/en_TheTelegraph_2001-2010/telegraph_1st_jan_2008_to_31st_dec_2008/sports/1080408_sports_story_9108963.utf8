The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied 39th 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jeev tied 39th 
                  Johnson Wagner with the trophy on Sunday                     
	Houston: Jeev Milkha Singh shot up the leaderboard and signed off in tied 39th spot in the $5.6 million Houston Open here. The Indian, who makes his second appearance at the Augusta Masters next week, finished with a tournament total of two-under 286, 14 strokes off champion Johnson Wagner of the United States.         
	Wagners win earns him a place in the Masters.         
	Jeev, who carded a one-under 71, was off to a fine start. He picked up a stroke on the fourth hole but was back to par after bogeying the sixth. He made the turn at one-under after a birdie on the eighth. He began his back nine by bogeying the 11th hole but birdied the next two before another bogey on the 14th denied him a better finish.         
	Australian Geoff Ogilvy (68) and American Chad Campbell (72) were tied for the second spot with 14-under 274.         
	Americans Billy Mayfair and Fred Couples were a stroke adrift in tied third place after carding an identical six-under 66 on Sunday.         
	Wagner, who fired a course record-tying nine-under-par 63 in the opening round, led wire-to-wire and finished with a 16-under total of 272 at the Redstone Golf Club.         
	This is unbelievable, 28-year-old Wagner said in a televised interview after clinching his first US Tour title. I cant believe Im going to Augusta next week. This was a long time coming and a dream come true.         
	Wagner, who had missed six of nine cuts this season, began the day with a one-shot lead over Campbell, who slumped on the front nine and was six strokes behind after a double bogey at the par-five eighth.

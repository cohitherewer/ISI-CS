The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand stretches lead

    - DEFENDING CHAMPION INFLICTS ANOTHER HUMILIATING DEFEAT ON KRAMNIK                   GM SPEAK    Pravin Thipsay                                        Viswanathan Anand in Bonn on Tuesday. (AFP)		    
	The defending world chess champion Viswanathan Anand inflicted yet another humiliating defeat on the challenger Vladimir Kramnik in the sixth game of the world chess championship match being held at the Art and Exhibition Centre of the Federal Republic of Germany, Bonn. Halfway through the match, the defending champion leads over the challenger with a huge difference 4.51.5 and the outcome of the match seems to have already been decided since only a series of miracles can bring Kramnik back in the contention for the crown.         
	Anand once again opened the game with the Queens gambit but unlike the fourth game, this time he decided to permit the challenger to play his favourite Nimzo Indian Defence. This must have delighted Kramnik, since the only game wherein he got a decent position in this match was the one wherein he had played the Nimzo. However, the challengers joy, probably lasted only for a move, since the champion differed on the 4th move itself and chose an interesting variation popularised by former world champions Mikhail Botvinnik and Garry Kasparov.         
	Garri Kasparov had rejuvenated and used this seemingly harmfully system effectively in his world championship match against the then world champion Anatoly Karpov in the year 1985. Kramnik, who is probably not well versed with the variation, gave up the centre control as early as on the 5th move itself and threatened to exchange Queens on move 6 by bringing out his Queen. Anand avoided the exchange by going for an extremely rare option, first played by Ivanchuk 12 years ago against Anand himself.         
	Anands ninth move, trying to trap the challengers Queen was a theoretical novelty. This powerful novelty forced the challenger to give away a Bishop for a Knight on move 12. Kramnik was also forced to offer an exchange of Queens on move 13. Since a Bishop is considerably better than a Knight in an ending, Anand gladly exchanged the Queens. In addition to the Knight vs. Bishop disadvantage, the challenger was also saddled with a weak backward Pawn in the open c file.         
	To make things worse, the challenger made a dubious Knight retreat on the 17th move allowing the champion to pin and attack a Knight against the King rook.         
	Kramnik unpinned the Knight by sacrificing the backward Pawn and then started thinking, only to find that the Pawn was gone for good. However, after landing in a hopeless situation by giving up a Pawn for nothing, the challenger started playing good moves.         
	He chased Anands Bishop with his Knights and forced it to retreat to its starting square. However, Anand regrouped his pieces and neutralised Kramniks threats by move 29. In an unsuccessful attempt to complicate the matters, Kramnik sacrificed another Pawn on the 30th move. Anand won the Pawn advanced his Passed Pawns with the support of his well coordinated pieces. On move 45, Anand sacrificed his Rook to Queen a King side Pawn and forced the challenger to give up on move 47.         
	Kramnik, who is the only human to have defeated the great Kasprov in a match, seems to be undergoing a very difficult time. His unscientific play in the opening and middlegame on Tuesday would make even a beginner blush. In fact, the amateur spectators on the internet chess club have started calling him Patznik, and although it is in very poor taste to make such a comment about such an outstanding player, it is difficult to criticise the critics after seeing the quality of Kramniks play.         
	The seventh game of the match will be played on Thursday, 23rd October, after a rest day.

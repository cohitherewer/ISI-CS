The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Okolie sinks Vasco
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Okolie sinks Vasco
                      
	Margao: Vasco found Odafa Okolie too hot to handle as he scored a hattrick to guide Churchill Brothers to a thumping 4-1 win in the ONGC I-League, played at Nehru stadium, here Saturday.         
	The winners, who led 3-0 at half-time, scored through Odafa Okolie (40th, 44th, 62nd) and Felix Chimaokwu (41st).         
	Vasco, who were busy defending their citadel in the first half, reduced the margin through substitute Agnelo Colaco.         
	Churchill, who scored their third win, have now collected 10 points from four matches. While Vasco are at the bottom with one point from five matches.         
	Vasco, with their strategy to play defensive and attack on the counter, employed five men in the midfield to frustrate Churchill moves. Odafa gave an early sign of things to come when he fell back and played a pass to Felix Chimaokwu whose shot hit the bar.         
	Odafa then again fed to Chandam Singh who essayed a left-footer which was tipped over by keeper Laxmikant Kattimani to frustrate a Churchill attempt for an early goal.         
	Laxmikant again came to his sides rescue when he blocked Odafas shot.         
	Meanwhile, Dempo will take on Air-India in an I-League match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pradeep, Dias in a tight spot
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Pradeep, Dias in a tight spot
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Three Mahindra United players, who have applied to play for Calcutta clubs this season, are unlikely to be cleared by the AIFF Players Status Committee, which meets here on Thursday.         
	While N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias have sought transfers to play for East Bengal, Subhasis Roy Chowdhury wanted to join Chirag United. Mahindra have objected to their transfers.         
	Pradeep and Dias, however, claimed that they signed the two-year contract only after verbal assurances that if need be, Mahindra will release them.         
	We have been cheated by Mahindra, alleged one of the two players.         
	Both Pradeep and Dias are already in Delhi and will stand before the status committee. But given the fact that Mahindra have a written contract to show, two of them are unlikely to be let off.         
	The cases against the two players are extremely tight, said a source in the AIFF.         
	The two players have written a letter saying that they had problems in adjusting with the food in Mumbai and it was the main reason why they opted for Calcutta. This argument may not be enough to convince the committee members, he added.

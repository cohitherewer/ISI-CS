The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai FC lock horns with AI
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mumbai FC lock horns with AI
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: A mouth-watering clash is on the cards as both Mumbai FC and Air India try to shrug off last weeks defeats and return to winning ways when they clash in the sixth round of I-League at the Cooperage on Saturday.         
	Air India went down 1-3 to Dempo Sports Club, while Mumbai FC lost 1-0 to Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	We did not have our two stoppers (Chiukwama Udofia and Syed Farid). They are key positions for any team. But those two players will be back tomorrow (Saturday), Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said on the eve of the match.         
	But like Ghosh, Mumbai FC coach David Booth, too, felt the loss to Sporting would not occupy his players mind on Saturday.         
	We didnt play well (against Sporting). We started well but dropped off. But we improved in the second half. We have to evolve from the pressure we had in that match. We created the pressure in the second half but didnt get the end product, Booth said after the teams training session.         
	Meanwhile, Booth has blasted the All India Football Federation for the unimaginative rescheduling of his teams clash against Dempo.

	Hyderabad: India squandered penalty corners galore but still pumped in three goals in each half to blank Singapore 6-0 and set up a semi-final clash with archrivals Pakistan in the sixth junior Asia Cup hockey tournament here on Monday.         
	Drag-flicker Diwakar Ram (31st, 64th, 67th minutes) scored three goals, while Roshan Minz (25th), S.V. Sunil (26th) and Gurwinder Singh Chandi (61st), too, sounded the board. In a Pool B match, Pakistan came back from a halfway 1-2 deficit to thrash Bangladesh 8-2 and finish second in the group, which pitted them against defending champions India in the semi-finals.         
	With Mondays resounding win, India topped Pool A, while South Korea led Pool B after crushing Oman 11-0. Japan beat Malaysia 3-1 on Monday and they will meet Korea in the other semi-final on Wednesday.         
	Though India did not break a sweat against lowly Singapore, their poor penalty corner conversion would remain a woe for coach AK Bansal. The hosts got as many as 13 penalty corners but could convert only three.         
	Earlier, Pakistan thrashed Bangladesh 8-2 despite trailing 1-2 at the halfway mark.

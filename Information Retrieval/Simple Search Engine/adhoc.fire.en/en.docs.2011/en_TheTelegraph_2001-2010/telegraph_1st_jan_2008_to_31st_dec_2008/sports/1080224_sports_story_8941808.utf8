                                                   Difficult to beat India: Hopes
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: Australian allrounder James Hopes feels India would be tough to beat on Sunday but with their bowlers at the top of their game, a win isnt impossible. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the eve of another encounter against India, Hopes said at last he feels that he belongs to the world stage.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Australian batsmen drawing a blank         
	Yes We are But our bowlers are doing an outstanding job. The conditions are making it difficult for our batters. Some of the pitches and really low and slow The batsmen are trying hard enough. We are batting first in most games so our bowlers know what they are bowling at which makes it easier for them.         
	Indian bowlers         
	Indian bowlers are doing so well. Ishant Sharma is outstanding. He could be regarded along with Mitchell Johnson as the two best young bowlers in the world. India are also going in with five bowlers. Hopefully, they can get around to a total that their bowlers can defend. The plan is actually working For us at the moment and for India as well. We hope to reach a target of 250-300 at the SCG on Sunday but will evaluate as the day goes on. If we get to 200, then we will try and make that enough.         
	Which team has the best chance on Sunday         
	I think the team whose batsmen stand up and get to 250 or 300 has a very good chance of winning. Some of the bowling is very, very good and of the highest standard and if that continues, its going to be tough work for the batsmen.         
	On the possibility of beating India         
	I dont think its going to be easy. India have some of the form bowlers and with class players such as Sachin, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and Yuvi (Yuvraj) in their ranks, they are a tough proposition. Once Yuvraj starts scoring, it makes a big difference.         
	About the pitches         
	They are just a bit slow Thats all they are. It takes a while to get in. As soon as your batting slides a little bit, you are down to 180.

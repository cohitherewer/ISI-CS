The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB chief quits
                                                                                                                                                                                                       PCB chief quits
                  Nasim Ashraf                     
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Nasim Ashraf quit on Monday in one of the first fall-outs of the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf.         
	The resignation of Ashraf was announced by the PCB just an hour after Musharraf resigned. After the President resigned, I also felt morally bound to resign, Ashraf, who was appointed PCB chief in 2006, said.         
	[That Ashraf was feeling the heat was reported by The Telegraph on May 9.]         
	Under the Pakistan cricket constitution, the President of the country appoints the cricket chief.         
	Ashraf said: I have informed him (Musharraf) that I can no longer continue my duties and would like to be relieved as cricket chairman.         
	Ashrafs resignation came soon after his return from the United States after a two-week vacation during which speculation was rife that he was waiting to see if Musharraf would survive the impeachment motion against him.         
	Ashraf said his resignation would not upset Pakistans preparations to host the Champions Trophy to be held from September 12.         
	The resignation of an individual does not affect the working of an institution and the Champions Trophy would be held on schedule and properly, he said. Ashraf was seen as very close to the outgoing President who brought him in to manage the National Commission for Human Development in 2002.         
	With less than a month remaining for the Champions Trophy and the new president to be appointed after 30 days, analysts believe that the government will move quickly to appoint a new chairman and may be even a new cricket set-up.

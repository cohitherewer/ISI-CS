The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super cop to super flop
                                                     Super cop to super flop
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            K.P.S. Gill                           
	Calcutta: Last August, it was the Chak de India cry which rent the air from Burdwan to Bhatinda. After the Olympic qualifiers fiasco in Santiago, its Chuck out Gill.         
	Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, though, remains unfazed. He was a super cop all right but has proved a super flop as the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) supremo.         
	Indeed, Gill has been around for almost a decade-and-a-half, but has little to show except the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games gold.         
	Its an era of accountability, but the IHF chief (who, by all accounts, has reigned with an iron fist) refuses to take anything on his shoulders.         
	Joaquim Carvalho has done the honourable thing by quitting  actually, one has lost count of the number of coaches whove either been sacked or have resigned in Gills era  but the supremo has been unmoved.         
	I dont just want him thrown out, I want him kicked out, thundered MP Gurudas Dasgupta, who keeps track of sport, on Monday evening.         
	A common enough sentiment that.         
	Another MP, as incensed, recalled the good old days when the nation would tune in to the radio commentary (Jasdev Singhs in particular) and keenly follow the exploits of the Ajit Pal Singhs and Zafar Iqbals.         
	Gill, of course, seems to have drawn some inspiration from Greg Chappell. A statement from him talked of a process having been put in place.         
	Its the former Team India coach who made process fashionable. Or, the most loathed word, depending on which side of the fence you were on.         
	One of the IHFs senior vice-presidents has quit, but why did he wait so long if he had such strong reservations over being Gills colleague?         
	Its the men within whore responsible for this shame.         
	Not too long ago, one of the selectors told The Telegraph: You know how our teams are picked... He was alluding to the IHF chiefs interference.         
	Need one say anything more?

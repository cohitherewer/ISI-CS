  Confusion prevailed at the launch ceremony of the tournament when Shoaib rsquo;s name was missing from the list of players from Islamabad.   Pak board accusation  Melbourne: Cricket authorities in Pakistan, meanwhile, have accused their Australian counterparts of double standards after they confirmed that Australia rsquo;s Test tour to India would go ahead. A senior official of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Tuesday that they expected the tour of India to go ahead because there was big money involved in the four-Test series which starts at the end of this month.  Shuttlers rsquo; training  New Delhi: Ace shuttlers Saina Nehwal and Anup Sridhar will be among 40 lsquo;core group rsquo; badminton players who will receive state-of-the-art training and exposure so that they can put their best foot forward when Delhi hosts the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

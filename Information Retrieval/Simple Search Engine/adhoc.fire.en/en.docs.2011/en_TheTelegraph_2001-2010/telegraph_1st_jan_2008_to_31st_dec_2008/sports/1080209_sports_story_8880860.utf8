                                                Confident Ill break into top 10: Zaman
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistans Mansoor Zaman, the fifth seed, is hopeful of breaking into the worlds top 10 by the end of this year.         
	I am confident of being into the top 10 by the end of 2008, Zaman, currently ranked 35, said after winning the Calcutta International Squash meet at the Calcutta Racket Club on Friday.         
	Zaman on Friday outplayed Malaysias Ong Beg Hee to clinch his first international title of the season.         
	I was confident. I trained hard keeping this tournament in mind and got the result, he said. Zaman will take part in a five-star $50,000 meet to be held in Kuala Lumpur from March 5.         
	Winning this tournament has helped boost my confidence. I hope this good form continues in Malaysia too, he said before leaving the city on Thursday night.         
	Talking about his win over Hee, Zaman said: We have been playing each other since the junior level. We know each others game well and I managed to exploit his weak points and win the match.         
	Admitting that his opponent was superb in the final, Hee said: I am disappointed but today Zaman was simply unbelievable, virtually unplayable.         
	If he continues playing in this manner he will surely reach the top 10 by the end of this year, Hee said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Federer beats Murray. Wins 5th US Open
                                        Roger Federer of Switzerland holds up the trophy after defeating Andy Murray of the United Kingdom to win the 2008 U.S. Open Men's Championship Match in Arthur Ashe Stadium at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center (Getty Images/AFP)        Roger Federer ended Andy Murray's historic run at the US Open, beating the 21 year old British player 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 in a fairly one-sided match. The Swiss champion has now won five US Opens in a row, a feat that was last accomplished by William quot;Big Bill quot; Tilden in 1924. Murray, who had beaten Nadal comprehensively in four sets in the semi-finals and had entered the finals fairly confident of meeting the former number one who seemed to be having a fairly bad season. Federer had failed to win a single Grand Slam this year, losing to Rafael Nadal in the French Open and Wimbledon, and to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open. He also lost his number one spot in ATP rankings to Nadal a few weeks ago.
    But in the US finals, Federer could do no wrong and Murray just watched as the Swiss completely outplayed him. Federer was completely precise in his shots and his serves were unplayable. Murray who was hoping to be first British winner of US Open in 72 years didn't have an answer today. Murray had come into the final with a better record against Federer than most. Till this match, the two had met three times, of which Murray had won two.
    With this win, Federer has taken his Grand Slam crowns to 13, just one short of Peter Sampras' record of 14.

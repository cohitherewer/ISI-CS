                                                                                                                                                                                                     Basant wreaks havoc vs Punjab
                      
	Bhubaneswar: Orissas Basant Mohanty played wrecker-in-chief as the hosts capitalised on a seaming wicket to bundle out Punjab for a paltry 60 on the first day of the Ranji Trophy elite division match here on Sunday.         
	Invited to bat first, the visitors failed to negotiate Orissas bowling attack. 21-year-old medium pacer Basant bagged seven wickets for just 27 runs.         
	In Rajkot, tons by debutant Chirag Pathak and Bhushan Chauhan helped Saurashtra post 285 runs for one against Mumbai on Day I at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground . Opted to bat first, Saurashtra openers capitalised on what seems to be a placid pitch.

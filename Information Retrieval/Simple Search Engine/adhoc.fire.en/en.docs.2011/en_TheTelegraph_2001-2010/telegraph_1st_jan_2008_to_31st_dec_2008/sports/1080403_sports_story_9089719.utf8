                                                     Bengal in semis
                  Shukla hit 124                     
	Visakhapatnam: Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas 95-ball blitzkrieg 124 helped Bengal beat Delhi by 48 runs to breeze into the semi-finals of the national one-dayers on Wednesday.         
	Riding on Shuklas swashbuckling century that included 16 fours apart from a couple of sixes, Bengal amassed 295 for five wickets in 47 overs.         
	In reply, Delhi were folded for 247 in 43.4 overs despite India under-19 World Cup winning captain Virat Kohlis run-a-ball 56.         
	For Bengal, S.S. Paul baggged three for 42.         
	Bengal openers  debutant Sreevats Goswami (25), and Sourasish Lahiri (40) gave the side a good start. Though the openers and Manoj Tiwary (5) fell in quick succession, captain Shukla was hardly unfazed.         
	Delhi lost opener Aditya Jain (1) early before Shikhar Dhawan (47) and Gambhir (31) joined hands in the middle.         
	Kohli and Pradeep Chawla (35) tried their best but it proved too late and too little in the end.           (PTI)

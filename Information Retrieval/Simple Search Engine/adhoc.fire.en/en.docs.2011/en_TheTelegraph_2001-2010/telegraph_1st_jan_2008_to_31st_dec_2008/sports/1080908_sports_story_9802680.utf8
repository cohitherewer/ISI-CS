The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A lot more at stake than just the title

	New York: Two women with the flair to carry a moment will intersect at one momentous prime-time juncture inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	For Serena Williams, its a return to the US Open final after an absence  whose duration of six years pretty much rates as startling.         
	For Jelena Jankovic, its a first try at a Grand Slam final just one month after her single week at No. 1 drew lampooning because she never had graced such a stage.         
	For both, its a chance to reclaim No. 1, and for both, its another culmination of stardom derived from unlikely beginnings.         
	Williams could state her longevity by returning to No. 1, after bouncing around beneath the throne for five years. Having come from a childhood in Compton and then Florida, she could extend her familys improbable story by claiming a 16th Williams Grand Slam singles title, nine for herself and seven for her sister, Venus.         
	Ive been way more consistent, said Serena, whose sister Isha Price has noticed the return of her joy, five years after the murder of their sister, Yetunde Price.         
	Playing a lot more, having more consistent results, and just putting in the effort  Its like I think my results are finally showing, Williams said. You know, if I dont practice, then its like my mind goes nuts. Its like, I couldve been out on the court.         
	Jankovic might take her first Grand Slam trophy if she plays the kind of defence that felled Olympic champion Elena Dementieva in the semi-finals. Says her mother Snezana, who travels with her: In these circles, if you are not positive, how will you survive?

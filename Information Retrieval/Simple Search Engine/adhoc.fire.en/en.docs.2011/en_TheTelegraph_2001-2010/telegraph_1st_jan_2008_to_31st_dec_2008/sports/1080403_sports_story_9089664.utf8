                                                     SA strategy not a worry: Sehwag
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag during a practice session at the Motera on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Ahmedabad: The Virender Sehwag storm is still raging in the South African camp and it wont die down in Motera, for sure.         
	So devastating was the Team India openers impact in Chennai that Graeme Smith amp; Co. are contemplating special plans to contain him.         
	If coach Mickey Arthur revealed chin music for Sehwag the other day, Smith confirmed it on the match-eve, saying his bowlers would counter the batsmen with bodyline stuff.         
	Sehwag, betraying no emotion, took the rivals strategy in his stride on Thursday. Ill play my natural game. Anybody can think of any strategy, but my philosophy will remain simple: if a ball is there to be hit, Ill hit it. Thats it, the Delhi dasher said after the nets session.         
	Sehwags career-best 319 catapulted him to the 12th spot in the ICC Test rankings, making him the highest ranked Indian in the current batting chart. He jumped 13 places leapfrogging Rahul Dravid (13th), Sachin Tendulkar (15th) and V.V.S. Laxman (18th) in the process.         
	But isnt it a mind game that South Africa are playing on him?         
	I am not too concerned about what the others are thinking, pat came the reply.         
	Perhaps a lull before another storm.         
	Former captain Sourav Ganguly, too, believes that Sehwag, when on song, cannot be contained.         
	The Motera remains a happy hunting ground for the left-hander who has scored two of his 15 Test centuries here, both against New Zealand.         
	You have to keep on performing, both here and elsewhere Thats the key, Sourav said, before heading towards the team hotel with Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Self-belief has made the difference, says Raina
                                                                                                                                                                                             Self-belief has made the difference, says Raina
  - Life hasnt changed for the in-form Team India batsman       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Karachi: Self-belief, more than anything else, has made the biggest difference for young Suresh Raina.         
	An exceptional run in the ongoing Asia Cup has seen the 21-year-old bag the MoM award in all three of Team Indias matches. Of course, batting up the order has been a big advantage.         
	Self-belief has taken me to 301 runs in the tournament... In fact, something within tells me that I have another big one coming... Which match, though, I dont know... What I do know is that Im not lacking self-belief... I can do it... That, indeed, is my approach, Raina told The Telegraph.         
	Has life changed over the past few days?         
	Speaking informally at the Pearl Continental on Sunday afternoon, Raina replied: Nahin, waisi koi baat nahin hai... Im happy that Ive got runs... Now, Ive got to keep this momentum going... One needs to bat according to the situation and calculated risks have to be taken.         
	He added: It was tough being out of the team for more than a year (after surgery on the left knee; comeback was in Dhaka this month)... However, I kept reminding myself that Ive got to build on the starts I get...That its important to convert 30s and 40s to big ones... Thanks to God, Ive managed to do so in this Asia Cup...         
	But was his heart in the mouth when Mahmudullah got under the top-edge off Mashrafe Mortaza, on Saturday, only to spill the chance on 16?         
	Look, thats part of the game... The shot was on, its just that the ball came slower and didnt go off the middle of the bat... Had it done so, it wouldve been a six... It was a let off, yes, and a signal for me to again get back to the basics...         
	Surely, expectations have gone up appreciably. How will this increased pressure be countered?         
	Pressure ka sawaal nahin hai... Before the tournament began, (captain Mahendra Singh) Dhoni asked me to enjoy the outing... Also that I must stick to my strength, which is hitting in front of the wicket... Ive followed his advice, as also the advice of the coach (Gary Kirsten) and (vice-captain) Yuvraj Singh, Raina answered.         
	Asked about former coach Greg Chappells contribution in his development as a cricketer, he said: Yes, he worked with me... Worked with others too...         
	For the record, Chappell regarded Raina as special, somebody who needed proper handling.         
	Raina, incidentally, dedicated his hattrick of MoM awards to family, friends and teammates whod been a source of strength during the many months that he was off cricket.         
	Getting a bit emotional, he signed off saying: It was a very difficult period, but my family and friends gave me the confidence to go forward... Teammates kept my morale up by calling or sending messages... Im indebted to them...         
	Today, Team India is indebted to Raina.

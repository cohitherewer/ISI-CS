The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib ignores PCB notices
                                                     Shoaib ignores PCB notices
                  Shoaib Akhtar                     
	Karachi: Temperamental fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has gone on the warpath with the PCB, insisting that he will not respond to any notices sent to him by the PCB over his recent statements in the media.         
	Shoaib told reporters after the Pentangular Cup match between Federal Areas and Punjab at the Gaddafi on Wednesday that since he was not a contracted player of the PCB, the board has no right to question him over what he said in the media.         
	I am not contracted to them. So I am not bound to respond to their notice. They cant seek any explanation from me, he said. They can send me as many notices as they want but I know my rights When I am not contracted to them, Im not going to answer.         
	The PCB and Shoaib have been at loggerheads for a while and after being dropped from the new central contracts list, the bowler accused the board of having double standards and of having a dual policy on players.         
	The PCB has given him seven days to explain or withdraw his statement. But on Wednesday, Shoaib was highly vocal in his criticism of the boards policies.         
	Having gone wicketless on a dead track in the domestic match, Shoaib said the domestic tournament being organised by the board was more like a B grade one.         
	What purpose is served by preparing such a pitch! Who will gain from it! We have had to use dead Kookaburra balls in the match. But by bowling 18 overs I have proved my match fitness to everyone, he said.         
	Shoaib also made it clear he would play just one more match in the Pentangular Cup as he had prior commitments.         
	He also dismissed the boards statement that he needed to sign a retainer with them to get an NOC to play in the IPL. Why do I need an NOC from them. I have no contracts. So why this? Secondly, this is a matter between me and the IPL and not the board, he stated.

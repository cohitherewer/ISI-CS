                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Lankans, English players may miss IPL  
	London: The next edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) might lose some of its sheen with a number of Sri Lankan players, along with a few English IPL probables, skipping the event for international commitments.  
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced the dates of a home series against Sri Lanka and the two-Test series, starting on May 7, coincides with the IPL, which is scheduled between April 10 and May 29 next year.         
	Sri Lanka is scheduled to kick off their England tour with a practice game against Leicestershire on April 21. Among the Sri Lankans, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidharan, Ajantha Mendis and Sanath Jayasuriya have three-year contracts with different IPL teams.         
	English cricketers like Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff are also reportedly on the IPL radar and in such case it would be a dilemma for the Englishmen as well.         
	India slip to third place

	P. Sen Trophy         
	 Calcutta: Both P. Sen Trophy matches on Wednesday, were decided via bowlout after rain played spoilsport, says A Staff Reporter.

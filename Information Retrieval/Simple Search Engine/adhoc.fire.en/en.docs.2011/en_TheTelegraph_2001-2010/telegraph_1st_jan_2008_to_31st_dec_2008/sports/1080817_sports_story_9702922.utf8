The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sinking feeling grips PCB
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sinking feeling grips PCB
                              
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board ran quarter-page advertisements in newspapers on Saturday announcing the launch of Champions Trophy, but there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle among its officials and they are expecting the worst in the next few days, say sources.         
	According to well-informed sources in the board, strong chances are that the Champions Trophy might be relocated or postponed even as Australia and New Zealand refused to confirm their participation despite briefings from ICC task force in the last 48 hours on the security arrangements being made for the event slated to be held from September 12.         
	Some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in Pakistan when Muslims the world over fast in the holy month of Ramazan, one source said.         
	The truth is that even within the PCB there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days, said the source, who is well aware of the cricket developments, said.         
	The same feeling is prevailing in the ICC camp office in Lahore although no one is willing to speak on record.         
	If the ICC manages to convince the teams that Champions Trophy should be held in Pakistan then it would be a major achievement, but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage travelling to Pakistan, the source said.         
	Even former players are questioning the role of PCB during the exercise being carried out by the ICC task force to convince teams to play in Pakistan.         
	PCB chairman Nasim Ashrafs continued absence from the country (as he is in the United States with his family reportedly on vacation) and the failure of the board to send senior board and security officials with the task force have come under scrutiny.

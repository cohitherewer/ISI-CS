The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clark, Lee tear Windies apart
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Clark, Lee tear Windies apart
                      
	Kingston: Stuart Clark and Brett Lee sliced through the West Indian batting line-up to reduce the hosts to 117 for six at lunch on the final day of the first Test at Sabina Park on Monday.         
	The West Indies, chasing 287 to win added just six runs to their overnight score of 46 for one, before they lost their captain Ramnaresh Sarwan to Clark for 12.         
	Sarwan tried to push Clark through the on-side, found a leading edge and Symonds took a brilliant catch at extra-cover, tipping the ball up one-handed before grabbing it at the second attempt.         
	That was a huge breakthrough for the tourists and it was not long before that Clark removed his third victim when opener Devon Smith was trapped leg before for 28 offering no shot to leave the hosts struggling at 60 for three.         
	Runako Morton made the small gathering cheer a little with two successive boundaries off Lee but was then caught leg before in the same over by the Australian and the run chase was petering out into a familiar West Indian crash.         
	Dwayne Bravo failed to score, falling into a set trap.         
	Ricky Ponting put Mitchell Johnson in short mid-on and Bravo drove a full length Clark delivery straight into his grateful hands.         
	Clark was able to make the most of the track with his nagging line and awkward bounce proving too much for the home batsmen.         
	Shivnarine Chanderpaul was next to go and with him went any lingering hope of even a form of a fightback from the home side.         
	With a heavily off-side field, Chanderpaul (11) tried to play Lee through mid-wicket but got himself tangled up and merely punched the ball back for a caught and bowled.

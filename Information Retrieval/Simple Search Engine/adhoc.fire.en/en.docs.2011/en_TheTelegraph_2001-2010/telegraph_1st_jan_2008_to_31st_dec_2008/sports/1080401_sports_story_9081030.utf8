                                                   Sehwag jumps 13 places to No. 12 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwags career best 319 catapulted him to the 12th spot in the latest issue of LG ICC Test rankings, making him the top-ranked Indian batsman in the list.         
	In the process, Sehwag leapfrogged compatriots Rahul Dravid (13th), Sachin Tendulkar 15th) and V.V.S. Laxman (18th).         
	Sehwag, whose triple century was the fastest recorded in Test history (278 balls), jumped 13 places after a massive 17 per cent rise in his rating. Sehwags ranking is his highest in two years. In 2004, the 29-year-old from Delhi batsman had jumped to second place behind team-mate Rahul Dravid.         
	On current form, Sehwag has a realistic chance of returning to the top 10. He is within touching distance of 10th-ranked Kevin Pietersen of England who is just behind ninth-placed Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies.         
	Dravid gained two places to 13th spot following his 25th Test century while Tendulkar dropped three places to 15th position after a fifth-ball duck in the Chennai Test. Laxman fell one place to 18th position.         
	Besides Sehwag, South Africas batting duo of Hashim Amla and Neil McKenzie also made significant upward movement.         
	Amla, who made scores of 159 and 81, jumped up 10 places to a career-best 24th spot while McKenzie, who contributed 94 and 155 not out, jumped 26 places to 36th position. It is McKenzies first time in the top 40 in four years.         
	Harbhajan Singh climbed four places to 24th position after match figures of eight for 265. The 28-year-old stands a good chance of returning to top 20 as only 25 ratings points separates him from James Franklin of New Zealand, who occupies 20th place.

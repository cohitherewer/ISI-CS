                                                   Dale Steyn bowls SA to series win

           
	Durban: Dale Steyn bowled South Africa to a series victory over the West Indies in the third Test on Saturday. 
    
	Steyn claimed six for 72 as South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs with two days to spare to wrap up a 2-1 series win. 
    
	West Indies, who needed 417 to make South Africa bat again, were dismissed for 317 with Marlon Samuels on 105 as their top scorer. 
    
	West Indian opener Brenton Parchment, meanwhile, has been charged under International Cricket Councils Code of Conduct for running into South African fast bowler Dale Steyn during the ongoing Test.

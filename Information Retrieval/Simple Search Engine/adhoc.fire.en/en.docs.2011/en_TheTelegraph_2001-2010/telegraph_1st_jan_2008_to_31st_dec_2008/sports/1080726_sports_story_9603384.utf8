	Toronto: Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy set up a quarter final clash with Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles after a straight-set win over Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka in the second round of the ATP Rogers Masters.         
	The seventh-seeded Indo-Czech pair beat their unseeded Swiss rivals 6-4, 6-4 in a contest lasting less than an hour.         
	Such was their domination that they held serve throughout the match and did not face a single break point in the opening set.         
	The Indo-Czech pair converted the only break point that came their way in the opener and won 91 per cent of their service points to go one up.         
	The second set followed a similar script and the seventh seeds broke Federer and Wawrinka once again, before sealing the issue in their favour.         
	Fourth seeds Bhupathi and Knowles had an even easier passage to the quarterfinals as they were handed a second-round walk over by Americans Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish.

	Cristiano Ronaldo may be the favourite to be crowned World Player of the Year but, according to new figures, he is down to joint-eighth place on a list of the highest-paid footballers.         
	The table, published in a popular sports blog, is topped by AC Milans Kaka on 143,438 a week, or just under  7.5million a year, while Ronaldos weekly wage is said to be just more than 20,000 less on 122,400.         
	On Monday night, Ronaldo scored his 36th goal of the season in Manchester Uniteds 2-0 win against Roma in what has been a remarkable season.         
	If United reach the Champions League final and he scores in each of the clubs remaining matches, he stands to equal Denis Laws United record of 46 goals, set in 1964.         
	Ronaldo, though, is still behind the likes of Ronaldinho, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Fernando Torres, Michael Ballack and also Andrei Shevchenko in the rich list.         
	Indeed, there are seven Premier League and four Chelsea players in a top 10 that is completed by Thierry Henry and Steven Gerrard.         
	Shevchenko has not started a match for Chelsea since Boxing Day and has scored eight goals in 30 Premier League starts since his 30m move from AC Milan two years ago.         
	Surprising names in the league table of footballers wages include Portsmouths Sol Campbell, who is placed 15th and is said to earn more than 105,000 a week, Tottenhams Darren Bent, whose salary is put at 94,669, and Liverpools Harry Kewell, in 39th place on an estimated 76,500.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania falters 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sania falters 
                      
	Los Angeles: Sania Mirza was once again shown the door in the second round when she lost in straight sets to Meng Yuan at the $600,000 East West Bank Classic tournament.         
	The 16th seed Indian lost to her unseeded Chinese opponent 4-6, 3-6 in one and a half hour contention to crash out of the hard court WTA event.         
	Sania broke Yuan once and dropped her own serve twice to go down in the first set.         
	Then in the second, Sania could convert just three out of six breakpoints while the Chinese cashed in on all the five breakpoints to snatch the match away from the Indian.         
	The defeat came as a big jolt to Indian fans who have pinned hopes on this Hyderabadi ace to win a medal at Beijing Olympics. Sania had also lost her second round matches at WTA events in Birmingham, Hertogenbosch, and at Wimbledon singles last month.         
	Last week, she succumbed to a British qualifier in the first round of the Stanford WTA tournament.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles did not have to do anything to enter the quarter final of the $2,615,000 ATP Rogers Masters as they got a walk over from their opponents in the second round.         
	The fourth-seeded Indo-Bahamas duo was up against American pair of Mardy Fish and Andy Roddick, who conceded the match because of knee injury to Fish.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles are yet to play a single ball in the tournament as the pair had also got a bye in the first round. (PTI)

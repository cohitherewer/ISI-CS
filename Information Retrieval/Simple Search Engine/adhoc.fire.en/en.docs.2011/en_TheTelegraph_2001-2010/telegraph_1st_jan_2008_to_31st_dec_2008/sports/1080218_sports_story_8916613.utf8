The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson wins mind game over Wenger
                                                     Ferguson wins mind game over Wenger

	It was another of those Old Trafford spankings that hurt Arsenal, I suspect, more than anything else the domestic game has to offer. Arsene Wenger and his squad could cope with last months 5-1 defeat in the Carling Cup at local rivals Tottenham. But how will they react to this?         
	Suddenly the rest of the season seems less predictable. Wenger managed a joke afterwards  We dont concede many goals, he said, but when we do we do it well  but the minds of neutrals had already been drawn back to October 2004, when Arsenal came here intending to complete a half-century of Premier League matches undefeated.         
	You may recall they suffered a few harsh tackles  the Neville brothers were especially attentive to Jose Antonio Reyess ankles  and a couple of poor refereeing decisions and, in consequence, a 0-2 defeat that made Wenger so angry he became involved in a confrontation with Sir Alex Ferguson. At least on that occasion, after which it became apparent that Chelsea under Jose Mourinho were capable of overtaking both clubs to become the leading force in the English game, Wenger vented his ire on the opposition; when Arsenal had lost 1-6 on this ground in February 2001, he had raged at his own players.         
	Only the other day Ray Parlour was saying: It was the first  and only  time I had heard him swear like that. Arsenal won nothing that season. Lets just hope the mascots had been safely ushered out of earshot by the time Manchester United took control Saturday.         
	The first goal may have involved an element of luck  with Emmanuel Eboue and Armand Traore still guarding the posts after the partial clearance of a corner, Wayne Rooney was onside and unmarked as he headed deftly past Jens Lehmann  and the second a brilliant combination by Nani and Darren Fletcher, but the third summed up how flimsy the visitors structure had been from the start.         
	Arsenal were especially grateful for the resolve of Lehmann; twice before the interval he was out bravely to thwart Rooney, whose every movement had Arsenals defence, even William Gallas, panicking. Young Traore, of whom much had been expected until Aaron Lennon shook his confidence at White Hart Lane, ineptly played Nani onside for the third goal.         
	Wengers renowned midfield, meanwhile, did little to relieve the pressure, frequently giving the ball away on a surface that, although as untrustworthy as Wenger said, did not prevent United from playing penetrative football. Shortly after Lehmann had done well to catch a deflected free-kick from Rooney, what remained of Arsenals discipline began to evaporate.         
	Recently Ferguson has started to chip away at them in the newspapers. No wonder he had his players so fired up for this match. Would this rout make a difference? I hope so, said Uniteds manager. His players would approach the remaining matches with even more relish. And as for Arsenal, who are due here in the league in less than two months, theyll certainly know theyre going to have a game.

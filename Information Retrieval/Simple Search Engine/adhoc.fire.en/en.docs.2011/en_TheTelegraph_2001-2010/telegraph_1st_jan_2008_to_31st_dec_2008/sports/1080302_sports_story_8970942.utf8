                                                   ACC looks to Australia for sponsors in China
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sydney: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is looking to Cricket Australia  and the Australian government too  to help arrange sponsors for cricket in China.         
	Sounds unusual, but the Australians trade big with the Chinese and its assumed that companies in Australia would be interested.         
	Towards that end, the ACCs chief executive, Syed Ashraful Huq, is in town and he has already met a host of people.         
	Im hopeful that things will work out for the benefit of Chinese cricket, Huq told The Telegraph.         
	China is an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council and has Associate Member status in the ACC.         
	The 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou will, incidentally, feature Twenty20 cricket. It will be a first.

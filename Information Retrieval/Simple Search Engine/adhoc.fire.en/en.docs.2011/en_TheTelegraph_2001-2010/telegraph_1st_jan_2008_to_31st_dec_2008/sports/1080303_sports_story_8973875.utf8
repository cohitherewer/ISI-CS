            A CORRESPONDENT            BOY ZONE: The Indian Under-19 team with the trophy in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Kuala Lumpur: The Indians held their nerves in a rain-curtailed final to regain the under-19 World Cup at the Kinrara Oval on Sunday. They had earlier won the title in 1999-2000.         
	After dismissing India for 159, South Africa were reduced to 17 for three in 8.4 overs when rain stopped play. Under the Duckworth-Lewis system, the Proteas needed 99 off 98 balls once play resumed. Needing 19 off the last over, South Africa finished on 103 for eight in 25 overs.         
	Reeza Hendricks and Wayne Parnell batted confidently after the break, but failed to capitalise on the two dropped chances and a missed stumping. Hendricks and Parnell added 50 for the fifth wicket in 57 balls, but Hendricks fell at a crucial juncture for 35 off 43 balls. South Africa required 44 off five overs, but lost the plot.         
	After Man of the Match Ajitesh Argals two wickets (5-2-7-2) at the start of the innings, left-arm spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Iqbal Abdullah struck at regular intervals to peg South Africa back.         
	They conceded only 12 off their final overs, leaving Siddharth Kaul 19 runs to defend in the last over. The first ball was paddled by Bradley Barnes past short fine-leg for four, but the next five deliveries yielded only two.         
	We bowled in the right areas and concentrated in doing that. Batsmen cant always win a game, bowlers too have a role to play, said Argal.         
	Earlier India were restricted to 159 after some fine pace bowling by Parnell and Matthew Arnold, along with brilliant all-round fielding by the South Africans. India succumbed to the pressure right from the first over  a maiden by Parnell  and, with the exception of Tanmay Srivastava, never looked like dominating the attack.         
	The Indians found it tough to get past the inner circle. A frustrated Virat Kohli and Srivastava tried to clear the top, but both found Sybrand Engelbrecht, who pulled off stunning catches to break the backbone of Indias middle-order. Engelbrechts athleticism also resulted in the run out of Iqbal Abdullah.         
	Not just Engelbrecht, the entire team showed tremendous anticipation and presence of mind on the field. Wicketkeeper Barnes continued his impressive form with three catches and one stumping.                     
	Saurabh Tiwary was brilliantly stumped after he and Manish Pandey had threatened a late-order comeback.         
	Only Srivastava provided some semblance of respect to the Indian total with 46 (74 balls, 4x4, 1x6).         
	The Indians started on a disastrous note after being put into bat, losing openers Taruwar Kohli and Sreevats Goswami cheaply. Kohli top-edged an attempted pull and Sreevats, who had a sedate start, offered a regulation catch to second slip. The Indians found it tough to counter the raw pace and swing of Parnell and Arnold.         
	Manager Gopal Bose was, however, not happy with the wicket. The middle strip at the Kinrara Oval was reserved for the final  a virgin wicket which should have been used before. It was difficult for the batsmen to go for strokes. This, however, doesnt justify our poor shot selection, said Bose.         
	How does he rate the performance? We were the strongest side in the group and have played true to our capabilities. In the league stage, we were in the group of death. The batsmen and bowlers complemented each other, Bose added.

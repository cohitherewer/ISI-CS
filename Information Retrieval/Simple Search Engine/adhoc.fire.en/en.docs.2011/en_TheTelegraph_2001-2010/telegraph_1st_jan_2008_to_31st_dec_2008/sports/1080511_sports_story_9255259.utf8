The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Force India to start from last rows
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Force India to start from last rows
                                  
	Istanbul: Both the Force India cars will start at the last rows of the grid at Sundays Turkish Grand Prix with Adrian Sutil starting at 19th followed by teammate Giancarlo Fisichella.         
	Fisichella finished 19th at the qualifying session after clocking his fastest lap with a timing of 1:27.807 but will have to start from the end because of three grid place penalty handed to him Friday.         
	Sutil got the 20th position at qualifying after registering his fastest lap with a timing of 1:28.325 but will start ahead of Fisichella.         
	The Indian team oozed confidence of doing well despite the low qualifying slots.         
	My car in the free practice had a few problems with the balance so we did a few changes between the sessions and it was better for the afternoon, Sutil said. I did a clean lap and the team did a good job with the car. We just need more grip and more downforce to move forward with the grid position, Fisichella said.           (PTI)

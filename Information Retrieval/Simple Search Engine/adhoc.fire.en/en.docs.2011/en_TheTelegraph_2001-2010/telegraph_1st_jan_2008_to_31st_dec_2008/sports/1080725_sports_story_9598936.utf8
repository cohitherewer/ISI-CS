                                                                                                                                                                                           DAY II HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	 Malinda Warnapura (115) brought up the second Test match hundred of his career. He scored 120 to score his first century vs West Indies at Providence in March 2008.         
	 The 155-run partnership for the third wicket between Warnapura and Mahela Jayawardene was the 20th century stand for the third wicket on this ground. Jayawardene has now been involved in nine of them.         
	 Mahela Jayawardene (136) scored the 23rd century of his Test career. It also was his fourth vs India and ninth on this ground.         
	 By scoring his 20th hundred at the No. 4 position, Jayawardene joins an elite list of batsmen with 20 or more hundreds at this batting spot. The others are  Sachin Tendulkar (34), Brian Lara (24), Jacques Kallis (21).         
	 Jayawardene scored his ninth Test hundred at the SSC to equal a 60-year-old record of Sir Don Bradman. Sir Don had scored nine of his Test centuries at the MCG alone. Graham Gooch, Matthew Hayden and Michael Vaughan have scored six centuries each at Lords, Melbourne and Lords respectively.         
	 Incidentally, eight out of nine centuries scored by Jayawardene at the SSC ground have come in the first innings.         
	 SSC has now become the third in the list of subcontinent venues with most Test centuries. Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore (75) and National Stadium, Karachi (69) are in front of SSC (65) in the list.         
	 Jayawardene completed 1000 Test runs against India on Thursday. He has also scored 1000 Test runs against England (1581) and South Africa (1472). He became only the second Sri Lankan after Aravinda de Silva (1252) to do so.         
	 It is now the sixth time that there have been three or more centuries in an innings by Sri Lanka in Tests and the 26th time a team has scored three or more hundreds against India         
	 It was the seventh time in his career that Zaheer Khan conceded 100 plus runs in Tests.

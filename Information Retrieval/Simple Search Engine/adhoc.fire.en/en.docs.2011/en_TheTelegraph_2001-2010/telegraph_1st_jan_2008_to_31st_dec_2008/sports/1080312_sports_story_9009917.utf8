	Chandigarh: The money generated through the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be used to improve cricketing infrastructure, former Indian captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi said Tuesday.  
	He said money will be used to improve infrastructure so that not only cricketers, but spectators too are able to take benefit from the improved facilities.         
	Both the players and spectators should get best facilities, Pataudi said.         
	Pataudi, who is a member of the IPL committee, will be inaugurating a two-day IPL seminar for the curators and turf managers at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Wednesday.

	Ranatunga fear         
	Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga fears that the huge amount of money offered to players by ventures like IPL and ICL can adversely affect the youngsters.         
	I have no problems with cricketers earning money when they get an opportunity, but its the young players who can lose focus with money, Ranatunga, currently the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, said. I hope this (losing focus) will not be the case and cricket will not be a business. The problem will start when money ruins the focus of young players, he added.         
	Harris hopeful         
	Dhaka: South Africas tour of Bangladesh is ideal preparation for the forthcoming Test series in India, off-spinner Paul Harris said on Tuesday.

	Conditions in Bangladesh are very similar to India, I am looking forward to it, Harris said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McGrath hails captain Warne
                                                                                                                                                                                                       McGrath hails captain Warne

	New Delhi: Ian Chappell believes Shane Warne is probably the best captain Australia never had. Glenn McGrath doesnt go that far but the Delhi DareDevils spearhead believes his former teammate has done an outstanding job leading the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.         
	Warne has galvanised a bunch of unheralded youngsters, along with the likes of Graeme Smith, to a formidable outfit, which has shrugged its defeat in the first match and went on to register five wins in a row to soar to the top of the table.         
	McGrath is naturally impressed by whatever he has seen of Warne the captain so far in the IPL. He is a great player and he leads from the front, McGrath told reporters here Tuesday.         
	He has done a great job in putting the team together and motivating them to give their best, said McGrath. He, however, made it clear that he would not hold anything back when his side locks horn with Warne and his teammates. I would love to play against Shane and win he said.         
	Delhi DareDevils have already defeated the Rajasthan Royals in the April 19 tie in Delhi and the rivalry would be renewed again on May 11.

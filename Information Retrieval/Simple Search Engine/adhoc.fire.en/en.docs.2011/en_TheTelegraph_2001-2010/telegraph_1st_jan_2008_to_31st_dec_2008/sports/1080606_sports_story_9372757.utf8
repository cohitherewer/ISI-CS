The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India beat Pak, in last four
                                                                                                                                                                                                       India beat Pak, in last four
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            N.P. Pradeep                           
	New Delhi: India survived a second-half scare to beat Pakistan 2-1 and enter the semi-finals of the SAFF Cup in the Maldives on Thursday.         
	The hard-earned victory at the rain-soaked National Stadium in Male came as a big relief for the injury-hit Indians. They can now relax a bit on the eve of their last league match against the hosts, who, too, are firmly placed for a place in the last four.         
	It wasnt a cake walk for India as their neighbours from across the border were determined to match the defending champions move for move and played lots of passes to stretch the Indian defence.         
	Things looked smooth for the Indians in the first half when they scored both their goals but the Pakistanis came back strongly after the change of ends to rattle the Indian defence time and again. Their perseverance finally paid off in the 88th minute when defender Adnan Farooq beat goalkeeper Subrata Pal with a fine header off a flag kick.         
	With two minutes left for the final whistle, Pakistan launched a desperate attack to restore parity but this time Farooq couldnt reach the ball in time.         
	In the first half, India capitalised on their chances to clinch the issue in their favour. They took the lead in the 25th minute when NP Pradeep scored his fifth international goal in five matches with a thundering shot from outside the box.         
	India doubled the lead at the stroke of half time through Steven Dias. The Mahindra United midfielder played a couple of measured wall passes with skipper Bhaiching Bhutia before shooting home past the diving goalkeeper. Later, Indian coach Bob Houghton criticised the format of the tournament saying it was difficult to play three matches in five days. It is impossible to play three games in five days. It will kill the players, he said.         
	Houghton is expected to rest some of his frontline players in the last match against the Maldives on Saturday.         
	Indian striker Sushil Singh, who came in place of Bhaichung Bhutia in the 59th minute, will have to sit out the next match as he received his second yellow card on Thursday.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The AIFF has decided to allow East Bengal to replace their injured Brazilian striker Edmilson with another foreign player.         
	The move comes as a major boost for the red and yellow brigade, who have been struggling in the ongoing I-League with nine points after seven rounds. With Edmilson injured and Sunil Chhetri playing only in patches, East Bengal have so far been able to win just two of their seven matches.         
	The AIFF has also decided to allot the Federation Cup to Calcutta and Barasat. The meet is to be played from December 4 to 24. The decision was taken after the Delhi Soccer Association expressed its inability in hosting the tournament as per the AIFF dates. A formal decision on the Federation Cup, however, will be taken by the executive committee, which is meeting on November 22.         
	The I-League committee also decided to reduce the number of foreigners for the Federation Cup from three to two. The committee decided that the clubs could register two and play two foreigners in the Federation Cup.         
	The first phase of the I-League will conclude on November 30 and the second phase will start on January 23. In between the national team is expected to play a friendly abroad on January 14. The name of India s opponents, however, has not been announced.         
	National coach Bob Houghton will also hold a nine-day camp from January 2 to 10. The Second Division I-League will be played in January.

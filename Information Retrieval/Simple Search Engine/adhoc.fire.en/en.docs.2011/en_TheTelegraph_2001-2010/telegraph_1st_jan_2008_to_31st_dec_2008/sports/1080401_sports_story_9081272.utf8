The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United the best, says Roma coach 
                                                     United the best, says Roma coach

	Rome: Manchester United are the best team in the world on paper but AS Roma can beat them even without injured striker Francesco Totti, the Italian clubs coach Luciano Spalletti said on Monday.         
	The clubs meet in a Champions League quarter final first leg in Rome on Tuesday in a repeat of last years tie which United won 8-3 after a 7-1 win in the second leg at Old Trafford.         
	Manchester United on paper are the strongest team in the world, they have great players in attack and defence, Spalletti told a news conference.         
	But Roma have grown up and have matured since the 7-1 last year and we are in the right condition to get a result and go through.         
	Leading scorer Totti is out with a thigh problem picked up in Saturdays 1-1 draw at Cagliari which kept second-placed Roma four points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan. The captain hopes to be fit for the return leg next week.         
	I am very sorry Francesco wont be there but the group must know how to cope without its focal point, otherwise there wouldnt be the right winning mentality, Spalletti added.         
	Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic is set to stand in.         
	Physically, I dont have any problems, Vucinic said. Im happy to be able to play against the team that scored seven goals against us last year. Weve got a chance for revenge.         
	Vucinic scored the winner in Romas 2-1 first-leg victory over Manchester in last years quarter finals. This season, Vucinic has scored important goals against AC Milan, Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev.         
	When you play big games against prestigious opponents, its tough not to go out onto the field focused 100 per cent, Vucinic added.         
	Defender Mikael Silvestre joined Uniteds squad travelling to Rome on Monday, with midfielder Nani the only major absentee.         
	Silvestre hasnt played since injuring knee ligaments against Everton in September, while Nani is still suffering from a thigh strain.         
	Roma is going to be a massive game for us and we prepared the right way with the win against Villa, Wayne Rooney said. To be at this club, with the football we play at times, is brilliant. Its something every player would want to be a part of.         
	Uniteds fans have been told to be on their best behaviour and to use a shuttle service to reach the ground to avoid a recurrence of the clashes and knife attacks that marred both of the previous games between the teams at the Stadio Olimpico.         
	Alcohol in the area has also been banned. Worries have been heightened after a Parma fan was knocked down and killed by a bus on Sunday following a spat with rival fans in the latest soccer-related death in Italy.         
	Uefa president Michel Platini will also be watching, with Rome reportedly at risk of losing the 2009 Champions League final if any more violence arises.           (AP)

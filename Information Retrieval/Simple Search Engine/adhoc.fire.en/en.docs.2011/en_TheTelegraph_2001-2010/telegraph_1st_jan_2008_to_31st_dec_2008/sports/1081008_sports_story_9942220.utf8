The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No beating Indo-Pak rivalry: Kumble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     No beating Indo-Pak rivalry: Kumble
                      
	New Delhi: Their upcoming Test series against Australia may be the flavour of the season but Indian skipper Anil Kumble said nothing can supplant the traditional rivalry that India and Pakistan share in terms of passion and commitment.         
	The leg-spinner said the upcoming series against Australia would bring out the best in the players, but Indo-Pak, nothing can beat that passion and competitiveness on the field.         
	I think every series has its charm and even India-Australia has such charm. But you cant really beat the rivalry that India-Pakistan has, Kumble said.         
	The series against Australia has assumed epic proportions and Kumble traced its roots to the historic 2001 tour.         
	...(India-Australia) Not really a rivalry kind of a thing, but I think it all started probably in 2001 in Calcutta when we won the Test match and the series. Since then India-Australia series has always been something which everybody looks forward to, he said.         
	Asked as to how the seniors planned to meet the expectations of the people, Kumble said, Thats the challenge for a sportsman. You are not trying to prove anything to anyone. Its all about your competitiveness. Your spirit and your performance is the pride of the country.         
	He also put a lid on talks surrounding his retirement.         
	I am still enjoying the game and enjoying the challenges and it will be great to have a crack at the Australian this time, he said. (PTI)

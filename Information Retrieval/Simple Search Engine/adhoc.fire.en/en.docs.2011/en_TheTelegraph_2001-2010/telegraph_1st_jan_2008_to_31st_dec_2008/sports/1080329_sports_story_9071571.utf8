                                                     Sehwags the type to get 500: Kapil
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: The first session on Day IV, Saturday, is likely to enjoy an exceptionally high viewership and Kapil Dev is among those wholl be glued to the TV.         
	Of course, Im going to watch the Test from the days first ball... Like the others, even Im excited and am hoping that (Virender) Sehwag gets past Brian Laras record, Indias only World Cup-winning captain told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from New Delhi on Friday night, Kapil added: The first half-an-hour will be critical Once Sehwag is past that, I see no reason why he cant beat Lara (400 not out) But, yes, one will have to keep fingers crossed         
	Asked to list Sehwags USP, Kapil replied: His ability to move into top gear when in the 90s, 190s and 290s Amazing khelta hai Even greats like Sunil Gavaskar would slow down in the 90s and so on, but Sehwags just the opposite I havent seen anybody like him.         
	Kapil continued: In fact, Sehwags the type to get 500, all because of the way he paces his innings Getting to a triple hundred in a mere 278 balls is mind-boggling         
	Sehwags philosophy is simple  if theres a ball to be hit, it will be hit Thats it.         
	Clearly, its paying rich dividends.

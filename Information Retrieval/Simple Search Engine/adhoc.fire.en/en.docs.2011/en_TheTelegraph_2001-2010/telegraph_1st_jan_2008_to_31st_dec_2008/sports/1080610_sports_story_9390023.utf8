  - SANTOSH TROPHY 
  -   Defending champions Punjab thrash Kerala 5-0         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Action during the J amp;K vs Services quarter final of the 62nd Santosh Trophy in Srinagar on Monday. Services won 3-2 to book a place in the semis. (PTI)                                 
	Srinagar: Football fans here should be commended for their undiluted love for the game.         
	On Monday, there were little reasons for the spectators to come to the Bakshi Stadium to watch matches in the Santosh Trophy. The securitymen had nearly turned the stadium into a fortress. The host team had already crashed out of the tournament. And to cap it all, the public transport had gone off the Srinagar roads in protest against petrol price hike.         
	Yet at least three thousand people thronged the stadium to watch Jammu and Kashmir play Services in an inconsequential group league match. The securitymen made them sit into the far corner of the stands but they remained unperturbed and cheered their team throughout the match.         
	Unfortunately, the Jammu and Kashmir team could not take advantage of the home support and went down to Services 2-3 in a lively encounter. With three victories in as many matches under their belt, Services have topped the group with nine points.         
	Defending champions Punjab clinched the second spot in the group with a resounding 5-0 win over Kerala. In a second half blitz, Punjab scored four goals in 35 minutes through Sakatar Singh, Baljit Saini (2) and Balraj Singh (2).         
	Jammu and Kashmir, coached by Bengals Bishwajit Bhattacharya, fought well but had to finish on the losing side because of inexperience. They couldnt save their day despite scoring two fine goals through Rohit Kumar and Mohun Bagans Ishfaq Ahmed.         
	Services, who seemed to be the best team in the tournament so far, once again relied on their forward Sochungmi Raleng to deliver the goods. The striker from Assam Rifles didnt disappoint and scored two goals to take his tally of goals in the tournament to 10. Shaji DSilva scored the other goal.         
	 Tuesdays matches: Goa vs Karnataka (2.15 pm); Bengal vs Maharashtra (4.15 pm).

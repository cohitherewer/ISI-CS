                                                                                                                                                                                                       Weve become tougher now: Shah Rukh
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan was absolutely overjoyed with the Kolkata Knight Riders emphatic performance against the Delhi DareDevils on Tuesday. Later, the Knight Riders owner briefly spoke to The Telegraph.         
	Shah Rukh, incidentally, will be back in Mumbai early on Wednesday to continue with his TV show shoots and prepare for a new film.         
	The following are excerpts from the one-on-one:               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the Knight Riders superb win on Tuesday         
	(Laughs) Weve been having some tough games and theyre making the team tougher! At the end of the match, John (Buchanan, coach) asked how did we do it? Indeed We bowled beautifully and fielded so well The two run outs made the difference.         
	Having got very emotional         
	Because the boys played so well and because the Eden crowd has been supporting us in such a big way Thats why I bow to the crowd after each match Its my way of thanking them         
	His remarkable connect with the fans here         
	They probably like me because Im humble At the Eden, Im Shah Rukh Khan Im not putting on an act.         
	MoM Shoaib Akhtars performance         
	Id been very disappointed when Shoaib wasnt allowed to play till last week Hed been our first buy at the February 20 IPL auction and was probably the first buy for any team I dont want to get into the rules but Id been extremely disappointed Id been very keen to have a photograph taken at the Eden with everybody in it Ricky Ponting, Brendon McCullum, Chris Gayle, Shoaib That didnt work out         
	His dream of Shoaib taking three wickets in his first over remaining unfulfilled         
	But I amended that to three in his first three Shoaib, in fact, did better Four in the first three! As Ive said, Im very happy as hes become the most liked player around People would say hes a budtameez and so on, but hes not that Hes shown what hes capable of.         
	Whether Shoaibs comeback script would match anything from the world of films         
	Reality is always different         
	Shoaib opening with Ishant Sharma         
	(Smiles) Thats one dream which has been realised I wanted them to bowl together That has happened at the Eden.         
	Finally, whether captain Sourav Ganguly should again be considered for the ODIs         
	Look, my involvement with cricket starts and ends with the Knight Riders I really dont know much about other things and wouldnt like to comment.

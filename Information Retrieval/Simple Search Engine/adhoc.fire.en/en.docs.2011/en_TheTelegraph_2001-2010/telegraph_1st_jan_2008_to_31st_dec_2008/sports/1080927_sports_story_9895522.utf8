                                                                                                                                                                                                     The 5 set to be senior national selectors
                      
	The following are pen sketches of the five who are set to be in the senior national selection committee:               
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth         
	A cavalier opening batsman, Krishnamachari Srikkanth made his Test debut against England in 1981-82. He was part of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad and led India to a respectable draw in Pakistan in 1989. He had in all appeared in 43 Tests and 146 ODIs until his last game in 1991-92.               
	Yashpal Sharma         
	Yashpal Sharma was a neat and attractive right-hand middle-order batsman who appeared in 37 Tests (1606 runs, 2 hundreds) and 74 ODIs (1859 runs) for India. He was also part of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad. He played for Punjab, Haryana and Railways from 1973-74 to 1992-93. During this period he appeared in 160 first-class matches, scoring nearly 9000 runs, with 21 centuries. Incidentally, Sharma was in the senior selection committee in 2004-05.               
	Narendra Hirwani         
	As a 19-year old, Narendra Hirwani made history when he picked up 16 West Indian wickets on Test debut in 1988. He appeared in only 17 Test matches and picked up 66 Test wickets. He also played 18 ODIs, taking 23 wickets. He played a season for Bengal in 1996-97.               
	Surendra Bhave         
	Surendra Bhave is perhaps the most unfortunate batsman not to have played international cricket. His first-class average of over 58 is one of the highest among non-Test cricketers. He scored nearly 8000 runs, including 28 centuries. He has seven double hundreds to his credit.               
	Raja Venkat         
	Raja Venkat was a solid left-hand middle-order batsman for Bengal from 1980-81 to 1992-93. He played 41 first-class matches, scoring 2261 runs at an average of 44 runs per innings. He scored five centuries which includes his 170 against Assam in 1989-90.                 COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is over the moon
                                                Sachin is over the moon
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Adelaide: Its rare for Sachin Tendulkar to get carried away, but the Padma Vibhushan has made him very emotional.         
	Its one thing to be recognised by others, very special when the recognition comes from your government, which is representing the people, Sachin told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	At some point, then, is the Bharat Ratna next? Sachin smiled and looked at the sky, suggesting it was up to the gods.         
	Earlier, he gave a statement: I came to know about this award through my wife (Anjali)... I was extremely excited on getting the news, but had to focus on the match... Its truly a great honour because its a recognition from the Indian government...         
	Having played for so many years, its very special when the government chooses to recognise... This is the second-highest civilian award (after the Bharat Ratna) and is very, very special... Ive won many trophies and prizes, but this one is right at the top         
	Ive been placed alongside many great personalities and couldnt have dreamt of this... Id like to take this opportunity to congratulate the other awardees...         
	Besides the sports-specific Arjuna and the Rajiv Khel Ratna, Sachin received the Padma Shri some years ago.         
	As the family isnt here, Sachin celebrated by having dinner with (among others) Ravi Shastri and Wasim Akram at a Greek restaurant.

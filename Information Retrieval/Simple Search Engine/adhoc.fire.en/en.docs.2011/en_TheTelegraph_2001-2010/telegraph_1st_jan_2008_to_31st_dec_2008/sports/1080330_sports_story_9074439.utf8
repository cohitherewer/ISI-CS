  - I told Sourav that I got my first run with you You are once again at the other end       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid en route to his 111 in Chennai on Saturday. (AFP)                                 
	Chennai: Former captain Rahul Dravid confessed that he had never dreamt of achieving 10,000 runs in Test cricket. The former India captain was candid, pragmatic, and at times emotional during the post match news conference on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Reaction on reaching the landmark         
	It is a proud moment When I grew up I dreamt of playing for India. To be honest when I look back, I have exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 12 years. For me its a proud moment that I can reflect back and think that I have maximised my potential over the years To do it here with my family and friends was great and I think it is very special.         
	If he remembers March 7, 1987, the day Sunil Gavaskar reached 10,000 and its influence on him         
	I can visualise that moment as clearly today as I saw it as a boy many years ago on TV Gavaskar late cutting in Ahmedabad and raising his bat I never had the ambition to do it as I never believed that I could do it. Over the years, as time went by, it did emerge as a goal.         
	On the last year (excluding matches against Bangladesh, he has gone for 15 Tests without a century)         
	I pretty much coasted for five to six years. Then I had to work hard for my 9,000 to 10,000. I think it was a sign that I should learn to enjoy things, reflect on these moments and take pride in them Understand the significance of what I have done. In some ways the last 1,000 has been a bit of a learning curve for me.         
	Why the year turned out to be tough         
	It has been a tough year in some ways. I felt like I played well in patches. I had set high standards for myself and wasnt able to achieve it over the past year. But like I said, Ive been fighting through it. I have worked really hard and felt in phases that it was coming back. Breaking my finger in the last game in Adelaide I couldnt pick up a bat for six weeks. I picked up a bat a couple of days before the Deodhar Trophy game.         
	How it feels to join the elite club that includes Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara         
	I think it is great company Just to be in that club is fantastic. They are the two greatest batsmen of my generation. To be in that company is surreal in some ways. It is hard to believe Ive got to pinch myself.         
	On his 291-ball 111         
	People who have watched me over the last 10 or 12 years will testify that this is the way I have always played. I have always played to do the best, prove to myself more than anyone else         
	The achievements of his teammates         
	Yes, fantastic I think Anils 600 is a fantastic achievement. Sehwags was truly special. It was one of the best knocks I have ever seen. I have been lucky enough to bat at the other end on two occasions  Laxmans 281 and Virus 319. I think it is great It is great for a generation of cricketers who have played a lot of their cricket together. I told Sourav when I was batting with him that I got my first run with you You are once again at the other end when Ive reached my 10,000.         
	On Sehwag missing 400         
	As the day started you could feel the buzz... We knew if Viru batted for a couple of hours he would get close to it, if not pass it. He was unlucky to nick one. But theres nothing to regret One of the finest innings I have seen.         
	Which is more special  10,000 in ODIs or Tests?         
	Definitely getting 10,000 runs in one-dayers was special. Starting out as a particular kind of player and adapting to the one-day game, batting in different positions, learning the one-day skills... I had to change, adapt, do different things. That gave me a lot of satisfaction. Test cricket, at the end of the day, is tougher.You will always cherish your Test performances a bit more than the one-day ones.         
	How he rates this century         
	Hard to rate I place the ones higher when we end up winning those games. Even the 90 in Perth is a lot more significant for me than some hundreds I have got.

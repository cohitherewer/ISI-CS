The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India bank on youth   to make amends

	Dambulla: A wounded India would bank on their young blood to make amends for their humiliating loss in the Test series against Sri Lanka as they take on the hosts in the first of their five one-dayers here on Monday.         
	Indian opener Virender Sehwag is doubtful for the series opener against Sri Lanka as the explosive right-hander sustained an ankle injury at practice on Sunday.         
	If Sehwag sits out, his Delhi teammate Virat Kohli is likely to take his place. Sehwag was seen limping out of ground after the practice session.         
	Indian team management sources said a final call on the chances of Sehwag playing will be taken before the match. If the swelling in his ankle subsides, why not play him? a team management official said. Kohli, if selected, will make his debut for India.         
	The Indian team is already without Sachin Tendulkar, who withdrew from the series after sustaining an elbow injury during the third and final Test.         
	Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was badly missed in the middle-order in the three-Test series, returns to lead the side knowing that it would be imperative for him to soon find a way to crack the code of mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis, who is fast gaining reputation as their nemesis.         
	The island nation has always been one of the toughest venues for India but Dhoni hopes his young brigade would grab the opportunity and come good to make a mark in the absence of seniors like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman.         
	Dhoni has said that the visitors are energised with inclusion of youngsters Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Subramaniam Badrinath, Irfan Pathan and Praveen Kumar.         
	Sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow, low wickets. You have to always stay positive, he said.         
	The Indian ODI side would also be infused with the freshness of Yuvraj Singh, who hit an explosive 172 against the Lankan XI in a practice match and gave indication that he was in the best of forms.         
	The Punjab batsman, however, said Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan, who made India bite dust in the Tests, would make a deadly combo.         
	Obviously, I have to face a better attack when I play the ODIs. But my innings was against an international side. With Mendis and Muralidharan, Sri Lanka will have a potent attack, said Yuvraj.         
	After a dismal showing by the batsmen in the Test series, the visitors will also have to pay special attention to building up partnerships during the ODIs as it would be the key in posting big scores.         
	However, the victory in the practice match against a moderate Lankan XI bowling attack, after scoring heavily in a slow and low wicket, would have done a world of good to the demoralised visitors.         
	For Sri Lanka, it is not so much the batting line up that the home team need to worry about, but the combination of bowlers as captain Mahela Jayawardene has no bowling all-rounder in the squad to choose from in the first two ODIs.

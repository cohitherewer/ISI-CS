	 Debanjan Majumdar has written a letter to the president of the WBBA questioning his non-inclusion in the state badminton team for the senior nationals in Goa. As the state doubles champion, is it not right and natural for me to wish to participate in the nationals?  he asked. According to a WBBA official, picking the team was the selection committees prerogative and there should be no interference.

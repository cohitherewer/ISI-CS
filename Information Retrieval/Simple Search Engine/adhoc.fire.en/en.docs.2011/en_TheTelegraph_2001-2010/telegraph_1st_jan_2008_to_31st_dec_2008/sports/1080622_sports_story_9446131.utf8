The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha misses cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev Milkha misses cut
                      
	Munich: Jeev Milkha Singh missed the cut at the BMW International Open after wobbling to a two-over 74 in the second round but Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur kept the Indian challenge alive by advancing to the weekend rounds at the $2 million event here.         
	Jeev signed off with a total of even-par 144, a stroke less than the cut which came at one-under on Friday.         
	In contrast, Randhawa sizzled with a three-under 69  studded with five birdies against a couple of bogeys to grab a share of the 27th spot with a total of four-under 140.           (PTI)

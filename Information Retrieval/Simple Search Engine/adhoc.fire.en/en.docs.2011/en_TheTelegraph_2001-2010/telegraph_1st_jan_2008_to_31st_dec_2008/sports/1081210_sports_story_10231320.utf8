                                                                                                                                                                                           Dickason begins Mohali review
                      
	Mohali: In a clear indication that Mohali will remain the venue for the second cricket Test between India and England, the England and Wales Cricket Boards (ECB) security advisor Reg Dickason Tuesday started the process of assessing the security arrangements for the match.         
	Dickason held a series of meetings with Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) officials and security agencies since arriving here from Chennai where the England team is preparing for the first Test beginning Thursday.         
	It was a preliminary meeting to review the security arrangements, Dickason said as he emerged out of the meeting with security agencies of Chandigarh and Mohali.         
	A detailed meeting will be held tomorrow (Wednesday), he added.         
	Later, Chandigarh police chief S. Srivastava said Dickason was apprised of the security arrangements for the players.         
	The Chandigarh and Mohali police had a joint meeting with the ECB representative to ensure safety and security of players, Srivastava said.         
	Dickason will be joined by the ECB managing director Hugh Morris on Wednesday and the duo will inspect the stadium and hotel.         
	They will also have a detailed discussion with the top brass of Chandigarh and Mohali police and also with the officials of hotel Taj where the team will stay.         
	PCA president I.S. Bindra, meanwhile, asserted that the ECB had suggested Mohali as the venue for the second Test and at no stage was there any doubt about hosting the match here.         
	Earlier, reports claimed both the English cricketers and their supporters were apprehensive about touring Mohali for its proximity to the Pakistan border. (PTI)

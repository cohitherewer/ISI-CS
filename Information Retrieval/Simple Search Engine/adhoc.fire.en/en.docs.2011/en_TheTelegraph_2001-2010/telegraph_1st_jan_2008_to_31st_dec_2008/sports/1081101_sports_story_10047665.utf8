The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir appeals ban
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gambhir appeals ban
            A STAFF REPORTER            Gautam Gambhir                           
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir on Friday appealed against the one Test ban slapped on him after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the ongoing third Test against Australia.         
	The final Test begins in Nagpur from Thursday.         
	The ICC confirmed that it has received official notification from the BCCI of its appeal.         
	The ICC legal counsel will now appoint a Code of Conduct commissioner to hear the appeal within 48 hours. Once the commissioner has been named, details of when and where the appeal hearing is to take place will be released. The commissioner will determine and hear the appeal inside seven days of his appointment.         
	In the meantime, according to the Code of Conduct regulations, Gambhir may continue to play pending verdict of the appeal being given.         
	Gambhir met Match Referee Chris Broad before the start of the third days play where he was informed of the penalty. The hearing had been adjourned on Thursday evening to allow Broad to review the evidence. The batsman had pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule C1 of the Code (level 2) which states that players shall at all times conduct play within the spirit of the game.         
	Gambhir, who scored 206 in Indias 613 for 7 declared, was involved in a verbal duel with Shane Watson on the opening day. They had an argument in the 51st over of the first innings when Gambhir took his first run and then elbowed Watson as he ran the second. Watson was found guilty and fined 10 per cent of his match fee on Thursday.         
	While Gambhir did elbow Watson, it seems the Match Referee has decided to ignore the fact that he was provoked by Watson. In the circumstances, it seems that there are two sets of rules for the two players.         
	Even Sunil Gavaskar had said that the provocation bit must be kept in mind when judging the case.         
	On Friday, Gavaskar said the ban was too harsh.         
	Gambhir is guilty, no doubt about that and its (elbowing) just not on as far as cricket is concerned. But I think the punishment was little too harsh, the former India captain told a television channel, reports PTI.         
	Look at Watson, the man who provoked him, he was handed a 10 per cent match fee fine. Well, if Gambhir has done something, which is 10 times wrong, make it 100 per cent match fee for him. But see the quantum of punishment he got, Gavaskar added.         
	Explaining the decision, Broad said: The decision to fine Gambhir guilty of a level 2 offence is indicative of the fact that any degree of physical contact is unacceptable.         
	Had Gambhir been charged with and found guilty of a charge under 2.4, due to his previous offence, I would have been obliged to impose a minimum penalty of a two-Test match ban. In the view of the umpires, the facts of this case  the lightness of the physical conduct and the element of provocation  would not justify such a penalty.         
	The umpires accordingly had regard to the notes of the ICC Code of Conduct which provides for a player to be charged under Rule C1 if the circumstances of the alleged incident are not adequately covered by the listed offences.         
	While I concur with this view, the ICC has repeatedly told the players that deliberate physical contact between players will not be tolerated. I have also taken into account the previous offences of Gambhir, and therefore, I am satisfied that the penalty imposed is an appropriate outcome in the circumstances. I hope Gambhir will learn from this, Broad said.

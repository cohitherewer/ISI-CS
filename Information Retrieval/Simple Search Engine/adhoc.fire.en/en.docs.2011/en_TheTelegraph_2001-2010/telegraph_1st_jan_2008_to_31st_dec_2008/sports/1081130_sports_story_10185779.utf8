	The English cricket fraternity is divided on whether England should go back to India to play the two-Test series. While former captain Bob Willis thinks not playing would be sensible, David Gower feels Kevin Pietersen and his men should play the series as scheduled. Former England coach David Lloyd, however, thinks it is not feasible. Mark Butcher, the former top-order batsman, feels the decision should be left to the individual.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Bob Willis: England players stayed on in 1984-85 when Mrs (Indira) Gandhi and Norris, the deputy British High Commissioner, were assassinated. But I can understand reluctance of any cricketer to go into areas where there have been terrorist attacks. As Westerners are being targeted, it is sensible for the team to not remain.         
	David Gower: I would understand if there were doubts about staying on in India but I would expect that if the players go back to different areas of the country, they would be fine. I would almost suggest that if they go back to Mumbai, they would be fine. India will provide full security, even though they will find it hard to get this out of their minds.         
	We talked about coming home when Percy Norris was killed  we had had drinks with him only the night before. But we knew security would be tight enough.         
	If India is deemed safe before the first Test in Ahmedabad on December 11 and the second in Chennai, they should go and play. Otherwise no one will come to England  teams will say we are as much a terrorist target as any country. I hope within a fortnight, things will settle down.         
	David Lloyd: I know the plan is still on for the Test series to go ahead but I cant see how it can, under these circumstances. Its terribly sad for India as a country. Our production crew was almost in tears about whats gone on. The people there are terrific; they are cricket disciples who turn up at grounds four hours before a match. We want to go there and play against a team that is the best in the world, make no mistake. But if you work back from the December 11  when the first Test is due to start  I dont think its feasible.         
	Mark Butcher: I would be incredibly surprised if England get back on the plane again to go back to India once theyve got home. Pietersen has already said that he wouldnt put pressure on his players to make a decision against their will; I think once those players get home back to their families, I think they will find it very difficult to go back.         
	In the end, I guess it will be up to players to make a decision individually. Thats whats happened over situations that have nothing to do with cricket in the past and theres every possibility thats what will happen again.         
	I hope that a sensible decision is made in terms of player safety. We are talking about a game, after all, and if people feel that their safety is compromised or they are being put in a position which is unreasonable to expect someone to do for the sake of a cricket match, then the right decision should be made.           (AGENCIES)

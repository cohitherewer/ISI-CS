            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Beijing: Rain stopped the mens doubles quarter final match between Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi and Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka with the Indians trailing 1-4 in the first set here on Thursday.         
	The match was into its 16th minute when what started as a drizzle turned into steady downpour, forcing the officials to postpone the tie till Friday.         
	Federer served the first game and he wrapped it up in style with an ace. His crosscourt backhand clinched the second game as well.         
	Wawrinka held his serve to put the side 3-0 ahead. The Indians seemed to lack in co-ordination.

	Madrid: A ruthless AS Roma snatched a 2-1 win over 10-man Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday to clinch their place in the Champions League quarter finals 4-2 on aggregate.         
	Real took the initiative for most of the game, but suffered a major setback when Portugal centre-back Pepe was sent off for picking up a second booking 19 minutes from time.         
	They were still reeling from the blow when Brazilian midfielder Taddei found space in the Real defence to head the visitors in front.         
	Real hit back two minutes later when skipper Raul steered in after some neat work by Robinho but Roma put them to the sword when substitute Mirko Vucinic scored with a diving header just before the final whistle.         
	I expected a tough game, but my team came here to get a result and they responded perfectly, Roma coach Luciano Spalletti told a news conference.         
	We suffered at times, but we deserved to go through. We didnt steal this tie from Real. I think both sides played well and that makes the win here at this ground even more special.         
	Having lost 1-2 in the first leg in Rome, Real pushed hard for an early goal, but a cagey Roma side appeared content to sit back and soak up the pressure.         
	Roma keeper Doni was not pressed into action until the 17th minute when he did well to deal with a deflected Julio Baptista free kick, but the Italians responded with two great shots that gave the Bernabeu a warning of what was to come.         
	Midfielder Alberto Aquilani sent a rasping drive slamming on to the bar from 20 metres out and Taddei followed up with another fierce shot that had Iker Casillas scrambling to turn past the post.         
	Without the injured Ruud van Nistelrooy, Real lacked bite up front and grew increasingly frustrated as the miserly Roma back four gave them no chance.           (REUTERS)

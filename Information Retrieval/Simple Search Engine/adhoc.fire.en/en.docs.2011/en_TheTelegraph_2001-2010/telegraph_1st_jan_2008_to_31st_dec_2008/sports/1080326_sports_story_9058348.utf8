The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferdinand to lead England 
                                                   Ferdinand to lead England 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                      Beckham in London on Monday. (Reuters)
    
	David Beckham will not be allowed to celebrate his 100th cap with the captains armband  as all four of Englands previous centurions were.         
	Rio Ferdinand will captain England in Wednesdays Paris friendly against France but coach Fabio Capello will not select his permanent skipper until his side begins its 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.         
	Capello has confirmed that this continues his approach of rotating the captaincy between players during the friendly matches before confirming the permanent captain for the qualifying games, the FA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.         
	Happy enough with his recall, Beckham would not dispute the arrangement. He also insisted that this would be no Sinatra-like farewell appearance and that his ambitions to keep representing his country went as far as the next World Cup, when he will be 35.         
	Another cap on Wednesday would move him 25 short of goalkeeper Peter Shiltons England record. Bobby Charlton (106), Bobby Moore (108) and Billy Wright (105) are the other former players to have reached the milestone         
	As much as reaching 100 is a milestone in an Englishmans career  and there are not too many who have done that  it is important for me to carry on, he said.         
	Both Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard, who were doubtful after the weekend fixtures, trained on Monday. Facing a French side badly weakened by injury  they are without Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Karim Benzema and Bacary Sagna  Capello will be tempted to employ Gerrard just behind Rooney.         
	Manchester United centre-back Ferdinand takes over from Steven Gerrard, who captained the side for Capellos first game in charge against Switzerland when John Terry was injured. Capello had been widely expected to hand the armband back to Terry and his decision to opt for Ferdinand instead will inevitably be interpreted as a significant snub to the Chelsea skipper.

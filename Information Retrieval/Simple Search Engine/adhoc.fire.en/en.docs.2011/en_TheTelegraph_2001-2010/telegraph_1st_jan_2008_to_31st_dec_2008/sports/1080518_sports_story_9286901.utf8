The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight Riders threaten legal action
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Knight Riders threaten legal action
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday threatened to take all possible action, including legal, against Pakistani newspaper The Nation for its report that Shoaib Akhtar was questioned at the Karachi airport for allegedly carrying a large number of syringes.         
	In a press statement on Saturday night, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise threw their full support behind the beleaguered speedster and said this was a clear attempt at slander.         
	We are talking to our lawyers We want to see how we can build up a case and we would take necessary action at the earliest, a member of the team management said.         
	The statement carried four-point clarifications, refuting the report carried by the Pakistani daily.         
	1. Shoaib Akhtar travelled to India from Lahore, not Karachi. 2. He travelled to Calcutta via Delhi, not Mumbai, as claimed by the report. 3. He did not travel with any hand baggage and therefore the question of syringes does not arise. 4. He was not stopped or questioned by any official of the Indian or Pakistani customs, the statement read.

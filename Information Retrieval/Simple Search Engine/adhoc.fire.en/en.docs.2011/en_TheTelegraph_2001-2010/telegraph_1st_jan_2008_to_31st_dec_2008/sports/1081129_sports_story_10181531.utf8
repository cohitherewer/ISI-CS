The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manojs form is a worry for Bengal
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Manojs form is a worry for Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla with consultant Mohinder Amarnath at the Eden on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Bengal, high on confidence after a close finish against Madhya Pradesh and an innings victory against Services, will take on Tripura in a Ranji Trophy Plate group match at the Eden from Saturday.         
	Currently placed third in Group B with seven points, Bengal need to grab full points from this match if they are to get back to the Elite Group.         
	The former Ranji champions have always had the upper hand against the north-eastern state but that was in the era of zonal Ranji matches. This Tripura side is more or less an unknown opposition for Bengal.         
	However, former Mumbai batsman Nishit Shetty and medium pacer Vineet Jain are the only ones who have substantial experience at this level.         
	While Nishit has close to 2000 runs in first-class cricket, Vineet, who used to play for Haryana, has 242 wickets to his credit. Bengal should not have too many problems with that kind of an opposition.         
	But the team management sounded cautious about their chances after practice on Friday.         
	We dont want to think about the result at the start itself. Well take a day at a time, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla told reporters.         
	While Bengal are a much better side on paper, the failure of premier batsman Manoj Tiwary has landed them in trouble in the previous matches. His return to form is a must not only because Bengal need to beat Tripura but also because crucial matches against Assam and Vidarbha are coming up.         
	Coach Utpal Chatterjee and consultant Mohinder Amarnath are hoping that Manojs poor run with the bat will end against Tripura. Manojs form is definitely a worry for us. But I dont think hes totally out of form. He just needs to have some kind of a start. Then hell be okay, Utpal said.         
	Amarnath dismissed Manojs failure as just a bad patch.         
	Arindam Ghosh, who has replaced Sreevats Goswami in the Bengal squad, is likely to make it to the first XI, while spinner Ritam Kundu looks favourite to start.         
	Tripura will rely on their spin trio of captain Tushar Saha, Joyanta Debnath and Abhijeet Dey to trouble Bengal.         
	Teams         
	Bengal (likely): Rohan Banerjee, Anustup Majumdar, Arindam Ghosh, Manoj Tiwary, Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Wriddhiman Saha (wicketkeeper), Aveek Chowdhury, Ritam Kundu, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose, Sourav Sarkar.         
	Tripura (from): Biswajit Dey, Rajib Saha, Timir Chanda, Rana Dutta, Abhijeet Dey, Jiban Paul (wicketkeeper), Nishit Shetty, Vineet Jain, Kishore Muhuri, Rajesh Banik, Tushar Saha (captain), Joyanta Debnath, Bappa Das, Rajib Dutta (wicketkeeper), Gopesh Bhowmik.

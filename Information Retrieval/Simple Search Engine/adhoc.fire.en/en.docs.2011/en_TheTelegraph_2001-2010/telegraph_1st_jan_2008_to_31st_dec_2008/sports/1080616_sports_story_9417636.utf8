	Halle: Leander Paes missed the chance to register his first doubles win of the season after losing the summit encounter of the Halle Open along with Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy on Sunday.         
	The fourth-seeded Indo-Czech pair lost the final match 6-3, 4-6, 3-10 to unseeded combo of Russias Mikhail Youzhny and Mischa Zverev of Germany.         
	Paes and his partner made a good start, breaking their opponents twice to pocket the first set.         
	However, the Russian-German duo cashed in on the breakpoints in the second set to draw parity and stretched the matter to a tie-breaker, in which they prevailed.         
	Meanwhile, World No.1 Roger Federer cruised to his fifth Halle Open title on Sunday, beating Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3,6-4.         
	Federer, who was heavily defeated by Rafael Nadal in the French Open final last week, was rarely troubled by his Germany opponent, extending his winning streak on grass to 59 matches ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on June 23.         
	I played great tennis all week. I didnt lose my serve once, which I dont think Ive ever managed in a tournament before, so its very special for me and Im really pleased about it, Federer said.         
	Federer has traditionally used the Halle tournament as a warm-up for Wimbledon, but skipped the event a year ago after losing to Nadal at Roland Garros.         
	The Swiss, who also failed to drop a set all week, said he was fit and ready for the third Grand Slam tourney of the year where he aims to break the record he shares with Bjorn Borg of five consecutive wins.         
	Its obviously a good omen to win here in Wimbledon, sorry, Halle the Wimbledon of Germany, he said, laughing.           (AGENCIES)

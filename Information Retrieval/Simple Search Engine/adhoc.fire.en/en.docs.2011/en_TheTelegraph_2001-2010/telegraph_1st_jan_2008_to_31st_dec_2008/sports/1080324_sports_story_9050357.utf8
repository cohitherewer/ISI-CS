	Sydney: Sophie Edington snatched the world record for 50 metres backstroke at the Australian Olympic trials on Sunday while the previous holder watched from the stands after electing to skip the race.         
	Edington stopped the clock at 27.67 seconds to win the final and slice 0.28 off the record set by Emily Seebohm in the semi-finals just 24 hours earlier.         
	Seebohm, a 15-year-old schoolgirl, pulled out of the final to concentrate on the 100 backstroke because the 50 is not an Olympic event and would not help her make the team for Beijing.         
	Seebohm set the fastest qualifying time for the 100 when she won her semi-final in 59.78. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md Yousuf may finally join ICL
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Md Yousuf may finally join ICL
                      
	Karachi: After months of legal wrangle with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), Mohammed Yousuf may finally end up joining the rebel Twenty20 series, thus ending his international career.         
	Sources close to the batsman have confirmed that Yousuf has conveyed to the ICL organisers that he is willing to consider joining them if they drop compensation claims and other charges against him.         
	The ICL took legal recourse after Yousuf a veteran of 79 tests and 269 one-day internationals  first joined them in 2007 and then backed out of the contract under pressure from the PCB who assured him of a more lucrative deal with the official Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	But the ICL obtained a stay order, restraining Yousuf from playing in any other rival Twenty20 league including the IPL.         
	Yousuf is set to file his reply to the ICL charges in the Mumbai high court, where he has appealed against the stay order.         
	Tafazzul Rizvi, the PCB legal counsel, who is supporting Yousuf in his legal battle said the reply would be submitted by an Indian lawyer, hired to push the appeal in the Mumbai high court.         
	However, according to the sources due to the inordinate delay in the legal battle and the failure of the PCB to get him a clear passage to play in the IPL, Yousuf has become extremely frustrated.         
	With the ICL having a strong case against him, former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has also advised him to make an out of court settlement and rejoin the ICL, a source said.         
	He said Inzamam would speak to the ICL on behalf of Yousuf and try to broker a deal but first they want to be sure Yousuf would face no legal hassles from the PCB and IPL.         
	Rizvi as expected said he was not aware of Yousuf making a U-turn.         
	As far as I know he is very keen on winning his appeal in the high court and he is also confident of success as we have made it clear that the arbitrator was biased towards our client, Rizvi said.

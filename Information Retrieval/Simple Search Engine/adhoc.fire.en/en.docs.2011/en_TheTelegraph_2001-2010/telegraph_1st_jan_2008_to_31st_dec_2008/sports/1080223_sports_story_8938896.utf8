The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randhawa tied fourth
                                                     Randhawa tied fourth
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jyoti Randhawa                           
	Noida: A shaky display in the third hole forced Jyoti Randhawa to surrender his pole position, but the local hero managed to return a level-par card to be tied fourth in the SAIL Open on Friday.         
	While Randhawa was left to do a damage control act in the back nine after he doubled bogeyed in the third hole, New Zealands Mark Brown grabbed the sole lead in the $400,000 tournament with a superb five-under-par 67 at the Jaypee Greens here.         
	On a hard day when many top stars found the going tough, the Kiwi golfer surged ahead with his aggregate of 11-under-par 205. He now leads by one shot from Australian Scott Hend, who carded a 69 and Asian Tour rookie Rhys Davies of Wales , who fired a fine 67.         
	Randhawa looked in trouble at the end of the third hole, and was in fact three-over when he approached the eighth hole. The Indian star, however, picked up a shot there and took a turn at two-over. He then fired an eagle on the 12th and then picked up two more shots to round off at level-par.         
	I was tired as I slept little last night, said Randhawa at the end of the day. I could not concentrate early on and in no time I was three shots down with a double and a bogey. But I made a great recovery from there.         
	At any point of time, if you are two or so behind the leader it is a nice position to be in.         
	Randhawa is tied fourth with Gaganjeet Bhullar, Malaysia s Danny Chia and Australian Adam Groom, who all carded matching 69s.         
	While Randhawa kept his hopes alive of winning the title, Bhullar slammed three birdies and an eagle against pair of bogeys to hang around for a top five finish.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, veteran Ashok Kumar (210) carded 71 to be tied 12th, while Harinder Gupta (212) slipped to tied 21st after going one-over 73.         
	Dinesh Kumar (214), overnight tied fourth, carded a horrendous five-over 77 to slide to tied 27th.

	New Delhi: IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly said on Wednesday that national coach Bob Houghton was desperate to divert attention after the national teams poor performance in the SAFF Cup.         
	Taking strong exception to Houghtons comments that the IFA was responsible for slowing down the process of development in Indian football, Ganguly said: I am surprised and disappointed to read Houghtons allegations against the IFA.         
	Such comments keep on coming after every failed performance of the national team, Ganguly said. Earlier, Houghton said that he sometimes felt frustrated with the slow pace of changes in Indian football and held state associations mainly responsible for that.         
	The AIFF knows the direction but the problem is state associations, particularly that of Bengal. The state associations have their own agenda.         
	They think their state leagues are more important than the I-League, they want to protect their interests only which is holding back Indian football, said Houghton.         
	Ganguly said it was not proper for Houghton to express his views publicly and undermine the state associations. At best, Houghton should convey his views to the AIFF or should discuss it in meetings.         
	Ganguly said he was convinced that the British coach has a negative mindset about the IFA, which runs the largest and most well organised local league in the country.         
	Ask the British coach not to play broken records and concentrate on his own job, a furious Ganguly said. In the AIFF core committee meeting, we agreed upon every decision and are abiding by it. It is surprising that Houghton still made such unfortunate comments.         
	Houghton is not aware of IFAs contribution to Indian football. We know what our responsibilities are and would continue to discharge it under the direction and guidance of the AIFF, irrespective of what Houghton thinks of us, Ganguly said.

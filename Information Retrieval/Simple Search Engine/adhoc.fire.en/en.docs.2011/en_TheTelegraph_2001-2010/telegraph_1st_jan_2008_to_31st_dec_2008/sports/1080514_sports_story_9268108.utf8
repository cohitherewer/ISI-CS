                                                                                                                                                                                                       Annika to retire at end of season

	Jacksonville (Florida): Annika Sorenstam will retire after the season, ending an LPGA Tour career in which she has won 72 tournaments to date and delivered a defining moment when she teed up against the men on the PGA Tour.         
	She announced her decision at a news conference on Tuesday at the Sybase Classic in Clifton, New Jersey.         
	The 37-year-old has hinted at retirement the past several seasons, saying she wanted to devote more time to her growing business and to start a family. She is engaged to Mike McGee, son of former PGA Tour player Jerry McGee.         
	The decision comes two days after Sorenstam won the Michelob Ultra Open at Kingsmill by seven shots for her third victory of the season, and first against a field that included Lorena Ochoa.         
	Sorenstam became the first woman in 58 years to complete on the PGA Tour when she played at the Colonial in 2003. She missed the cut, but earned world-wide respect for the way she handled herself amid massive scrutiny.         
	She won LPGA Tour player of the year a record eight times.           (AP)

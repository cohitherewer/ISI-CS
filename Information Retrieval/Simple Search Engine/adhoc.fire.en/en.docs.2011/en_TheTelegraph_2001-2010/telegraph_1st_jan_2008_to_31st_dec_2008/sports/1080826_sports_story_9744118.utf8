The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB win opens up three-way race
                                                                                                                                                                                                     EB win opens up three-way race
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Ashim Biswas, who scored a goal in EB rsquo;s 2-0 win on Monday		    
	Calcutta: East Bengals win over Mohammedan Sporting on Monday at the Salt Lake Stadium makes the Sahara CFL Premier Division a three-horse race. Coming into the home stretch, the traditional big three are bearing down on each other with two points separating the three teams.         
	After their match, Mohammedan Sporting remained at second place on 20 points after 10 matches, while East Bengal climbed to third in the league table with 18 points. Karim Bencharifas Mohun Bagan are the current table toppers, edging Mohammedan Sporting on goal difference. But the green-and-maroon brigade have a game in hand and are slated to face Railway FC on Tuesday.         
	Mohun Bagan look favourites to claim the league title, especially, if they can get past Mohammedan Sporting and East Bengal in the remaining two big matches of the season. Much will depend on the veteran Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto and the oft-shaky Bagan defence who have to buck up and hold fort.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, who usually tend to bounce back emphatically after a loss, might begin to struggle in this later phase because of the lack of depth in their side which has hindered Shabbir Alis plans time and again this season. With teams bottling up Theodore Sunday and Mike Okoro and the Mohammedan Sporting midfield not being creative enough Shabbir Alis men might have to scrap for every win.         
	A resurgent East Bengal are bound to push Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting till the very end, especially since more national team players like Surkumar Singh and Mehrajuddin Wadoo are slated to return to the side after fighting back injuries.         
	But as coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee pointed out in the post match news conference on Monday, East Bengals fate is no longer in their own hands. We must win every match that we play but even then winning the league is no longer in our hands solely, he said. While Manoranjan will be hoping for dropped points from the other two sides, the win against Mohammedan Sporting will certainly come as a boost.         
	The growing understanding between Sunil Chhetri and Ashim Biswas up front will surely be a cause of worry for the opposition. The pair looked lively and created chances for each other against Mohammedan Sporting. Speaking after the match Ashim said: I have played with Sunil before and weve always shared a good understanding We enjoy playing with each other. A visibly delighted Ashim dedicated his goal to his new-born daughter.         
	Peerless FC are all set for relegation in the CFL, while second from bottom United SC will be hoping for a turnaround in fortunes in the I-League. Raghu Nandys George Telegraph who have impressed throughout this season will be hoping to finish strongly as well.

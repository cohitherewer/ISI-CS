                                                   Clark recalled for tri-series

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Australia recalled seamer Stuart Clark in place of Shaun Tait for the Commonwealth Bank ODI tri-series against Sri Lanka and India, according to a Cricket Australia release. 
    
	Clark did not play in the three one-day Internationals against New Zealand in December and will miss the Twenty20 match against India on Friday because of an ankle injury. 
    
	Tait announced earlier this week that he was taking an indefinite break from cricket due to emotional and physical exhaustion. 
    
	The squad, with the exception of Shaun Tait, is the same squad that played against New Zealand for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a Cricket Australia statement. 
    
	Stuart Clark is expected to be fully fit to take his place in the tri-series squad. 
    
	Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist will play his final international matches after announcing his retirement last week. His likely successor, Brad Haddin, was also named in the squad. 
    
	Australias first match of the tri-series is against India in Brisbane on Sunday. 
       
	THE SQUAD 
    
	Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist (vice-captain), Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, James Hopes, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds.

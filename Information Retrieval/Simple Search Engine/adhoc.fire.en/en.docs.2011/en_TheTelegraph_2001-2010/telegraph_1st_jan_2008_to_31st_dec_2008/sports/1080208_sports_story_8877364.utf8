                                                  New kid on the block
  - Dream is to play for my country... I feel excited, says Somdev       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Somdev Dev Varman in New Delhi on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	New Delhi: When 18-year-old Somdev Dev Varman won the $10,000 Futures tournament in Calcutta four years ago, not many took notice of his growing skills.         
	But the Tripura boy left everyone surprised after he joined the University of Virginia in 2006. A player with tremendous groundstrokes, tough legs and strong serves, Somdev became the first Indian to win the US Collegiate championship  one of the toughest of its kind in the world  last year.         
	During the entire season, Somdev, whose father is a senior central government official currently based in Guwahati, lost just one singles and doubles match for his college. In the singles final, the youngster defeated John Isner, the man who snatched a set from Roger Federer in the US Open.         
	Somdev also displayed remarkable fighting spirit when he bagged another Futures title in the US. He entered as a qualifier, crossed two rounds to make the main draw and then won five matches in a row to clinch the title.         
	It didnt really come as a surprise when Indian captain Leander Paes chose Somdev ahead of Prakash Amritraj for the singles against Uzbekistan. After all, Somdev has been knocking on the Davis Cup door for some time now. He missed the opportunity to make his debut against Uzbekistan last year because of a visa problem.         
	I feel no pressure. Pressure brings opportunity, said a smiling Somdev, who is pitted against Uzbekistans best player  Denis Istomin  on the first day. My dream is to play for my country... I feel excited.         
	Initially, Paes was upset with Somdev for reporting late for the tie. Immediately on his arrival in the capital last Saturday, Paes said: Somdev is coming only on Tuesday. Perhaps he has a commitment to fulfil with his college team. Ideally, he should have been here earlier.         
	But Somdev forced his captain to speak in a different tone within hours of his arrival. So impressed was Paes with Somdevs attitude and style of play during practice that he dropped broad hints about fielding the youngster in singles.         
	Paes made no secret about how impressed he was by Somdevs attitude and style of play. Somdev is fearless. Hes got a big heart and thats the positive thing about him. He hasnt played much on grass, but I am amazed by his adaptability.         
	Vijay Amritraj also sounded optimistic. The boy is learning very fast. It remains to be seen how he takes up the challenge on grass court. Davis Cup is a test of character because it is played in different conditions.         
	Somdev said he also loved to play doubles. With Treat Huey, I have already won two doubles titles in the US. Teaming with Treat I had a 13-0 doubles record in the college circuit.         
	But my priority is singles. I prefer to play on clay courts but is shouldnt be a problem tomorrow, said the youngster.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capitulation surprises Mahela
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Capitulation surprises Mahela
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahela Jayawardene                           
	Colombo: Mahela Jayawardene on Saturday hailed his bowlers after winning the first Test against India by an innings and 239 runs. The Sri Lanka captain, during the post-match news conference, said he was a little surprised by the way Indias much vaunted batting line-up caved in.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether at the start of the day he expected the match to be over by today itself         
	Ya definitely! Just joking. It was important to take those four early wickets. We didnt want it to drag too long There was a bit of resistance though. I thought Laxman batted really well in the morning and we had to be very patient. Once we enforced the follow-on, we knew that we had to be more patient because the wicket wasnt doing that much. We were a bit lucky with a couple of early wickets and after that (Muttiah) Muralidharan bowled brilliantly Ajantha (Mendis) also kept up the pressure and bagged a few more at the end. Overall, it was a brilliant effort. We played a really good Test match.         
	On the pre-Test hype on Ajantha Mendis         
	Everyone was focused on Ajantha but Murali is a class act. When somebody else is creating that much pressure at the other end and picking up wickets as well, it opens up both ends for Murali to attack. He doesnt really have to control the runs. He just has to focus on attacking and picking up wickets, which is what he wants to do. Its good to have him. Unfortunately, the fast bowlers didnt get any assistance. If they had, probably all four guys would have picked up a few more wickets.         
	On Muralis performance         
	Murali basically knows how to go about it. We wanted him to attack from the start because he was getting a lot of turn and hitting the right areas. Whenever we could, we kept up the pressure and blocked a few run-scoring opportunities. Credit should go to both guys (Mendis and Muralidharan) They maintained the pressure and it is not an easy batting line-up to bowl at. We did a very good job.         
	How significant is the margin of victory?         
	For us, it was all about just winning the Test The first one in a three-match series. It was important and we were fully focused. Surprised a little because when you see that batting line-up, you obviously think these guys have a lot of experience and they will buckle down and really give you a good fight. We were prepared for that. The way we managed to bowl them out in two sessions is surprising but credit should go to these two guys (Murali and Mendis) because they bowled really well in tandem. Their (the Indian batsmens) records are brilliant but on the day you have got to perform. These two guys did that for us today.         
	On how he expects India to respond         
	Im sure they will come back strongly at us. Right now, though, we are enjoying this moment. We have got an extra day off. It is not easy to play in these conditions. The guys need a break.         
	On the high standards of fielding         
	On the field, we made a huge difference in this Test. Thats because of the effort we put in off the field during practice. Everything is going our way But we cant stop what we are doing. We need to keep working really hard Try to maintain these standards or improve. Thats our challenge.         
	Note: The Sri Lanka selectors have added paceman Dammika Prasad to the squad for the second Test, in Galle, from July 31.

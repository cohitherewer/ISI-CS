The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tsonga the man to beat
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tsonga the man to beat
            MARK HODGKINSON in SHANGHAI            Jo-Wilfried Tsonga                           
	When the year began, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was best known for his resemblance to a young Muhammad Ali.         
	But then he smashed, clumped and slam-dunked his way into the final of Januarys Australian Open, where he finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic, and now he is about to make his first appearance in the tour finale, the Masters Cup.         
	These days, Tsonga isnt just a celebrity look-alike, but a sporting face in his own right.         
	The Frenchman is one of four new faces at the Masters Cup, which means that half of the field are to make their debuts here, with Andy Murray, Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro and Frances Gilles Simon the other first-timers.         
	Roger Federer is attempting to win a fifth Masters Cup title  he has won four of the last five of these tournaments, but perhaps one of the four new boys is going to come through and lift the trophy.         
	What a finish to the year that would be for Tsonga, who missed the French Open and Wimbledon because of injury, and who only qualified for Shanghai by beating Argentinas David Nalbandian in the final of last weeks Paris tournament.         
	To think that, only a couple of years ago, he was ranked outside the top 200, and was playing small tournaments at small clubs.         
	Tsonga is a wonderful talent and has great court presence as he doesnt leave his emotions back in the locker-room. If the 23-year-old from Le Mans does well here, the Chinese should take to him.         
	After Rafael Nadal withdrew, Del Potro was left as the only player to be involved in both this tournament and then the Davis Cup final, and it will be intriguing to see whether the 20-year-old goes flat out in Shanghai, or whether he tries to keep something in reserve for when his country face Spain in Mar del Plata.         
	Perhaps all will become clear on Sunday when he opens the tournament with a Gold group match against Djokovic.         
	Simon, who was only given a place in the draw after Nadal pulled out, would plainly prefer to be here as of right.         
	But that does not mean that the 23-year-old Frenchman should be under-estimated, given that he has beaten Nadal, Federer and Djokovic this season.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

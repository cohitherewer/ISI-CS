The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drew ready to weave magic
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Drew ready to weave magic
                      
	Augusta: Drew Weaver was struggling to contain his excitement at playing in his first US Masters on Monday, just a year after having to deal with the tragedy at Virginia Tech University.         
	The week will be one of contrasting emotions for Weaver, who narrowly missed being caught up in the gunfire of the Virginia Tech massacre on April 16 which left 32 fellow students and the gunman dead.         
	The emotional pendulum will swing to the other end of the spectrum on Thursday, when Weaver, dressed in Virginia Tech colours, launches his opening shot at the Masters.         
	One of the things that I talked with my parents and my coach and everybody about, and one of the things I really wanted to do, was to wear the Virginia Tech logo, Weaver told reporters following Mondays practice round at Augusta National.         
	Just having something with the Virginia Tech logo (and) instantly you get associated with April 16th and its very unfortunate. People, when they talk to you about it, its always in a very supportive way.         
	Its nice to have all of the support. We definitely needed it and we still do, even the one-year anniversary coming up. Youve got to really appreciate the small things after being so close to something that bad.         
	Weaver was only 100 metres away, close enough to hear the shots ring through his accounting class, when a gunman opened fire on students. A text message from a frie-nd told Weaver what was unfolding outside his classroom, sending him and his fellow students running for safety.         
	We didnt really know what was going on, recalled Weaver. We thought it was a bomb threat and heard the shots go off, it was a terrifying few seconds... everyone pretty much freaked and ran as far as we could get away from the scene.         
	As life slowly returned to normal, so did Weavers focus on golf, the 20-year-old American going on to win the British amateur title last June and earn an invitation to the Masters.         
	Weaver will spend Masters week living in the famed Crows Nest which sits on top the players locker room at Augusta National and has been home to some of golfs greatest names including Tiger Woods.         
	Its just such an incredible week and I just cant believe  I still cant believe that Im actually a part of it and playing in it, Weaver said. Today definitely made me realise that I was here, and playing the practice round was just an incredible feeling.

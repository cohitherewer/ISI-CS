	Zurich: Fifa will issue guidelines by Thursday to calm growing tension between clubs and countries over the release of players for the Olympic football tournament.         
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter, an International Olympic Committee member, is preparing to rule on whether players must report for national duty if selected for next months Beijing Games, which run in direct conflict with the start of the European season.         
	Fifa declined to comment on Wednesday but said an official statement from the presidents office is expected in the next 24 hours. Blatter has been an IOC member since 1999 and is a strong supporter of the Olympic tournament.         
	For any player, the Olympic football tournament represents a highlight of his career and I hope that a solution can be found, Blatter said in February.         
	Current Fifa advice obliges clubs to release players 23 and under, but allows them to stop older players taking part. Each of the 16 competing teams can have three over-age players on its roster.         
	The informal rule is being tested by two German clubs after the announcement of the Brazil squad on Tuesday. Werder Bremen have refused to release Diego, a 23-year-old midfielder, and Schalke want to keep their 22-year-old defender Rafinha.         
	Both clubs say the players would miss pre-season training and two Bundesliga games, while Schalke have a Champions League qualifying round match scheduled for August 12 or 13.         
	Brazil star Ronaldinho has also been chosen but the 28-year-old midfielders Spanish club FC Barcelona is refusing to let him go to China, where Brazil are due to play the host nation on August 13.         
	Ronaldinho has said that he wants to play for Brazil at the Olympics in defiance of the wishes of his club.         
	I do not see myself being left out of Beijing, Ronaldinho said during a press conference at a charity event on Tuesday. I see myself in the Olympics doing good things and bringing home the gold medal.         
	Ronaldinho was named in Brazils Olympic squad on Monday, but a day later Barcelona posted a statement on its website saying the former world player of the year will have to report for training on Monday, the first session of the 2008-09 season.         
	The Olympics do not form part of the official Fifa calendar, and no official decision has ever been made in that respect, so the club is under no obligation to allow its player to travel, the statement said.         
	The Brazilian star, who last played on March 9, is still under contract with Barcelona, even though he has been linked with transfers to Manchester City and AC Milan. Brazil are scheduled to gather in two weeks for the Olympics  the only significant title they have never won.         
	I feel very motivated and happy for having been summoned to the team, Ronaldinho said. My aim is now to prepare myself for the Olympic Games  an honour few players have received.         
	Ronaldinhos agent and brother, Roberto de Assis, said he was also confident that Ronaldinho would be going to Beijing. Barcelona have always treated Ronaldinho very well and we are sure everything will work out and that we will be going to Beijing, he said.

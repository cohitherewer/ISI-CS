The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unforgettable experience for Mohun Bagan juniors
                                                                                                                                                                                           Unforgettable experience for Mohun Bagan juniors
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Even if Rahul Das goes on to win the biggest prize in international football, he is unlikely to forget the Danone Nations Cup in a hurry.         
	The captain of the Mohun Bagan under-12 team, who returned on Tuesday, trembled with excitement when he narrated his Paris experience.         
	You know I shook hands with Zidane during the prize distribution ceremony, he started excitedly, before continuing, he patted on my head lightly and asked me about India and said we had done very well in the tournament. I was truly overwhelmed.         
	Mohun Bagan finished 12th among 40 teams in the worlds biggest tournament for under-12 kids, but the fans in the French capital were truly impressed.         
	We were unlucky not to reach the semi-finals, said Mohun Bagan coach Amiyo Ghosh. I shouldnt be saying, but the standard of supervision in the crucial pre-quarter final encounter against Czech Republic was very poor.         
	The decisive goal against us came off a free kick. It wasnt the best decision, said the 61-year-old coach.         
	Among the Bagan players, striker Anubrata Maity was the biggest hit as he scored six goals. Midfielder Souvik Ghosh, striker Subhrojit Das and goalkeeper Saikat Das also had a good tournament.

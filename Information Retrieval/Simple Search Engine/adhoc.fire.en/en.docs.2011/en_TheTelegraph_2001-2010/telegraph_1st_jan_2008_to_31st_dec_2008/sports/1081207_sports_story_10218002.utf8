The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Best chance for Proteas to beat Aussies: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Best chance for Proteas to beat Aussies: Kirsten
                  Gary Kirsten                     
	Durban: South African players should attack the young and inexperienced players of the Australian cricket team if they want to beat the World Champions in the upcoming Test series, India coach Gary Kirsten has suggested.         
	Kirsten said that the Australian team could be beaten at home. The hosts are lacking in experience after the retirement of players like Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist and Justin Langer.         
	If the South Africans can put enough pressure on these (inexperienced) players, their lack of experience will eventually make the difference, Kirsten said.         
	The former South Africa opener felt Australia were struggling to get replacements of their retired star players and it gives the visitors the best opportunity to beat them.         
	The Aussies are a difficult team to beat in their own backyard, (but) I believe that the Proteas have their best chance ever to win a series there. Without (the retired greats) the Aussies are forced to include a lot of young, inexperienced players who have not yet made their mark at Test level, he said.         
	The first match of the three-Test series begins on December 17 in Perth.         
	Kirsten, who closely watched the Australian players when India beat them recently, said Indias recipe to win against the world champions was to put the teams interest first.         
	The main thing is to build a happy team and an environment in which everyone can trust each other. Our preparations for the Aussies were exceptional and we could weave a well-bonded team, each member focused on what we wanted to achieve, rather than on individual goals, Kirsten said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from the I-League if the standard of refereeing did not improve.         
	They alleged that the refereeing was atrocious during their match against JCT on Saturday. The penalty given against us was not fair, while we were denied one, East Bengal vice-president Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta said.         
	The East Bengal officials said the AIFF was not paying any heed to repeated appeals from the teams to review the standard of refereeing. If this goes on, well consider pulling out of I-League, the officials said.

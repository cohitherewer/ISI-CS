	Melbourne: Legendary West Indian batsman Brian Lara paid tribute to Sachin Tendulkar, saying that the Indian batting maestro was the most deserving batsman to break his world record and become the highest run-getter in Tests.         
	I was quite happy for him. There is no better individual or batsman in the world who could go past you than Sachin Tendulkar, Lara said.         
	He has been a great for so many years and is someone who is deserving of such a record. So I just want to wish him the best, he told local media during his visit to Australian Institute of Sports in Canberra.         
	Lara said he was never in doubt that his 11,953-run mark would be bettered following his retirement in 2006.. (PTI)

	Canberra: Paceman Ishant Sharma scalped three wickets to brighten chances of retaining his Test berth, but it was an unexpected name who stole the limelight on the second day of Indias tie against ACT Invitational XI at Manuka Oval on Friday. 
    
	John Rogers, 20, struck a fine 98 as the hosts finished the penultimate day on 292 for eight. 
    
	Chris, the better known Rogers, appeared to have done enough to book the Australia openers spot for the Perth Test if Matthew Hayden was forced to pull out because of a thigh injury. Chris did not score as big as John, but his 60 off 92 balls with five fours was a fine knock. 
    
	Chris said he expected the Australian selectors would give Hayden until the last minute to prove his fitness but felt he was ready to make his debut if called upon. 
    
	I just have to wait and see what happens and if Mattys not fit, who the selectors go for, he said. Ive been waiting for this moment for a while... I feel pretty good and ready to step up and make my debut. Chris said he was impressed by Ishant and expected the paceman to be a handful on the bouncy Waca pitch. 
    
	If you are tall and can bowl pretty quick, then its always a good place to bowl, Chris said. The day began with the tall, gangling Ishant getting three quick successes to have ACT XI reeling at 83 for three. 
    
	Ishant bowled with spirit and purpose on a largely flat wicket to account for Ed Cowan (14), Johanthan Dean (0) and Mark Higgs (1). 
    
	Things only became worse when Chris fell leg before to Harbhajan Singh, trying to sweep a fullish delivery, having made 60 in the team total of 100 for four. John then took charge and carried out a belligerent attack as the Indians wilted in the heat. 
    
	He put on 74 runs for the fifth wicket with Randall Starr (27) and 67 runs for the sixth wicket with James Crosthwaite (27). John was dismissed when he cut R.P. Singh uppishly to deep point for 98. He hit 12 fours in his 189-ball knock in his 247-minute stay. 
    
	Ishant seems to have booked his place for the Perth Test as RPs new ball partner. The choice for the third seamer  from Irfan Pathan, Pankaj Singh and V.R.V. Singh  wont be easy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Becks show not enough
                      
	Edmonton: David Beckham put on a show on Tuesday, but it wasnt enough for Los Angeles as the Vancouver Whitecaps won their friendly 2-1 on Tuesday.         
	In the 43rd minute, Beckham sent a cross-field pass that Alan Gordon headed past Serb goalie Srdjan Djekanovic to tie the game at 1-1. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star also took a 30-yard free kick that just missed the near post as camera flashes flickered among the crowd of 37,104 at Commonwealth Stadium.         
	The crowd appeared more supportive of the Galaxy, but the Whitecaps had the better of play for most of the match.         
	Eduardo Sebrango scored on a picture-perfect cross in the 66th minute and Nick Adderly gave the Whitecaps the lead four minutes in, scoring from 20 yards out.         
	This was the second friendly match in six months, following a Novembers scoreless draw in Vancouver. (AP)

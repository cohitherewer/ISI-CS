                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     RCTC owners demand transparency 
            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: The good news is that a team of competent veterinarian surgeons have arrived in the city to take the stock of the situation, and also to crack the mystery fever that has gripped the Hastings and the racecourse stables since last week. The bad news is that the commencement of the winter season may be delayed by a few weeks.          
	Dr Hasneyan Mirza from Bangalore and Dr Karpik (Chennai) were in the city on Monday on a request form the RCTCs top-brass to examine and monitor the situation. They were hopeful, it was learnt, that the situation in the RCTC was bad but not alarming. The timely action had helped the club stop things from going out of hands. Surgeons also advised that the whole thing should be handled with care without pushing horses to attain racing fitness. This action may ruin many horses and RCTC may be back to square one after making painstaking efforts to put the racing back on the track in the recent past.The clubs stewards and officials were, however, playing their cards close to the chest, keeping the horseowners in total dark about the start of the winter season. Owners are demanding transparency.

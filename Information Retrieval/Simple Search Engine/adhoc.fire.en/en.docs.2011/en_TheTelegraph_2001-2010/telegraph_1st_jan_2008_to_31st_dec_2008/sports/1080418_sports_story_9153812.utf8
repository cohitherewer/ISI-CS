	New Delhi: The Olympic torch relay brought Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi together for the first time in many days. Off-the-court, it hasnt happened in the recent past.         
	On Thursday, however, when the Indian leg of the relay reached the finishing stage at the India Gate here, the two tennis stars walked hand in hand to take over the torch from Indian Olympic Association (IOA) secretary general Randhir Singh and lit the Olympic cauldron in unison.         
	It was a unique experience, said Bhupathi after the event. Its a special day in my life. I enjoyed the occasion and wish Beijing Olympics all success.         
	Asked how he felt while sharing the limelight with Paes, Bhupathi laughed and said: It was a great opportunity for the photographers.         
	Even IOA president Suresh Kalmadi made it a point to say a few words about how the duo came together for the sake of Olympic spirit.         
	It was a memorable day in Indian sport, Kalmadi said. All top sportspersons, including Leander and Mahesh ran together. They showed the world how seriously they were gearing up for the battle ahead in Beijing.         
	Those who pulled out missed something special. We didnt, Kalmadi added.         
	On Thursday, musician Aayan Ali Bangash and ace shooter Jaspal Rana withdrew a few hours before the start of the relay, citing personal reasons.         
	The relay started at the Vijay Chowk when vice chairman of the Beijing Olympic Committee, Jiang Xiaoyu, handed over the torch to Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, who in turn gave it to Kalmadi.         
	After the IOA chief ran a few metres, Flying Sikh Milkha Singh had the honour of leading the relay before the torch changed hands among 68 celebrities, including sportspersons, film stars and politicians taking short turns.         
	Aslam Sher Khan, Dhanraj Pillay, Zafar Iqbal, Wilson Cherian, Khazan Singh, K. Kunjurani, P.T. Usha, Karnam Malleshwari and Manavjit Singh were among others who took part in the event.         
	Bollywood was represented by Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan.

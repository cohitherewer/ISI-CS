    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Legend on completing 19 years as an India cricketer today             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: Saturday will see Sachin Tendulkar complete 19 years as an India cricketer. In the lead-up, he spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Have there been stages in your awesome career (12,273 runs in Tests, 40x100; 16,361 runs in ODIs, 42x100)?         
	A Just two, Id say... The first would be from my debut till the maiden tour of Australia, in 1991-92, and the second from there onwards... I was 18 then, but that tour made a man out of me... It was a defining moment in my career.         
	Youve been in the India dressing room for two generations... From the time of the Dilip Vengsarkars to the Gautam Gambhirs... The Kid of 1989 has been the senior-most pro for some years now... Whats your own take on this?         
	I fool around, try to crack jokes... My seniority and experience is all on the field... I like the dressing room atmosphere to be light, for thats the way it should be. I try and contribute towards that... Sure, I was the baby of the team 19 years ago, but I dont think Ive changed much in the dressing room... I mean, I wont sit in a corner and be quiet because Im the senior-most around. Thats not me.         
	Do the newcomers get intimidated by your presence?         
	(Laughs) Its for them to answer, but I try and make them comfortable... Were, after all, part of one team.         
	Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly are through with international cricket... Today, what does the future hold for Team India?         
	Its difficult to predict... What I can tell you is that it will be difficult to fill the space left behind by Anil and Sourav... One played for over 18 years, the other for over 12... Its a long time to be playing for your country... Talented players are there, but what has been left vacant cant be filled in 12 or 18 months...         
	Like millions, Mahendra Singh Dhoni grew up idolising you. How is he as captain?         
	Dhoni has a mature head on his shoulders... Hes balanced... His peripheral awareness is very good... I remember having been impressed by him from very early on when, in between deliveries, Id chat with him from the slips cordon... Dhoni wasnt even the vice-captain then.         
	Much like you, Dhoni remains calm. Youve been asked this before, but one cant help asking once more  how do you handle such enormous pressure?         
	Look, the heat is on everyone... Pressure is always there... Some show theyre under pressure, others dont... Focusing on the job at hand is probably the best way of not getting overwhelmed.         
	Have you gifted yourself anything after breaking Brian Laras record (in Mohali, last month)?         
	(Laughs) Youve asked an interesting question... Nothing as yet... Id, of course, gifted myself a BMW M5 after scoring the (record-authoring) 35th Test hundred, three years ago... Thought I deserved it!         
	What now?         
	I do get tempted by cars... Havent made up my mind, though...         
	Did Sara and Arjun present you something?         
	They congratulated me... They were quite shy, really, and gave what Id describe a good gift... (After a pause) My mother blessed me, as usual... I was welcomed home with an aarti... Were a traditional family and dont like making a show of celebrations. You wont find us going overboard.         
	Whats the future youre looking at? Everybody wants you around till the 2011 World Cup... Come to think of it, 2009 is already at our doorstep...         
	I know that... I also know well-wishers have put 2011 as a target for me... However, what Id like to do is remain fit and enjoy the game... Thats my goal, rather than being available for a particular series or a tournament... Id rather look at the immediate future and be ready... As is my practice, I wouldnt like to look too far ahead... You know I look at the next engagement, not an X number of years down the line...         
	Fine, but if youre fit and enjoying your cricket, then it wouldnt be unrealistic to say you could actually be available for the next World Cup...         
	Id try to be fit... Work as hard as possible... Having said that, I wouldnt like to start thinking of 2011 in 2008... But, yes, Ill continue doing the things Ive done for the last 19 years... I know fans would be happy (to see him in the 2011 showpiece)...

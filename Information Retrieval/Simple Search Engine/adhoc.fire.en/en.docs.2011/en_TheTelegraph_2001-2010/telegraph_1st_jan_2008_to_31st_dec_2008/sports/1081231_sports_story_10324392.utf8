                                                                                                                                                                                                     SA bring Aussies to their knees
            Simon Briggs                      
	Melbourne: There was a sense of denial about Australias response to their historic series defeat at the MCG.         
	The tourists won the second Test at a canter, overhauling their victory target of 183 with nine wickets in hand. But you would hardly have known it from the comments of Andrew Hilditch, Australias chairman of selectors, who calmly told reporters that the rebuilding process is going well.         
	Australia have always been blessed by an enviable depth of talent, and no one is suggesting that they are going to become a bad side overnight. But Hilditchs blas attitude suggests that he and his co-selectors have yet to face up to the reality of a new world order.         
	This mindset could lead to some painful reappraisals over the next few years. It could also boost Englands chances of success in the Ashes next summer. After a dynamic start to this Test, Ricky Pontings team unravelled with frightening speed. Strong favourites by the close of day two, they failed to win a single session over the remainder of the match. It hardly mattered what target South Africa had been set in the fourth innings; they batted with such total assurance that they could probably have chased down 500.         
	So complete was Australias capitulation that South African supporters came out of the ground with a sense of anti-climax. Everyone knew that the world champions would be forced to give up their long unbeaten sequence sooner or later; we just didnt expect them to do so without a fight.         
	There had been rumours of sweeping changes in the air before Saturdays third and final Test. But Hilditch confirmed that only the three players with injury problems  Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds and spare allrounder Shane Watson  would be missing from the squad when it reconvenes in Sydney.         
	In defiance of most predictions, the selectors also reaffirmed their ongoing support for Matthew Hayden, the embattled opener who has totted up just 110 runs in nine innings this Australian summer.         
	The public debate on Hayden had centred around the question of whether he should be given one more Test at the SCG  a chance to bid farewell to his adoring fans  or ushered straight into international retirement. Hilditch took a very different view, hinting that Hayden remained Australias first-choice opener for the Ashes.         
	Moving forward, we would still want him very much to be part of our plans, he said. This was another surprising comment, in view of the fact that Hayden is now 37 years old, while his run tallies have dropped faster than the FTSE 100 this year.         
	This is not the time for chopping and changing, Hilditch added, moving some Australian critics to ask If not now, then when?         
	Lee will have an arthroscopy at the weekend to clean debris out of the back of his left ankle  a similar operation to the one Andrew Flintoff has had so many times. He will probably miss eight weeks cricket, which should also give the stress reaction at the front of his foot time to heal.         
	Meanwhile, Andrew Symonds will have an exploratory operation on a sore knee, and Shane Watson will take a break to rest a stress fracture in his back. After so many years of blasting through opposition batting line-ups, the Aussies are beginning to feel the effect of long days in the field.         
	The teams inability to take quick wickets has contributed to their sequence of four defeats in the past seven Tests  the worst set of results they have returned since the late 1980s. It also makes Hilditchs take on this match seem wilfully one-eyed.         
	We lost our strike bowler, he said, in reference to Brett Lees foot injury, and obviously that exposed us. Probably if that hadnt happened, we may well have won this Test match.         
	Perhaps Hilditch has not been following Lees figures for the series, which now stand at one wicket for 249 runs. For Sydney, Australia will experiment with a new allrounder in the flame-haired shape of Andrew McDonald, who is 27 but relatively inexperienced at first-class level.         
	They will also bring in two swing bowlers to spice up the attack: left-arm inswing bowler Doug Bollinger  who is expected to make his debut  as well as right-armer Ben Hilfenhaus, who will probably carry the drinks. Whoever comes in will face a daunting challenge to get this team back on track.                     
	UNBEATEN streak         
	South Africa have not lost a Test series since losing 0-2 in Sri Lanka in August 2006. Since then their series record is as follows:         
	 2006-07 (home) bt Ind 2-1 (3-match series)
  2006-07 (home) bt Pak 2-1 (3)
  2007-08 (away) bt Pak 1-0 (2)
  2007-08 (home) bt NZ 2-0 (2)
  2007-08 (home) bt WI 2-1 (3) 
  2007-08 (away) bt Ban 2-0 (2)
  2007-08 (away) drew Ind 1-1 (3)
  2008 (away) bt Eng 2-1 (4)
  2008-09 (home) beat Ban 2-0 (2)
  2008-09 (away) lead Aus 2-0 (3+)
  + one more Test remains

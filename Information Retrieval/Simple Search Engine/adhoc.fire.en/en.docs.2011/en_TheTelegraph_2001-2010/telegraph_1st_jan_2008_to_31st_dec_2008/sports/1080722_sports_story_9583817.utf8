                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cricket briefs
                            
	Yuvrajs mother   hits back  
	New Delhi: Yuvraj Singhs mother, Shabnam, on Monday lashed out at Kapil Dev for criticising her sons party animal image, saying the former India captain is no angel himself.  
	I was indeed pained to read Kapil Devs highly provocative comments on Yuvis party life. As a mother, I am hurt mainly because Kapil has known Yuvi ever since he was born, an enraged Shabnam said.         
	He has obviously gone by the media reports, which was proved wrong, she added, referring to the late-night party that Yuvraj allegedly attended during the Asia Cup.         
	Kapil on Sunday criticised Yuvraj for putting parties over cricket and had urged him to concentrate on his game to realise his potential. Shabnam said Kapil had a past of his own and should therefore refrain from taking a high moral ground.         
	Kapil should remember that people who stay in glass house shouldnt throw stones at others, she fumed. He should introspect his misdeeds during the time he played cricket. If he rewinds his life, he will find that he wasnt an angel.    
	Warne thrilled         
	 London: The euphoria of the Indian Premier League has long settled but leading a bunch of no-hopers to the ultimate glory still gives the thrills to Shane Warne.         
	In almost 20 years of playing the game at the highest level, I dont think Ive ever experienced the intensity and passion from a crowd like we had in the IPL, except for maybe the Ashes, Warne said.         
	The beauty of the competition was that I could bowl to Sachin Tendulkar in Rajasthan and a 70,000 home crowd would be cheering for me to knock over an icon of world cricket that is Indian. That was unbelievable, said the Australian.    
	Jenners view         
	 New Delhi: Australian spin guru Terry Jenner feels Twenty20 cricket was only for mature spinners as it hardly has a role in the development of slow bowlers.         
	I have been very critical of Twenty20. The format plays no role in developing spinners. I have seen lot of young spinners bowl medium pace in T20 matches in order to give less runs, he said on the sidelines of a function here last night. Jenner also pointed out chinks in Ajantha Mendis armour. He said he was surprised to learn that the spinner didnt have a stock ball in his kitty.         
	Mendis needs to develop the stock ball which is very essential for leg-break bowlers. When I heard that he doesnt have stock ball, I was amazed, said the Australian great.    
	Telecast rights         
	 Calcutta: ESPN STAR Sports has secured exclusive broadcasting rights from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games and London 2012 Summer Games, says A Staff Reporter.         
	The network will telecast the London Olympic games in 22 countries across the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia.

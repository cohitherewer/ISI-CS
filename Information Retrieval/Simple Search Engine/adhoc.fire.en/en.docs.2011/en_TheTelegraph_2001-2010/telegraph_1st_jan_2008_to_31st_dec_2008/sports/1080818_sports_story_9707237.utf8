	Olympic organisers were forced to lift draconian security arrangements after complaints from sponsors that the millions of pounds they had spent was going to waste in an empty and joyless Olympic park.         
	The empty spaces around the main Olympic venues, where the majority of sponsors have their pavilions to show their wares to the public, came on top of a disappointing build-up to the Games for many companies.         
	Tight security, meant the zone was virtually closed to the public. Beijing has been unusually quiet since the opening ceremony, with the government encouraging viewers to watch the Games on television. Finally a delegation of sponsors, led by Johnson amp; Johnson, the healthcare company, complained to the IOC demanding change.         
	The sponsors have invested a lot of money in their showcasing and they had expected lots of people going through, Gerhard Heiberg, chairman of the IOCs marketing commission, said.

	Gurgaon: Smriti Mehra teed off her womens Indian Open campaign with a sedate opening round of 73 to be tied fifth, three shots off leader Pornanong Phatlum of Thailand, here on Wednesday.         
	Teenager Phatlum, who won the Thailand Ladies Open last month, posted six birdies against four bogeys to soar to the lead with a round of 70 in the $120,000 event, one stroke ahead of Indonesian amateur Jaya Lidya Evana and Jenni Kuosa of Finland.         
	Smriti shares fifth spot with the Thai duo of Porani Chutichai and Nontaya Sirisawang, Chinas Wang Chun, favourite Yuki Sakurai and Korean Kang Yeo-jin.         
	A 10th tee starter, Smriti bogeyed the 11th and 14th to take the turn at two-over before she picked up a shot on the sixth for her lone birdie of the day. Compatriot Irina Brar was tied 20th after an eventful round of 76 that included four birdies, five bogeys and a double bogey.         
	Among other Indians, Tanya Wadhwa was tied 25th after posting 77, while amateur Sharmila Nicollet carded 79 to be tied 29th. (PTI)

                                                   New Zealand seal series on Day III 

           
	Wellington: New Zealand wrapped up their two-Test series against Bangladesh when they bowled the visitors out for 113 just before lunch on the third day of the second Test at the Basin Reserve on Monday. 
    
	New Zealand won the match by an innings and 137 runs, and wrapped up the Test inside three days for the second time. They won the first Test in Dunedin by nine wickets. 
    
	New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said he could fault his team for how quickly they won the match but said they would have preferred a tougher workout before the upcoming home series against England.

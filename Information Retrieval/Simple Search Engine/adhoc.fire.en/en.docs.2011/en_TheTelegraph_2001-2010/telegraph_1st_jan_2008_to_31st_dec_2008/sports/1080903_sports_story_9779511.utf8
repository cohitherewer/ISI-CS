	New York: Leander Paes continued his winning run to advance to the mixed doubles semi-finals but, it was curtains for Mahesh Bhupathi at the US Open here.         
	The fifth-seeded duo defeated the Czech pair of Martin Damm and Vladimira Uhlirova 7-5, 6-2.         
	Paes and Cara Black will now take on the Swedish-Russian team of Jonas Bjorkman and Nadia Petrova.         
	Bhupathi, who was earlier ousted from the mixed doubles competition, crashed out of the mens doubles with a stunning third-round loss.         
	The Indian and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles, squandered a sets advantage to go down 6-2, 4-6, 4-6 to unseeded Argentines Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco. (PTI)

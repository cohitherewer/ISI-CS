The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victors to take home 85 million
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Victors to take home 85 million
            RICHARD MORGAN                      
	The Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea is the richest match in the history of football.         
	The contest at the Luzhniki Stadium between the English Premier League champions and the runners-up is reported to be generating in excess of 200 million in prize-money, spending and TV income.         
	The two sides will share a minimum of 115m between them, said Professor Simon Chadwick, director of Coventry Universitys Centre for the International Business of Sport.         
	The victors will receive 85m in prize-money and commercial spin-offs, with the losers taking home 30m.         
	However, it is not just the two competing teams who will benefit financially, but many different aspects of sporting life in the United Kingdom as well, including the betting industry, bars and restaurants, supermarkets, travel and consumer goods such as the sale of TVs.         
	This is not only the greatest prize in European football but is expected to be the biggest yet in economic terms, with a total cumulative impact that could be upwards of 210m.         
	Quite apart from the qualifying, group and knock-out stages of the tournament, this places the final itself on a par with the worlds leading regular, one-off sporting events, such as the National Football Leagues Super Bowl in the US.                                             
	Chadwick has also estimated that the Moscow economy will benefit by upwards of 35m of extra income being spent in the Russian capital on hotel rooms, food and drink.         
	ITV have increased their advertising rates for slots around the game by 50 per cent, with an actual 30-second slot during the final itself costing upwards of 200,000.         
	Athens, host of the 2007 final, made an estimated 18 million, the study said.         
	The 2008 Uefa Champions League final is not only the greatest prize in European club football, but it is also expected to be the biggest yet in economic terms, with a total cumulative impact that could amount to upwards of 210 million, professor Chadwick said.         
	The 85 million estimate for the winning team does not include more than 30 million the two English Premier League clubs may have already pocketed during their respective Champions League campaigns.         
	The figures are higher than the estimated economic impact of the 2007 Champions League final in Athens, where AC Milan beat Liverpool 2-1 and is supposed to have earned up to 67 million from winning, according to the study.

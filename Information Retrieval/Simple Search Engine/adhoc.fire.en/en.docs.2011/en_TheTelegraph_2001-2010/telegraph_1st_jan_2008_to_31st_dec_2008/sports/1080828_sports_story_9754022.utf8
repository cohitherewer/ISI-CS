The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It was a good toss to win, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     It was a good toss to win, says Dhoni
  - You need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing: Jayawardene       A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Colombo: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the toss played a crucial role in their first-ever bilateral one-day series triumph against Sri Lanka in their backyard on Wednesday. The wicket gave enough assistance to the spinners in the second half of the match as India took an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.         
	Dhoni also felt it was the bonhomie and sense of responsibility among the players that eventually helped his side to win the crucial fourth match.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Dhoni: It was a good toss to win... It does a bit under the lights here and the spinners get some help towards the closing stages. We managed to put some pressure on the batsmen. We needed to get some wickets at the top and Munaf (Patel) provided us with the breakthroughs today. The good thing about this team is if one doesnt get going, the others chip in at the right time. Zaheer (Khan) bowled okay today but Munaf was there to respond to the challenge. We are a good fielding side and that is a plus point. Suresh (Raina) played well; it was disappointing that we both got out together and we couldnt get runs in the end. We got out in a pair and I would have loved to get another 25 runs. It was a negative thing I had fever yesterday and hence I was feeling hot inside and was struggling towards the end. If I had continued for another five overs, it would have been good for the side.         
	Mahela Jayawardene: We shouldnt take any credit away from India. After winning the toss, they put the runs on board. We made some mistakes on the way. The spinners are getting more turn towards the end of the innings. But even today, after losing wickets, we were 40 runs away. You need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing. Jayasuriya gave us a good start but we didnt back it up. We hope to put up a good show in the next match. We need to avoid committing these silly mistakes Thushara has done very well with the ball and the bat. Its been a great one-day series for him. He has shown lot of potential, but he has to keep working hard.         
	Suresh Raina (Man of the Match): I enjoyed batting with Dhoni. We put a lot of pressure on them. The wicket was turning and Harbhajan bowled very well. I did a good job here. Really happy for the team; we are going home with the Cup.

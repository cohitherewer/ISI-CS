	Rome: World No. Roger Federer beat Croatias Ivo Karlovic 7-6, 6-3 in the Rome Masters on Thursday to book a quarter final berth against Czech Radek Stepanek.         
	Earlier, Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic edged past Russias Igor Andreev 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in his third round match and will face Spains Nicolas Almagro in the last eight.         
	Stepanek set up a match against Federer by ending Peruvian qualifier Luis Hornas impressive run with a 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 win.         
	Almagro, who knocked out Argentine seventh seed David Nalbandian in the second round, went straight into the last eight after Chilean Fernando Gonzalez, last years finalist, pulled out of their match with a leg injury.         
	In another match, eighth seed James Blake of the US got past Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. (Reuters)

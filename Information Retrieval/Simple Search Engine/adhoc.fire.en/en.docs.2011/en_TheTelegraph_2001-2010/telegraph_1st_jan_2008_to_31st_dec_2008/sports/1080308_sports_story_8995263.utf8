                                                   Chance for Proteas
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa, if sweeps the three-match series against Bangladesh, will have the opportunity to dethrone Australia and secure the top spot in the LG ICC ODI Championship table at the April 1 cut-off. The South Africa-Bangladesh one-day series is starting in Chittagong on Sunday.         
	According to an ICC release, both Australia and South Africa are currently sitting on 127 ratings points. But, when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point, the Proteas are just 0.529 of a point behind the Aussies.         
	If Graeme Smiths men win the series 3-0, they will stay on 127 ratings points but will finish ahead of Pontings side by 0.191 at the cut-off.

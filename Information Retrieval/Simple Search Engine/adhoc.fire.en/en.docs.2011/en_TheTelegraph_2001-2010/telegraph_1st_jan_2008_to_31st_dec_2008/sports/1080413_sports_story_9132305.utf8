The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICL may face legal hurdle
                                                                                                                                                                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	ICL may face legal hurdle  
	Karachi: The Indian Cricket League (ICL) organisers run the risk of inviting legal troubles after fielding a Pakistan XI side, which has irked the cricket board here. According to a board official, the ICL organisers have upset the PCB by fielding a Pakistan XI who have players wearing national colours in the ongoing World Series. PCB COO Shafqat Naghmi said: We are looking at the legal side of this issue. We believe what is being done is not right, he said.    
	Sledging okay, says McGrath  
	New Delhi: Calling the BCCI proposal to ban sledging as unrealistic, former Australian pace spearhead Glenn McGrath said players should be allowed to exchange words on-field as long as it is within limits. Its okay to show aggression and have a bit of chit chat in the middle, McGrath said. But once the match gets over and we leave the field, we are all mates, he added. Me and Vettori were talking about this last night. We had a bit of a laugh about it.    
	Younis rules himself out  
	Lahore: Middle-order batsman Younis Khan pulled out of the squad for the remaining matches of the ongoing one-day series between Pakistan and Bangladesh. According to the PCB chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed, Younis asked the selectors to exclude from the squad due to personal reasons. He asked us for rest and we agreed, Ahmed said. It gives us a chance to give some other players a go as well, guys like Bazid Khan and Fawad Alam in the batting. The stylish batsman looked out of sorts in the first two matches of the series, scoring 1 and 13.     
	Asif criticism  
	Lahore: Strongly criticising the ICCs decision to reinstate controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair, former captain Asif Iqbal has warned that the decision could result in conflicts, both on and off the field. I cannot convince myself that this decision (of the ICC to reinstate Hair) is in any way in the best interests of the game, for it carries potential of conflict and much unpleasantness both on and off the field. Pakistan is not the only Asian side that feels less than comfortable when he is officiating. Why must a man who makes some teams uncomfortable be forced on them? he said.     
	India XI win   
	Hyderabad: India XI followed up a solid batting display with a disciplined bowling performance to rout World XI by 44 runs in the Indian Cricket League 20s World Series on Saturday.  
	BRIEF SCORES         
	India XI 163/8 in 20 ovs (S. Abbas Ali 44, A. Jhunjhunwala 27; M. Kasprowicz 2/39). World XI 119/8 in 20 ovs (M. Atapattu 20, M. Elliot 19; A. Murtaza 2/19, S. Binny 2/19).                 
	Latif move  
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif launched a parallel cricket association here following his growing displeasure with the Karachi City Cricket Association (KCCA). Latif announced the launch of the Karachi Regional Cricket Association (KRCA) with himself as chairman.

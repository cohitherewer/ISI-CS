	Kuala Lumpur: India survived a late scare to beat New Zealand by three wickets and book a berth in the final of the under-19 World Cup here on Wednesday.         
	In a thrilling rain-curtailed semi-final, the Black Caps rode Corey Andersons 68-ball 70 to score a modest 205 for eight in 50 overs after electing to bat.         
	However, the target become slightly stiffer for the Indians after it was reset at 191 in 43 overs owing to rain interruption.         
	Opener Sreevats Goswami (51 off 76 balls) and Man of the Match Virat Kohli (43 off 53 balls) played sensible knocks to lay the foundation for Indias win, which was achieved in 41.3 overs at the expense of seven wickets.         
	Even though Indias firebrand pacer Pradeep Sangwan could not taste success, other bowlers stuck to their task to check the New Zealanders from scoring freely and take wickets at regular intervals.         
	New ball bowler Ajitesh Argal provided the early breakthrough claiming opener George Worker (3).         
	Ken Williamson (37) and Fraser Colson (32) consolidated the New Zealand innings with a vital 57-run partnership for the third wicket. Kohli removed both batsmen.         
	That, however, was not the end of the Black Caps resistance as Anderson blasted 70.         
	Anderson gathered 58 runs for the seventh wicket with M Bracewell (17 not out) before falling to Tanmay Srivastava.         
	Kohli (2/27), S. Kaul (2/43) and Srivastava (2/46) were the main wicket-takers for India.         
	During the run chase, India lost  Taruwar Kohli (10) and Srivastava (13)  cheaply, but wicketkeeper-batsman Goswami and Kohli steadied the boat by adding 84 runs for the third wicket.         
	Goswami was castled by Tim Southee while Kohli was caught by Williamson off George Worker.         
	The Indians were cruising with 11 required off 21 balls with five wickets in hand. But suddenly, the Black Caps applied pressure and were able to notch up two quick wickets.         
	But middle order batsman Saurabh Tiwary (29 not out off 41 balls) held his nerve to see the Indians through.                 (AGENCIES)

                                                    Tsonga shocks Nadal in ridiculous win

         A dejected Rafael Nadal after his loss to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Thursday 
          
	Melbourne: He may not yet fly like the legendary Muhammad Ali but Jo-Wilfried Tsonga sure stings. 
    
	Ask Rafael Nadal. Armed with a forehand that carries the sting of his lookalikes famous fists, the unseeded French powerhouse blasted the world No. 2 Spaniard off court 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 with a dazzling array of shots to secure the biggest victory of his career. 
    
	Not only does he look remarkably similar to the legendary boxer, Tsongas flair, both on and off-court, frequently reminds one of Alis while demolishing his opponents. 
    
	On Thursday, the unseeded Frenchman described his astonishing straight-set rout of Nadal in the Australian Open semi-finals as ridiculous. 
    
	It was ridiculous, Tsonga said. For me its a big dream. Its just amazing. I played unbelievable tonight. 
    
	The 22-year-old, playing only his fifth Grand Slam tournament, has been plagued by a succession of back and shoulder injuries during his career and has never won a Tour title. 
    
	Tsonga will meet either Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic in Sundays final. 
    
	He knocked out seeds Andy Murray, Richard Gasquet and Mikhail Youzhny on the way to the last four. 
    
	Rafael plays the same tennis all the time, Tsonga said. His level is very high and its very difficult to play against him. I was moving on the court like I never move, so everything was perfect. 
    
	On being compared in looks to the boxing legend, Tsonga had said: Im not flying on the court like him, but I try to fly.Nadal was not quite lost for words following his thrashing  but he was at a loss for ideas. 
    
	We have to accept today that he played unbelievable tennis. Playing the ball very hard every time, serving unbelievably, the Spaniard shrugged. 
    
	In the backhand he didnt miss one. Every time he did the forehand it was a winner, so I congratulate him. Thats it. 
    
	Nadal had thought he was playing well enough to win the tournament. 
    
	I was playing very fine, very well, but it wasnt for me to beat Tsonga tonight, Nadal said shaking his head. 
    
	Running unbelievably, physically very explosive, everything. What can I say? No weak points about his game tonight. I have to find something. I gonna think all night. (AGENCIES)

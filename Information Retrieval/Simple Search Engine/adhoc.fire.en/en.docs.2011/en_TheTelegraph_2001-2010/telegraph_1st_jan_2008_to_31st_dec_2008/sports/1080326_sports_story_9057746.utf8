	Sentosa: Indias top-ranked golfer Jyoti Randhawa will need a miracle to make his fourth British Open appearance after a disastrous opening round of five-over 77 at the International Final Qualifying Asia here on Tuesday.         
	Compatriot Shiv Kapurs chances, too, look slim after the Delhi golfer went three-over 75 to be tied 31 in the two-day qualifier at the Sentosa Golf Clubs Serapong course.         
	Malaysian Danny Chia, Filipino Angelo Que and Englands Yasin Ali blasted identical three-under 69 to stay in the hunt for the four tickets at stake to the Open in Royal Birkdale in July.         
	In fact, none of the Indians could return a sub-par round with Amandeep Johls two-over 74 being the best of the lot.         
	Erratic Kapur birdied the fourth and fired an eagle on the 12th but a couple of bogeys and as many double bogeys blighted his card.         
	Randhawas plight was worse. He birdied the fourth and 12th holes but as many as five bogeys and a final hole double bogey cooked his goose, leaving him languishing at tied 52nd and virtually dashing his hopes of a fourth appearance in the elite event.         
	Among others, Digvijay Singh carded 75 to join Kapur at tied 37, while Randhawa had Rahil Gangjee for company. Gurbaaz Mann was tied 62 after a nightmarish round of 10-over 82.

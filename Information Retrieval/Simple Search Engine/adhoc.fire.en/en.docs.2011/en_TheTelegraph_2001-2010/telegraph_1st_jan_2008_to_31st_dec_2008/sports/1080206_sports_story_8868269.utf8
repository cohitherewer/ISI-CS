                                                Saurav advances, Iskandar upset
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Top seed Mohammed Azlan Iskandar of Malaysia bowed out of the three-star $30,000 Calcutta International squash meet losing 3-11, 9-11, 11-3, 6-11 to Shahid Zaman of Pakistan in Round I at the Calcutta Racket Club on Tuesday. Seventh seed Saurav Ghosal kept Indias hopes alive winning 10-11 (0-2), 11-6, 11-10 (2-0), 11-7 against Mohammed El Shorbagy of Egypt after Ritwik Bhattacharya, Gaurav Nandrajog and Siddharth Suchde lost their respective matches.         
	While Ritwik lost to fourth seed Aamir Atlas Khan of Pakistan 8-11, 7-11, 6-11 in a 33-minute encounter, Nandrajog went down to sixth seed Omar Mosaad of Egypt 8-11, 7-11, 9-11. Siddharth was edged out by eighth seed Farhan Mehboob (Pakistan) 11-4, 11-5, 11-6.         
	Zaman will face Ghosal in the next round on Wednesday.         
	In an enthralling 55-minute encounter Ghosal crawled back after losing the first game 10-11 (0-2) to his Egyptian opponent. The city-boy made some unforced errors and was reeling 5-9 at one stage. Fighting hard he made it 9-9 but finally lost it 10-11 (0-2) succumbing to Shorbagys speed.         
	In the second game, the former junior world champion came back strongly and outsmarted Shorbagy 11-6. With prompt returns and some amazing nicks, Ghosal was at his best. But in the third game, the Egyptian made a strong return and made it 10-10. Ghosal however, picked some good shots and pocketed the game 11-10 (2-0). The fourth game witnessed some sluggish shots from Shorbagy and the Indian capitalised them.

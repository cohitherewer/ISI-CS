                                                                                                                                                                                             Saina in semis
    - CHINA MASTERS                 Saina Nehwal                           
	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal continued her rampaging form and staved off the challenge of third seed Lin Zhu of China to cruise into the semi-finals of the China Masters Super Series at Changzhou in China.         
	The national champion overcame a second game lapse to beat Zhu 21-16, 21-23, 21-18 in a fiercely contested match, which lasted 56 minutes.         
	Saina depended more on smashes to win points and quickly ran away with the first game. However, the 18-year old shuttler could not continue the momentum and the second game slipped through her fingers.         
	The Indian then came back strongly, and pocketed the third game to seal the match and set up a tough clash against Hong Kongs sixth seed Mi Zhou, who thumped top seed Lan Lu 10-21, 21-13, 21-14 in the other quarter final.         
	Zhou had inflicted a crushing first round defeat on Saina in the Yonex Japan Super Series tournament last week. (PTI)

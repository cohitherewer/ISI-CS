	Beijing: Sergio Aguero scored two second-half goals in seven minutes on Tuesday and later set up another to lead Argentina to a 3-0 win over rival Brazil and into their second straight Olympic final.         
	Aguero opened the scoring for the defending champions by chesting in a left-side cross in the 52nd minute, then scored again from two yards on a cross from the right in the 58th. Aguero also set up a 76th-minute penalty kick that was converted by Juan Roman Riquelme.         
	It was the first victory for Argentina against Brazil in three years. They hadnt beaten Brazil since a 3-1 victory in a World Cup qualifier in June 2005.         
	Its not a score you see every day when Brazil and Argentina play, Argentina coach Sergio Batista said. Argentina had a great match, with intelligence and personality.         
	Argentina, trying to become the first nation to win consecutive titles in 40 years, will now face Nigeria in a rematch of the 1996 final in Atlanta, when the Africans won 3-2 for their first and only title.         
	Brazil will have to wait at least another four years to try to win their first Olympic gold medal. It is the only significant title the five-time world champions have never won.         
	The match in front of a crowd of nearly 53,000 at Workers Stadium marked the encounter of the tournaments top stars, former FC Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho.         
	Both players displayed their uncanny skills, but Messi threatened the most and created dangerous scoring chances for Argentina. In his first Olympics, the midfielder set up Argentinas second and third goals, while AC Milans Ronaldinho struck the post with a free kick as he tried to put Brazil back into the match.         
	Messi sent a dangerous shot across the area in the 32nd, and had one of his best chances in the 41st after clearing three defenders inside the area before firing a shot that was barely saved by goalkeeper Renan.         
	Aguero ran past defender Breno to open the scoring after Angel di Marias cross, then easily added to the lead in front of the goal mouth after Ezequiel Garays set-up. Messi started the play on the second goal by eluding several defenders before feeding the ball to Garay.         
	Messi also set up Aguero inside the area before he was fouled by Breno in the play that prompted the penalty kick, which Riquelme converted with a right-footed shot into the middle of the net.         
	After Agueros first goal, striker Rafael Sobis almost equalised with a powerful low shot that struck the post in the 60th.         
	Ronaldinho also hit the post on a free kick in the 65th. Substitute forward Alexandre Pato scored after the free kick, but the goal was disallowed for offside.         
	Brazil midfielder Lucas was sent off in the 81st after a foul from behind on Liverpool teammate Javier Mascherano. Substitute midfielder Thiago Neves was red-carded just three minutes later after another hard foul on Mascherano.

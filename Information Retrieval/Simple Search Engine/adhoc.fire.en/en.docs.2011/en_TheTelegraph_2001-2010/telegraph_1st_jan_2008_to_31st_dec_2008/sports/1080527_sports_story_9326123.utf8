The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lawson in trouble
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Lawson in trouble
                      
	Karachi: Chief selector Salahuddin Ahmed has made a written complaint to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) against coach Geoff Lawson after their relations deteriorated during the home series against Bangladesh in April.         
	Sources in the PCB confirmed that shortly after the Bangladesh series, Ahmed complained to the board over the attitude and behaviour of Lawson who took over the job in last August.         
	Salahuddin complained to the board that Lawson had twice used unparliamentary language with him during meetings to pick players for the Bangladesh series and even questioned his credentials to be the chief selector, one source said.         
	At one point, Lawson told Salahuddin how many Tests had he played and what did he know about selection issues, the source added.         
	He said the differences between the two erupted over the selection of batsmen Bazid Khan and Nomanullah who the selectors insisted on playing because of their impressive domestic performances while Lawson felt they had no future in the national team.         
	Meanwhile, as the PCB ponders over holding its own version of the Indian Premier League (IPL), former Pakistan skipper Javed Miandad denounced the idea saying such a move would destroy the game in the country. Miandad said the IPL is nothing but entertainment and lacks quality.         
	The involvement of too much money will destroy the game of cricket. IPL lacks quality and a cricketer can never get the confidence he needs as a player. Even the greatest of bowlers cannot do anything about conceding sixes and fours, Miandad told a daily.         
	The former Pakistan coach insisted that five-day cricket and not Twenty20 was the real test of a players capability as the latter does not require players to showcase their technique.

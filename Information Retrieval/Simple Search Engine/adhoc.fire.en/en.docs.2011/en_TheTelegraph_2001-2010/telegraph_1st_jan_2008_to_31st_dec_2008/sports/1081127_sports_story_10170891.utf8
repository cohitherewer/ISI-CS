The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Columnist now commentator too
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Columnist now commentator too
                  Sourav Ganguly                     
	Columnist Sourav Ganguly is turning commentator too. A fortnight ago, the former India captain made his debut as a print media expert in the ongoing India versus England series. Next week, hell be starting his innings behind the TV microphone.         
	In a coup of sorts, Sourav (who retired from international cricket as recently as November 10) has been taken on board by ESPN STAR Sports, the global commercial rights partner for the Champions League Twenty20.         
	Souravs columns have been well received  he has been making his point firmly, without ruffling feathers  and theres no reason why he cant be a big hit as a commentator.         
	Being critical, but in a positive manner, has been Souravs approach as a columnist.         
	That formula is unlikely to change in his new role.         
	The December 3-10 event featuring eight teams, including IPL winners Rajasthan Royals and runners-up Chennai Super Kings, will be held in three cities  Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai.         
	Two matches have been scheduled for the opening day and Souravs debut will be in Bangalore, which is hosting match No.2, between the Rajasthan Royals and Dolphins (South Africa).         
	Its just going to be a start... Right now, however, I dont intend doing commentary full-time, Sourav told The Telegraph on Wednesday, in the lead-up to a formal announcement by the ESPN STAR Sports brass.         
	One can expect Sourav, who may actually be commanding a higher fee than respected veterans Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri, to pick and choose. Hes unlikely, for example, to miss the second edition of the ICC World Twenty20 (September 2009, in England).         
	The Champions League matches will be telecast on STAR Cricket and Souravs presence in the commentators box should guarantee high ratings in the region, even though the Kolkata Knight Riders arent in the competition.         
	Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja and controversial South African Herschelle Gibbs will, among others, also be doing commentary.           LPS

	Berlin: Werder Bremen clinched second place and Nuremberg were relegated on the final day of the season on Saturday, while champions Bayern Munich gave Oliver Kahn an almost perfect send-off by beating Hertha Berlin 4-1.         
	Bayern had already wrapped up their 21st German league title, making the final day all about giving a fitting send-off to goalkeeper Kahn, who is retiring at the age of 38, and departing coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. Fittingly, they did it thanks to a hattrick from Luca Toni and one goal from Franck Ribery, their two outstanding players this season.         
	Werder finished second after winning 1-0 away to Bayer Leverkusen. Schalke, who confirmed Nurembergs relegation by beating them 2-0, had to settle for third and a place in the Champions League final qualifying round.         
	Hamburg SV, 7-0 winners at home to Karlsruhe, and VfL Wolfsburg, who beat Borussia Dortmund 4-2, qualify for the Uefa Cup after finishing fourth and fifth.         
	For league champion Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahns last game before retiring, and he leaves with the club setting a record for the fewest goals allowed in a season.         
	Bayern conceded just 21 goals over 34 rounds  two less than the mark set by Werder Bremen in 1988.         
	Oliver Kahn left the field with six minutes to play to a standing ovation from the 70,000 at Munichs Allianz Arena. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who is also leaving the club, broke into tears after he got the same reception after the final whistle.         
	Kahn holds a number of Bundesliga records, including the most games played with 577. Hitzfeld will coach Switzerland after winning a record 16 titles in Germany.         
	Nuremberg was relegated for a record seventh time after losing 2-0 to Schalke. The club joined MSV Duisburg and Hansa Rostock in the second division next season.         
	Luca Toni scored three goals for Bayern to clinch the Bundesliga scoring title with 24. (Agencies)

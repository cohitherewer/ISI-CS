            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has nothing to do with Mahesh Bhupathis choice of not playing with Leander Paes in Beijing and on Wednesday, the association dismissed any change in the squad under any circumstances (reported in Wednesdays Late City edition).         
	We are very clear We have nothing to do with Maheshs choice since we have already selected our team We will stick to that, AITA secretary Anil Khanna told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Our position is extremely transparent We have decided on the combination way back in February 28 And that will stay, Khanna stated.         
	According to him, both players should realise the importance of teaming up for the country. Look the Olympic Games is the mother of all tournaments And only the best players should represent his/her country there.

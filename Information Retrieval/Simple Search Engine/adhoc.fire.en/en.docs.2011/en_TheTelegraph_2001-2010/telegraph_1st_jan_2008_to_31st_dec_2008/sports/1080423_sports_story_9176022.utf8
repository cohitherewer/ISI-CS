	BCCI aid for Games preparation   
	Mumbai: The Indian cricket board will help sportspersons in five disciplines to prepare themselves for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and a corpus of Rs 50 crore has been set aside for this venture with the Union government.   
	We will have a meeting with the government at the end of this month or first week of May to set up a committee to oversee this. The disciplines that would benefit are swimming, archery, judo, wrestling and shooting, BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.         
	We will not be dealing with the respective federations but with the government, he added.         
	Shetty said the BCCI has also come forward to finance the training and participation of tennis player Karan Rastogi, squash player Aditya Jagtap and shuttler Anand Pawar as part of its policy to help talented sportspersons in other disciplines.         
	We are giving Rastogi Rs 40 lakh, Jagtap 26 lakh and Pawar 14 lakh, he added.               
	Shoaib hearing next week         
	 Karachi: The appellate tribunal constituted to hear pacer Shoaib Akhtars appeal against the five-year ban, imposed on him by the Pakistan Cricket Board, will start its proceedings from April 28.         
	Judge Aftab Farrukh, who heads the tribunal, said the start of the proceedings had been delayed because of the prior commitments of one of the tribunal members, Hasib Ahsan, a former Test player.         
	We will start formal proceedings from April 28 and hear out the arguments from Shoaib and the board. We will need two to three days to deliberate and reach a final decision once the arguments are over, he said.         
	Shoaib filed a fresh and revised appeal before the tribunal on Monday after his lawyers were provided with the complete documents prepared by the board and its disciplinary committee on the several charges of misconduct.         
	Academy by Ntini

	Speaking after the launch in Johannesburg, Ntini said he wanted to give something back to young boys who were keen on playing cricket for the country.         
	Ntinihopes to receive the support of other national cricketers from his province, such as Mark Boucher.

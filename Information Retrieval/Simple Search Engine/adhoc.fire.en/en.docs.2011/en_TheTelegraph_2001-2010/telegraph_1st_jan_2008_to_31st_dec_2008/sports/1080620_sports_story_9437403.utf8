The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beijing wild card unlikely for Sodhi
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beijing wild card unlikely for Sodhi
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Double trap winner Ranjan Sodhi in Belgrade on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: Indian shooter Ranjan Sodhi, who won a double trap gold medal in the World Cup at Belgrade on Wednesday night, is unlikely to receive a wild card entry for Beijing Olympics, according to National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) sources.         
	The 28-year old Indian shooter upstaged a world class field to win the event with a world record equalling final score of 194 out of 200 set by Italian Daniele Di Spigno during the 1999 world championships.         
	With the time for Olympics qualification already over, nine Indians have booked their berths for Beijing. It includes Athens Olympics silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who is also a double trap shooter.         
	It is unfortunate that Sodhi is unlikely to get a chance to compete at Beijing, said an NRAI official, who didnt want to be named.         
	The International Shooting Federation (ISSF) is supposed to grant 29 wildcards for the Olympics. Last month it has distributed all the wildcards. The ISSF may only consider the case if any of the wildcards withdraw at the last moment.         
	Wild cards are primarily granted to countries, from where no shooter qualifies for the Olympics.         
	 Sodhi had an outside chance to get a wildcard if India did not have a representative in double trap at Beijing. Since Rathore has already qualified for Olympics, Sodhis claim is unlikely to be entertained.         
	Interestingly, Rathore, who also competed at Belgrade, could finish only 24th with 134 points.

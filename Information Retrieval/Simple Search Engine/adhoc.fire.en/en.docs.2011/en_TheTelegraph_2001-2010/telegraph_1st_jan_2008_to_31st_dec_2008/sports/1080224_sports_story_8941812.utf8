            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal off-spinners Sourashish Lahiri and Priyankar Mukherjee may have been reported for suspect action but state coach Bharat Arun hopes they will come out clean.         
	On Lahiri, Arun said: He has played a lot of first-class matches without being reported maybe to the naked eye its not visible. Im sure hell prove himself at the NCA. On Priyankar, he said: Theres no bending in his arm... Only thing that may have given rise to this suspicion is when he bowls the doosra.         
	Im sure the duo will prove themselves at the NCA and will come out clean.

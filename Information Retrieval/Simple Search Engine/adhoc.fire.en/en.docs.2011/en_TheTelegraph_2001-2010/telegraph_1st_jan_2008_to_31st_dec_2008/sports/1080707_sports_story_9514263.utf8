The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good learning curve: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Good learning curve: Dhoni
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene looked a happy man after his teams comprehensive win in the Asia Cup final against India on Sunday.         
	Following are excerpts of what the two captains and the Man-of-the-Match had to say in the post-match presentation ceremony:         
	Mahela Jayawardene: We have played lots of finals. We knew that 300 was not needed in the final and 270 would be a big score, especially with two spinners. We were in trouble when Sehwag went about his way. Mendis came in and bowled brilliantly. Everyone else chipped in. But I think what turned around things today (Sunday) was Jayasuriyas brilliant innings. He did what he does best. We knew that we have to pick up wickets to control this batting line up. To win the Asia Cup away from home is a monkey back of us. We havent had a good 2008, so this victory is good for us. The series against India is going to be tough. We just have to enjoy this moment and re-focus on the home series. All the guys are looking forward to it.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Mendis bowled really well. He maintained a magnificent line and length. We were playing him for the first time, and frankly speaking, none of us picked him. He bowled brilliantly. He was fantastic. It was his day. Its a good learning curve for us as we are playing Sri Lanka next month. We lost early wickets and were never in a position to recover. Its disappointing to lose in the finals but being in the final is better than not reaching it. Hopefully, the tracks will be a bit more helpful for the bowlers in the Champions Trophy. Its going to be a tough series against Sri Lanka. Not only Mendis but also Murali will be there and the pitches will help the spinners even more. Hopefully it will be an exciting series.         
	Ajantha Mendis: It was a great experience; first big tournament and enjoyed it. I didnt think too much about the Indian batting, just wanted to bowl to the field. I just wanted to hit good areas.

	 IPL here to stay: Dravid  
	Bangalore: The Bangalore Royal Challengers may have cut a sorry figure in the inaugural season of cash rich Indian Premier League but captain Rahul Dravid has no doubt that the Twenty20 extravaganza is here to stay.  
	After Dravid-led team completed their campaign with yet another defeat, he looked back at the tourney and said though organisers put up the show in a hurry, the event looked good enough to last.         
	Definitely this IPL tournament is here to stay. It was designed in such a short span of time and hopefully it will come with better colours next year, he said.         
	When asked about his sides performance, Dravid said, it has given all of us lot of learning. We require some special skills to play in Twenty20 games and its for the youngsters to know how important its to hone these skills when they are back in this format next year.         
	He felt that crowds have been fantastic in this event.         
	Though unfortunately we could not play well here, yet the crowds have been fantastic in these matches, Dravid said.         
	Gaekwad backs senior trio         
	 New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly cannot be called a spent force as the senior trio still has 2-3 years of international cricket left in them, says Aunshuman Gaekwad.         
	Tendulkar (Mumbai Indians), Sourav (Kolkata Knight Riders) and Dravid (Bangalore Royal Challangers) are the captains and icon players of their teams.         
	Gaekwad, a former selector and India coach, believes that the future of the trio depends on their fitness. Form follows if players are fit enough. Class is permanent while form is temporary and you cannot question their class. They can play international cricket for next two-three years, said the former captain.         
	South Australia target Younis         
	 Sydney: Pakistan batsman Younis Khan has been offered a contract by South Australia, their coach Mark Sorell said Wednesday. The 30-year-old star was considering the offer, Sorell said. Younis is currently one of the worlds best batsmen. Recruiting him is an important step in our recruiting strategy and an opportunity that presents itself as too good to miss, Sorell said.         
	The news follows reports that Younis, who has played 58 Tests and 167 ODIs for Pakistan, was set to follow in the footsteps of countrymen Majid Khan, Imran Khan and Sadiq Mohammed and play in Australia. Younis is a great player and... We have no objection to him playing for an Australian side when our national team is not playing, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said last week.         
	CSA contracts         
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa CEO Gerald Majola on Wednesday announced that three additional national contracts have been awarded to Neil McKenzie, allrounder Robin Peterson and Albie Morkel, says A Staff Reporter.         
	According to a CSA release, the contracts will take effect on from next month and will run through to April 30, 2009 bringing the number of nationally contracted players to 18.

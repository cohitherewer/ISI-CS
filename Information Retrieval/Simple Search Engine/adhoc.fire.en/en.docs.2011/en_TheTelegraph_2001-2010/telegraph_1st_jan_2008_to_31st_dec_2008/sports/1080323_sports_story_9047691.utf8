	Hair to be monitored for 12 months: Bindra   
	Mohali: Darrell Hair may have been reinstated by the International Cricket Council but the controversial umpires man-management skills would be under the scanner for the next 12 months, said ICC principal adviser designate Inderjit Singh Bindra.  
	Addressing a press conference on Friday, Bindra said: Reinstating of Hair was an unanimous decision. He has been a No. 1 umpire in terms of assessment of various captains, though his man-management skills have been a problem. Hair will be reviewed by the ICC in another 12 months time, he said.                 
	Dhoni, Bhajji fit  
	New Delhi: The BCCI said on Friday that off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had recovered from injuries and would be available for the three-Test series against South Africa starting next week.     
	County ban  
	London: The England and Wales Cricket Board has rejected applications of five players, including Andrew Hall of South Africa, for playing in County cricket next season due to their links with the Indian Cricket League. Wavell Hinds, Johannes Van Der Wath, Hamish Marshall and Justin Kemp are the other four players who would not be able to play in the Counties in 2008.     
	WICB plea  
	Port of Spain: The West Indies Cricket Board has reminded captain Chris Gayle along with Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul of their responsibility to value national commitment ahead of the Indian Premier League, which is coinciding with Australias tour of the Caribbean.  
	The WICB had expressed concern after Gayle, Sarwan and Chanderpaul refused to confirm their availability for the first two Tests against Australia.                 
	Sledging issue  
	New Delhi: President Sharad Pawar said that the Board raised the sledging issue at ICCs executive board meeting in Dubai recently and would pursue the matter further when it meets for the annual general meeting in June.  
	The process is on to get a ban on sledging and it would be discussed again in the June meeting, he said.         
	Making it clear that the Board would do everything to stamp out the menace, Pawar revealed that the Indian players have been asked to mind their on-field behaviour.                 
	Ric not to travel  
	Chennai: The Indian Hockey Federation may have finally roped in Ric Charlesworth as technical adviser but the Australian legend will not travel with the team during its first international tournament after the disastrous Olympic qualification campaign.  
	The Indians, who will train in a camp in Bangalore from March 25 to April 17, are scheduled to leave for Perth on April 18 for a four-nation tournament, also featuring Korea, China and the hosts. The team will not get Charlesworths services during the meet.                 
	Barcelona lose  
	Valencia: Valencia stunned Barcelona 3-2 at the Mestalla to reach the Kings Cup final 4-3 on aggregate on Thursday. Barcelona, who had scrambled an injury-time equaliser to draw 1-1 in the first leg, were hit by a Ruben Baraja piledriver and a breakaway goal from Juan Mata before halftime.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City in fray   to host tie vs Japan 
                                                     City in fray   to host tie vs Japan 
            A STAFF REPORTER            It all depends on Leander Paes                                 
	Calcutta: The city may see Leander Paes amp; Co. in action in April if Indias Asia-Oceania Zone Davis Cup tie versus Japan is awarded to South Club.         
	According to All India Tennis Association (AITA) sources, South Club has offered to host the April 8-10 tie.         
	The position should become clearer within a week or so, depending on what captain Paes decides, sources said. New Delhi is the other city hoping to host the tie.         
	Paes, a seven-time Grand Slam champion and the non-playing captain during Indias 3-2 victory over Uzbekistan in New Delhi last weekend, may just be inclined to favour his hometown. He, however, refused to say anything when contacted over the phone.         
	India have the edge over Japan on grass having won two of the three ties they have played on this surface. Overall, India have won 17 of their 20 meetings.         
	Japan, however, came out 3-2 winners in the last face-off  the Asia-Oceania Group semi-final  in 2004 in Osaka.         
	South Club had made the offer before the tie versus Uzbekistan got underway and if everything falls into place, the AITA will ask the Bengal Tennis Association to organise the event.         
	Fingers crossed on that.

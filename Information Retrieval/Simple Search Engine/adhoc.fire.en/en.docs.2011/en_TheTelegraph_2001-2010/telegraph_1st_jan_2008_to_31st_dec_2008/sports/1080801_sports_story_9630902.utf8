	Cincinnati: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi easily advanced to the quarter finals of the $2,615,000 Cincinnati Masters Tournament along with their respective partners.         
	The sixth-seeded pair of Paes and Lukas Dlouhy of Czech Republic defeated Ivo Karlovic of Croatia and Rogier Wassen of the Netherlands 6-4, 6-2 in the second round while Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles got a walkover from Czech pair Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek.         
	Both Paes-Dlouhy and Karlovic-Wassen pairs had plenty of chances against each other and offered many breakpoints. Both pairs got four breakpoints each in the first set. The Indo-Czech pair converted two and saved three to take the lead. In the second set, Karlovic and Wassen squandered three breakpoints to hand the match to Paes and Dlouhy in just 58 minutes.

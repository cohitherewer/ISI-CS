The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clean sweep by Aussies

	Basseterre (St Kitts): Australia completed a 169-run victory in the fifth and final one-day International against West Indies at Warner Park. Australia won the series 5-0 to become only the third team to sweep an ODI series in the Caribbean on Sunday.         
	Australia won the opening match by 84 runs in St Vincent, the rain-affected second ODI by 63 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method, and the third ODI last Sunday by seven wickets in Grenada, as well as the fourth ODI last Friday by one run at Warner Park.         
	Previously, South Africa and Pakistan were the two sides that achieved ODI series sweeps in the Caribbean. Both accomplished the feat three years ago, when the Proteas won all five of their matches in a bilateral series, and the Pakistanis won all three in theirs.         
	Australias stand-in captain Michael Clarke said: Credit goes to the whole Australian team. Our goal was to come over to the Caribbean and win 5-0 in the one-day series and weve done that. Its great for Australian cricket. We have a lot of depth back at home.         
	Australias batsmen had mauled West Indies bowling to set the home team 342 for victory. Australia, choosing to bat on a hard, easy-paced Warner Park pitch, amassed 341 for eight from their allocation of 50 overs  a record total against West Indies in an ODI  as four of their batsmen passed 50. Andrew Symonds top-scored with 66 from 80 balls, Luke Ronchi made a rapid-fire 64 from 28 balls, David Hussey led a flourish with 52 from 21 balls, and Mike Hussey gathered 51 from 52 balls.         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan took three wickets for 57 runs from nine overs, and Fidel Edwards captured three for 86 from nine overs to be the most successful bowlers for West Indies. The runs Edwards conceded were the most by a West Indies bowler in an ODI, three more than the 83 Corey Collymore gave away from his 10 overs against South Africa four years ago at Johannesburg.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia allrounder Shane Watson was fined 10 per cent of his match fee on Thursday after breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the third Test against India in New Delhi. According to an ICC release, Indian opener Gautam Gambhirs hearing was adjourned till Friday morning for match referee Chris Broad to review the evidence.         
	The incident that led to the charge being laid by on-field umpires Billy Bowden, Aleem Dar and third umpire Suresh Shastri, took place during the 51st over of Indias first innings at the Kotla on Wednesday when there was a coming-together of Watson and Gambhir.         
	At Thursdays hearing Watson pleaded not guilty to a Level 1 charge under clause C1 of the ICC Code of Conduct which states that players shall at all times conduct play within in the spirit of the game as well as within the Laws of Cricket.         
	After considering the evidence, Broad found Watson guilty of verbally engaging with Gambhir in a manner that was not in keeping with the spirit of cricket.         
	Watson was fined 10 per cent of his match fee. As is the case with Level 1 offences Watson has no right to appeal against the decision.         
	Present at the hearing were Watson, the match referee, the on-field umpires and the third and fourth umpires. Australia coach Tim Nielsen and manager Steve Bernard accompanied Watson.         
	Gambhir has pleaded guilty to a C1 Level 2 offence of not playing within the spirit of cricket.         
	The penalty for a Level 2 offence is a fine of between 50 and 100 per cent of the players match fee and/or a maximum ban of one Test match or two ODIs.

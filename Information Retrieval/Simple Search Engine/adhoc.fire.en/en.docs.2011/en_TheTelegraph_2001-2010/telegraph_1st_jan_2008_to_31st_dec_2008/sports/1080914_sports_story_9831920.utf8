                                                                                                                                                                                                     Whatmores money is on India
                      
	New Delhi: India have a bright chance to avenge their 2004 series loss in the four-Test series against Australia beginning next month, feels former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore.         
	Whatmore, now director of operations at the National Cricket Academy, Bangalore, said Anil Kumbles boys should capitalise on the inexperienced Australian bowling to beat the world champions.         
	I think in the series they (India) are fairly fortunate. There is no Warne, no McGrath. That is over a 1000 wickets taken out.         
	India have got the advantage. Generally speaking, you would need everyone firing for Australia to win a Test match, he told a website. (PTI)

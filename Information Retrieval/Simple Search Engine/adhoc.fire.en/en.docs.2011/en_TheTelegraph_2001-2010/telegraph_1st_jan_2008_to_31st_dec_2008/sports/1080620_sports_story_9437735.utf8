            A STAFF REPORTER            Soma Biswas                           
	Calcutta: Bengal heptathlete Soma Biswas alleged that the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has conspired against the Bengal athletes and grouped them together to reduce their chances of getting selected for the Beijing Olympics.         
	Its sheer conspiracy against Bengal athletes. I dont understand in what basis they (the association) have put Sushmita (Singha Roy) and me in the same group This is only meant to reduce our chances to make it to Beijing, Soma told The Telegraph from Chennai.         
	When you are choosing the best athletes for Olympics this should not be the way. There is no reason why we were grouped together It will affect the countrys performance, she added.         
	Bengals hold is not that strong in the federation and thats why we have suffered and are suffering, she said.         
	Two-time Olympian Soma had announced her retirement from professional circuit after a listless show at the recently concluded 48th national inter-state athletics championship at Madurai.         
	Yeah, it was my dream to participate in the Olympics this time too. I should have completed a hattrick. I had prepared the whole year for it Soma said.         
	In the first 100m hurdle where she was grouped with state-mate Sushmita Singha Roy, Soma clocked 14.16s while her personal best is of 13.6 seconds. And in high jump, she managed a distance of 1.59 metres.         
	Yes I am a bit disappointed with my performance But one day I had to retire and I felt this was the right time, the 29-year old girl from Nadia said.

	Dambulla: The Indian batting once again failed as the visitors were thrashed by eight wickets in the first one-day International here on Monday.         
	India were skittled out for 146 in 46 overs as all the batsmen failed to read spinners Ajantha Mendis (3-21) and Muttiah Muralidharan (3-37). Yuvraj Singh was the top-scorer with 23 after Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat.         
	Sri Lanka comfortably chased down the target in 34.5 overs as skipper Mahela Jayawardene (61 not out) hit a breezy half century while Chamara Kapugedera contributed 45 to take the side home.         
	The Indian team, playing without Sachin Tendulkar, who is ruled out of the series owing to his left elbow injury, also missed the services of Sehwag as the opener injured his ankle during practice on Sunday.         
	Indians never looked like settling down as they were tottering at 36 for three after losing both openers  Gautam Gambhir and debutant Virat Kohli  cheaply and slumped further to 75 for five in the 21st over before the last three batsmen contributed 59 runs.         
	Earlier, veteran pacer Chaminda Vaas and young Nuwan Kulasekara kept the Indian batsmen in check with the visitors scoring just 29 runs in the first 10 overs.         
	With this victory, Sri Lanka have taken a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.         
	Gambhir, opening with 19-year-old Kohli, was removed by Vaas off the second ball of the innings. The left-hander played all around the line to a good length delivery from Vaas. The ball slipped between his bat and pad to hit the off stump.         
	Kohli, who replaced Sehwag, began on a shaky note, too, playing and missing away swingers. He contributed only 12 before finally being adjudged lbw to a delivery off Nuwan Kulasekara.         
	Next man in, Suresh Raina, started off emphatically hitting two fours  one to mid-off boundary off Kulasekara and then to mid-wicket fence  but returned to the pavilion, leaving India tottering at 36 for three in the 12th over. Raina tried to drive a Kulasekara delivery only to offer a simple catch to short cover.         
	Yuvraj was lucky to be dropped by Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene at second slip when he played a Kulasekara delivery away from his body.         
	Though Jayawardene got his hands to the ball, it eventually popped out, saving India from further damage. The dropped catch, however, did not help India much as Mendis consumed the dangerous looking left-hander after he swatted the young Lankan for a six.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SGM next Tuesday
                                                     SGM next Tuesday
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: The working committee of the CAB has left it to the special general body to work out an acceptable formula on the distribution of IPL tickets. The SGM will be held on February 26.         
	The proposals, discussed at Mondays emergent working committee meeting, will be placed before the SGM. These include increasing grant to the associations 121 affiliated units. A proposal has been made to distribute 70 per cent of the Rs 10 crore grant from the BCCI among the affiliated units.         
	The BCCI has decided to distribute the profits in a 70-30 ratio among its own affiliated units. The same rule should be applied at the CAB, said a committee member.         
	Another proposal that came up for discussion was distributing the total tickets for the seven matches among the members on a first-come-first serve basis and/or by rotation. This is to ensure that each member (life, annual, associate and honorary) gets to watch at least one of the matches.         
	The working committee was unanimous in stressing that matches should be held at the Eden and members shouldnt be deprived of their rights. Shifting matches out of the city will also mean depriving the players from this region So we will have to sit and find a solution, said CAB president Prasun Mukherjee.         
	He also turned down Sourav Gangulys suggestion that the CAB purchase tickets for its members and the clubs from the BCCI grant.         
	A few members wanted to know the details of the agreement and demanded all documents be placed at the SGM.         
	The legality of Red Chillies Entertainment hosting matches at the Eden also came up for discussion. Since the Eden lease has still not been renewed it was decided that Red Chillies would apply for necessary permission to the defence ministry through the CAB.         
	It is for the officials to ensure that the IPL does not go the way of the Calcutta Book Fair due to legal paraphernalia, said former assistant secretary Biswarup Dey.         
	Will beer be allowed during the matches in keeping with the festive and commercial mood? This hasnt happened before at the Eden. But if the necessary licence can be obtained, well said Mukherjee.

	Hyderabad: Title favourites DPR Korea lived up to expectations as they outplayed Sri Lanka 3-0 in their opening group B match of the AFC Challenge Cup here on Thursday.         
	The North Koreans, who brought a second-string team with their first team preparing for the final qualifying round of the 2010 World Cup in September, toyed with the islanders by pumping in three goals in the first session though they failed to add any more after the breather.         
	In a group B tie, Myanmar pumped in three second half goals to drub Nepal 3-0. Win Thein Waza opened the scoring in the 66th minute before substitutes Min Tun Myon (73rd) and Myat Min Soe (84th) scored in quick succession.

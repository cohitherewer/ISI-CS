	New Delhi: In the last week of this month, when Calcutta will be busy hosting German giants Bayern Munich, some of the top footballers from the city will be away in Goa and Chennai to play exhibition matches for the national team against Chinese Taipei.         
	The All India Football Federation (AIFF), according to sources, has invited the national team of Chinese Taipei to play two matches against the Indian team as a part of its preparations for the SAFF tournament starting next month in the Maldives and Sri Lanka.         
	Chinese Taipei, currently ranked 170 in the Fifa rankings, will play their first match against India on May 24 at the Nehru Stadium in Goa. The next match is likely to be played on May 29 in Chennai, a day before the Indian team leaves for the Maldives.         
	Sources said the matches were arranged after national coach Bob Houghton requested the federation to get an outstation team to play against the national campers in Goa.         
	The AIFF first arranged a match against the Hong Kong national team on May 22, but it fell through after Hong Kong decided to back out.         
	For the Bayern Munich match, Mohun Bagan are unlikely to get back any of their players from the national camp as Houghton doesnt intend to announce his final squad till the matches against Chinese Taipei.         
	At the moment, there are 31 players in the national camp. Houghton is likely to call all of them when the camp restarts on May 11.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rohit powers Red to five-wicket win
    - CHALLENGER TROPHY
  -   Naman Ojhas 96 goes in vain                   Rohit Sharma                           
	Cuttack: Rohit Sharma scored an unbeaten 117 to guide India Red to a five-wicket win against India Green in the Challenger Series for the NKP Salve Trophy here on Friday.         
	Set a victory target of 261, the Reds reached 263/5 with seven balls to spare.         
	Rohits innings came off 120 balls and was studded with 13 boundaries and two sixes.         
	Bengals Manoj Tiwary failed with the bat, scoring only eight. He was out lbw to Suresh Raina.         
	Earlier, Naman Ojha fell four short of a well-deserved hundred as India Green posted a challenging score of 260 for nine against India Red.         
	Naman set the foundation of India Greens innings but the team made a mess of things in the end losing eight wickets in nine overs.         
	Opting to bat under overcast conditions, India Green got off to a blazing start thanks to some splendid batting by Shikhar Dhawan and Naman. Shikhar got a life when Manoj Tiwary dropped him at mid-wicket in the sixth over bowled by Laxmipathy Balaji.         
	The Madhya Pradesh wicketkeeper was more aggressive, racing to his 50 in 55 balls. Just after completing his half-century, the pair helped the team cross the 100-run mark in 19 overs.         
	With the Green openers giving a tough time to Red, Mohnish Parmar got the first breakthrough when the Gujarat off-spinner deceived a well-set Shikhar with a flighted delivery. Shikhar tried a sweep only to get a top-edge. Tiwary, this time, did not make any blunder.         
	The Delhi opener hit eight boundaries in his 56-ball stay.         
	Suresh Raina joined the well-settled Naman in the middle and the duo, unaffected by the fall of the wicket, began to stitch together a partnership. Problems kept mounting for India Red skipper S. Badrinath, and with part-time medium pacer Abhishek Nayar conceding 25 in three overs, Badrinath had to bank on the slower off-breaks of Rohit Sharma.         
	Taking advantage of their frail bowling and sloppy fielding, Naman raced to 96, while Raina was also on the touching distance of a half-century. Having just hit a boundary, Naman again attempted a big one off Chawla, only to find Murali Vijay at deep square leg. Namans innings was studded with 10 hits to the fence and one over the boundary.         
	Sent to accelerate the run rate, Yusuf Pathan came back to the pavilion in no time as the Baroda pinch-hitter got out off the very first ball he faced. A brilliant diving catch by Faiz Fazal at long-on put paid to Yusufs aspirations.         
	Meanwhile, Raina completed his half-century before taking on a hapless Nayar for his second six.         
	Chawla completed his spell taking the prized scalp of Raina (58 from 65 balls), who stepped out to hit over mid-wicket only to find Tiwary in the path.         
	Chawla finished with three wickets, giving away 50 runs.

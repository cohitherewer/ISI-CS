                                                                                                                                                                                                     Rivalry a dogfight: Hayden
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australian opener Mathew Hayden on Thursday described India and Australia as two hungry dogs who are trying to outwit each other on the cricket field.         
	Talking to reporters during the inaugural T20 Champions Awards, Hayden said though the two nations were playing the game in the best of spirits, neither team would lose an opportunity to smash each others teeth.         
	Hayden said: India and Australia are like two hungry dogs, which have played with lot of passion for 13 days so far.         
	It is quite likely that every now and then there will be a chance to smash each others teeth. But then, two great Test nations have so far played with great spirit except in one incident in which the match referee pulled up a bowler.         
	Indias stand-in captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni felt what transpired between the two teams on the field so far was not a matter of concern. The chit chat between the two teams only livens up the proceedings. Dont read much into it.         
	Dhoni emphasised the fact that too much cricket was being played these days. Player knows his body best. A time will soon come when more players would wisely decide to be choosy in order to avoid injuries.

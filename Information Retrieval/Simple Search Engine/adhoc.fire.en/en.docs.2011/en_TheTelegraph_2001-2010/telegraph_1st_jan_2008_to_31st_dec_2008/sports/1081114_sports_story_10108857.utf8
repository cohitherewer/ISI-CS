The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunday to miss tie
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sunday to miss tie

	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will miss Theodore Sunday in their ONGC I-League tie against Vasco at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	It will be a battle for survival between the two bottom rung teams with Shabbir Alis boys looking to exploit the home advantage to the fullest.         
	The MRI report on Sundays injury is awaited but Mohammedan Sporting are unlikely to risk him.         
	They will also be without Anit Ghosh and Mir Farooq Haider because of double bookings. Gautam Thakur or Bimal Pariyar will start upfront.         
	To the home teams relief, Madhab Das will return to bolster the defence after having served a one-match ban.         
	Five defeats and two draws mean the Goan side are on the brink of relegation with two points so far. Mohammedan Sporting have fared a shade better with one win in their kitty, taking their tally to seven points.         
	Mohammedan Sporting lost to United SC in their last match but Shabbir is looking ahead. We had an off day against United SC. Were hoping everything will be okay on Friday. I never complain about the unavailability of players. We will fight with whatever we have, the coach said.         
	Vasco coach Elvis Goes said: We believe we can beat Mohammedan Sporting. We are aiming for full points.

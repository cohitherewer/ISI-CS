	Melbourne: Former Australia batsman Mark Waugh has slammed Indias defensive tactics in the ongoing fourth Test against Ricky Pontings men, describing the host teams approach as ridiculous and boring.         
	Waugh said the Indians made the game too boring to watch with their wide outside off-stump line that yielded just 166 runs on the third day of the match in Nagpur.         
	It was a dreadful session of Test cricket. Ridiculous. Not good enough. Pretty boring to watch, Waugh said.         
	As far as I can see, India arent trying to win this game, Waugh added..           (PTI)

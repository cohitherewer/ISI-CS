                                                    Indians avoid sending the wrong signal

	Sydney: Ricky Ponting is going to be disappointed. Hed been expecting Virender Sehwag to make the Team India XI in the second 3mobile Test, from Wednesday, but the opener has to wait. 
    
	Actually, having accepted all the best of luck wishes with a smile after Team Indias nets at the SCG on Tuesday afternoon, Sehwag must himself be more than just disappointed. 
    
	For his part, hed responded with quiet thank-yous. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the move to play Sehwag and omit Yuvraj Singh got shelved for three reasons: (a) It would hurt Rahul Dravids confidence after hed set aside reservations and agreed to open in the lead-up to the first Test; (b) It wouldnt exactly be fair on Yuvraj; and (c) It would send the wrong signal  that the Indians were in a state of panic. Clearly, in the mind games with Australia, such a signal would be disastrous. 
    
	While status quo will be maintained in the batting line-up (despite the thrashing at the MCG), its more or less certain that spearhead Zaheer Khan is going to miss the Test. 
    
	There has been a recurrence of his left heel problem and an MRI scan was done on Tuesday, apparently after manager Chetan Chauhan insisted only hundred per cent fit players will play. 
    
	The same ailment had kept Zaheer out of last months Bangalore Test against Pakistan. 
    
	Irfan Pathan and Ishant Sharma have been named as cover for Zaheer. If it comes to a vacancy being created, then its likely that Ishant is going to play. 
    
	Former captain Sourav Ganguly felt much better during the day and, so, the think tank didnt have to worry about him. Sachin Tendulkar, though, had a light session as hes recovering from allergy-driven rashes below his eyes. 
    
	Im much better today... You shouldve seen me after the MCG Test... My face was swollen, thanks probably to the detergents left-over in the towel used to cover my face during a session with the masseur, Sachin told this Reporter. 
    
	The senior-most pro, of course, scripted an epic 241 not out the last time we played here. A repeat will, to say the least, do wonders. 
    
	Meanwhile, according to curator Tom Parker, showers are expected on the last two days.

	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders will play a practice match at the Eden on Tuesday evening.         
	This was decided at todays team meeting. The match will test the teams strength and help us to identify the weaknesses and work on them, a team spokesman said.         
	We just want to check on some combinations with the batting. Some players are likely to be brought up the batting order. We still have sometime before Thursdays match and dont want to repeat the same mistakes, he added.         
	Sourav Ganguly along with his teammates had a pool session at the team hotel on Monday which was followed by a team-meeting for an hour.         
	Meanwhile, Murali Kartik, who underwent a MRI on his ankle was advised rest to regain fitness. There is nothing to worry about it. Its only a minor niggle and he needs some rest, the doctor attending on him said.

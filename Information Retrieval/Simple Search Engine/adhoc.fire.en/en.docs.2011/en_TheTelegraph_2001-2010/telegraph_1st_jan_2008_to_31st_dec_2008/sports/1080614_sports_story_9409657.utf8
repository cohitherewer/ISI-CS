The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unheralded Streelman, Hicks in joint lead
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Unheralded Streelman, Hicks in joint lead

	La Jolla: The 108th US Open rolled out the green carpet on Thursday and produced a full-on rock star treatment  the Tiger-Phil-Scott trio  and of course, no one in that group took the first-round lead at Torrey Pines.         
	That distinction belonged to 29-year-old PGA Tour rookie Kevin Streelman, who has missed seven cuts so far, and 33-year-old Justin Hicks, best known for graduating from something called the Montgomery Tour and for not being the other Justin Hicks.         
	The Justin Hicks who isnt tied for the lead of the US Open is a local teaching pro at Stadium Golf Center. The Justin Hicks who shot a three-under-par 68 and is tied for the lead of the US Open looked up during his round and saw his wife walking with the other Justin Hicks.         
	I said Wow, thats kind of weird, said Hicks, who met his namesake earlier in the week.         
	Heres something else that was kind of weird: The Big Three got around the course without being suffocated by galleries that would probably qualify as suburbs.         
	The first round of the US Open was long on star quality, but short on sub-par rounds. That list featured Hicks and Streelman, but included only nine others, with Geoff Ogilvy, Rocco Mediate, Stuart Appleby and Eric Axley only a shot behind the co-leaders after opening at two-under 69.         
	Streelman may not be famous, but he comes from a Wheaton, Illinois, high school with some strong name recognition: Red Grange, John and Jim Belushi and Bob Woodward.         
	Hicks is un-famous enough that his agent caddies for him. He is also unknown enough that hes often mistaken for the teaching pro Hicks, and vice-versa.         
	The Tour got us mixed up, companies got us mixed up, cheques were going to my place, cheques were going to his place, there was all kinds of fun stuff going on there, he said.         
	Its understandable. Even the USGA database isnt sure about which Hicks theyve got  there is no picture of Hicks.         
	And after so much was made of the charisma-oozing Woods-Mickelson-Scott, their day went off without a hitch, despite the size of the gallery. If there were 42,500 tickets sold, probably half the fans holding those tickets followed the premier grouping.         
	Groups of fans were about 12 deep as they lined the fairways and the green most of the way and they saw Mickelson get the jump on his peers with an even par 70. Woods double-bogeyed the first hole, three-putted the 18th and wound up at one-over 72. Scott shot a two-over 73.         
	Woods knocked his drive into the left rough at the first hole, pitched back out to the fairway, sent the ball over the green, chipped on and two-putted for a routine six.         
	It helps when you hit six shots on the first hole to get into the flow, he said. Thats a lot of shots to get into a flow.         
	Actually, it could have flowed a different way for him. Woods had a six-iron into the par-five 13th, a seven-iron into the par-five 18th and didnt birdie either one.         
	But you must consider Woods round in the proper context. It was his first round in competition in 60 days, since the last round of the Masters. Plus, it was the first time he played 18 holes since arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in mid-April.         
	Woods had two double bogeys, three-putted the 18th and birdied only one of the par fives, so his one-over score seems more than reasonable.         
	Woods grimaced after he ripped his drive at the 18th and even though the ball travelled almost 350 yards, he admitted his knee hurt.         
	Didnt feel very good, no, Woods said.           LAT-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

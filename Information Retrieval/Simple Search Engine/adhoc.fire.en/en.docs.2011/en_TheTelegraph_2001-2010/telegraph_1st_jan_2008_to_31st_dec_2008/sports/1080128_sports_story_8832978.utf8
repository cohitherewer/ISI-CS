The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania, Mahesh falter in final 
                                                Sania, Mahesh falter in final 
                      
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi lost the mixed doubles final at the Australian Open on Sunday, done in by poor serving and too many unforced errors.         
	The unseeded Indians squandered numerous chances before going down to fifth seeds Tiantian Sun of China and Serb Nenad Zimonjic 6-7 (4), 4-6 in just under one and half hours.         
	Sania and Bhupathi were a break up at 4-3 in the first set but weak second serves and a couple of double faults allowed Sun and Zimonjic to claw their way back.         
	The Indians did break Sun and Zimonjic once more but failed to hold their own serve, thus forcing the first set into a tie-breaker where the fifth seeds came out trumps.         
	In the second set Sania and Bhupathi committed more double faults and unforced errors. In contrast, Sun and Zimonjic were pumped up and broke the Indians once and held their serve without conceding a single break point.         
	Sania and Bhupathi saved seven break points in the set, three of them match points, but it was too little, too late as Sun and Zimonjic served out the match with ease.         
	Sania, however, has now replaced Chinas Li Na as Asias top-ranked womens singles player at No. 29. Im very happy, I think this is the first time Ive been Asian No. 1, so its an honour, she said.         
	I thought we started really well. I dont think I missed one ball before maybe third or fourth game, which I think helped Tiantian a little bit because it was her first (Grand Slam) final, Zimonjic said.

	Calcutta: Kalighat bundled out Dakshin Kalikata Sansad (DKS) for 18 in a J.C. Mukherjee Trophy quarter final match at the Eden on Tuesday in what is believed to be the lowest total in the states cricketing history.         
	It took Kalighat just 18.7 overs to reduce DKS to 18 for nine with six of their top order batsmen back in the pavilion without scoring. Rajesh Hela, DKSs eleventh man, was absent. Six of the 18 runs came from sundries.         
	Kalighat took only 1.4 overs to reach the target with the match lasting only an hour and 27 minutes.         
	Kalighat, who have already bagged three titles this season, won by nine wickets to set up a semi-final clash with Sporting Union.         
	DKS, who were put into bat, had no answer to the fiery bowling of Avik Chowdhury and Sanjib Sanyal. Chowdhury finished the day with five wickets, including a hattrick. Sanyal bagged four.

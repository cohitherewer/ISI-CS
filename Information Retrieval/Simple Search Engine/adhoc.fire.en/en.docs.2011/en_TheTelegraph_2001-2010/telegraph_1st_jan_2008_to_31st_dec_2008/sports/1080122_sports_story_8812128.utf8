                                                     Morgan uneasy over Sunny comments

   SHARP SINGLES - Down Under
   
	 ICC president-elect David Morgan has sensed a conflict of interest in Sunil Gavaskars attack on Match Referee Mike Procter and expressed concerns at the ICC cricket committee chairmans outspoken comments. Gavaskar lambasted Procter after the Sydney Test for slapping a three-match ban on Harbhajan Singh. Conflicts of interests pervade our sport. In terms of Gavaskar, within the ICC, there is a concern now that hes chairman of the cricket committee and a journalist who has expressed some fairly outspoken comments, Morgan said.
 
	Buchanans theory
 
	 Former Australia coach John Buchanan feels the hosts lost the edge in Perth because of the distractions created by the world record pursuit and fallout from the acrimonious Sydney Test, but he doesnt believe the golden era is over.
 
	It took me back to Calcutta. In that situation sometimes the way forward is not as clear as it should be, Buchanan was quoted as saying in The Age. Having been involved when there are records on, and with all the distractions occurring between the second and third Tests, thats all part of it. It (the record) is what everybody expected. All of those things can play a part in the end.
 
	Clarks lament
 
	Australias pacemen are coming to terms with being both out-bowled and out-witted by their inexperienced Indian rivals. Stuart Clark said Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait had all wanted to bowl downwind. That was probably a mistake on their behalf, they both realised that, Clark was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph. 
 
	White to lead
 
	Cricket Australia Monday announced the Prime Ministers XI to play Sri Lanka in a one-day tour match on January 30 at Manuka Oval in Canberra. The squad includes Victorian allrounder Cameron White who will captain the side for the second consecutive year. 
 
	THE SQUAD
 
	Cameron White (captain), David Hussey (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Callum Ferguson, Ben Hilfenhaus, Philip Hughes, Shaun Marsh, Ashley Noffke, Luke Pomersbach, Luke Ronchi, Luke Swards, Jonathon Dean.
 
	Lillees plot
 
	Ricky Ponting and his men probably have Dennis Lillee to blame for their stunning defeat in Perth. As revealed by Indias bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad, Lillee agreed to provide crucial information about the wind at the Waca. He told me about the winds and how to use them, Prasad was quoted as saying in Herald Sun.
 
	Bucknor move
 
	Unfazed by the happenings after the recent Sydney Test between India and Australia, West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor is ready to extend his contract with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for another year. If I am asked to go on for another year, I would accept, but not beyond, Bucknor said.

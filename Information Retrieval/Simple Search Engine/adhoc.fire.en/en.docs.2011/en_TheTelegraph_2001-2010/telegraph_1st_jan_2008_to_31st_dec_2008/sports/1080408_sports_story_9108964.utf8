The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AFC proposals to AIFF
                                                                                                                                                                                                     AFC proposals to AIFF
                      
	New Delhi: The Asian Football Confederation Monday asked the AIFF to set up a separate legal body for running the I-League and to convert the clubs into profit-making commercial entities if the country wants to take part in the revamped AFC Champions League starting next year.         
	A two-member AFC delegation visited the capital on Monday. India has the capacity to meet the criteria and the AIFF has the commitment to work on it. But there are a couple of issues which India will have to meet. The clubs in India will have to be legal as well as commercial entity, the I-League should be run by separate legal entity and the crowd participation in the I-League will have to be increased substantially, said Tokuaki Suzuki, the vice chairman of AFC Pro League ad-hoc committee formed in 2006.

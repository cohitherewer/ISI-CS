            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Srinagar: A few days back there was panic in the Bengal camp when goalkeeper Abhra Mondal injured himself on the right eye in their match against Goa. The team management was worried that Mondals injury could cost Bengal dearly .         
	Mondals replacement Somnath Khara, though, proved to be a revelation in the next two outings. Against Maharashtra the unknown youngster from Chirag United made some spectacular saves. Surprisingly, there is no one to take note of his deeds.         
	Khara is not the only footballer from outside the elite I-League to shine in the Santosh Trophy here. Players like Kingshuk Debnath (Bengal stopper back), Sochungmi Raleng and Shaji P DSilva (Services strikers), Xavier Vijay Kumar (Karnataka midfielder), Francis Fernandes (Goa central midfielder) and Gurwinder Singh (Punjab defender) have proved they are capable of delivering the goods.         
	Unfortunately, there is no one from the AIFF technical committee here to take note of these youngsters. For strange reasons, the AIFF hasnt appointed any spotter for the Santosh Trophy this time.

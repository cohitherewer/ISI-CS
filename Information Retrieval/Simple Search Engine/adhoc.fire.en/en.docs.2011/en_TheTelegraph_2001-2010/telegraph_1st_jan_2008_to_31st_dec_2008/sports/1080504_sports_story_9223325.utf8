	Togo (Japan): An off-colour Jeev Milkha Singh dropped two crucial bogeys on the back stretch to occupy the tied fourth position at the end of the third and penultimate round of the 120 million Yen Chunichi Crowns.         
	Jeev, who missed quite a few birdie putts, had an even par 70 with three birdies and as many bogeys. At one stage, the former Asian Tour No. 1 was at the sole second spot with birdies on the second, 11th and 13th and a bogey on the third.         
	But the Indian messed up his last five holes, dropping shots on the 14th and 17th and slipped to fourth at five-under 205. He is now three shots behind Japans Ryoken Kawagishi who fired a 68 to grab the pole position.         
	Shingo Katayama (69), Liang Wen-chong (70) and Toru Suzuki (67) are sharing the fourth place with Jeev.         
	Arjun Atwal, meanwhile, brought home a second round card of one-under 71 to make the cut in the $ 625,000 South Georgia Classic Golf Tournament in Valdosta, US. (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Englands no to Bernabeu
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Englands no to Bernabeu
                                  
	Madrid: European champions Spain will meet England at a venue of their choice if the two sides reach agreement on playing a friendly in February next year, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said on Monday. Earlier, the English Football Associations director of communications Adrian Bevington had said the fixture had been requested by England coach Fabio Capello, but that they would refuse to play the game at Real Madrids Bernabeu stadium.         
	The Spanish federation was fined 100,000 Swiss francs after Shaun Wright-Phillips, Ashley Cole, Rio Ferdinand, Jermain Defoe and Jermaine Jenas were racially abused there on Englands last visit in 2004. Nothing has been agreed with the English FA. If we do make a deal it will be played where the Spanish Federation thinks opportune, RFEF spokesman Jorge Carretero was quoted as saying in the Spanish media.         
	The RFEF has received no communication from the English FA (over their refusal to play at the Bernabeu). The fans at the Bernabeu are excellent, just as they are in the whole of Spain.         
	In an interview earlier in the day, Bevington said: As yet, a venue is still to be confirmed and the contract yet to be signed. However, from the outset, the FA, with Fabio, were clear we would not play the fixture in Madrid due to the incidents of racial abuse we faced last time.         
	A Fifa spokeswoman said the choice of a venue was a matter for the two countries football authorities. Its basically up to them where they want to play, she said.         
	Last month, the world governing body fined the Croatia Football Federation 30,000 Swiss francs after supporters taunted England striker Emile Heskey with racial slurs during a World Cup qualifier.

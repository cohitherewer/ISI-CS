The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand to take on Carlsen for title
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand to take on Carlsen for title
                      
	Mainz: World Champion Viswanathan Anand set up a summit clash against Norwegian sensation Magnus Carlsen in the Grenkeleasing World Rapid Chess championship after signing off his preliminary campaign with two wins and four draws here.         
	Aiming for his 11th title, Anand, a winner here in the past seven times, will start favourite against Carlsen who finished second overall in the preliminary stage held between four players on a double round robin basis.         
	The event, part of the Mainz Chess Classics, is being played with 20 minutes for the entire game with a five-second increment after every move is made.         
	Like in the first half, Anand drew yet again with Carlsen and the worlds highest rated woman player, Judit Polgar of Hungary, and defeated Alexander Morozevich of Russia to reach four points out of a possible six which proved enough for him to top the standings.         
	For the records Anand scored two victories against Morozevich and drew the remaining four games to reach four points in all.         
	Carlsen came a close second a half point behind after he drew all his games on the second day of the three-day event while Morozevich had to be content with the third spot on three points and will fight it out in a play-off for the third place against Polgar on Sunday.         
	Anand was business-like coming in to the second day of the event having the joint-lead cushion with him along side Carlsen. (PTI)

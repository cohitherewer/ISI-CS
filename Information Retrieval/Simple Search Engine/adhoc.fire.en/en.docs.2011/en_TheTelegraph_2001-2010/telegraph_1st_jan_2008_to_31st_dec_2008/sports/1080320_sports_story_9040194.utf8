                                                     Lewis still in dreamland 
            EDWARD GORMAN            Lewis Hamilton                           
	Melbourne: After his convincing win in the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday, Lewis Hamilton has spoken of how confident he feels about his prospects this season and how he believes that he is a far stronger competitor this year than last.         
	Talking in Melbourne before flying to Kuala Lumpur, where he will be looking for win No. 2 in the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend, Hamilton said that he could hardly believe he is only just starting his second season in Formula One.         
	It is unreal, he said. I have just been talking to my brother and my mum and weve been saying that it is difficult to believe I have only been racing in Formula One for a year. But I am so much stronger this year. It is all the stuff I learnt last year and, coming into this race [in Melbourne], as you can see, I was so much at home. I felt very comfortable.         
	In recent days Hamilton has been compared by Sir Jackie Stewart, the triple world champion, with sporting icons such as Tiger Woods and even Muhammad Ali in terms of the impact that he has made on people worldwide in his first year in motor sports elite category.         
	Hamilton finds the comparisons far-fetched, saying that he can only aspire to emulate such legendary figures. Bloody hell, he said, laughing. That is a bit unreal. I wouldnt put myself in the league of the likes of Muhammad Ali. If I ever could be as good as him, that would be my aim.         
	The 23-year-old Briton sounded confident about his new McLaren Mercedes car and its pace in comparison with the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen, the world champion, and Felipe Massa, neither of whom completed the race in Australia.         
	I wasnt worried about the car, Hamilton said. I was confident in my car and if the Ferraris were fast, I was confident that I would be able to fight them. I didnt think it was going to be a case of theyre quicker in the race and were much quicker in qualifying. It was slightly different this year. It seems more balanced.         
	Hamilton added that he had more in hand, performance-wise, if he had needed it. I could have produced it, there is more to come, he said. I think, being the opening race, there were a few areas where I took my time. But a lot of people struggled and I am sure not having traction control [electronic driver aids have been banned this year] was behind a lot of the mistakes.

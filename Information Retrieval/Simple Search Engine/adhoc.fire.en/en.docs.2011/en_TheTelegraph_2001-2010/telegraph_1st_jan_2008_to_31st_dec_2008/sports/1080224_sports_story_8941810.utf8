The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand in lead despite draw
                                                   Anand in lead despite draw
                      
	Morelia: World champion Viswanathan Anand maintained his slender half point lead after an eventful draw with former world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the sixth round of the Morelia-Linares Chess tournament.         
	Anand took his tally to four points out of a possible six after the end of the penultimate round and is likely to play the second half in Linares as a leader when it begins on February 29.

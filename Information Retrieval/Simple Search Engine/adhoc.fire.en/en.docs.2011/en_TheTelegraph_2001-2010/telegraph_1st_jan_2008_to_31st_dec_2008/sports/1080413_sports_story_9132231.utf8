	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi put aside their off-court differences to give India an unassailable 3-0 win over Japan in the Asia-Oceania Zone group I Davis Cup tie on Saturday.         
	The former World No.1 pair defeated Japans Takao Suzuki and Satoshi Iwabuchi 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in four hard fought sets that lasted 138 minutes.         
	It was Indias eighth successive win at home against Japan since 1961 and it carried them into Septembers play-offs for the elite 16-nation World Group. India last appeared in the World Group in 1998 and have not taken part in the play-offs since 2005.         
	An uneasy calm prevailed at the DLTA Stadium on Saturday morning when Paes and Bhupathi walked into the Centre Court to play together for the first time since December 13, 2006 when they won the gold for India in the Asian Games in Doha.         
	The sizeable crowd that thronged the stands suddenly went quiet when the famed Indian duo made their appearanceWhile both Paes and Bhupathi later said that they enjoyed playing in each others company, it looked different from the stands. They hardly exchanged a word before warming up. When the umpire called for the start, Paes and Bhupathi were slow in taking their respective positions on the court.         
	Things eased as the match progressed. With the Japanese pair putting up a spirited fight, the Indians realised that it wasnt going to be a stroll in the park. Paes and Bhupathi then started consulting each other more often between the points and even congratulated each other whenever one of them hit a winner.         
	After all that happened in the past few months, this win is very satisfying, said Paes later. It is just a great feeling when you do well for your country. Nothing else matters.         
	But then, it wasnt difficult to gauge the tension between the two. Not for once the duo did the famous hi-five and the chest bumps despite demands from the spectators. Instead, Bhupathi rushed to the sidelines to embrace Prakash Amritraj after his stinging forehand ended the Japanese resistance in the eighth game of the third set.         
	The Indian duo survived some mid-match scares but was able to wriggle out of the situation because of their experience.         
	It wasnt certainly the kind of match that Paes and Bhupathi would like to remember. The duo was not exactly at their best and it took 29 games before they could break their opponents service for the first time in the match.         
	While Paes was mediocre in his returns, Bhupathi had problems with his service. In the fourth game of the second set, Bhupathi committed four double faults that stretched the game to deuce six times. Bhupathi, however, recovered to hold on to his service.         
	Coming back from after an ankle injury, Paes looked rusty though he hit some tricky shots that won huge applause from the partisan crowd. Bhupathi, on the other hand, was immensely successful at the nets and won some crucial points in the final set.         
	The reverse singles on Sunday will be best-of-three-set affair since the tie is already decided.

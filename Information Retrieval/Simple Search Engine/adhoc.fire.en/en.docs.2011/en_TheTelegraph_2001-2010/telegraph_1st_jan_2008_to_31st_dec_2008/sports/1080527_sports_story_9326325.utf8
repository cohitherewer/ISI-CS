	Jaipur: Rajasthan Royals clinched a last ball thriller to beat Mumbai Indians by five wickets in a Indian Premier League (IPL) match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Monday.         
	Thus the Mumbai outfit lead by Sachin Tendulkar lost their third successive IPL tie to leave their semi-final hopes still hanging. With 43 required from three overs, youngsters Niraj Patel and Ravindra Jadeja of the Rajasthan outfit kept their nerves to win it off the final ball.         
	Rajasthans win thus helped Delhi DareDevils become the third team to reach the semi-finals of the ongoing Twenty20 meet and if Chennai Super Kings manage to win their match against Deccan Chargers on Tuesday, Mumbai will be out of contention.         
	Earlier, Sohail Tanvir (4/14) and Sidddharth Trivedi (2/31) led a disciplined Rajasthan Royals bowling attack and shared the spoils to restrict Mumbai Indians to a modest 145 for seven.         
	Trivedi accounted for Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya to put the brakes on Mumbai Indians while Tanvir rocked the visiting middle and lower orders to deny their opponents, who badly need a win to stay afloat, a big total.         
	Electing to field first, the Rajasthan bowlers tied down the Mumbai openers Tendulkar and Jayasuriya on a slow Sawai Mansingh Stadium pitch which was not easy for batsmen to play shots and odd balls keeping low.         
	It was an unusual sight of two of the best contemporary cricketers having against their names more number of balls than runs and failing to impose themselves on the bowlers in the format considered to be batsman-friendly.         
	The duo scored just 28 from the first five overs bowled by Tanvir, Shane Watson and Yusuf Pathan, and 60 at the end of 10th over.         
	However, thanks to wicketkeeper Yogesh Takawale, who came at number eight and scored an unbeaten eight-ball 24 runs, which included four boundaries and a huge six, that the visitors added some more runs to the paltry total.         
	Jayasuriya opened up in the seventh over off Pankaj Singh by taking 13 runs from it which prompted Shane Warne to introduce himself in the 10th over to the eager anticipation of the huge crowd of a spin champion taking on his old nemesis Tendulkar.

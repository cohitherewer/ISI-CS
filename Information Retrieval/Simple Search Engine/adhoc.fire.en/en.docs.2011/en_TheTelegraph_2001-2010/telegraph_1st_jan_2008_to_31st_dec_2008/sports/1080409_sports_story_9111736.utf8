The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona appeal for fan support
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Barcelona appeal for fan support
                                Samuel Eto rsquo;o remains upbeat about   Barcelona rsquo;s chances     
	Madrid: Barcelona are calling for their supporters to rally round the team for their Champions League quarter final decider at home to Schalke 04 on Wednesday following weekend protests at their recent performances.         
	Barcelona won the first leg 1-0 in Germany last week but they have won just one of their last six league games. They were given the white handkerchief treatment at the end of Sundays 0-0 draw at home to Getafe, while several hundred fans staged a demonstration to voice their discontent with the president, players and coach Frank Rijkaard.         
	This team needs support if it is to pick itself up, Rijkaard said after the game. Ive never got carried away when things are going well and I dont like seeing everything as being negative either. The protests are disappointing.         
	The draw against Getafe provided yet another blow to Barcelonas title aspirations in the league and the Catalans remain seven points adrift of leaders Real Madrid with seven games left to play.         
	But striker Samuel Eto remains upbeat about Barcelonas chances of ending the season with some silverware. Weve failed to take a lot of opportunities to close on Real but I still believe we can win the league and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, he said.         
	Argentine centre-back Gabriel Milito is doubtful after experiencing a recurrence of a groin problem during the Getafe match, while midfielder Xavi also ended the match in some pain. Ronaldinho is out for six weeks with a pulled muscle, while Lionel Messi is still out of action.         
	For Schalke, it was an all too familiar story in the first leg, as they battered the Barcelona defence without managing to get the ball in the net. Schalkes problem all season has been scoring goals, with just six to their name in nine games in the Champions League, but the way they put Barcelona under pressure has given the German side hope of causing an upset.         
	We obviously have to play the same game we played in the second half last week, fullback Heiko Westermann said. (Reuters)

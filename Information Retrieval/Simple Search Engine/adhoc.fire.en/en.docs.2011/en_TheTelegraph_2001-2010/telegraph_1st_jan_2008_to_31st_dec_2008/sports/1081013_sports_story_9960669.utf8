	New Delhi: Indias Jwala Gutta clinched the womens doubles and mixed doubles titles at the Bulgarian Grand Prix badminton tournament in Sofia on Sunday.         
	Jwala first combined with V. Diju to win their consecutive Grand Prix title, defeating the fifth-seeded Indonesian pair of Fran Kurniawan and Shendy Puspa Irawati to win the mixed doubles title.         
	The Indian duo overcame initial hiccups and rallied from behind to pip the Indonesian pair 15-21, 21-18, 21-19 in a 45-minute gruelling contest.         
	The pair had won the Bitburger Grand Prix mixed doubles title in Saarbruecken, Germany last week, which catapulted them to World No. 55 in the latest rankings.         
	There was more good news for 25-year-old Jwala as she paired up with her doubles partner Shruti Kurian to thump second-seeded Indonesian duo of Irawati and Meiliana Jauhari in straight-games to bring home her second title of the day.         
	The World No. 26 pair, who also has the distinction of winning the National Badminton Doubles Champions seven times, spanked Irawati-Jauhari 21-11, 21-19 in just 28 minutes.         
	On her twin title wins Jwala said she was very happy and extended her regards to her coach S. M. Arif.         
	I am very excited, very happy and I want to thank my coach S. M. Arif for his constant support, she said.           (PTI)

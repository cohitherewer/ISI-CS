	Melbourne: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has said captaining the national team is no kids play and people should stop bashing Ricky Ponting for the series defeat against India.         
	Until you become captain of the Australian cricket team you dont really understand the demands, Waugh wrote in his column for a newspaper.         
	The former captain didnt gloss over the fact that Ponting erred in Nagpur by focusing more on reviving a sluggish over-rate to escape a possible ban, than going for a series-equalling win.         
	What has shocked many was that we went against our instincts and let the match meander by being concerned about over rates until the chance had vapourised.         
	If Rickys tactics worked he would have been labelled a genius by killing two birds with one stone but in hindsight they probably killed Australias chance to square the series, which would have been a tremendous achievement, Waugh said. He, however, asserted that captains is a complicated job and cited his experience to buttress his point. At various times for me it meant being a psychologist, adviser, mate, mentor, mediator, selector, advocate, mouthpiece and politician.         
	Another former captain Mark Taylor has sought to bail out Ponting from accusations of putting self interest ahead of the team, saying the issue of slow over-rates was a worldwide epidemic not specific to any team or captain.         
	This is nothing new and its been a real issue for years but its got progressively worse to the point where every skipper around the world must make a stand to do something about it, Taylor said.         
	Its Test crickets big problem and its every captains problem, not just Ricky. Its stifling Test cricket and slowing it down and it needs addressing collectively, not just one individual, he was quoted as saying.

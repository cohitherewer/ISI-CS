  -   Sreevatss allround show stumps England         A STAFF REPORTER            The Indians celebrate a fall of an English batsman in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday                                 
	Calcutta: Indias young hopefuls moved one step closer to their dream of winning the ICC Under-19 World Cup on Sunday with an impressive victory over England in the quarter finals at Kinrara Oval, in Kuala Lumpur.         
	According to an ICC press release, it was Englands batting that let them down.         
	Put to bat by India, England batsmen gave in to the fiery bowling of the Indians.         
	Although they did not lose many early wickets, the top order batsmen  Billy Godleman, James Taylor and Alex Wakely  found it difficult to get the tight bowling of Pradeep Sangwan and Ajitesh Argal away.         
	And then came the collapse. England crashed from 73 for one and then 106 for three to 146 all out with only Taylor (41) sticking around long enough to post a significant score.         
	While left-arm bowler Sangwan has been Indias top performer in the tournament so far, the wickets were shared around more evenly on Sunday with Abdullah Iqbal (three for 29) registering the best figures.         
	City boy Sreevats Goswami again proved his mettle behind the stumps with two catches and two stumpings on the day.         
	While chasing, the Indian openers  skipper Virat Kohli and Sreevats (26 off 60 balls) set about the run chase cautiously, not trying to smash the ball around but they picked up their singles with some good running between the wickets.         
	They tackled the English pace attack brilliantly and put on 65 runs in 20 overs. After Sreevatss departure, Tanmay Srivastava (22) combined with Kohli and the runs continued to come at a steady pace.         
	Taruwar Kohli carried his bat through the innings and finished unbeaten on 63 as India coasted home with seven wickets and 10.5 overs to spare.         
	India will now face the winner of Mondays quarter-final between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Wednesdays semi-final.

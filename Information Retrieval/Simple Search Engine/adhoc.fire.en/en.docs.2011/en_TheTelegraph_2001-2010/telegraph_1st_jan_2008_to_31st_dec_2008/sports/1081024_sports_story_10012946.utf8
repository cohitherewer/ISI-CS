	Hoogeveen: World junior champion Abhijeet Gupta was in for a nasty surprise as Brazilian Grandmaster Alexandr Fier outplayed him with black pieces in the sixth round of the Essent International open chess tournament here.         
	It turned out to be a bad day for Abhijeet as he was caught unawares in the opening and the Indian slipped to joint second place on 4.5 points after the debacle while Fier shot into sole lead with 5.5 points.         
	The other Indians in the fray had an average day as Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi also played out a draw with veteran John Van Der Wiel of Holland while Neelotpal Das failed to break the ice against Oleg Romanishin of Ukraine.         
	Prasanna Rao was the other Indian who played out a draw with International Master Andre Diamant of Brazil while Sahaj Grover went down tamely against Ewoud De Groote of Holland.

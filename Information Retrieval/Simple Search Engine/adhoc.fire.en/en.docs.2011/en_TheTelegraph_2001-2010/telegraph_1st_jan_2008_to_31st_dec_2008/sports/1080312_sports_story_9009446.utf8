                                                     Ranty helps Dempo to 3-1 win over Al Ansari

	Margao: Dempo Sports Club exploited the shaky rival defence, scoring a 3-1 win over Lebanons Al Ansar in an opening group match of the AFC Cup at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday.         
	Dempo, who led 2-0 at half time, scored through Nigerians Ranty Martins (20th, 31st) and Edeh Chidi (61st).         
	Al Ansar, who had the major share of exchanges and scoring chances, pulled one back in the 89th minute through Hassan Danach.         
	Playing with five men in the midfield and a lone striker upfront, the visitors played an attacking game. They had two chances to score but Dempo keeper Abhijit Mondal brought off good saves to deny Fadi Ghosson.         
	Dempo concentrated more on defending their citadel and relied on long balls. They took the lead in the 20th minute, taking advantage of the space provided by the rival defence.         
	Roberto Silva, from the right, split the defence with a long pass for Martins who controlled the ball, took a few steps and essayed a stunning shot that found the net.         
	Al Ansar continued to leave gaps in defence and Martins again punished them in the 31st minute. Nicolau Borges, from the left, sent a cross to Martins into the box. The latter chested, beat a defender and seeing keeper Larry Mehanna out of position, sent a gentle shot into the net.         
	Changing over, Dempo increased the tally in the 61st minute. A combined move between Martins and Chidi saw the latter getting the better of the rival defence and sending a rasping drive into the net. The visitors went all out in the last quarter of the match but failed to cash in on a couple of clear chances that came their way.         
	However, Danach pulled one back minutes before the end of the match to score a consolation goal for the visitors. Referee NG Chiu Kok of Hong Kong showed yellow card to Al Ansar captain Malek Hassoun and El Choum Ahmad.         
	Dempo will now travel to Oman to play against Sur Club on March 18. Dempo assistant coach Mauricio Afonso was pleased with his teams performance. Most of the players such as Melvin Rodrigues and Joaquim Abranches, who did not feature in the last few I-League games, played well on Tuesday.         
	The win is a morale booster for the team as we play a tough match against Sur Club in Oman. Hopefully, Mahesh Gawli, Valeriano Rebello and Anthony Pereira, who are nursing injuries, recover in time to play in Oman, Afonso said.         
	Al Ansar coach Jamal Taha said he was disappointed with the loss. (PTI)

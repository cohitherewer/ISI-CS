                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahesh, Mark clinch title
                  Mahesh Bhupathi                     
	Basel: Mahesh Bhupathi and partner Mark Knowles clinched the Swiss Indoors doubles title Sunday beating the German pairing of Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3, 6-3 in straight sets. The contest lasted 61 minutes.         
	It is the Indo-Bahamian pairs first ATP crown since they won back-to-back titles at Memphis and Dubai. They had finished runners up at ATP Masters Series Madrid.         
	A good season on the tour has already seen Bhupathi and Knowles qualify for the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai.         
	Roger Federer won his hometown tournament for the third straight year on Sunday, beating second-seed David Nalbandian of Argentina 6-3, 6-4 in the Swiss Indoors mens singles final.         
	Top-seed Federer hit eight aces and conceded just seven points on his serve in the match.         
	Im very happy, everything worked as planned, Federer said. It was a match played at a high level.         
	The 27-year-old Swiss broke to lead 4-2 in the first set and again in the third game of the second set.         
	The fourth game of the first set epitomised high-quality tennis. Nalbandian saved five breakpoints, twice with aces, and eventually held after six deuces.         
	Federer kept up the pressure on his opponents next service game, creating two breakpoints with a forehand passing shot on the run. Nalbandian then hit a forehand long to drop serve.         
	Federer held to love in the next game, helped by two heavily sliced aces to the Argentines forehand. He clinched the set with an ace and three service winners.         
	In the second set, Federer hit a backhand crosscourt winner to break Nalbandian and lead 2-1.         
	Federer, who only conceded two points in a service game once, closed out the match with a forehand winner behind a big serve.           (AGENCIES)

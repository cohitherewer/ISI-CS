            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton on Saturday released six players from the national camp in Hyderabad but preferred to retain two injured stars  Steven Dias and Mahesh Gawli.         
	The Indian team now have 25 players, but Houghton will have to drop two more as only 23 players can be registered for the AFC Challenge Cup beginning at Hyderabad on July 30.         
	According to sources in the Indian team, the national coach has released goalkeeper Sandeep Nandy, defenders N.S. Manju and Rakesh Masih, midfielders Kuttimani and Denzil Ferrao and striker Manjit Singh. Both Nandy and Manju have not recovered from their injuries.         
	Sources said that while Dias may also find himself out of the squad before the start of the tournament, the team management is confident that Gawli would be fit at the last moment.         
	The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Saturday, once again shifted the venue for the tournament, the second time in the last one week.         
	The Challenge Cup will now be played at the Gachibowli on the outskirts of Hyderabad instead of the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium.

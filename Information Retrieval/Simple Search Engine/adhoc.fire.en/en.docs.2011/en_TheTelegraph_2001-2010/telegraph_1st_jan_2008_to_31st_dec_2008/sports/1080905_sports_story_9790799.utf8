                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nadal enters the last four
  - World No. 1 sets up date with Briton Andy Murray             Rafael Nadal on Wednesday                           
	New York: Rafael Nadal, looking for his first US Open title to underline his new status as world No.1, booked a date with Briton Andy Murray in the mens semi-finals.         
	The Spaniard closed Wednesdays marathon night session with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory over unseeded American Mardy Fish.         
	Delayed by a series of long matches, Nadal clinched his first trip to a US semi-final at 2:10 a.m. with a boisterous throng of fans still on hand in the city that never sleeps.         
	Thanks everyone for being here till 2 clock, Nadal told the crowd in a courtside interview. The night atmosphere here is always amazing. But I prefer to finish a little earlier.         
	After overcoming a first-set hiccup, a merciless Nadal was steaming towards victory when he was suddenly stopped in his tracks.         
	Leading 3-2 in the fourth set, Nadal was distracted by a male fan, who shouted out from the stands while the Spaniard was in full flight of his service motion.         
	The crowd disruption only provided a brief respite for Fish and he bowed out after two hours and 40 minutes combat, thus allowing Nadal to get within touching distance of adding the US Open crown to his French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic triumphs.         
	Britians Andy Murray gave a roar of relief after ending the 23-match winning streak of Argentine teenager Juan Martin Del Potro 7-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-5 to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final.         
	Murray plotted his path to the semi-final through two dominant tiebreakers, winning the first 7-2 and the second 7-1. The Scot overcame shaky moments in an error-filled third set before ending it as Del Potro served to stay alive.         
	In womens action, Serena Williams barely got the better of older sister Venus in a quarter final that was fit for a summit clash, coming back in each set to win 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (9-7) on Wednesday.         
	Played with uncommon ferocity and passion from both combatants, Serena emerged triumphant in the gruelling two hour 25 minute battle to reach the final four at Flushing Meadows for the first time since her 2002 win.         
	 I cant believe I won, Serena said courtside. Wow. I think we played a great match today, Serena said. It just boiled down to one point here and there.         
	 Im a very good closer, Venus said. Ive never had a match like this in my life, so I guess theres always a first.         
	It was the siblings 17th meeting as professionals, and Serena leads 9-8. That includes 11 matches at Grand Slams, where Serena leads 6-5. She also has the edge in major championships, 8-7, and only she can add to that total this weekend. The fourth-seeded Serena will meet No. 6 Dinara Safina in the semi-finals, who overpowered No.16 Flavia Pennetta 6-2, 6-3.         
	 Its great, said Safina, runner-up at the French Open and Beijing Olympics. Im getting closer to reaching the same thing as my brother (Marat Safin, the 2000 champion), so I hope that one day we can have the same titles.         
	The second-seeded Jelena Jankovic will face No. 5 Elena Dementieva in Fridays other semi-final. (Agencies)

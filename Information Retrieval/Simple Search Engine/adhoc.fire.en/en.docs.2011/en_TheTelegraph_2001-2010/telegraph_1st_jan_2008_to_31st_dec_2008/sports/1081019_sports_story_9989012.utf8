The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adjustment more important than perfection, says Sachin
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Adjustment more important than perfection, says Sachin
    - If you respect cricket, the game will take you everywhere             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Chandigarh: Sachin Tendulkar didnt wake up feeling any different, on Saturday, but the country continues to toast Test crickets No. 1 run-getter.         
	Sachin has always been pressed for time and the demands have got more after he eclipsed Brian Laras record. Late on Friday, though, he found some time to speak to The Telegraph at the Taj.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q After such an exhaustive media conference, theres little left to ask... However, is perfection possible?         
	A Look, you can always try and get close to being perfect... But Id say that perfection isnt everything... I know of players who havent been absolutely correct, or perfect, technically, but have still been able to adjust to the demands of big-time cricket... For me, then, adjustment is more important than perfection.         
	What about excellence?         
	It can be achieved, yes... It wont come on a platter, though.         
	After almost 19 years, what are your memories of your Test debut in Karachi?         
	Its all a blur and it has been that way for quite some time and not related to everything that has been happening after this record... About the only thing I remember is that I was so, so excited to play for India... Remember, I was just 16... Those five days went by so fast... (After a pause) What I also recall is that Id been tense and nervous while batting.         
	At the media conference, you spoke of having converted the stones thrown at you into milestones. What exactly did you mean?         
	(Emotionally) Its not only about me... I was also thinking of the other seniors (in the present team) when I made that comment... I think people need to show more respect to the seniors... Weve achieved a certain level because of the sweat and tears weve put in and nobody should run us down... Weve never taken anything for granted... Weve been committed to our job and, to give a personal example, Id be very hurt if somebody said and wrote (negative) things about my heroes... Im so disappointed at whats being written and said about Anil Kumble... Hes been around for over 18 years and his achievements do all the talking. Should he be subjected to what has been going on?         
	If anything, the seniors have always tried to raise the bar...         
	Absolutely... Weve tried to put up a better performance... Getting better, irrespective of the achievements, has been our driving force.         
	So, whats the legacy youll be leaving?         
	Thats not for me to say... If the next generation of cricketers find something thats useful then theyll try and do the same thing... It will be for them to say if they found something in me to motivate them.         
	Your message for young cricketers...         
	Take to cricket wholeheartedly and respect the game... Indeed, if you respect cricket, the game will take you everywhere. I didnt take to cricket so that I could do certain things and go to certain places, but the game has done everything for me... Ive stayed focused and being that would be my advice to others.         
	The final one: Youre seen as a unifier, among the few Indians whose following cuts across regional and religious lines. Does that, in a different way, add to the pressure?         
	I consider myself very fortunate that Im able to bring people together... I stay the way I am 24x7... I dont make an effort to do anything special, dont try and change my behaviour... If I am a role model, its because people have appreciated the things Ive done and, yes, Im grateful to them. I guess Ive been blessed.

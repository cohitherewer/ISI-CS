  -  Former Australia coach on what could be a great series 
              LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            
	Calcutta: The incredibly successful John Buchanan, who was Australias coach during the last two Test series in India (2000-01 and 2004-05), spoke to The Telegraph from Brisbane early on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How do you expect the latest series, potentially a blockbuster, to unfold?         
	A I can understand the huge amount of interest... From Australias perspective, the injury to (leggie) Bryce McGain has definitely affected the teams balance... The most critical element, for me, is how the top order is going to handle the new ball... The game plan will be to get early breakthroughs and the Indians must be believing that the Australians are fragile... The Australian strategy, I reckon, would be to rotate the fast bowlers... That would help maintain an aggressive approach... The spinners (specialist and part-time) will probably do a holding operation.         
	Which team starts as the favourite?         
	It seems an even bet at the moment... One could think the Indians have their nose in front, but the Australians are renowned to be absolutely ready for the big games... Theyve got big-match players... Mohali (second Test) and Nagpur (fourth and last Test) could be interesting venues as theres a bit of bounce and pace at both places... Weve experienced that on earlier tours... Theres a chance that we may witness one of the best series of all time.         
	Do you too agree that the Australians could suffer big because of a lack of experience in key positions  wicketkeeping and spin bowling?         
	Im not too concerned about the wicketkeeping (the big gloves are in Brad Haddins hands)... Haddin is reasonably experienced at the competitive level... You cant, of course, expect him to bat like (Adam) Gilchrist, but he knows his game and gained by being Gilchrists understudy... I accept theres no Shane Warne or Stuart MacGill, though.         
	Clearly, Andrew Symonds will be missed...         
	Absolutely... Not just as a batsman or on the field, but as a very useful bowler... Andrew brings a lot to the table.         
	Just how big an issue is McGains shoulder injury?         
	Its most definitely a blow and I reckon he would have been in the XI... With him not around, the Australians would have redrawn strategy to take 20 wickets in every Test.         
	Your take on Cameron White, McGains replacement?         
	An interesting selection as Beau Casson had played in the West Indies (last season)... Suggests that pace and depth in batting will be key elements in Australias strategy.         
	What is this Australian teams USP?         
	The emphasis has been on this being a new era... The team is in a stage of transition and some players could move out in the next 12 months or so... Theres no point in making comparisons and the current team is trying to set its own benchmarks... This team doesnt have the same aura... Its not invincible, but it does prepare well and carries the old never-say-die attitude... The players are determined to establish and leave their own footprints in history.         
	Smart move to involve Greg Chappell, the former Team India coach...         
	The team has been very happy and I know that (coach) Tim Nielsen respects Chappell enormously... In a general sense, Im sure Chappell is adding great value... However, whether his presence is also a distraction, is something time will tell.         
	Will captain Ricky Ponting be able to overcome the India-blues (average of 12.29 in 14 Test innings on Indian soil)?         
	Im sure hes been trying to address that... Ricky has the methods to rectify his record in India... He did so against (Muttiah) Muralidharan on the 2003-04 tour of Sri Lanka... I remember Ricky used his feet more and came up with other ideas as well.         
	What would be your message to Ponting?         
	(Laughs) Well, the preparation must all have been done and, so, its now a matter of backing ones abilities and the skills of the entire team... Ricky, Im sure, realises that the game will ebb and flow. Thats the way it goes.         
	Essentially, what should India watch out for?         
	Its the same for both teams... Handling the new-ball bowlers will be critical... If the Australians quickly adjust to the conditions on offer, then the batsmen have the capacity to post big totals consistently... Just one session could have a significant bearing on the outcome of that Test... Indeed, the team which falters in that one session could pay a heavy price.         
	Theres been a big debate in some quarters over Indias Fab Five. Your thoughts?         
	Look, your selectors have picked a squad which they believe will deliver... For me, age isnt an issue... I mean theres no guarantee that somebody who is 26 will play better than a 36-year-old only because hes younger... Cricket is about applying skills to get the maximum benefit... With so much attention on the Fab Five, it could allow a Virender Sehwag or a (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni to make a statement without too much pressure.         
	If you had a role, would you have selected the same XV?         
	It wouldnt be fair for me to comment... I dont like sitting in judgement on teams picked by others.         
	Youve said age doesnt really matter...         
	You know, nowadays, players look after themselves better... Thats because of help from the support staff... The notion of somebody being old at 30-32 just doesnt hold any more.         
	Who, to your mind, could make the biggest difference for India?         
	The Sehwag-Gautam Gambhir combination, perhaps... If they can get on top of Brett Lee, (Stuart) Clark and Mitchell Johnson, then the pressure will be off the middle-order and the spinners will have enough runs to attack...         
	What are your expectations from Sourav Ganguly, wholl be retiring after the series?         
	He loves Test cricket and sees that form as the best measure of judging players... I expect him to deliver.         
	Do you agree that the IPL has helped heal the Sydney-wounds, so to say?         
	Yeah... Theres no doubt that the more you get to know people, the more you get to understand them... Its going to be a hard fought series and the Match Referee (Chris Broad) will surely be asking the captains to control their players... The crowds can expect tense moments, which could lead to the fraying of tempers... The players should be presenting their best image on every ball. In the heat of the moment and emotion, though, that may not always be possible.         
	Finally, just how much of the battle will be mental?         
	You need to win the mind games first as that will then allow your skills to do the talking... It will be important for the players not to get distracted by whatever tension there may be.

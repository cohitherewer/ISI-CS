The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India A recover after poor start
                                                                                                                                                                                                     India A recover after poor start
                      
	Chennai: Sourav Ganguly failed to get the match practice that he desperately sought ahead of the opening Test against Australia after being dismissed for just 14 runs but India A recovered from a shaky start to post 162 for three in their first innings on the second day of the four-day cricket match against New Zealand A on Saturday.         
	Unbeaten knocks by opener M. Vijay (76) and Cheteshwar Pujara (49) helped India A after their bowlers fought back well to dismiss New Zealand A, overnight 270/3, for 315 in 30 overs just before lunch.         
	The host teams first innings did not start on a very confident note and they were reeling at 56 for three with opener Sahil Kukreja (0), captain Suresh Raina (11) and Ganguly (14), who was run out, back in the pavilion.         
	Ganguly started off with a boundary to the third man, played cautiously thereafter, picking a few singles with Vijay getting more strike.         
	New Zealand A skipper Peter Fulton introduced spin in the form of Nathan McCullum and runs became scarce. However, an unfazed Ganguly swept him to the fence when he strayed down the leg-side.         
	However the fireworks did not last long and Ganguly got out in the 23rd over. Vijay played the ball in the square leg region and called for a quick single.         
	Ganguly responded a trifle late and a direct throw from James Marshall caught him out of the crease at the strikers end with his bat in the air. He faced 39 balls during his 57 minute stay at the crease.           (PTI)

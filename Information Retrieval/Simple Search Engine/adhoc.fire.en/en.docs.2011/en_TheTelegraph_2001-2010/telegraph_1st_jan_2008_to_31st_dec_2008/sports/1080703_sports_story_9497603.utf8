The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis overpowers India
                                                                                                                                                                                           Younis overpowers India
  - Asia Cup 
  -   Dhoni-Rohit 112-run partnership for fifth wicket fails to save visitors                               
	Karachi: Familiar team India nemesis Younis Khan (123 not out) rose to the occasion with a scintillating century as Pakistan chased down an intimidating target en route to an eight-wicket win against their lacklustre arch-rivals to stay afloat in the Asia Cup here on Wednesday.         
	With captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (76), Rohit Sharma (58) and Virender Sehwag (49) chipping in with the bat, India put 308 for seven on the board. Their listless bowling colleagues, however, could not defend the total and Pakistan cruised to 309 for two wickets in 45.3 overs to make the chase look like a walk in the park.         
	Chasing 309 to stay afloat , Pakistan got off to a rollicking start with Nasir Jamshed (53) and Salman Butt (36) taking the Indian attack by the scruff of its neck.         
	When butt returned, following an almighty mix-up, and Jamshed retired hurt due to dehydration, Younis khan once again emerged as Indias bogeyman, while stand-in skipper Misbah-ul-Haq (70 not out off 62 balls) ensured it remained an all-round memorable outing for him. Younis unbeaten 117-ball knock was studded with 11 fours and a six.         
	A win would have sent India to Sundays summit showdown against Sri Lanka, and Dhonis men will now need to get past the islanders when they return to the National Stadium in less than 24 hours for their last Super Four match.         
	Pakistan meet Bangladesh day after, and going by form, the hosts should not have much of a problem taming the minnows. In such a case, run rate might play a vital role in deciding who play the Lankans on Sunday         
	.Earlier, opting to bat first, India rode on a breezy start and half centuries from Dhoni and Rohit to go past the 300-run mark.         
	Dhoni walked out in the middle with india struggling on 91, having lost three quick wickets in 10 balls, and proceeded to play a sensible and patient knock of 76 before falling in penultimate over.         
	A fifth wicket stand of 112 from 139 balls by Dhoni and Rohit kept India going after they had slumped to 129 for four despite a breezy opening stand of 88 between Gautam Gambhir (35) and Sehwag.         
	In the final overs, Irfan Pathan struck a breezy unbeaten 38 from 25 balls to push the total beyond 300.         
	Both the Indian openers were in terrific form, pouncing on the loose balls on the true National Stadium pitch as Pakistan without their regular captain Shoaib Malik wilted a bit.         
	Gambhir went after hitting four boundaries when he drove hard at a full ball from iftikhar and was caught by shahid afridi in the covers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good chance for fringe players: Amre
                  Dilip Vengsarkar will watch the boys in action                     
	Mumbai: The emerging players tournament, featuring Twenty20 and 50-over games in Australia from July 14, is a great chance for fringe players to capture the national selectors attention, feels India A coach Praveen Amre.         
	The tournament is very important for our emerging players as its a long (international) season ahead (for the India team), Amre said on Friday.         
	Because of its importance, the board (BCCI) is sending Dilip Vengsarkar (chief national selector) to accompany the team and watch the performance of the players, the former India middle-order batsman said.         
	The team would be led by Tamil Nadu batsman Subramaniam Badrinath with Uttar Pradeshs Suresh Raina, who has replaced original captain Parthiv Patel following the latters selection in the Indian Test squad for Sri Lanka, as his deputy.         
	Amre recalled that players who did very well in the previous three editions of the new concept by Cricket Australia, went on to play for their countries.         
	Players who did very well had gone on to the next level. Its a very important tournament for all the players representing Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India, he said.         
	Its a great chance to see which of the players can perform well under pressure. All the teams would be keen to win the tournament, especially Australia, who have not won it in the last three editions, Amre said.         
	Meanwhile, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar is to leave for Australia on July 16 to watch the tournament. This would be Vengsarkars first visit overseas in an official capacity in more than 10 months.         
	THE SQUAD         
	S. Badrinath (captain), Suresh Raina (vice captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Nayar, Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra, Pankaj Singh, Manpreet Gony, Siddharth Trivedi, Dhawal Kulkarni, Iqbal Abdulla, Ravinder Jadeja and Pinal Shah.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jaques out till February
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australian opening batsman Phil Jaques will be out of action till February following a surgery after returning home from India owing to a back injury.         
	While this is incredibly disappointing at the moment, my sole focus is on getting back to playing for Australia as soon as possible, Jaques said in a statement on Friday.         
	I am hoping that with the correct rehabilitation, I can play the last few matches of the interstate season, get some batting under my belt and push for selection on Australias tour to South Africa next year, he said.         
	Jaques had surgery on a bulging disc after specialists decided this was the best course of action for the injury that left him unable to prepare for matches during his visit to India. The specialists advised me this is a very serious back injury and my only option was to get it operated on as soon as possible, Jaques said.

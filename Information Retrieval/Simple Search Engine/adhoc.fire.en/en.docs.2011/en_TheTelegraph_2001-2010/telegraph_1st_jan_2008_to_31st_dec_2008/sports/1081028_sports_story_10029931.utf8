The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kramnik finally shows his class 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Kramnik finally shows his class 
                    GM SPEAK    Pravin Thipsay                      
	World Championship challenger and former world champion Vladimir Kramnik at last showed his true class when he scored a fine victory over defending champion Viswanathan Anand in the 10th game of the World Championship match in Bonn.         
	The challenger began the game with his favourite Queens gambit but this time the champion decided to surprise him on the third move itself by opting for the Nimzo Indian defence. The challenger, however, seemed to be quite prepared for the opening and played the initial moves quite quickly.         
	The players followed the famous KasparovAnand game from the Wiek Aan Zee Tournament in 2000. Anand had lost a pawn in the said game but had displayed skilful and active piece play to force a drawn rook ending after a long battle.         
	On move 18, Kramnik varied from the above game and made a theoretical novelty (a new move, not played in the past) by moving his King rook from an open central file to a totally closed central file.         
	The defending champion was slowly pushed to the wall. Perhaps Anand would have obtained reasonable chances of a draw by a mass exchange on move 22, but he chose to keep the pieces on the board. This proved to be a blunder, since Kramniks pieces invaded Anands camp pretty soon thereafter, creating almost a Zugzwang.         
	On move 27, Anand moved his knight into Kramniks Chakravyooha only to find that it could not be saved there. Kramniks rook infiltrated Anands second rank and finally it was Kramniks 29th powerful Queen move which decided the fate of Anands knight and the game. Faced with inevitable loss of material, Anand resigned on the 29th move.         
	The game clearly reflected several aspects of the players. When Kramnik had repeated the opening unsuitable to his playing style, he had a miserable loss in the fifth game. This had affected him so much that he played probably the worst game of his career the very next day.         
	However, on Monday he went back to the days when he was a pupil of Kasparov. Kasparov had learnt a great deal of chess from his trainer, the legendary Mikhail Botvinnik. Kramniks play on Monday matched that of Botvinniks from the strategic point. It was Botvinnik who showed the world 50 years ago how to win such positions. Perhaps Kramnik will rely upon Kasparov and Botvinnik in his next games as well.         
	I personally believe that after the miserable loss in the sixth game, Kramnik had sought help from his former trainer Garri Kasparov and this had resulted in his shrewd opening choice in the last two games.         
	With regard to Anands play, one can only say that this was his worst game in the last 10 years. He has never been defeated this way in the recent past. I felt that it was basically Anand who defeated Anand, though Kramnik contributed 25 percent, by playing powerful moves.         
	The eleventh game will be played after a rest day.

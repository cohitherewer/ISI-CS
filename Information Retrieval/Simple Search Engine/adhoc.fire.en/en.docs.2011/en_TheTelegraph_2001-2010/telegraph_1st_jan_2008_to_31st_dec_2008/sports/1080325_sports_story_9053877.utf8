                                                     Inzy recipe to bury hatchet
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Inzamam-ul Haq                           
	New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has proposed a match between the winners of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Indian Cricket League (ICL) to bring the two warring groups together.         
	Let there be a best of three finals between the winners of the two leagues, Inzamam said during a function here on Monday. That would improve the relationship between the organisers of the two groups.         
	Inzamam, the Lahore Badshah captain in the ICL, said he was disappointed to see the cricket establishment putting a series of roadblocks on the rebel league.         
	I dont see ICL and IPL as enemies to each other. After all, both are meant to promote cricket, he said.         
	Inzamam said he sincerely wanted a match between the winners of the two leagues. I am sure the crowd response for such a match would be huge. In such a contest, cricket is bound to be exciting.         
	The former Pakistan batsman said that though he has nothing against the IPL, he is not too comfortable with the idea of players auction.         
	I am very happy that players are getting good money from the IPL, but cricketers shouldnt be treated like commodities, so that they could be auctioned or sold, he said.

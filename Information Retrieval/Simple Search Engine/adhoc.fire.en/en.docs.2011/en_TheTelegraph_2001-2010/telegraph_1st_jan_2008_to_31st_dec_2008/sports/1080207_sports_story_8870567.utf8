The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karachi among venues for Australias tour of Pak
                                                Karachi among venues for Australias tour of Pak
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has finalised the venues for the March-April home series against Australia, which also include the troubled port city of Karachi.         
	Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad are the other venues for the much-anticipated tour of the world champions.         
	The PCB has told Cricket Australia (CA) that the three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 International in the series would be held in these four venues.         
	The PCB has also reaffirmed that under no circumstances would Pakistan shift the series to any other venue.         
	Chairman Nasim Ashraf told his Australian counterpart Creagh Connor that Pakistan were ready to scrap the tour altogether rather than shift it to some other country.         
	Our stance is very clear. We want the Australians to come and play in Pakistan as planned. Our people want to see them play as they have not toured Pakistan since 1998, Ashraf said from Dubai where he met Connor.         
	Ashraf said he had a fruitful discussion with Connor and assured him that Pakistan was a safe country to play cricket.         
	I think it was very worthwhile to meet them. I informed him about the proposed tour itinerary and venues where the matches will be held, Ashraf said.         
	I also briefed him about the security arrangements being made for the Australians which are similar to those made for visiting head of states, he added. We thought that should answer any questions in their mind.         
	Ashraf said he had told Connor that terrorism was a worldwide phenomenon and not confined to Pakistan.         
	I told him that sporting authorities cant allow terrorism to stop sporting events as terrorism can happen anywhere. We feel it is everyones responsibility to ensure this.         
	At the same time we are ourselves aware of our responsibilities as a host nation to provide the Australians a safe and secure environment and they need to trust our arrangements, he said.         
	The PCB has got the planned series insured by Lloyds of England for $7.4 million and the insurance covers all eventualities and security risks.         
	Pakistan can also claim a minimum compensation of $2 million if Australia pull out of the tour for security reasons.         
	Ashraf said he has told the Australians to send their security consultants to Pakistan to assess the security situation.           (REUTERS)

	Chennai: The days biggest applause was reserved for the umpires when they decided to call it off once South Africa declared their second innings. For the handsome turnout at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, it was an end to the 298-minute ordeal on the final day.         
	An unbeaten 155 from Neil McKenzie and his 157-run partnership for the second wicket with Hashim Amla helped the Proteas force a draw in the opening match of the three-Test Future Cup. The Indians were left to rue their missed chances, particularly the two catches squandered in the morning session.         
	South Africa have enough reasons to return satisfied from their efforts here. The way they came back on the fourth day after Man of the Match Virender Sehwag had bulldozed them on Day III, and the determination and application of their batsmen on a final day wicket, were laudable. They have already shown that they mean business.         
	This Test was consigned to the record books after the visitors managed to go through the first session on Sunday losing just one more wicket. The slow turn and low bounce made it tough for the spinners. Anil Kumbles unavailability a little after lunch because of a groin strain compounded their problems.         
	The bowlers did the best they could possibly do on this pitch, Team India Test captain summed it up well in the end.         
	Only a sporting declaration from Graeme Smith could have breathed some life into the match. But in these days of professionalism no one was willing to take such a risk. The Sehwag factor must have also loomed large in the South African captains mind after the first innings experience.         
	I thought about it (the declaration) once or twice In the end didnt think it was necessary today, the South African captain said.         
	Its time for the Board mandarins to devote some time to the game and stress on the need to prepare sporting pitches. Such stillborn tracks will only add to the fading interest for Test cricket. An aggregate of 1498 runs were scored on the five days, the highest here, for the loss of only 25 wickets.         
	The visiting batsmen gained some valuable batting practice, not to mention the big scores that is sure to boost their confidence. McKenzie showed no nerves after having fallen for 94 in the first innings. He cut Kumble for two fours to reach his fourth hundred after lunch.         
	McKenzie was in no hurry and used his firm defence to keep the Indians at bay. He found the gaps easily on both sides with effortless sweeps and inside out drives. His 445 minute-stay at the wicket yielded 13 fours and a six.         
	Along with Amla, McKenzie was instrumental in blunting the spin threat. The first innings centurion went on to make 81 but shouldve been dismissed earlier. Harbhajan couldnt hide his frustration after Sreesanth made a hash of a chance at deep fine leg. Amla was on 55 and survived again on 72 when Rudra Pratap Singh dropped a fairly straightforward caught and bowled chance.         
	Amla is the only player in this team who doesnt wear the Castle logo because the alcoholic blend goes against his religious beliefs.         
	Kumble ensured his charmed life didnt get prolonged any further after he had poked outside the off-stump to a leg-break. But theres no doubt that he has answered his critics and the Indians will have to work overtime to restrict his scoring ways.         
	Sehwag and V.V.S. Laxmans part-time off spin was never going to be an ideal foil for Harbhajans probing line and the batsmen made full use of the circumstances. Sachin Tendulkar, too, stayed out with a groin strain.         
	Harbhajan was rewarded for his tenacity and persistence with two wickets after lunch but by then the game had been reduced to one of academic interest.

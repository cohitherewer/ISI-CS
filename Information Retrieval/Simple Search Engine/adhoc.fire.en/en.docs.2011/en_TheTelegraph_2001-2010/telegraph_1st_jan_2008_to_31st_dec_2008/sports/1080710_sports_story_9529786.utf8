	Pinzolo (Italy): David Trezeguet is retiring permanently from Frances national football team due to discrepancies with coach Raymond Domenech.    
	Domenech left Trezeguet off Frances roster for the European Championship last month, where the two-time champions lost in the group stage with no wins and only one goal scored in three matches. The 30-year-old Trezeguet is Frances third leading scorer with 34 goals in 71 appearances.    
	Last season with Juventus, he was the second leading scorer in Serie A with 20 goals.    
	I see football differently from the way they see it in France. The Euros were very negative, but what bothered me most was Domenechs confirmation, Trezeguet said.         
	Gstaad: Unseeded teenager Marin Cilic beat defending champion Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-3, 6-4 on Wednesday in the second round of the Swiss Open.

	Cilic beat 26-year-old Mathieu for the third match in a row, but for the first time on clay, as the players met for the fourth consecutive tournament.    
	The Croat beat Mathieu in the third round at Wimbledon, but then lost to Arnaud Clement of France in the fourth round. In the quarter finals, the 43rd-ranked Cilic will face seventh-seeded Igor Andreev of Russia, who beat Florent Serra of France 7-5, 6-4.

	New Delhi: Indian womens 4x400m relay team has finally been included in the list of Beijing Olympics qualifiers after the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) rectified its mistake, Athletics Federation of India said today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne, too, under fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Warne, too, under fire
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Adam Gilchrist hasnt just stopped at questioning Sachin Tendulkars honesty in his yet to be released autobiography.         
	The former wicketkeeper-batsman says that he was hurt by on-field verbal abuses by Shane Warne. Gilchrist was labelled a*** licker by Warne.         
	According to Daily Telegraph, Gilchrist claimed that the seeds of animosity were sown in a Sheffield Shield match in the late 1990s when Warne sledged the wicketkeeper.         
	Warne, playing for Victoria, was backing his teammate Darren Berry to be Ian Healys successor as Test wicketkeeper, over Gilchrist, who was playing for Western Australia.         
	Warnie and Darren Berry were absolutely giving it to me, verbally, Gilchrist writes.         
	They were saying youve only got where you are because youre an a*** licker. The nature of what they were saying was extremely hurtful.         
	... considering Id played some cricket with Warnie now for Australia, it was below the belt. At the time it almost killed me, he said.         
	Warne and Gilchrist, one of most successful bowler-keeper partnerships in history, never really got along.         
	Their frosty relationship was laid bare sprang when Warne was stripped of the vice-captaincy in 2000 and Gilchrist was given the position. He has really p***ed me off over the years with certain acts, and Ive p***ed him off too.

                                                   Buzz over Greg joining Bangalore
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The buzz is that former Team India coach Greg Chappell is being wooed by Bangalore to handle the city team in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The Bangalore team, incidentally, will be captained by Rahul Dravid, whod struck up a fine relationship with Chappell during the time the Australian was the India coach and he was the captain.         
	Since leaving the India job, Chappell has been with the Rajasthan Cricket Association and has been the head of the Cricket Academy in Jaipur.         
	Incidentally, Shane Warne is both the captain and coach of the Jaipur team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj Singh on selectors radar
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yuvraj Singh on selectors radar
                      
	The national selectors may recall Yuvraj Singh and release Rudra Pratap Singh for Ranji Trophy duty.         
	If that does happen, then there will be that one change in the squad for the last two Tests against Australia, in New Delhi and Nagpur, respectively.         
	Nothing else is being looked at... As Munaf Patel is also in the squad, theres no point having two seamers among the reserves... RP will be better off bowling in domestic cricket, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues  Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  are scheduled to meet in Mohali on Monday evening.         
	Yuvraj, who scored 113 in the second innings of the Board Presidents XI versus Australia match in Hyderabad, this month, has been out of favour from the Test series in Sri Lanka. That was in July-August.         
	Hes the vice-captain in ODIs, though.           LPS

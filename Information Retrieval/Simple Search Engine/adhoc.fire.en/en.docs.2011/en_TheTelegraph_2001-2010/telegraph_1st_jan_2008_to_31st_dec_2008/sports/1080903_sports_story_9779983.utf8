	New Delhi: East Bengals last-ditch effort to get N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias failed when the Mahindra United management refused to release the two footballers.         
	According to Mahindra sources, club president Alan Durante told East Bengal officials that it was not possible to release Pradeep and Dias.         
	The Mahindra president also told the Calcutta team officials that Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira would not leave Pradeep and Dias under any circumstances, sources said.         
	The coach, Durante said, has threatened to resign if the duo were released.         
	Mahindra also cant find a replacement for the players as there was no more transfer window, Durante added.         
	No compensation was offered, though indications are that Mahindra were demanding Rs 70 lakh as the transfer fee for the two players.

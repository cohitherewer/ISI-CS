The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chappell slams BCCI 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chappell slams BCCI 
                  Greg Chappell                     
	Jaipur: Former India coach Greg Chappell on Saturday took potshot at Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials for raising a hue and cry over Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) providing its state-of-the-art facilities to the visiting Australian team, saying the game of cricket is all about sharing.         
	Besides being the assistant coach of the Aussie side, Chappell is also the chief technical advisor at the RCAs Future Cricket Academy. According to him, cricket is all about sharing information and benefiting from the best facilities wherever available in the world.         
	I dont think anyone should think that they solely own the wisdom of the game and try and keep it to themselves. That is very unhealthy for everybody involved and unhealthy for the game.         
	The game of cricket is all about sharing information over the years. Australians are head coaches of four or five countries now. During my young days I learnt a lot from my stint in county cricket.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders at the moment are training at the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane and lot of young Indians have benefited from that academy. We provide all facilities in Australia to anyone including Indians when they tour Australia. We are keen to share ideas and will continue to do that, he said at a news conference.         
	Chappell said he was amused by the talks of he sharing the Team India secrets he gained earlier to help Australia during the Test series.         
	I am amused by some of the discussions going around for the last few days. I am also flattered by the fact that people think that I wield a magic wand and can change things overnight.         
	In Test cricket success is all about doing hard work and doing the basics right. I was just trying to make sure the (Australian) team has these. People are being unduly nervous and concerned about things not important. Australia and India have played a lot against each other in recent times.         
	Chappell also dismissed talks of Indians losing the home advantage after the Australians got the facilities to acclimatise with the conditions by having a camp ahead of the Test series.         
	I dont think just four or five days spending here by the Australians will make Indians lose the home advantage. Cricket is not rocket science, it is pretty basic.         
	The former Australian captain warned the Indians not to think that Ricky Ponting is under pressure to perform in India where he has a poor record of scoring just 172 runs from 14 innings.         
	There is not much wrong in Ponting. He got a great record all around the world. He is conscious of the fact that his record here is not so good as compared to in other countries. He has to trust his methods and I have no doubt he will succeed.         
	On the retirement of the Indian fab four, he said the players themselves should be given the right to decide when to quit the game.         
	From the point of view of retirement each individual player has the right to make his own decision. When you do that, you take the risk of selectors might take a decision before you make your own decision. Thats life and thats the way it should be, he said.

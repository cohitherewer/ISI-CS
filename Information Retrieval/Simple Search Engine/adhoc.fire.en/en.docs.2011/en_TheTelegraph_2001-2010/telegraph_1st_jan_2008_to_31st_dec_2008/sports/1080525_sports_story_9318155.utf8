	Lawson may opt out: Reports  Karachi: Coach Geoff Lawson may not return to Pakistan to resume his coaching assignment with the national cricket team, local media reported on Saturday.  Reports said people in the Pakistan cricket set-up were unhappy with the performance or commitment of Lawson who was appointed coach last August after the tragic death of Bob Woolmer during the 2007 World Cup. Reports said there were rumblings within the cricket circle against Lawson, who is currently on vacation in Australia but there was no immediate confirmation that he would not be returning to Pakistan.  A top PCB official, however, maintained that Lawson was still the coach.    
	 R.P. Singh unhappy   Chandigarh: Deccan Chargers rsquo; pacer R.P. Singh may be the leading wicket-taker in the ongoing IPL, but he is sad that his performance could not help his team reach the semi-finals.  The 22-year-old is currently the leading wicket-taker in the IPL along with Kings XI Punjab rsquo;s Sreesanth. ldquo;I am obviously disappointed as our team couldn rsquo;t achieve desired results. I would have been happier had my performance helped my team get a semis berth, rdquo; he said.     
	 Bob rsquo;s room   Melbourne: Fourteen months after Bob Woolmer rsquo;s death, room no. 374 of the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica, has turned into a hot tourist destination.  During the cricket World Cup in the Caribbean in March last year, the former Pakistan coach had breathed his last in that room in suspicious circumstances.  The hotel authorities may have refurbished the room where Woolmer died, but that has not stopped fans and tourists from inquiring about it.    
	 Ricky rsquo;s way   Melbourne: lsquo;Ponting TV rsquo; mdash; a big screen plasma television that helped captain Ricky Ponting come out of his form slump mdash; is all set to become an essential part of the Australian Cricket (CA) team rsquo;s kit. Ponting, who was going through a rough patch since last summer, did not do well in the IPL.

                                                   Serena wins it for US 

           
	Perth: Serena Williams shrugged off her jet lag to lead the United States to a 3-0 victory over the Czech Republic at the Hopman Cup on Monday. 
    
	Little more than 24 hours after stepping off a marathon flight to Perth, the seventh-ranked Williams opened her season with a three-set win over Lucie Safarova, and said she still had the desire to regain the top world ranking. 
    
	Of course, I want to be number one and I want to win Grand Slams, said Williams, who has already won eight Grand Slam titles. 
    
	I wouldnt be out there if I didnt have those goals. 
    
	Williams thrashed Safarova in the first set 6-0 thanks to her big serves and powerful ground strokes. But she lost her range in the second and the 23rd-ranked Safarova fought back, forcing a deciding third set. 
    
	The 26-year-old Americans experience then came into play, and she showed her trademark grit to secure victory, 6-0, 2-6, 7-5. 
    
	The group B tie was decided when an ailing Tomas Berdych was forced to withdraw from the mixed doubles against Williams and partner Mardy Fish, giving the US an unbeatable 2-0 lead. 
    
	Fish was given a walkover in the mens singles, completing the 3-0 sweep. 
    
	The Americans are now in prime position to reach Fridays final, having beaten India in their opening tie on Saturday when Meghann Shaughnessy filled in for Williams, who delayed her arrival here due to illness.

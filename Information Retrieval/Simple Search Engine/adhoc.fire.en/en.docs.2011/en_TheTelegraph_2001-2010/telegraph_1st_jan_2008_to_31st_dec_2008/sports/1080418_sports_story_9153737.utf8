	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday brushed aside reports of his being doubtful for Mumbai Indianss opening IPL tie against Bangalore Royal Challengers.         
	The former India captain said there were two more days left for him to get into shape and lead his team at the Wankhede Stadium here.         
	I am strictly following the physios fitness regime. There are two more days to go (for our opening match). A decision will only be taken before the 20th, he said.         
	The Team India senior pro has not played any competitive cricket since being ruled out of the last two Tests against South Africa after aggravating an old groin injury. He could not take part in the Olympic torch relay in New Delhi for the same reason.         
	Mumbai Indianss coach Lalchand Rajput said that off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has been appointed vice-captain.         
	Also present at the official launch of the squad was guest of honour Sunil Gavaskar and Nita Ambani, wife of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, the franchise owner of the team.         
	Sachin said surprise was the key element in Twenty20 matches.         
	The key factor in Twenty20 (matches) is the introduction of surprise element and we will have quite a few of those planned, he said.         
	Sachin, who skipped last years ICC World Twenty20 which India won, said he had limited experience of playing the shortest form of the game when representing Mumbai last year in domestic cricket.         
	I have played a few Twenty20 games for Mumbai last year and I enjoyed it. Its a great challenge and I am looking forward to it, he said.         
	Shaun (Pollock) has already started giving tips to our young fast bowlers. I am not sure how the wickets and conditions would be as the matches would start at 8pm.         
	I dont know how much dew will be there. We will have a few practice sessions to see how the conditions are, he added.         
	The 27 players, barring the absentees  Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka and Loots Bosman  and the support staff, were welcomed in traditional fashion during the launch.           (PTI)

                                                   Learn from Sydney and move on: Lee

      SHARP SINGLES / DOWN UNDER
        
	 As the Sydney furore finally settles down, Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee urged the teams to learn from the controversy and move on for the sake of crickets future. I still believe Australian cricket and cricketers are respected and as long as everyone learns from the fall out of Sydney, I think we will be in a better place, Lee said from Adelaide. 
    
	The affable speedster brushed aside suggestions that the episode would have an effect on his equation with the Indians. I enjoy (the company) of Sachin, Laxman and Dravid. They are good blokes... It would be fair to say we enjoy each others company.

In his first official duty as Australias new spin coach, Warne jetted into Brisbane and spent an hour in a private tutorial with emerging Queensland spinners before unveiling his box of spin tricks in the Gabba indoor nets. Warnes search for Australias next spin king has taken on extra urgency, with Brad Hogg being belted by India and with no guarantees the injured Stuart MacGill will return to his best. 
    
	Tait to consult depressed players 
    
	 Shaun Tait will speak to sportspersons who have battled depression to revive his desire to play cricket. The 24-year-old quit international cricket temporarily on Tuesday citing mental and physical exhaustion.

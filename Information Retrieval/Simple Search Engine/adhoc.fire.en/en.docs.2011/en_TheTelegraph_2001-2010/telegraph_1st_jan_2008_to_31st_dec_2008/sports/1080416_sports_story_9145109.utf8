The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Immelman: Not easy to win in Woods era 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Immelman: Not easy to win in Woods era 
                  Immelman                     
	Augusta: First carried by fellow South African Gary Player at the tender age of five, Trevor Immelman fittingly rewarded the support of his boyhood idol by winning his maiden major title at the US Masters.         
	The 28-year-old Immelman achieved a lifelong dream with a gritty display in gruelling, windy conditions at Augusta National, becoming the first South African to clinch the green jacket since Player himself in 1978. Player spurred on the young South African with a timely telephone message on the eve of Sundays final round.         
	Immelman duly delivered, after surviving a white-knuckle day of intense pressure and damage limitation when the swirling winds gusted up to 50kph through the towering pines at Augusta.         
	Ive always dreamed about winning majors and, deep down, I always thought I was good enough, a relieved but joyful Immelman told reporters after signing off with a three-over-par 75 for a three-stroke victory.         
	But at times you obviously doubt yourself because you miss a few cuts and you screw up a few times. Youre just like: Man, maybe Im not as good, or not good enough.         
	Just to be a major champion, a champion here at the Masters, thats what Ive dreamed about since I was a very young man. Im living proof that if you work hard and believe in yourself, it can happen.         
	Immelman paid tribute to the lifelong support he has received from nine-time major winner Player.         
	I first met him when I was five years old at my home club in Somerset West, he said, referring to his birthplace close to Cape Town. I have a great picture. He picked me up and put me on his shoulders. I have no front teeth.         
	That photograph was shown during television coverage of the final round at the Masters, depicting a smiling, gap-toothed Immelman on the shoulders of arguably South Africas best-known sportsman.         
	I think he realised that, even at a young age, I had so much passion for the game, Immelman added. He kept in touch with me, kept writing me notes and kept answering my calls and my letters to him. He was always there for support and advice.         
	Hes been kind of like another type of a father for me. To have somebody with that much experience on your side, giving you advice is just incredible, Im very thankful for that.         
	With world No. 1 Tiger Woods now aged 32, Immelman is delighted to be the only player under 30 to have a major title in his trophy cabinet.         
	I dont think its ever easy to win a major in any era but Im playing in Tiger Woodss era, the 2006 PGA Tour rookie of the year said. The guy boggles my mind. This guy is frightening in what he gets done and how he gets it done and the ease in which he gets it done. To win 13 majors at the age of 32 is just frightening. Its just crazy to think how many hes going to get to.         
	For the moment, though, Immelman will savour the memory of clinching his maiden major title and first green jacket. The Masters is such a big deal down in South Africa, he said. We grow up idolising this event and kids dream about winning it, just as I did.

                                                   Deep to lead Tigers

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta will lead Calcutta Tigers in the Indian Cricket League (ICL)s upcoming domestic competition scheduled to be held in February. Pranab Roy will be the coach for the Calcutta outfit in absence of Daryll Cullinan. 
    
	Deep was Craig McMillans deputy in the side during the ICLs twenty20 tournament. 
    
	Since the domestic players are not getting enough opportunities, we have decided to hold a 50-over tournament exclusively with the Indian players, an ICL official said on Wednesday. 
    
	The 50-0ver meet will be followed by a Twenty20 tournament in March. 
    
	The one-day tournament will take place in two venues  Chennai and Hyderabad. Mumbai Champs are expected to be led by Robin Morris while Dinesh Mongia will captain Chandigarh Lions. Hemang Badani and J.P. Yadav are likely to be the skippers of Chennai Superstars and Delhi Jets, respectively.

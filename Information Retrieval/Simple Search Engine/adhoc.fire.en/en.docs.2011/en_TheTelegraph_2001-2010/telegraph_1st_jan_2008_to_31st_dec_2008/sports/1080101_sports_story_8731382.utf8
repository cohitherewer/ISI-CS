 advice for Paes-Bhupathi 

      OUR CORRESPONDENT
              
	Chennai: Former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj feels Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would do well to pair up for a couple of tournaments ahead of the Beijing Olympics. 
    
	Amritraj, also the chairman of the organising committee for the Chennai Open, which got underway here from Monday, said if both have decided to join hands for a shy at Olympic glory in Beijing, pairing up for a tournament or two may only be beneficial. 
    
	Since both have not played with each other for a number of years, it is possible that there may be a lack of co-ordination. It wont be a bad idea if they try it out before taking the plunge. 
    
	Amritraj, who had reached the quarter finals of the Wimbledon and the US Open twice each, said an Olympic medal isnt a far fetched dream if the trusted duo take up the cudgel. 
    
	We do have a chance with those two playing And not to forget Sania (Mirza). If she is fit and on top of her game, a couple of medals may be coming our way, Amritraj smirked.

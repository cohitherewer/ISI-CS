The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan a safe bet vs Vasco
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bagan a safe bet vs Vasco
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After an exciting opening match against minnows Oil India, Mohun Bagan will be up against Vasco Sports Club, who they beat 2-1 in the I-League recently, in a Group D match of the 30th Federation Cup at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday.         
	While Mohun Bagan were equal to the tough task at hand on Friday, Vasco were listless against Air India and lost 0-1, conceding a goal in the 87th minute. If they perform like they did against Air India, their Federation Cup hopes will be as good as over.         
	In the other match of the day, Air India will take on Oil India.

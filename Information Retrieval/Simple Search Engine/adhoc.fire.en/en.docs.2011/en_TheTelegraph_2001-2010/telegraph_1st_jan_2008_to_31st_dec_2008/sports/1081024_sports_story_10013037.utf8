	 Kolkata Knight Riders have made it clear to the CAB that they wouldnt shell out more than Rs 3.5 crore for hosting the seven Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the Eden. The Knight Riders letter also mentions that out of this amount, Rs 1 crore has already been paid to the police and CMC and will be accordingly deducted. This means that the CAB, who spent Rs 7.26 crore during the tournament, will have to incur a loss of Rs 4.76 crore. The IPL sub-committee of the association will meet on Friday to discuss the issue.

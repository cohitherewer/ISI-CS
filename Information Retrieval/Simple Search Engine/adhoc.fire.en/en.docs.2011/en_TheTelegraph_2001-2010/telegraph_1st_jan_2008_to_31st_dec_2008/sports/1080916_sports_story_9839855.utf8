            A STAFF REPORTER            Stanley Rozario                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal on Monday formally introduced Stanley Rozario to the media and the club supporters as the new coach of their football team at a news conference held at the club premises.         
	Exuding a quiet confidence, the new coach indicated, in so many words, that he would like to restore East Bengals lost glory.         
	I am happy and excited to take up this new assignment. Ill try my level best to bring back the lost glory. I promise results. Im very confident that we will do well in the I- League despite the fact that I have only ten days before we start our campaign.         
	Rozario said that the most important ingredient for success, in so far as football is concerned, is team spirit.         
	This is not a one-man show. We will all have to join hands and bring results. Emphasising the need for a positive mindset and a winning mentality, Rozario added that his primary task would be to instil these qualities in his side. He said that he felt the current side is well-balanced and full of talented players.         
	They (the East Bengal team) believe in themselves and there is a lot of desire among them to do well. All they need is to be mentally strong and play as a unit. We need to work as a team. Team spirit is very important if we are to compete successfully, he said         
	Indications are that we havent heard the last of Salgaocar striker Yusif Yakubu as he was present at East Bengal on Monday.         
	When asked if Yakubu will play for them in the I-League, club secretary Kalyan Majumdar said that nothing is certain yet, although they are very confident of the strikers inclusion in the side. He said that negotiations are on and hopefully they would secure the strikers services very soon.         
	The team go into a week-long camp at SAI which starts Tuesday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The decision to return was unanimous, says Flintoff 
                                                                                                                                                                                             The decision to return was unanimous, says Flintoff 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Flintoff                           
	London/Chennai: Team unity played a big part in Englands decision to resume their tour of India, according to Andrew Flintoff.         
	The England allrounder was one of the players who had reservations about returning to play the two-Test series when the final security briefing began at Englands base in Abu Dhabi on Sunday night.         
	But once the full-strength squad landed in Chennai on Monday, ahead of the first Test which begins on Thursday, they were surrounded by unprecedented levels of security. Each England player stepped off the plane into the embrace of their personally assigned, heavily armed commandos.         
	The team returned in two batches to resume their Indian tour which was interrupted by the Mumbai carnage.         
	The full-strength 16-member team is led by Kevin Pietersen. The first batch reached Chennai from Abu Dhabi followed by another from neighbouring Dubai within 20 minutes of each other. The contingent consists of 28 people, including support staff.         
	Immediately upon arrival, the team was taken out of the airport from a separate gate and driven straight to the hotel where foolproof security cover had been provided.         
	Sean Morris, the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, praised the more experienced players attitude in questioning whether to travel.         
	But Flintoff, 31, said: Its been a difficult last three days. Everyone has voiced their opinion, whether they be junior or senior players. Everyone has decided to go, so to say it was just about the senior players would be wrong. We have decided to go as a team.         
	England have spent three days in a training camp at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium preparing for the Test series.         
	When we have been practising out on the field, batting and bowling, the intensity has been fine, Flintoff said.         
	But when people are on their own, and with time to think, the mood has been different.         
	Personal doubts about the ethics and practicalities of returning to the subcontinent so soon after the Mumbai terror attacks, and reservations over trying to concentrate on cricket while being surrounded by armed guards, will now have to be put aside.         
	There can be no tougher assignment in world cricket at the moment than facing India on their own soil.         
	If you win anything in India I think you are doing well, Flintoff added. Particularly with the way they played in the one-dayers, and the way they played against Australia.         
	We have now got two Test matches to show what we can do.

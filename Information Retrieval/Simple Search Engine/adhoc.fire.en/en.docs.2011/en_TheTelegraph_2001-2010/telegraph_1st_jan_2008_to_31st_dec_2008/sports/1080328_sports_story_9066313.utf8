                                                   Most difficult innings yet: Amla
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Hashim Amlas fourth Test century on Thursday displayed his growing maturity in the South African ranks. He was relaxed at the press conference and said the visitors were hoping to make early dents in the Indian line-up on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If he enjoyed batting on the wicket         
	Yeah, I think the credit must go to the wicket. Its a good wicket to bat on, but probably the hottest conditions I have ever played under The most difficult challenge yet.         
	Relieved to back in the dressing room after 406 minutes in the middle         
	Its a relief but at the same time you kind of enjoy the challenge of playing in the heat and under trying circumstances. That its a Test away from home makes the effort a bit more special.         
	On the run out that resulted in the dismissal         
	(Mark) Boucher said yes and I just responded These things happen and both of us are disappointed. Youve got to take it in your stride.         
	If the wicket is hard on the bowlers         
	Without a doubt... You just see the wicket Day I and II will be good to bat on and then naturally it will start to deteriorate. Obviously we will be hoping that it will start going up and down. That will give us a chance to take wickets.         
	On gains from the innings         
	I take a lot of confidence out of it. For me its the first century away from home and a huge bonus. Something I was always determined to try and achieve and am glad it happened in the first Test.         
	Where he would place this innings with his previous three hundreds         
	Right up there... May be No. 2. Obviously the 176 against New Zealand was better because I was going through a tough time. My career depended on it at that time.         
	On his tackling the spinners         
	I think it comes with a bit of experience and effort as well. South Africans at one stage had the reputation of playing spin well.

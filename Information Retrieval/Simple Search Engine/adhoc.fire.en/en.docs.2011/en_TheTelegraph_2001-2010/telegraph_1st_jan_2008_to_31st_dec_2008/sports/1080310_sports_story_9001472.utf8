	London: Premier League leaders Arsenal suffered a comedown from their midweek Champions League win over AC Milan as they were held to a 0-0 draw at strugglers Wigan Athletic on Sunday.         
	Arsenal found Wigan more resilient than the European aristocrats were at the San Siro and had to settle for a point which put them two clear of second-placed Manchester United, but having played one match more.         
	The Londoners have 66 points from 29 games, United 64 from 28 and Chelsea 58 from 27. Arsenal, drawing for the third successive game in the league, were far from their fluent best and created few clear openings.         
	Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas wasted their best chances while the second-half introduction of Dutchman Robin van Persie after a two-month injury absence failed to spark the Gunners.         
	Andrew Johnsons second-half goal secured Everton a 1-0 win at Sunderland to stay firmly in the hunt for a Champions League place.         
	Victory puts fifth-placed Everton level with city rivals Liverpool on 56 points from 29 games, with Liverpool having a superior goal difference.         
	Johnson bundled in Mikael Artetas cross after 55 minutes to increase the relegation worries for Sunderland who remain in 16th place, two points above the drop zone.         
	Tottenham Hotspur increased the pressure on under-fire West Ham United manager Alan Curbishley after handing the east London side a third successive 4-0 defeat with Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov netting twice at White Hart Lane.         
	Gilberto and Darren Bent were also on target for Spurs. West Ham had Luis Boa Morte sent off just before halftime for a second booking.           (REUTERS)

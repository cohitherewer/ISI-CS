The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohali pitch also under scanner 
                                                                                                                                                                                           Mohali pitch also under scanner 
            LEAGUE SNIPPETS                            Suresh Raina survives a run-out chance during Chennai Super Kings rsquo; match against Kings XI Punjab at the PCA Stadium in Mohali     
	 After the Eden, the PCA Stadium pitch in Mohali is also under the Indian cricket boards scanner for being low on bounce. The BCCI has asked the local authorities to ensure grass cover on the track for the IPL matches there.         
	M.P. Pandove, BCCI joint secretary and co-chairman of the IPL technical committee, said there were complaints about the ball not carrying and the bounce not being consistent. Pandove said the bounce would be even after the grass cover was provided, which would help batsmen play strokes.         
	They have been directed to prepare pitches accordingly as the focus is that the wicket should result in high scoring, he said.         
	The BCCI has recommended a system of grading of the pitches according to certain parameters, including the amount of bounce, the quality of outfield and the amount of greenery.         
	After the conclusion of the IPL, the venues would be graded and awards would be given to the best, Pandove said.         
	PCB confident               
	 The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday said the IPL would not affect the sides planned home series against Australia, to be held in 2009-10.         
	PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi said that Australia would arrive in Pakistan on April 19 to play five ODIs and a Twenty20 match.         
	They will then tour in 2010 for the Tests, Naghmi said.         
	There are fears that the scheduled dates of Australias tour next year would clash with the IPL, which would make it difficult for the players to decide where they want to participate. But Naghmi argued that the IPL schedule for 2009 was still to come out.         
	Collection for Challengers               
	 Louis Philippe, life-style brand from the stable of Madura garments, has unveiled a collection made for Bangalore Royal Challengers in Bangalore.

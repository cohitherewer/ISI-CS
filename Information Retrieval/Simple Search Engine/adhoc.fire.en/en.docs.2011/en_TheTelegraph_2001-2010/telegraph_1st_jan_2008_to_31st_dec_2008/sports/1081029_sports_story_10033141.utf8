The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji in doubt for 3rd Test
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bhajji in doubt for 3rd Test
  - Aussie pride at stake as India look to wrap up series
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: The third Test between India and Australia, beginning at the Kotla on Wednesday, could be a far more intense battle than what one generally gets to see between these two teams.         
	Neither India nor Australia are willing to concede an inch on the field. While Australia, who are down 0-1 in the series, will leave no stone unturned to prove they are still the No. 1 side, India will be out to dent Aussie pride and wrap up the four-Test series.         
	At the Kotla, the hosts have won seven Test matches on the trot, and will strive to better the record.         
	India, however, may have to play without Harbhajan Singh, who is nursing a toe injury. Captain Anil Kumble, who declared himself fit for the match after being forced to sit out in Mohali, said the final decision on the Punjab spinner will only be taken on Wednesday morning.         
	Harbhajan is still not a certainty for the match, the Indian captain said. We just want to wait and see, and depending on his fitness, we will take a final call on Wednesday.         
	In case Harbhajan is declared unfit, in-form Amit Mishra, who played a crucial role in Indias victory in Mohali, would take the off-spinners spot. Harbhajan remained out of action for most part of the practice session on Tuesday and bowled only a few deliveries at nets.         
	Kumble said he was hopeful that Harbhajan would be fit before the start of the match. Its a question of keeping the balance and obviously Harbhajan is a key member of the side and we are hoping he would be fit by Wednesday morning, Kumble said.         
	The Australians, on the other hand, are still looking rattled and will do everything to regain their lost prestige.         
	They took three days off after the Mohali Test and then got down to business with renewed vigour.         
	The Aussies, in the current series, have looked fragile in both batting and bowling. Their bowling has lacked bite and Indias exceptionally gifted batting line-up should present the biggest challenge to Brett Lee amp; Co.         
	India would once again want big scores from openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. That would make the middle orders job easier.         
	The visitors bowling will be strengthened by the return of Stuart Clark in place of Peter Siddle. However, the key lies in batting well.         
	Matthew Hayden has been out of touch, and his return to form could change the course of the series.         
	The Australian batsmen need to click to put pressure on the Indian bowlers, and it is going to be a test of their character.         
	This Test would make it clear if Ricky Ponting and his men have learnt to negotiate the reverse swing of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma.         
	Ponting admitted on Tuesday that his team had been bothered by the reverse swing in the last two Tests.         
	We have spoken a lot about it, he said. Reverse swing played a very big part in the first Two Tests, and more so in the last game, where the Indians certainly out-bowled us with reverse swing. It is now up to our batsmen. They will have to play a lot better than they did last week.

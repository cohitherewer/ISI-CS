The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India A lose by 133 runs
                                                                                                                                                                                             India A lose by 133 runs
    - Sourav scores only 6 in 2nd innings but is strongly backed by Emburey                 Sourav Ganguly                           
	Chennai: Sourav Ganguly failed to get the much-needed batting practice ahead of the Test series against Australia yet again as India A crashed to a humiliating 133-run defeat against New Zealand A in their second and final four-day cricket match here on Monday.         
	The former India captain, who made 14 runs in the first innings, was dismissed for just six in his second essay.         
	New Zealand A captain Peter Fulton made a bold second innings declaration shortly before lunch at 194 for seven, setting India a target of 234 to win from a minimum of 60 overs.         
	Fultons gamble paid off as the hosts were dismissed for 100 in 58.2 overs. The result enabled the visitors to draw the series 1-1 and salvage some pride.         
	India got off to a forgettable start and were reeling at 25 for five in just 14 overs. Barring opener Sahil Kukreja (31), the other batsmen got out cheaply and but for a 22-run last wicket partnership between Pradeep Sangwan (11) and Ashok Dinda (not out 10), the Indian total would not have reached the three figure mark.         
	Earlier, New Zealand, who had taken a first innings lead of 39, declared their second innings after adding 87 runs for the loss of four wickets to their overnight score of 107.         
	Greg Hay (23) and James Marshall (43), two of the key batsmen, were dismissed by Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina respectively within the first 18 overs.         
	B.J. Watling (34 not out) forged ahead but wickets kept on falling at the other end. Leg spinner Amit Mishra continued his good show adding two more wickets to the one taken on Sunday for a match tally of nine wickets.         
	With runs hard to come by on the wicket that kept low, the target was never easy and the New Zealand medium pacers Ian Brien (3/30) and Bradely Scott (2/5) and spinners Nathan McCulluam (2/33) and Aaron Redmond (2/25) did a commendable job with some tight bowling.         
	Ganguly came in at number four with the side struggling at two for one in the third over after first innings stars M. Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara were back in the pavilion without scoring, both falling to Brien in successive overs.         
	Vijay, who missed the century by two runs in the first essay, gave a top edge to Fulton at mid-off trying to pull from outside the off stump and Pujara was caught in the second slip by McCullum while playing a cut.         
	The situation provided Ganguly the right opportunity to get back to competitive cricket and bring out his best. He started off confidently cutting Brien to point boundary in the last over before lunch.         
	Returning after the break, the southpaw, included in the Indian squad for the first two Tests against Australia, played watchfully against the opening bowlers Brien and Trent Boult, who were bang on target.         
	However, Ganguly got out in the ninth over going for his favourite slice shot off the first ball of Scotts first over and was well caught at shoulder height by B.J. Watling at gully.         
	India A captain Suresh Raina, who hit a century in the first match, also departed soon being run out by a direct hit from Marshall from the cover region. Ravindra Jadeja was caught by Reece Young off Scott in 14th over, trying to slash out side the off stump without moving his feet.         
	Kukreja, who was playing with a lot of confidence, led a fight back adding 31 runs for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha off 128 balls before Saha was trapped in front by Brien in the last over before tea. Kukreja too departed, caught by Young off leg spinner Redmond 10 overs later with the team total at 69 for seven, and a defeat appeared inevitable.         
	Mishra and Sangwan offered some resistance. Dinda and Sangwan picked up some valuable runs towards the end but could not bat out the day in the end.         
	India A Coach Dav Whatmore blamed the top order batsmen for the defeat and said: They played too many shots too early. The loss of early wickets put the pressure on the lower order batsmen.         
	A jubilant Fulton admitted he did take a risk in declaring the innings.         
	I knew it was a bit risky. But down 0-1 we had to win to draw the series. Once India lost two wickets at lunch, I new we had a chance. And after the fall of Raina I realised India cannot go for the win, he said.

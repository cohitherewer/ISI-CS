	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly jumped seven places to occupy 17th place in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen after his Man of the Match performance in Kanpur which helped India win the Test by eight wickets and level the series against South Africa 1-1.

	Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag and VVS Laxman are the other India batsmen to appear in the top 20.         
	Having missed the last two Tests because of injury, Sachin dropped one place to 13th. Dravid lies on 14th spot, gaining one spot.         
	Sehwag, who became Indias top ranked player in 12th position after hitting a swashbuckling 319 in Chennai, dropped two places to 15th, while Laxman, who scored 50 in Kanpur, remained on 19th spot.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni climbed four places and is now ranked 39th.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith improved his ranking by two places to lie on 12th spot after knocks of 69 and 35 at the Green Park.         
	However, Jacques Kallis, who surged to the top of batting chart after the series in Pakistan last year in October, continued his slide. Kallis is now fifth placed after dropping three places, while AB de Villiers lost five places to 26th spot.         
	South African pace spearhead Dale Steyn, after the sides defeat in the third and final Test, conceded his top position in the bowling chart to Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla and Neil McKenzie have held steady in 23rd, 28th and 33rd positions, respectively.                     
	India captain Anil Kumble remains Indias highest ranked bowler despite dropping one place to seventh after missing the series decider because of a groin injury.

	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who won the Man of the Series award for his 19 wickets, climbed one place to 19th position in a congested lower half of the top 20. Just 13 rating points separates Harbhajan from 13th-placed Andrew Flintoff of England.         
	Sehwag might have slipped in batting rankings but he climbed eight places in the bowling list to occupy 51st position, two places ahead of Ishant Sharma, who took five wickets in his only appearance in the series in Kanpur.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen plans India tour sans Symonds
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nielsen plans India tour sans Symonds
                  Symonds                     
	Melbourne: Unsure of Andrew Symonds return to the side, Australia coach Tim Nielsen is working on a plan to deal with the feisty allrounders absence in the forthcoming India tour.         
	After Symonds was sent home for missing a compulsory team meeting, preferring a fishing trip instead, Nielsen said he could not assume that the allrounder would be part of the squad in India.         
	I dont think we can at the moment, I dont think we can bank on much at all at the moment, Nielsen was quoted as saying by a news agency here.         
	The only thing we can bank on is providing as much support as we possibly can for him (Symonds) to make the right decision for him and for us, to come back into the group 100 per cent committed, he said adding how long is a piece of string?         
	I dont know if Roy (Symonds) would understand or know how long its going to take. I certainly dont, Nielsen added.         
	Australia will announce their touring squad soon as they play the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India in October and Nielsen said Symonds absence would have ramifications on the teams planning for the four-match series. Oh yeah, weve lost out No. 6 batsman and our allrounder in the Test team for the short-term, so for sure, he said.         
	Cricket Australia, Queensland and Australian cricketers association are planning to provide Symonds with counsellors to help him deal with the demands of being an international star. Nielsen said Symonds was sent home in everyones best interests. But he conceded there could be a long-term risk if Symonds did not return for some time. If he does return.         
	It could have long-term implications. He could decide that he needs a bit more time than we thought, Nielsen said, adding: We just dont know, thats the hard part.         
	The report also claimed that Australia are trying to organise another warm-up match before the first Test, starting on October 9. Nielsen said he wanted the players to reach India well ahead so that they could acclimatise to the conditions.         
	Everyone keeps talking about being ready for that first Test match, but Im really conscious of the fact also that weve got to be going strongly and well by days four and five of the second Test, he said.         
	Australias players have used their stay in Darwin on strength and conditioning work in the heat and humidity to prepare them for India.           (PTI)

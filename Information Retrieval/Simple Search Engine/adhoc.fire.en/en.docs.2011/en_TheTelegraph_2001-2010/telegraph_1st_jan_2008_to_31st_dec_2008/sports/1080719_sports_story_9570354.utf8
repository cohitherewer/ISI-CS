                                                                                                                                                                                                     All credit to boys: Coach
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: S. Malsawmtluanga was a happy man after his hattrick on Friday, but he was not a satisfied man.         
	It was my day. So I could score a hattrick. But theres a long way to go. We want to win the league title, said Man-of-the-Match Malsawmtluanga.         
	His appetite would surely make coach Karim Bencharifa happy. All credit to boys. They have done a lot of hard work. You can see the result, said the Moroccan coach.         
	He heaped praise not only on Malsawmtluanga but on the entire team. Mama definitely played well but he was ably supported by his teammates. Our midfielders supplied a lot of balls. We created a lot of opportunities, the coach said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Task rests with office-bearers 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Task rests with office-bearers 
  - Shortlisting candidates for selection panels       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Theres much interest over who will succeed senior chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar                                 
	Calcutta: For a change, in an election year, the focus isnt so much on the next lot of office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as its on who all will actually become the countrys first set of paid selectors.         
	Thats because theres no suspense over Sharad Pawars successor (it will be his confidant Shashank Manohar) and current treasurer N.Srinivasan is strongly favoured to become the next secretary.         
	Last Saturday, the BCCIs working committee spelt out the criteria for both the senior and junior selection committees, but the way forward in appointing them wasnt put down in black and white.         
	According to outgoing secretary Niranjan Shah (who could succeed Srinivasan as treasurer, unless joint secretary Mohinder Pandove is accommodated in that position), the office-bearers will shortlist names from each of the five zones and place them before the September 27-28 AGM in Mumbai.         
	Traditionally, the president, secretary, joint secretary and treasurer would form the office-bearers club. From last year, after the constitution got amended, the president-elect has been added.         
	The office-bearers should be able to finalise the shortlist by September 20 or so and, then, involve the general body... Well be talking to the affiliates in each zone... Their views will be taken into account, Shah told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Another official pointed out that the BCCIs database had been updated and, so, shortlisting the right people wouldnt be a difficult task.         
	Former cricketers whove played at least 25 first-class matches would be considered in both categories. While a senior committee member should have retired at least 10 years ago, that particular criterion has been halved for the junior committee.         
	Ideally, the senior committee should comprise only former Test cricketers, but there would then be problems in shortlisting enough names from two zones  Central and East.         
	Whats laudable is that the selectors wont be able to also hold positions in either the BCCI or any of its affiliates.         
	Till now, the respective zones would have internal meetings and, then, decide on their nominees for the selection committees. Technically, the selectors would get elected. Now, they will be appointed, initially for two years.         
	The remuneration will, of course, be handsome: Rs 25 lakh (senior committee) and Rs 15 lakh.         
	Incidentally, Pakistan has had paid selectors for well over a year, but that change in policy hasnt brought about a significant change in the on-field performances.

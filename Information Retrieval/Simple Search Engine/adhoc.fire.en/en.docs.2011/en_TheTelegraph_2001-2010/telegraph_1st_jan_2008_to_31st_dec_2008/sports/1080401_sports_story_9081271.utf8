The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Europe is Uniteds to lose 
                                                   Europe is Uniteds to lose 
            MARTIN SAMUEL                                  
	The strangest thing about Manchester Uniteds season is that it could still end in tears. Not for a title gone astray, because there is no way this team can surrender pole position in the Barclays Premier League now. Too strong, too well constructed, in Cristiano Ronaldo too damn brilliant, this campaign will not go much beyond the end of April and United could yet win the closest title race in recent history by ten points.         
	No, it is in Europe where United have it all to lose. For if this most talented United team do not win the Champions League final in the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow, on May 21, they will have underachieved and Sir Alex Ferguson knows it. United are the best in Europe. This is their time, just as it was Barcelonas two years ago, and they must make the most of it, as Frank Rijkaards team did, for who knows what is around the corner?         
	Following on from Uniteds sublime demolition of Aston Villa on Saturday was Barcelonas 2-3 defeat away to Real Betis, as a result of which they surrendered second place in La Liga. It demonstrated how quickly things change. Ronaldinho, once the best player in the world, did not play and even when he does, he appears to have lost his spark; Thierry Henrys first season in Spain has not been a happy one; and Lionel Messi, the Ronaldo of Rijkaards team, is injured.         
	It could happen anywhere, at any time, even at Old Trafford. An injury, a loss of confidence; look at the collapse of Arsenal in the league after the draw away to Birmingham City. Form is fragile. And on the sports field, in particular, genius is fleeting.         
	So United must seize this opportunity, for who knows when it will come again? If Barcelona are the main danger to the prospect of English champions of Europe, it is Uniteds year. They are a different class to Rijkaards team, stronger defensively and sharper in attack. Indeed, it could be argued that Uniteds outlook is even better than it was in 1999, when the last eight included a Bayern Munich team who defeated FC Kaiserslautern, their Bundesliga rivals, 6-0 on aggregate and Real Madrid, the holders (knocked out by Dynamo Kiev). To reach the final, United had to eliminate two Italian teams, Inter Milan and Juventus, which they had not done before.         
	Right now, United have the beating of any team. Their three English rivals have not been able to live with them in domestic competition, while AS Roma have played United four times in the past year, winning once against ten men and going down 1-7 in a spectacular return at Old Trafford. This year, the clubs were paired at the group stage, which United won by five points. There is no reason to doubt Uniteds progress to the last four.         
	Could Liverpool be a danger? Could Chelsea? Could Arsenal? Not on the evidence of this campaign. United were plainly superior to Liverpool at Old Trafford, even before Javier Mascherano was sent off, the same with Chelsea before the sending-off of John Obi Mikel. It took a late goal from William Gallas, the Arsenal captain, to share the points when United went to the Emirates Stadium.         
	And, no, this is not a vintage year in Europe  the league leaders in Spain and Italy are out, the pace-setters in Germany did not qualify  but United are its beacon. This should be their triumph and they must seize the moment, for who knows what the future holds.

                                                    Dilip wants action against Procter

	New Delhi: BCCI president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday described as proper the judgement given by ICC appeals commissioner John Hansen, who decided to drop the racial charges against Harbhajan Singh and three-Test ban on the offie. 
    
	The judge has given a proper judgement. BCCI was consistently taking only one stand that it was practically impossible for us to accept the racist charges against any Indian player. And the honourable judge has accepted BCCIs view Pawar told reporters. 
    
	Pawar praised V.R. Manohar, the BCCI-appointed lawyer for Harbhajan during the hearing. I thank Mr Manohar. He has done well. He did not even charge us any fee and worked on a honorary basis and worked for the players cause, Pawar said. 
    
	Manohar, who took part in the hearing via a tele-conference, said it was proved that Harbhajan did not say anything racial. 
    
	Racial remark is a very big crime. He (Harbhajan) has been acquitted from that and now has been charged for another type of abuse, Manohar said. 
    
	He himself admitted that he abused Symonds but said he did not call Symonds a monkey or a big monkey. The court did not accept (Symonds claim), he added. 
    
	While welcoming the outcome of the hearing, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar demanded action against Match Referee Mike Procter. 
    
	The racist tag has been removed and it is a good thing for us. Full marks to BCCI for standing behind Harbhajan, he told a news channel. 
    
	Procter has not done his duty properly. I would like to know what action is being taken against him, he said. Indians are not the first to sledge their opponents but again we would not take anything lying down. Its very clear in the message, he said.

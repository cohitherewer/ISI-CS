                  Kapil Dev                     
	New Delhi: Former India captain Kapil Dev Friday lambasted the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for neglecting former cricketers and pleaded before the Delhi High Court that the governing body be asked to release pensions to him and other players who joined the rival Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	He made the submission while appearing before the registrar of the Delhi High Court, Pawan Kumar Jain, for cross-examination by the BCCI. The allegations have been levelled by Kapil Dev against the BCCI on the ground that the apex body was taking punitive action against him and his ICL colleagues.         
	The BCCI has blocked pensions to 15 former players including Kapil Dev, Kiran More, Sandeep Patil, Ajit Wadekar and E. Prasanna after they joined the rival ICL.           (PTI)

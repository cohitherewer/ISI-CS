                                                                                                                                                                                                     Bengal players not to tour Queensland
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal players, who are part of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad, will not be released for the forthcoming tour of Queensland as Bengals newly appointed Ranji coach Utpal Chatterjee wants to work with all the players before the start of the season, according to Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) sources.         
	Knight Riders coach John Buchanan, who was in town to complete the final leg of the Knight Riders talent hunt, termed the decision as disappointing.         
	Obviously this is disappointing, but I can understand why the CAB would like all the Bengal players to be in the city, Buchanan told The Telegraph.         
	India A players like Cheteswar Pujara, who are part of the Knight Riders team, also wont go to the tour of Queensland.         
	However, around 16 players will make it to the Queensland trip.         
	Buchanan trooped in to the Eden Gardens on Friday morning to meet the local lads that he had coached in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Buchanan was in town after looking at potential players in Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad.         
	The World Cup-winning coach of Australia had a short session with Knight Riders players like Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ranadeb Bose and others. Also present were senior Bengal players including Manoj Tiwary and Sreevats Goswami. Knight Riders skipper Sourav Ganguly too made an appearance.         
	At a news conference after the talent hunt session, the former Australia coach said that having toured all four cities he will now make a list of the players who will be touring with the Knight Riders when they travel to Queensland on September 21.         
	Buchanan stressed the need for the Kolkata based franchise  owned by Shah Rukh Khan  to develop a pan-Indian presence and following. He was also happy with the progress that some of the players have made since playing the IPL. He said: Its good to seem all of them again for a startWeve seen the progress they have made and well keep a further watch But I am happy, especially for Dinda (who made it to the India A squad).         
	Getting the balance of the Knight Riders team right is imperative for the next IPL, Buchanan quipped.         
	The Aussie coach said that he is a bit better versed with the Twenty20 format this time round and stressed that a team should ideally have a mix of power players and reserve players who can step up and deliver when required. He also stressed the need to find genuine allrounders and spinners  especially a leg spinner.         
	The newly elected CAB administrators also assured Buchanan of their full support and co-operation. Buchanan too hoped that the Eden pitch would be an even one this time round, which would encourage positive cricket. The former Australian coach added: I will be very disappointed if we dont make the semi-finals of the IPL, this time round.

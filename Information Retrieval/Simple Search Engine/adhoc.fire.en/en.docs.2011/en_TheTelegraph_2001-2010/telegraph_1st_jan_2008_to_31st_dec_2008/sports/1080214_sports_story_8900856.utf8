	We are extremely pleased to welcome these players to the ICL family, chairman of the ICL executive board Kapil Dev said. Though there was no official confirmation about spinners Saqlain Mushtaq and Arshad Khan, the PCB sources said the duo have already signed contracts with the ICL.  
	Afridi for Glamorgan

                                                                                                                                                                                                     Milestone beckons Sachin, Kumble eyes series win
                                  Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag in Chennai on Monday		    
	Chennai: Highest Test run scorers glory beckons Sachin Tendulkar in Sri Lanka but Team India Test captain Anil Kumble is not ready to allow it to be a distraction and stressed that a series win would top the teams agenda in the island nation.         
	We always feel proud that one of our teammates is going to cross a landmark. Every time when there is a sense of achievement, its not for the individual only but also for the team, the 37-year Kumble said here on Monday, on the eve of teams departure for Sri Lanka.         
	But, the most important factor is that we go there and ensure a series victory. That will be on top of everybodys mind, he added. I am sure that at some point of time, Sachin will cross the landmark. It will be a huge achievement not just for him but also for Indian cricket. Sachin is confident. He has come back fully fit from groin injury. He is really fresh in mind, Kumble stated. Sachin (11782) will reach Sri Lanka needing another 172 runs to topple Brian Lara (11953).         
	Kumble however, feels that the Test squad has been quite consistent and there will be no impact of Indias loss to Sri Lanka in the final of the recently concluded Asia Cup in Karachi. As a Test team we have really performed well, in that sense, we are pretty confident. In Tests, we have done exceptionally well in the last year or so. We have been consistent and I am sure of putting up a good show and ensure a series win, said the veteran leg-spinner.         
	Talking about Ajantha Mendis, Kumble was full of all praise and refused to underestimate the Sri Lankan mystery spinner though he was not unduly worried about him either.         
	We need to respect every bowler. We will definitely not take anyone lightly. Importantly, in Tests we have a lot more time to get ready and get set. Obviously, my interaction with some of our players was that they had some difficulty in picking him. I guess in Tests when you have more time, we will certainly be able to ensure about our quality, Kumble said.         
	Asked how important would the presence of seniors like Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid be, Kumble said, We never lost on any of these players on Test cricket scene. We are looking forward to the challenges in Sri Lanka. I know it is not going to be easy but we have the potential to win the series, he said. He also feels that Harbhajan Singhs return to the side would also add tooth to the Indian attack.         
	He (Harbhajan) is an integral part of the team and is a key member of the squad. He will go out there and give his best given the opportunity.         
	On the referral system, which would be introduced in the Test series, Kumble said: It is for the first time we will be using it in the series. We are going to have a chat about it once we reach Sri Lanka with the officials. We will see how it goes.

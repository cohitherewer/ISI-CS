	Bangalore: World No. 4 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and American second seed Venus Williams entered the quarter finals of the Bangalore Open in contrasting styles on Thursday.         
	While top seed Jankovic was clinical in her 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Croat Sanda Mamic, world No. 7 Venus stumbled past Chinas Peng Shuai in three sets, committing 15 double faults.         
	Jankovic broke her left-handed opponent in the fifth and seventh games of the opening set after the two had traded early breaks.         
	The powerful Serb broke Mamic in the fifth and seventh games of the second set as well to close out the match.         
	Jankovic will meet Chinas Yan Zi next.         
	Yan, ranked 54, needed less than an hour to dispose of Olga Savchuk of Ukraine 6-2, 6-1.         
	Former world No. 1 Venus was stretched 6-2, 6-7, 6-2 by her gritty 58th-ranked opponent in a second round match that lasted nearly two hours.         
	She next faces Russian Vera Zvonareva, who beat Romanian qualifier Agnes Szatmari 7-6, 6-1.         
	 With her service letting her down, Venus looked vulnerable in the first two sets.         
	Venus overcame some early blues to break her opponent in the fifth game of the first set with a powerful forehand.         
	Gritty Shuai came back strongly in the second, serving hard and returning with precision to trade breaks and win in the tie-breaker before Venus found her groove in the decider.

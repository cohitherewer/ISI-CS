            MADHUMITA GANGULY            V. Pranitha in Beijing on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Beijing: Heartbreak again for India at the archery range. In individual events, all the three women participants  Dola Banerjee, K. Bombayla Devi and V. Pranitha  bowed out on Tuesday.         
	Of the trio, Pranitha, the youngest, made a slightly better showing in that she progressed to the second round before falling to Kwon-Un Sil of North Korea while Dola and Bombayla failed to cross the first hurdle.         
	Dola, ranked 31, was playing Marie-Pier Beaudet of Canada, ranked 34. She scored a 10-10-9 in the first end and her adversary scored exactly the same. In the second, Dola could manage a 9, 7 and 8 (24) while Marie got a 26 to move into the lead. In the third after both had earned 28-29, respectively, defeat stared Dola in the face. But the Canadian allowed the Indian to come back with a poor fourth end after which the scores were tied 109-109, taking the game into the tie-breaker.         
	It was in the tie-breaker that Dola faltered, scoring 8 to Maries 10.         
	This is my only regret That I did not score at least a 9, if not a 10, Dola told The Telegraph. You see, since I shoot first, Marie had the chance of knowing how much I scored.         
	Now a 10 or a 9 would have put more pressure on her and this could have led to her missing the target.         
	Except for that, Dola has no regrets, for she has played well. She does not blame anything either. Its all a matter of one arrow. In knockout, the luck factor also remains.         
	The young Pranitha won her first match against Australian Jane Waller 106-100. The 37th-ranked Indian found the fifth ranked North Korean Kwon Un-Sil too much to handle and lost the second round contest at 99-106.         
	In swimming, Virdhawal Khade and Sandeep Sejwal created twin national records but that wasnt enough to see them through to the semi-finals of the 100m freestyle and 200m breaststroke events, respectively, on Tuesday.         
	Boxers Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar moved into the pre-quarter finals in their respective categories.         
	In the 51kg category, Jitender Kumar defeated Ulas Memis until the Turkey boxer retired while trailing 1-21. Akhil tamed Ali Hallab of France 12-5 in the 54kg category to advance.         
	Jitender meets Tulashboy Doniyorov of Uzbekistan while Akhil takes on Sergey Vodopyanov.         
	Akhil was in control right from the beginning and led 4-2 after the first round. A lop-sided second round saw him stretching the lead beyond Hallab and the Indian did not break sweat in the last two rounds as he ambled to an easy win.         
	Earlier Jitender led 5-0 after first round and though Memis put up a slightly better show in the second, the Indian landed a flurry of punches on the Turkey boxer to take an unassailable lead.         
	The Indian rowing pair of Devender Kumar Khandwal and Manjeet Singh finished fifth in the lightweight mens double sculls repechage 2.         
	The Indians clocked 7:02.06s, 23 seconds behind the winners  Pedro Fraga and Nuno Mendes  of Portugal who crossed the finishing line in 6:39.07s.         
	In shooting, Samaresh Jung was not in his elements in 50m pistol and his total of 540 was not enough to find a place among the top six who made it to the finals.

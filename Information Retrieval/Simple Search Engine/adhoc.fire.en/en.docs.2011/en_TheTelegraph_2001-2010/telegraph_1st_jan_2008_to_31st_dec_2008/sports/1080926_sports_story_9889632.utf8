                                                                                                                                                                                           T20 League final   in Mumbai
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The inaugural edition of the Champions League Twenty20 cricket tournament, involving eight teams from five countries, will be hosted by three cities  Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, between December 3 and 10.         
	Mumbai, venue of the semi-finals and the final of the high-profile Indian Premier League (IPL) earlier this year, would host the final.         
	The first edition of the Champions League Twenty20 will offer teams $6 million as prize money, making this the biggest prize in world cricket for the game at a domestic competition level.         
	Besides Indian Premier League champions Rajasthan Royals and runners-up Chennai Super Kings, Western Australia Warriors and Victoria Rangers, from Australia, Titans and Dolphins, from South Africa, Englands T20 champions Middlesex and the yet-to-be crowned T20 champions of Pakistan are to take part in the tournament.         
	With most of the matches being night games the dew factor would come into the picture in northern India and the conditions would also be very cold. So we have decided to shift the venues from the originally announced Jaipur, Mohali and Delhi, Champions League chairman Lalit Modi explained.         
	The teams have been divided into two groups of four each and will initially play each other on a league basis. The top two teams will qualify for the semi-finals.

                                                   Shaun Pollock calls it a day

           
	Durban: South African allrounder Shaun Pollock announced his imminent retirement from international cricket on Friday. 
    
	Pollock, 34, said the current third Test against the West Indies, his 108th Test, would be his last. But he said he would remain available for South Africas five-match one-day series against the West Indies. A few people have made me offers, but I havent decided anything yet, Pollock told a news conference. 
    
	Id like to take at least a year off to be with my family. Pollock was left out of the first six Tests South Africa played this season. He returned to take four for 35 in the first innings of the third Test. Pollock made his Test debut against England at Centurion in 1995.

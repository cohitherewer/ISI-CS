                                                   Mahindra catch up with Bagan

           
	Kozhikode: Mahindra United beat Viva Kerala 2-0 in a 13th-round match of the ONGC I-League here on Thursday. Andrew Mensah (47th) and Mohammed Rafi (73rd) scored for the visitors. 
    
	Mahindra capitalised on a defensive lapse to take the lead. Man-of-the-Match Mensah shot past custodian Nelson who fell down. Steven Dias set up the second goal with a brilliant pass which Rafi blasted home. 
    
	Mahindra thus caught up with Mohun Bagan (20 points each), though the Mumbai side has played a game more. Viva Kerala stayed on 12. 
    
	In Margao, wooden-spooners Salgaocar squandered the lead to share points with Sporting Clube de Goa. Felix Chimaokwu put Salgaocar, winless so far, ahead in the 26th minute. 
    
	Sporting found the equaliser in the 64th minute through a penalty which was awarded when Salgaocar keeper Marcus Basumatari brought down Elijah inside the box. Denzil Franco made no mistake from the dreaded spot. 
    
	Sporting now have 13 points, while Salgaocar have 6.

	Napier: Englands Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell scored centuries to lead their side to a massive 501-run lead and all but end New Zealands chances of winning the deciding third Test on Monday.         
	Strauss, who had not scored a hundred in his last 30 Test innings, was on his highest Test score of 173 not out and Bell made 110 to guide the tourists to 416 for five at the close on the third day.         
	The hosts have scored in excess of 400 only twice before when batting fourth, both times against England but they lost on each occasion. Their highest successful run chase was 324 for five against Pakistan in Christchurch in 1994.         
	Tim Ambrose was the other not out batsman on 28. Daniel Vettori had figures of three for 135.         
	The England batsmen applied themselves throughout the day on the batter-friendly pitch and demonstrated how easy it could be to accumulate runs in the near-perfect conditions. They scored 325 runs in 90 overs for the loss of three wickets.         
	They batted really well and showed us what is (achievable) on that wicket, New Zealand offspinner Jeetan Patel told reporters.         
	I dont think we bowled poorly, they just stuck around and hung in as hard as they could.         
	Strauss, recalled for the series after being dropped last year, surpassed his previous highest score of 147, made against South Africa in 2005, and the biggest individual total (160) at McLean Park.         
	He had brought up his 11th Test century with a cover drive off Chris Martin for his 16th boundary shortly before tea.         
	The 31-year-olds last Test century was the 116 he scored against Pakistan in Leeds in August 2006.         
	I was frustrated in my previous hundreds in not going on and getting a big one and I think ...youll appreciate those are the easiest runs to score after making a hundred, Strauss said.

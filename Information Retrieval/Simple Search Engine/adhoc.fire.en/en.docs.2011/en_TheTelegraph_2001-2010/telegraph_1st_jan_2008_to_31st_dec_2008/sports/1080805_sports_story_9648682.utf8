The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen named England captain
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pietersen named England captain
                    Kevin Pietersen                
	London: England appointed Kevin Pietersen as their new captain on Monday following Michael Vaughans resignation after the series loss to South Africa.         
	Vaughan stepped down on Sunday after five years as Englands most successful Test skipper with 26 wins from 51 Tests. The 28-year-old Pietersen will lead England against his native country in the fourth Test against South Africa, starting at The Oval on Thursday, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said.         
	I am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain England, Pietersen said. Its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me, especially at this stage of my international career.         
	I have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both Michael and Paul (Collingwood). I fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country.         
	My immediate priority will be this weeks fourth Test. I will be devoting all my energy to ensure that the we are properly prepared and play to the full potential.         
	Pietersen, who made his Test debut in the 2005 Ashes series victory over Australia, was also named as the England one-day captain in succession to Collingwood, who resigned on Sunday.         
	In choosing a new captain, we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain, said England chairman of selectors, Geoff Miller.         
	Kevin is a world-class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and I am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staffs to bring England success in the future.         
	Pietersen, born in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, opted to play for the country where his mother was born because he disapproved of South Africas racial quota system.         
	He qualified for England in September, 2004, and was selected to tour Zimbabwe where he averaged 104 in three one-day innings. Pietersen was selected to play in the one-day series against South Africa early in 2005 and, in the face of unremitting hostility from the home crowds, struck three centuries in five matches.         
	He was named ahead of Graham Thorpe to play in the first Test of the memorable 2005 Ashes series at Lords and marked his debut with two confident half-centuries in a losing cause.         
	In the final Test at The Oval, he took the attack to the Australian bowlers in a match England needed to draw to secure the Ashes.         
	Since then Pietersen has been Englands leading batsman, expanding his repertoire to include a reverse sweep of Muttiah Muralidharan for six against Sri Lanka, and striking 226 against West Indies last year. He was also Englands best batsman in an unsuccessful World Cup campaign in the Caribbean last year.         
	Pietersen has captained England once in a one-day International, losing to New Zealand at Lords this year.         
	Along with the Test squad, the England selectors also announced a 15-man squad for the one-day series and Twenty20 matches against South Africa.         
	Uncapped Nottinghamshire batsman Samit Patel has been included and there was a recall for Sussex wicketkeeper Matt Prior.

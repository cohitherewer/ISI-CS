The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal win
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Arsenal win
                      
	London: Arsenal rediscovered their Premier League form on Saturday with a convincing 3-0 victory over Newcastle United at the Emirates Stadium.         
	Portsmouth ended a run of six successive league defeats when they won 3-0 at Everton while Hull Citys flying start ended emphatically when they were thrashed 5-0 at home by Wigan Athletic.         
	In Saturdays other games, West Ham United beat Blackburn Rovers 4-1, Middlesbrough beat Stoke City 2-1 and Bolton Wanderers game against West Bromwich Albion finished goalless.         
	A Charles NZogbia handball enabled Robin van Persie to put them ahead with an 18th-minute penalty and the Dutchman got his second five minutes before halftime when he ended a flowing move with a searing shot into the roof of the net.         
	Another fluid passing movement ended with Denilson tucking in the third.         
	Portsmouth began well on Saturday when Jermain Defoe turned well to put them ahead after 11 minutes and a rare effort by defender Glen Johnson made it 2-0 by halftime.         
	David James saved a Yakubu Aiyegbeni penalty early in the second half and Portsmouth finished with a flourish when a Defoe chip came down off the bar and just over the line, though Crouch was on hand to make doubly sure.         
	Hull began their first season in the top flight with a win and a draw but were thumped by Wigan.         
	An early own goal, a breakaway by Antonio Valencia and, after the break, two for Amr Zaki and one for Emile Heskey in the second half did the damage. (REUTERS)

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brett Lee bats for on-field umpires
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Brett Lee in New Delhi on Monday                           
	New Delhi: Brett Lee still hasnt lost faith on umpires. Like all bowlers, he, too, has found his appeals been turned down by the men in white on leg-before decisions several times, but the Australian speedster wants the umpires to dictate terms on the cricket field.         
	Speaking to the reporters on the sidelines of a promotional on Monday, Lee said he was in favour of retaining the human element in the game. The run outs and the stumping decisions could be referred, but on-field umpires should take care of the lbw decisions, he said.         
	On most of the occasions I have found that the umpires have been correct on lbw appeals, he added. The referral system has its positives as well as negatives. It is definitely a time consuming process but one can achieve accuracy through it.         
	Lee, who has recently won back to back Man-of-the-Series awards against West Indies and Sri Lanka, said he was confident of continuing his good form in the near future.         
	The 31-year-old pacer, however, has no issues travelling to India despite the recent serial blasts in cities like Bangalore and Ahmedabad.         
	Personally I dont have any problem travelling to India but on travelling to Pakistan for Champions Trophy, it is CA that will decide, he said.

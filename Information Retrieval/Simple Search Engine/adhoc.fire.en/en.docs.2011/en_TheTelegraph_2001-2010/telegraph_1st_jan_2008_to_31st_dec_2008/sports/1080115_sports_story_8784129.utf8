	Perth: Neither Team India captain Anil Kumble nor manager Chetan Chauhan took everybody into confidence before dropping the charge against Brad Hogg. 
    
	The following is how the ones contacted by The Telegraph, at the Hyatt Regency, reacted: 
    
	Senior batsman: Im not sure whether others were told or not, but I knew If I had to complain each time I heard b****** on the field, then much of my career wouldve been spent in the rooms of Match Referees! Weve taken a stand and the world knows about it. 
    
	Another senior batsman: I had no idea Obviously, the Board has had a hand 
    
	A senior: Look, in any case, I dont believe in things being carried to the Match Referees room I believe in playing hard, but it should all be left on the field. 
    
	Senior bowler: Is it? But have the Australians shown any gesture? Weve proved that theres a difference between them and us, but what are they doing? 
    
	Another bowler: Its news to me Nobody told me anything I didnt go around asking either I prefer doing my bit and thats it. 
    
	Yet another bowler: Oh 
    
	Senior member of the support staff: What are you saying? Is it true? With all the pressure on Australia now, its going to be interesting

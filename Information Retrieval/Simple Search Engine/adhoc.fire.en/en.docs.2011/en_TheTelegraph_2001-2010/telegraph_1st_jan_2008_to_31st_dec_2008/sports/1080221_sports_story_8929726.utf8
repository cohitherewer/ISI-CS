                                                     Leipus, Le Roux for   Team Calcutta
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Leipus                                 
	Calcutta: Physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian Le Roux, whod helped take Team India to the 2003 World Cup final, are coming together again  this time in the same roles for the Calcutta team in the Indian Premier League.         
	This was made known to The Telegraph by coach-designate John Buchanan.         
	My understanding is that Leipus and Le Roux have both been signed up Ill be happy to work with them, Buchanan said, while speaking from Perth on Wednesday evening.         
	While Leipus hasnt worked with a national team after quitting the India job in December 2004, Le Roux (who chose to leave after the 2003 World Cup) was with the South Africans till recently.         
	Both, of course, are highly rated.

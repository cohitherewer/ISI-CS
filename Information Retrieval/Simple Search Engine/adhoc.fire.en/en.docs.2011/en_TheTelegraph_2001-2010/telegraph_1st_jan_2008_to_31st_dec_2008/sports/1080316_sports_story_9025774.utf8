                                                   England 421 runs ahead
                      
	Wellington: England all but batted New Zealand out of the second Test with their top-six guiding their side to a 421-run lead at the close of play on Day III of the second Test at the Basin Reserve Satur-day.         
	Already ahead by 144 runs, the England batsmen produced a series of partnerships to reach 277 for nine at the end of play, giving their bowlers a formidable target to defend and at least two days to try to level the three-match series.         
	Jacob Oram was fined 20 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of dissent, the ICC said on Saturday.         
	Oram pleaded guilty to the offence after being charged for showing serious dissent at an umpires decision when he was given out lbw by umpire Steve Davis off Ryan Sidebottom.

	London: In a world where no country is immune to terror threats, England should heed to the security assurances and return for the Test series against Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men, said India cricket coach Gary Kirsten.         
	Kirsten said an element of risk would always be there no matter where England play.         
	From a security point of view the England players have received assurances, the question on everyones mind is: how safe is safe? Kirsten said.         
	There is no way that security can be guaranteed wherever you are in the world. But you cant keep saying No, he said.         
	Despite that, Kirsten said, England should have no apprehensions in coming to India if the security experts give an all-clear to the arrangements. ...if the professional security people who are paid to make these assessments have given the go-ahead then I think you have to go with it.

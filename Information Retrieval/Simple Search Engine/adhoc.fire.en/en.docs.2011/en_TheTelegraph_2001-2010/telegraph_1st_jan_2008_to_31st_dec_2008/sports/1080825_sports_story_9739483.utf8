The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deco puts Chelsea back on top
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Deco puts Chelsea back on top
                      
	London: Deco scored with a free kick on Sunday to give Chelsea a 1-0 victory at Wigan and extended coach Luiz Felipe Scolaris winning start in the Premier League.         
	The Blues now have six points after two games and lead Liverpool on goal difference at the top of the league.         
	The Portugal midfielders chip caught Wigans stand-in keeper Mike Pollitt out of position in the 4th minute and drifted into the top corner.         
	Chelseas hopes of reproducing the attacking style that characterised Scolaris time in charge of Brazil gave way to a cautious approach that effectively shut Wigan out of the game.         
	Wigan lost its England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland during the warm-up and Pollitt was at fault for the goal. Lee Cattermole handled the ball on the edge of the area and Pollitt left his corner exposed, with Deco clipping the ball over the wall and into the net.         
	Wilson Palacios and Jason Koumas both tested Chelsea goalkeeper Peter Cech as Wigan reacted strongly.         
	Chelsea successfully took the sting out of the second half, giving Wigan a significant amount of possession without allowing clear chances. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gripping end to thrilling league
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gripping end to thrilling league
  - The season was pure Hollywood with Ronaldo rightly cast as the leading man       HENRY WINTER            Ryan Giggs (left) and Gary Neville celebrate winning the Premier League on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	Kevin Keegan picked the wrong moment to decry this title race as boring. Short of Nijinsky, Devon Loch, Shergar and Black Beauty joining in, this race could not have been more dramatic. And it was Keegans old nemesis, a dancing, smiling Sir Alex Ferguson, who did his pensioner-on-a-skateboard impression in the winners enclosure on Sunday night.         
	As Ferguson did his lopsided jig, as United soaked up the plaudits, credit must go to Avram Grants Chelsea for staying with the champions for so long. Not since 1968 have two teams hurtled into the finishing straight, shoulder to shoulder, level on points.         
	Such was the uncertainty over who would prevail that two sets of winners medals were minted. The Premier League sent the original trophy to the JJB Stadium, and a replica to Stamford Bridge, and their hunch proved correct.         
	In a way, the Premier League could not lose such has been the quality of the football, the intensity of the championship chase and the sports inherent integrity as confirmed on Sunday by the efforts of Wigan Athletic and Bolton Wanderers.         
	 For excitement, switchback fortunes and sheer technical brilliance, the 2007-08 season has been pure Hollywood with Uniteds swaggering Cristiano Ronaldo rightly cast as the leading man.         
	Chelseas cast-list glittered, particularly in recent weeks. Petr Cech, John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho, Michael Ballack, Michael Essien, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole all played their part in an unforgettable season, the climax of which was watched by hundreds of enthralled millions across the globe on Sunday.         
	Individual moments assumed great significance during the season, keeping the race rolling. Carlo Cudicinis point-blank, point-saving save from Dimitar Berbatov at White Hart Lane. Cechs decision to play on despite requiring 50 stitches in his face after a training-ground collision with Tal Ben Haim.         
	Two vital Grant decisions, bringing Nicolas Anelka on against Arsenal on March 23 and moving him closer to Didier Drogba against Newcastle United on May 5. Ballack finding such majestic form. It was not enough, but Chelsea deserve huge praise for pushing United right to the wire.         
	Despite Keegans comments, United had to win this league the hard way. Manchester City were quickest out of the stalls, Sven-Goran Eriksson astounding expectations with his hastily-assembled XI winning their first three. What a Trivial Pursuit that will be: who did the double over the champions and lost 1-8 on the last day of the season?         
	United were hesitant early on. Down at the Bridge, Roman Abramovichs tense relationship with Jose Mourinho went into complete meltdown. When the Special One departed on September 19, Chelseas season looked in tatters. The unknown Grant stepped in to very large shoes, and his welcome to the Premier League involved defeat chez Ferguson. John Obi Mikel saw red. The Blues lacked harmony.         
	Arsenal dominated the contest in October, seizing the high ground with victory over Sunderland, and in December defeated Chelsea with a rare Cech howler seized on by an old Blue, William Gallas. Terrys broken foot added to the collective pain.         
	Liverpool gave brief hope of a first title since Kenny Dalglish was manager in 1990. Inspired by the quicksilver Spanish golden boy Fernando Torres, Rafa Benitezs side hinted at finding the right mental and physical resolve and consistency.         
	 Compounding Kopite frustration, United clicked into gear. Chelsea, their dressing-room heaving with talent, found their stride. Their ambition confirmed by the transfer-window arrival of Nicolas Anelka, Grants side racked up 12 points from 12. But elegant Arsenal still headed the field.         
	Then came a hugely significant moment, Arsenals grisly visit to St Andrews. Eduardos season ended in sickening circumstances, his leg shattered. Why does it happen to the nice guys? Arsenal also dropped two points with a late penalty.         
	Possessing more style than steel, Arsene Wengers side were swiftly overhauled by United, utterly irresistible in March. United had the lead, but Chelseas persistence was remarkable.         
	They were now the team in form, with Ballack imperious, Essien consistently outstanding and Terry giving them confidence. When Ballack struck twice in a 2-1 win over the depleted leaders at a jubilant Bridge on April 26, United clung to their goal difference.         
	Chelseas visit to St James Park proved more problematic but they eventually triumphed, setting up a finale that was far from boring.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

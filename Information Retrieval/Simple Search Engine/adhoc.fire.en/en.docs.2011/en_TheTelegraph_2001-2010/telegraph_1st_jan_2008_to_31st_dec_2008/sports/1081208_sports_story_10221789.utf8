The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A poignant win for Jeev Milkha
                                                                                                                                                                                                     A poignant win for Jeev Milkha
                      
	Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh put behind a personal tragedy en route to perhaps the most emotional victory of his career when he lifted the season-ending Golf Nippon Series JT Cup here on Sunday.         
	With his wife recuperating in a local hospital here after delivering a still-born child, Jeev had decided to withdraw from the tournament but his wife, Kudrat, urged him to play on and Jeev eventually went on to claim his second Japan Tour title of the year  his fourth this season.         
	I dedicate this win to my wife, for being strong enough to tell me to go and play on Thursday morning, an emotional Jeev said in a statement.         
	Starting the day one shot off the lead, Jeev, the 2006 winner here, carded a four-under 66 to clinch the title at 12-under 268. The trio of Brendan Jones (64), David Smail (66) and Taichi Teshima (68) finished second, further two shots behind.         
	This was Jeevs second Japan Tour title of the year, following his Nagashima Shigeo Invitational Sega Sammy Cup earlier this year.         
	A lot happened in my family over the last few days and we have gone through quite a bit. Besides my wife, I want to dedicate this win to the family members from both my and my wifes sides. I also want to thank the Indian ambassador and his wife, who have been a close friend and stood by us emotionally as well, helping us get through the difficult time, Jeev said.         
	On the personal tragedy, Jeev said: It was Gods will and I hope there is something better in store for us. I would like to thank my friends and fans who cared for us and all people who supported us in this difficult time. I also thank the media for respecting and understanding the situation.         
	God has been very kind with this victory and I hope, no I believe, in future something good will happen to us, said the Indian.         
	Beginning the day one shot behind penultimate round leader Prayad Marksaeng, Jeev kicked off with a blemish-free front nine, which was studded with a treble of birdies at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club.         
	On his way back, the 13th hole bogey turned out to be the only aberration as Jeev, in complete control of his game, preceded and followed it with a birdie each for a sizzling card of 66 that was enough to take home his second JT Cup title and pocket 3m yen.         
	So far, Jeev has won four titles on three different tours to break into the top 50 and his other titles include Bank Australia Open (European Tour) and the Barclays Singapore Open (Asian Tour).         
	Thanks to his sensational run of form, Jeev is assured of the Asian Tour Order of Merit title. The Nippon Series was the last event of the Japan Tour season, featuring this years tournament winners and players who finished in the top 25 in the money rankings after last weeks Casio Open.

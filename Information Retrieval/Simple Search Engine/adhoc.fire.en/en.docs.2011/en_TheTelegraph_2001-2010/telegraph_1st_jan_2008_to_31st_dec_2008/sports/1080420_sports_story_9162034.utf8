	SOURAV vs LAXMAN                    
	Arguably the best Indian captain, Sourav has a definite edge over his Deccan Chargers counterpart. In terms of experience too, Sourav is ahead having featured in 19 Twenty20s. Laxman on the other hand is yet to play in the shortest version of the game. On a high after their slam-bang performance against Royal Challengers in the opener, the Knight Riders captain will look to repeat their performance at home. Much to prove for Laxman.    
	ISHANT vs SYMONDS                  
	Their rivalry is still afresh. Not many days ago, the 19-year-old was fined 15 per cent of his match fee in the CB Series in Australia. His offence: Sharma pointed Symonds back to the dressing room after having bowled the Aussie. Having bagged the prize scalp of Symonds thrice (from five ODIs vs Australia), the Kinght Riders medium-pacer will surely give his Deccan Chargers rival some nightmares. It is to be seen how the highest bid foreign player in the IPL plays this youngster.    
	McCULLUM vs RUDRA PRATAP                    
	On Friday, the New Zealnder has proved why he rsquo;s the highest bid player from his country with a record-breaking unbeaten 158. With his explosive batting the Knight Riders batsman has emerged as the most challenging contender for rival teams. It remains to be seen how Rudra Pratap Singh will stop McCullum before he gets going. The pacer, who is coming back from an injury, struggled in the Test series against South Africa.      
	GILCHRIST vs KARTIK                  Adam Gilchrist combined his aggressive batting to redefine the role of wicketkeeping. The battle will see whether the veteran Gilchrist, who has retired from international cricket, still has the firepower in him to put it across the left-arm spinner. He has shown the ability to dominate spinners in subcontinent conditions and so it will be an interesting battle with Murali Kartik. There rsquo;s no doubt the Knight Riders will try to stop Gilchrist early because he can spell the doom for any team.

                                                   Controversial catch
                      
	Perth: The Sri Lankan chase suffered a setback on Friday when Chamara Silva was controversially given out caught by Andrew Symonds for a duck off Nathan Bracken. The incident happened in the 14th over and replays showed the ball had touched the ground when the fielder pouched it.         
	According to The Age, Symonds moved brilliantly to take the ball one-handed centimetres off the ground, but it was inconclusive as to whether he had full control before planting the ball on the ground as he fell.

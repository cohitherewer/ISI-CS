The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Keane has the final word 
                                                   Keane has the final word 
            HENRY WINTER                      
	Avram Grant continues to fluff his lines on the big stage. The Chelsea coachs negative substitution of an attacker, Salomon Kalou, for a centre-half, Alex, invited Spurs on Wednesday night, setting up a thrilling climax in which Robbie Keane struck a marvellous equaliser which will have been celebrated as wildly by followers of Arsenal and Manchester United as by the Tottenham faithful.         
	Ashley Cole should have been banished for a horrific lunge at Alan Hutton deemed worthy of only a yellow card by Mike Riley.         
	The first half had contained enough drama for a whole game, conjuring up three goals in a frantic first 20 minutes and concluding with Ashley Coles horrific lunge.         
	Drogba had shown Chelseas ruthless intent early on, although his headed goal was cloaked in controversy. Essien, allowed to roam through Claude Makeleles assiduous anchoring, charged upfield, eventually losing possession as Pascal Chimbonda slid in. Riley bizarrely deemed the challenge illegal.         
	The ball was in the domain of John Terry. The Chelsea captain elegantly lifted the ball across from the left towards the far post. Drogba had read Terrys intentions, darting in ahead of the slow-reacting Jermaine Jenas to nod Chelsea in front.         
	Jenas swiftly made amends. When Claude Makelele was penalised for climbing over Aaron Lennon, Jenas took charge of the free kick on the right. The England internationals delivery was magnificent, the ball hoisted to the far post.         
	As Terry clutched a handful of Dimitar Berbatovs shirt to prevent the Bulgarian reaching the ball, Jenass free kick continued to Jonathan Woodgate. One of the most uplifting sights for Spurs fans this year has been Woodgate rising high, having eluded his marker  in this case Drogba  to head powerfully in.         
	Largely unimpressive since the Carling Cup success, Spurs now played with greater conviction. The determination flooding through Juande Ramos men was evident. Joe Cole made the telling break, dribbling through the middle. With Essien and Drogba lurking on the edge of the area, Joe Cole released the ball, which rebounded from Drogba to Essien. His response was magnificent, the ball lifted unerringly over Robinson for his first of the season.         
	Spurs strove to find an equaliser and when Jenas wriggled in from the left, Drogba threw himself in to try to block. Inevitably, Drogba stayed down, nursing another seemingly terminal injury, stirring unrest among the home fans. A plastic bottle was thrown on to the pitch as Drogba miraculously recovered.         
	A good game then turned nasty, Derby-day fireworks erupting. Chimbonda fouled Joe Cole, who gave the linesman some choice London invective for ignoring the offence. Joe Cole was booked, Lampard should have followed him for catching Jenas, and then came Ashley Coles assault on Hutton, an offence that deserved more than yellow and triggered a near brawl.         
	Adding insult to iniquity, Ashley Cole set the scene for Chelseas third, delivering a quick throw-in to Makelele, who swiftly found Kalou. Chelseas No. 21 cleverly worked the ball across the edge of the area to Joe Cole, who darted around Chimbonda.         
	Still the angle was tight. Still Robinson had to be negotiated. Joe Coles shot sped through Robinsons legs, clipped the keepers heel and looped up and in, to Robinsons deep anguish.         
	Even before Robinson regained some pride with an outstanding save from Drogba, Spurs had pulled a goal back. As the spellbinding entertainment continued, Huddlestone displayed his more positive side. Keane clipped over a corner from the left and Berbatovs presence caused chaos in the box, allowing the ball to fly through to Huddlestone. What a response! The midfielder drilled the ball unerringly in past Cudicini: 3-3.         
	But there was more. When Spurs foolishly conceded possession on the right, Chelsea leapt into life, Drogba finding Joe Cole. The England international again ghosted around Chimbonda and found the net with a brilliant finish, the ball placed at speed past the exposed Robinson.         
	But then came Keane. What a finish! What a game!           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                     Jeev up to tied 2nd
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Jakarta: Jeev Milkha Singh has a good chance of ending a 15-month long title drought after carding a five-under 65 that saw him move up to tied second at the Indonesia Open on Saturday.         
	Jeev has not won a title since lifting the Volvo Masters of Europe in October 2006.         
	Arjun Atwal also made his way up with a fine 66 after the third round to be at tied 10th.         
	Jyoti Randhawa, Gaurav Ghei and Shiv Kapur also returned sub-par rounds.         
	Randhawa carded a 66, which helped him climb from tied 45th to tied 28th (six-under 204). Ghei (67) and Kapur (69) are tied 37th at five-under 205.         
	Jeev, who has an aggregate of 14-under 196, and Chinas Liang Wen-Chong trail Chilean Felipe Aguilar by two strokes. (PTI)

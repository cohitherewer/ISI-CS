The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI allays private ownership fears
                                                                                                                                                                                           CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	BCCI allays private ownership fears  
	Chandigarh: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reacted strongly to Cricket Australias criticism of private ownership in Twenty20 leagues like the Indian Premier League, saying the Aussie boards concerns are unfounded as stringent checks and balances are in place to ensure that the game is not harmed by private owners.  
	I can say this with full confidence that private ownership in cricket poses no threat to the games future. Unlike many foreign cricket clubs, IPL is not an independent body and is governed by the rules and regulations of the board. IPL is BCCIs child and we will never allow any such thing which proves detrimental to the game, BCCI joint secretary and IPL committee member M. P. Pandove said here.    
	CA not to force players  
	Karachi: Raising the spectre of Australia fielding an under-strength team in the Champions Trophy in Pakistan, Cricket Australia chairman Creagh Connor on Sunday said players would not be forced to participate in the September event if they give genuine reasons for their pullout.         
	We have always believed that Australia would be sending their team at this stage. We will, however, not force any player to go anywhere ... If he has a legitimate reason not to do so, Connor said.    
	Warne to lead
    
	Melbourne: what cricket could not give Shane Warne, finally poker has. The retired spin legend is realising his long-cherished ambition of captaining an Australian team in the world series of poker in Las Vegas.    
	CSA rsquo;s view  
	Durban: Although relieved that a potential problem was avoided courtesy Zimbabwes withdrawal from the Twenty20 world championship, Cricket South Africa today made it clear that the strife-torn countrys future in the International Cricket Council remains a complex issue which needs to be dealt with soon.    
	Mali rsquo;s support  
	Dubai: Ray Mali, who stepped down as the International Cricket Council president on Friday, has urged the cricketing fraternity to support his successor David Morgan, who he said was capable of taking the game to new heights.    
	Ashraf hopeful  
	Karachi: with Asia becoming a powerhouse in world cricket, newly-elected Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Nasim Ashraf exuded confidence that two more Asian nations would qualify for the 2011 World Cup.         
	We are expecting that in the next two years, hopefully one more team from Asia will get one-day status, said Ashraf, after the annual general meeting of ACC.

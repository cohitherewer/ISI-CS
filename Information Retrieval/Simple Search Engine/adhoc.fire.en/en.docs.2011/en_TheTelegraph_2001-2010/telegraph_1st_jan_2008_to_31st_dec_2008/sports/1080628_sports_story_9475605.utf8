The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zimbabwe top ICC agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zimbabwe top ICC agenda
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: The vexed Zimbabwe issue, Sunil Gavaskars replacement in the cricket committee, the fate of disgraced West Indian batsman Marlon Samuels and the Future Tours Programme (FTP) post-2012 will top the agenda at ICCs annual general meeting starting here on Sunday.         
	Further discussion about the concept of a Test Championship and/or play-off was also part of the agenda.         
	The two-day chief executives committee (CEC) meeting will decide on a range of issues relating to the game as well as recommendations by the ICC board, which will meet on July 2-3.         
	The week will conclude with ICCs annual conference on July 4, followed by a members forum, according to an ICC release.         
	The ICC board will be asked to select a replacement for former cricket committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar, who relinquished the post in May after eight years at the helm. Former Pakistan captain Majid Khan and ex-West Indies skipper Clive Lloyd are the potential candidates.         
	The worsening situation in Zimbabwe has prompted ICC president Ray Mali to place the issue on the agenda at the board meeting, the release said.         
	The governing body is also expected to announce Marlon Samuels fate.         
	Samuels was found guilty of offence C 4 (ix) of the ICC code of conduct, which indicts a player who has received any money, benefit or other reward (whether financial or otherwise) which could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute.         
	The CEC will also consider replacing bowl-out with one-over eliminator in case of a tied match in the 2008 Champions Trophy and 2009 Twenty20 World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni amp; the rest not keen on touring Pak
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dhoni amp; the rest not keen on touring Pak
    - 2009 Tour
  -   Mood informally communicated to the BCCI by the Big 3             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Calcutta: Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, vice-captain Virender Sehwag and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar have informally told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that they and the rest of the players have strong reservations about touring Pakistan in January-February 2009.         
	That the players could move in that direction was reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	According to well-placed sources, the Big 3 have, at the same time, made it clear that they have no problem with Pakistan as an opposition, its just that they (and the rest) dont wish to tour a country where blasts are almost a daily occurrence.         
	If the carnage at the Islamabad Marriott in September rattled the players, for that hotel usually hosts cricket teams, last Saturdays blast outside the Gaddafi left them shocked.         
	In recent times, the Australians and players from the West Indies have also refused to tour Pakistan.         
	The Big 3 have made an informal representation Whats significant is that the entire team has reservations When even the Gaddafi isnt safe, how can the players be expected to focus on their cricket? In any case, a tour of Pakistan is very demanding mentally Because of the restrictions, its draining, is what one of the well-placed sources said late on Wednesday.         
	The BCCI, though, hasnt confirmed this development. Hardly a surprise, as its bound to affect cricketing ties with Pakistan and some in the BCCI wouldnt like the Asian unity within the International Cricket Council to be broken.         
	Lives, however, are much more important. In fact, thats the bottom line which matters.         
	Eventually, its a no from the government which could come to the BCCIs rescue. Indeed, despite pressure from Islamabad, its unlikely that New Delhi is going to give permission.         
	Earlier this month, the government withheld its okay for the hockey colts tour of Pakistan.         
	Meanwhile, unfazed by the negative developments, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt intends coming to India next week for a one-on-one with BCCI president Shashank Man-ohar.         
	Till the other day, the PCB was looking at the option of hosting India at a neutral venue. Perhaps, the time has come to work on that more actively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL confirms player tested positive
                                                                                                                                                                                                     IPL confirms player tested positive
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta:The Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner, Lalit Modi, on Sunday confirmed that a player has tested positive in Wadas random dope test conducted during the meets inaugural edition.         
	The name of the player couldnt be confirmed but the finger of suspicion points to Pakistan and Delhi DareDevils pacer Mohammed Asif.         
	An ICC spokesman said the organisation was still looking into the matter.         
	Modi, however, insisted that it was too early to say the player failed the drug test as there are several procedures to follow before arriving at a conclusion.         
	A cricket website had earlier claimed that a player from the sub-continent had failed the random dope test.         
	Two days ago the IPL received a letter from a Swiss agency, mandated by Wada, which said one sample had tested positive. The IPL will follow set procedures from now on, Modi said.         
	As per the procedures, the identity of the player has to be matched with the sample. Then the form, which the player filled before the tournament will be scrutinised for any pre-declared or prescribed drug. And if that matches the drug found in the sample, the matter ends there.         
	In case that does not happen, the player will be informed and a B sample will be sent for testing. If that, too, is positive, the matter will be taken up by the IPLs drugs tribunal.         
	The tribunal will consist of a leading doctor, a former cricketer and a lawyer. The committee will study the issue and take a decision, for which there will be a separate appeals tribunal.

	 This is the 29th Test to be played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. It equals the Kotla in Delhi as the No.2 spot in terms of Tests hosted. The top spot belongs to Calcuttas Eden Gardens         
	 India have not lost a Test at this venue since they were defeated by Pakistan in January 1999         
	 South Africa won the toss and decided to bat. Of the 29 Tests here, only once has the team that won the toss chosen to field. On January 13, 1982, England, playing the fifth Test of the series, won the toss and inserted India. It proved a disaster as they watched Gundappa Vishwanath pile up 222 and Yashpal Sharma score 140 as India made 481 for four declared. England replied with 328 and a century from Graham Gooch. The match ended in a draw         
	 The average age of the Indian XI is 30.73 and South Africas average age is 28.31

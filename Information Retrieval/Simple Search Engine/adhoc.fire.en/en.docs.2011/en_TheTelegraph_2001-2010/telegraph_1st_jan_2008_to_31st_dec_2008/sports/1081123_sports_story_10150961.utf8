The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI move against Lloyd shocks Kapil Dev
                                                                                                                                                                                                       BCCI move against Lloyd shocks Kapil Dev
  - If the ICC does act then, henceforth, it should appoint only yes-men to all positions...             Kapil Dev                           
	Kapil Dev has been shocked and shaken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-authored call to remove Sir Clive Lloyd as chairman of the cricket committee of the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	The BCCI, known to flex its muscles every now and then, has been offended by his comments on the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	For the BCCI, the ICL is a touchy issue and, in the past, hasnt been amused that its relationship (or the lack of it) with the Zee-backed show has been on the ICCs agenda.         
	Speaking at a promotional event in Mumbai this week, Sir Clive hoped the ICL and the officially-sanctioned Indian Premier League would co-exist and that a dialogue would do no harm.         
	Sir Clive was, of course, not there as chairman of a key committee of the ICC. But, then, that hasnt stopped the BCCI from making such an issue.         
	Ive been so shocked and shaken... Cant Lloyd speak his mind? Have people forgotten his stature? Does he need anybodys permission to say anything as an elder statesman of the game? I just cant believe that the BCCI has moved the ICC, Kapil, who heads the ICL board, told The Telegraph.         
	Both Sir Clive and Kapil, incidentally, are World Cup-winning captains.         
	Speaking on Saturday, he added: If the ICC does act then, henceforth, it should appoint only yes-men to all positions... Or get people wholl always stand up and say yes boss... Wahi karna chahiye.         
	Kapil, who too was present at that promotional, said he wouldnt have objected had Sir Clive been critical of the ICL. As an individual, and a cricketing giant at that, Lloyd has the right to say what he wants... Nobody controls him and I certainly wouldnt have questioned him if, for example, hed been critical of the ICL.         
	The ICC, meanwhile, is not saying anything beyond confirming that an email had been received from the BCCI.           LPS

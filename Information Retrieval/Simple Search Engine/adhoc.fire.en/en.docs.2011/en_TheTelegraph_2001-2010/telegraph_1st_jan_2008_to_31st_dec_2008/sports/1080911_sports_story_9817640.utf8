            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The India under-16 team continued their good run in the tour of England when they held fancied Manchester United youth team to a 3-3 draw on Tuesday night.         
	According to information received here, the Indians, who are currently preparing to take part in the final rounds of the Asian under-16 championships in Uzbekistan in October, displayed grit and determination to shoot ahead in the 5th minute through Malswamfela.         
	The home team, however, came back strongly to strike twice but Malswamfela once again hit back in the 51st minute to restore parity for the Indians.         
	Trained by British coach Collin Toal, India scored their last goal a few minutes before the final whistle after Manchester United boys found the target off a spot kick to take a 3-2 lead.         
	Opportunist striker Lalrindika got the goal for the visitors when he made most of a goal-mouth melee.         
	The Indian juniors have been doing well for the past few months, especially after qualifying for the Asian meet. In July, the team went to the US and won six of the seven friendly matches.

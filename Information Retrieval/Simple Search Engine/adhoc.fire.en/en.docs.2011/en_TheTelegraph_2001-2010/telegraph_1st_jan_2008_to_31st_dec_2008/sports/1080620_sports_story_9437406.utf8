                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kirmani: Never thought wed create history
                  Syed Kirmani                     
	New Delhi: Former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, said the dream to hoist the Tricolour at Lords  the Mecca of Cricket  inspired Kapils Devils in the final against the West Indies, the two-time champions.         
	When we left India, we thought reaching the knock out stage would be a great achievement. At that time we never thought of winning the Cup, Kirmani said in the run up to the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the historic triumph.         
	Our dream was to hoist the national flag at Lords. But when we left, we were hardly hoping for that. Luck was on our side though and eventually things changed We wrote the golden chapter in Indias cricketing history.         
	We were the fourth weakest team in the tournament and we never hoped that we would create history, he added.         
	In his 12-year-old illustrious career, Kirmani played 88 Tests and 49 ODI matches. Apart from winning the Cup, he also achieved a personal milestone in the tournament when he scalped three catches and two stumpings in a league encounter against Zimbabwe.         
	In that match, the former India selector also showed his prowess with the bat, scoring 24 runs. Along with captain Kapil Dev, he shared a record ninth-wicket unbeaten stand of 126 runs to pull India out of trouble and register a 31-run victory.         
	On Indias chances in the final against the 1975 and 1979 world champions, he said, we scored 183 runs which were not enough to beat the West Indies  the favourites. Nevertheless, we were not bothered because reaching the final was a great achievement for us. We trusted our skill and eventually changed the wind.         
	Though India made only 183 runs in the final, an inspiring bowling performance by Mohinder Amarnath and Madanlal did wonders as the formidable Caribbean batting line-up collapsed.         
	We won against the West Indies in a league match and this gave us confidence to do our best, said Kirmani, who was adjudged the best wicketkeeper of the tournament, registering 14 dismissals in eight matches.         
	Getting the silver gloves and silver ball from great wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans was an honour for me. I cannot forget that moment ever in my life, he added.         
	Asked about the atmosphere of the dressing room during the final, he said, there was no tension as nobody felt the pressure. Mood was very positive and all the players were enjoying the match.         
	To tell you the truth we had nothing to lose, so we gave our best shot in every match. We were positive which paid dividends for us.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Looking forward to working with Sunny, says Sourav
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Looking forward to working with Sunny, says Sourav
    - Former captain on BCCIs technical committee           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Early days and a first step of sorts, but former India captain Sourav Gangulys nomination to the technical committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is anything but a routine development.         
	Indeed its already widely accepted in cricketing circles that, at some point, Sourav will be pretty actively involved in the BCCI. It could, in a big way, start with his taking over the reins at the Cricket Association of Bengal once Jagmohan Dalmiya brings his second innings to a close.         
	Sourav didnt talk of all that, though, when The Telegraph spoke to him on Thursday.         
	He did, however, have something to say about sitting on the Sunil Sunny Gavaskar-chaired technical committee.         
	Its possible that the BCCI brass took Gavaskar (also a former captain, who admires Sourav) into confidence before extending the invitation.         
	Of course, Im looking forward to working with Sunny... At this moment, though, Im not absolutely clear about what Im expected to do... That should be known during the first meeting...         
	Nobody in the Board could recall an instance of a just-retired cricketer being given a seat on such a key committee.         
	In fact its rare for the BCCI to court independent-minded former cricketers.         
	Asked who approached him, Sourav said: The BCCI secretary (N. Srinivasan)... He called a couple of days ago, but I took some time to convey my acceptance... I agreed after being told that the only travelling Id have to do would be for the meetings.         
	That wont be too often.         
	Sourav declined to straightaway list a priority. Look, let me attend a meeting and be sure about my role... It wouldnt be proper to say anything till Ive shared my thoughts with the other members...         
	The technical committees members include another former captain and present-day chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth, former India opener, selector and manager Chetan Chauhan as also Milind Rege and Dr M.V. Sridhar.         
	As appointments to all committees are made during the AGM, held in September, Sourav has been nominated and (technically) not appointed.         
	Sourav, it may be recalled, had been invited by Board president Shashank Manohar for tea on the morning after his last day as an India cricketer.         
	If that was a nice gesture, in Nagpur last week, getting Sourav on the technical committee has been smart.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Why pick on me, asks SRKShah Rukh Khan
  - I have paid my players to win... Will I pay them now to lose?                               
	Mumbai: Shah Rukh Khan still cannot believe that he had been stopped from entering the dressing room of the team he owns and the actor is sulking, saying that he was singled out for such harsh treatment.         
	The Bollywood superstar, who owns the Kolkata Knight Riders, made it clear on Thursday that he was very upset after being told by an official of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) to stay away from the players.         
	I have paid my players to win. Will I pay them now to lose? This is illogical, an angry Shah Rukh said on the sets of his TV show Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain? at the Film City in Mumbai.         
	The megastar was clearly miffed at being treated as if he were a bookie.         
	The Indian Premier League (IPL) has its set of rules and regulations and I am a law-abiding person. But why pick on me? Other team owners are seen near their players. Is it because I am a celebrity and vulnerable? he asked angrily.         
	[As reported in Thursdays edition of The Telegraph, Shah Rukh had conveyed his feelings on the issue in a lengthy text message to the team members.         
	 I am still trying to understand the code of conduct expected of me at the matches of the IPL ICC Etc After I understand it, I will decide whether to accept it or not Till such time, I will be with you guys at the hotel In the meetings etc., but wont come for the matches So, please dont ever feel it is anything to do with us as a team]         
	The IPL authorities subsequently decided that an owner could stay in the team dugout while four visitors would be allowed to stay for 15 minutes each and they could be there one at a time.         
	The Bollywood badshah was far from happy with the 15-minute allowance.         
	Why should I be given only 15 minutes time with my players? This is unfair, he said.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders owner said the IPL is a domestic tournament and should follow the rules and regulations of the BCCI.         
	Scoffing at reports in a section of the media that he does not get along with captain Sourav Ganguly, Shah Rukh said, reports said that I was kicking chairs. Dont I have any work other than clarifying to the whole world that nothing of this sort has happened?         
	He said the Knight Riders have lost a couple of matches and the boys were down at present but it should not be an opportunity to hatch conspiracy theories.         
	I have learnt that the world loves only winners, he said.         
	The actor said Sourav messaged him thrice requesting a clarification on media reports of the alleged rift between them.         
	My team told me that they have yet to meet a better human being than me. This is a huge compliment, he said.         
	Shah Rukh admitted that his teams losses were hurtful and disturbing.         
	But this is a game and if there is a winner then there has to be a loser too, he said, trashing rumours that he was planning to sell the team.         
	Dont hit someone when he is down. I have seen too many losses and victories in my career including films flopping, running successfully and speculation of not getting along with film fraternity members. This is just one small incident, he said. (PTI)

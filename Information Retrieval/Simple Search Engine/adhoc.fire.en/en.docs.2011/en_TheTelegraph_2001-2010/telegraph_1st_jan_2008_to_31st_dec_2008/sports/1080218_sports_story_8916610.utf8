	Chennai: Armaan Ebrahim finished in the top 10 of a gruelling GP2 Asia Series race in Sentenul, Indonesia, on Sunday. The 18-year-old Ebrahim finished 14.556 seconds behind winner Fairuz Fauzy (Super Nova), who clocked 45:20.990.         
	Karun Chandhok finished 13th, coming in just over five seconds later in 45:25.966. Chandhok had finished on the podium in Dubai last month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | TRI-SERIES FINAL HIGHLIGHTS
                                                                                                                                                                                                     TRI-SERIES FINAL HIGHLIGHTS
                      
	 Saturdays final was the 115th match between India and Pakistan. These teams have played most ODIs against each other. Australia and the West Indies are second with 114 matches         
	 In the final, India fielded their sixth youngest side in ODIs. In the first match, India had fielded their fifth youngest.         
	 Salman Butt registered his fifth century against India, joining three others to have most ODI centuries against India. They are  Nathan Astle (NZ), Sanath Jayasuriya (SL) and Ricky Ponting         
	 The 205-run stand between Salman Butt and Younis Khan equalled Pakistans best for the second wicket against India. In the 1982-83 series, Mohsin Khan and Zaheer Abbas also put on 205 runs in Multan         
	 Piyush Chawla conceded 85 runs during Pakistans innings  the third most by an Indian in ODIs. He holds the dubious record of conceding most runs as an Indian spinner, surpassing Anil Kumbles record of 78 runs in 10 overs against New Zealand in Christchurch in January 1999         
	 Butt (129*) became only the second batsman in ODIs to retire hurt after scoring a century. South Africas Herschelle Gibbs retired hurt on 116, also against India, in Colombo in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy         
	 The two centuries in Pakistans innings (Butt and Younis) provided the 18th instance when two Pakistan batsmen made centuries in the same innings. It equalled Indias tally of 18 such instances  the most in ODIs. However, India have won only 13, while Pakistan have won 15 such matches         
	 The catch of Yuvraj Singh was the 100th dismissal as a wicketkeeper for Kamran Akmal (86ct and 14st)           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday received unexpected words of comfort from Cricket Australia (CA), which said that the violencehit South Asian nation, which is hosting the Champions Trophy, was not the only place in the world of cricket which has security concerns.         
	CA spokesman Peter Young said even though they still have security concerns in sending their players to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in September, security assessments were not Pakistancentric and his board had done such exercises before going to England also.         
	We have had reservations regarding the safety and security in Pakistan but we have that wherever we travel these days.         
	The world is an increasingly uncertain place and we have to make these security assessments even before going to England, Young told an English channel. He denied reports that CA and Australian players association had set any deadline  a fortnights time  to decide whether to play in Champions Trophy. He also said they would first study the report of their security consultant Reg Dickason before taking any decision.         
	We ourselves are making security assessments. We are more interested in the process and about the safety of our players than the actual timings of our decision. (PTI)

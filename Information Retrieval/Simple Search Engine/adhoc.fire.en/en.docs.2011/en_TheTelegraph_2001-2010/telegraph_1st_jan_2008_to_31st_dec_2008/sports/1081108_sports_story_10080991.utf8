The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die tie for Arsenal
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Do-or-die tie for Arsenal
                      
	Manchester: Manchester Uniteds game at Arsenal on Saturday is critical to their chances of retaining the Premier League title, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday.         
	The spotlight has fallen on Arsenal following a run of three games without a win and manager Arsene Wengers complaints about what he perceived as the over-physical approach of Stoke City last weekend, when Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott were added to a lengthy injury list during a shock 2-1 defeat.         
	But with a five-point gap between United and leaders Liverpool and Chelsea, Ferguson is adamant the clash between the two great rivals at the Emirates Stadium is as important to his team as it is to Arsenals attempts to steady the ship.         
	I think its critical for us. Weve got to win our games. Weve got to be consistent between now and the end of the season, Ferguson said.         
	United have their own injury concerns with Wes Brown ruled out for a fortnight with an ankle injury and Darren Fletcher rated 50-50 for Saturdays game because of a knee problem.         
	Wenger is refusing to panic. We want to be guided by the way we want to play football, our spirit and not to go over-board, he said.         
	Another defeat could stretch that gap to nine and see Chelsea, Liverpool and United pulling clear. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Take action against Bhajji, CA to BCCI
                                                   Take action against Bhajji, CA to BCCI
                      
	Melbourne: Harbhajan Singh has denied to have called Matthew Hayden a liar and Adam Gilchrist no saint, but Cricket Australia (CA) is furious on the reported outburst and has asked the BCCI to take action against the off-spinner.         
	I did not make these comments. A lot has been written in the last few days, but I have not said such things, Harbhajan said after a newspaper reported his alleged outburst directing to Hayden and Gilchrist.         
	According to a report, CA has now written a letter to BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, demanding that the board take action on Harbhajan.         
	Enough is enough. Despite assurances that you have instructed him not to fuel this issue any more, Harbhajan continues to say whatever he wants. When will it ever end? Could you please deal with your player in regard to these comments, CA chief executive James Sutherland wrote in the letter.         
	Weve tried over the summer to get the balance right in the way controversial comment has been managed and weve certainly, through our actions with Matthew Hayden, been firm with our own players in terms of where the tipping point is.         
	We believe it is possible to make intelligent, thoughtful and even provocative public comment without descending to personal abuse, Sutherland wrote.           (PTI)

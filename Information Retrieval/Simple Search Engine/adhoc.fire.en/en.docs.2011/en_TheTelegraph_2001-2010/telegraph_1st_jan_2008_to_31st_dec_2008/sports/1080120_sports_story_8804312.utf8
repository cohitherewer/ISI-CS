                                                   Perth win boosts pride, says Kapil Dev

      A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES 
           
	The cricketing fraternity on the subcontinent hailed Indias win over Australia in the third Test in Perth on Saturday, with former batting great Sunil Gavaskar dubbing the performance as one of the greatest in the nations Test history. 
    
	Kapil Dev said it was special since the odds had been heavily stacked against Anil Kumble amp; Co. The following is the reaction from former cricketers from the subcontinent (alphabetically): 
    
	Kapil Dev: It is a great victory, though I consider the team that had beaten Steve Waughs side in Calcutta a greater one. But this win boosts the pride of every Indian because the odds were heavily stacked against India. Any cricketer at world level would not have given India a 10 per cent chance before the match. I congratulate Anil and other members of the team. 
    
	Devang Gandhi: It was one of the best wins for us overseas. All the players lifted themselves after the Sydney controversy. The seniors led the way while the juniors chipped in well. Perth is the toughest venue for any visiting team and a win there is a terrific feat. 
    
	Sunil Gavaskar: To win over here in Perth, this has got to be without doubt the greatest win Indian cricket has had over the last 35-40 years. 
    
	Inzamam-ul Haq: It is a very creditable victory for India because they were beaten badly in the first two Tests. Beating Australia in Perth is a big achievement and the Indian team deserves all praise. But I think the Australians were unnerved by the criticism they came under after the Sydney Test. They were not at their best in this Test The final Test in Adelaide will be a cliff-hanger because the Indians have now smelt blood 
    
	Moin Khan: Its not surprising I think any team with Sehwag, Dravid, Laxman, Tendulkar and Ganguly should do well even in Australia. But their bowlers deserve a lot of credit. 
    
	Ashok Malhotra: India staged a brilliant fightback and they must now be ready for a similar fightback from the Aussies in Adelaide. But I am convinced that the Indians are well prepared for the Aussie attack. 
    
	Javed Miandad: Perth has always been Australias hunting ground and overseas teams rarely win there. In that sense, India did really well. Kumbles captaincy was brilliant and he inspired his boys with his bowling and batting. 
    
	Arun Lal: Its a phenomenal win and Im absolutely overjoyed by it. Its also an emotional day in Indian cricket. Anil Kumbles composure and maturity as the captain also helped Indias cause. No better man than Kumble could have represented India in this Test. 
    
	Rashid Latif: India bowled superbly under pressure against a strong batting line-up Australia missed the experience and confidence of Matthew Hayden. 
    
	Arjuna Ranatunga: The Indian team has a balanced batting and bowling line-up. They showed they have it in them to beat Australia or any other team in the world.

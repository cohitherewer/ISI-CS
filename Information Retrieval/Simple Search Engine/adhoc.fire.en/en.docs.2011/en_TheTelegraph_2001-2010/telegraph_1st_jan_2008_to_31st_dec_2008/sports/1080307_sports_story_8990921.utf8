The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham given hope of 100th cap
                                                     Beckham given hope of 100th cap
                  David Beckham                     
	London: David Beckham will get his 100th England cap as long as he is fit and in form, manager Fabio Capello said on Wednesday.         
	I know Beckham very well from Real Madrid and I hope David will play the 100th game and get that cap, Capello said. He will get his 100th cap if he is fit and in form.         
	Beckham was left out of Capellos first squad for the friendly against Switzerland at Wembley Stadium last month because the MLS was in its close season and the midfielder was not match-fit.         
	Speaking mostly in English on Wednesday, Capello said he or his assistant Franco Baldini would travel to the United States this month to see the 32-year-old former England captain in action for his MLS club Los Angeles Galaxy.         
	Los Angeles play in Dallas on March 14 and Franco or I will go to see him and assess his fitness. He is in contention for France (friendly on March 26). We will check him in Dallas and then we will decide whether he will be fit for that squad, Capello was quoted as saying in British newspapers.         
	Beckham was substituted after 70 minutes of LA Galaxys 0-3 defeat of a local side in Shanghai on Wednesday after sustaining a minor thigh injury. (Agencies)

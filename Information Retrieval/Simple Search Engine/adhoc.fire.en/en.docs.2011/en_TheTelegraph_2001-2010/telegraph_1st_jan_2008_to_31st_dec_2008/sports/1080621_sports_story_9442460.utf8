            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Friday decided to appoint an auditor to look into its Indian Premier League accounts at their working committee meeting after the office bearers came under flak for alleged lack of transparency.         
	The CAB also decided to change the existing format of the P. Sen Trophy cricket tournament. The annual event will now be played in a Twenty20 format . The junior 110 points tournament will no longer be played and will be replaced by an under-14 school meet.         
	The association also rejected the plea of the malis of Eden Gardens to be made direct CAB employees but kept the door open for further dialogue with president Prasun Mukherjee.         
	Kalighat, Eastern Railway, BNR and DKS would also be asked to meet with the CAB to decide how the pending local tournaments could be completed within the June 30 deadline, set in the associations constitution.         
	Meanwhile, NCA director of operations Dav Whatmore will conduct the BCCI Level I coaching course at Eden Gardens from July 8.         
	Thirty aspiring coaches will attend the six-day course.

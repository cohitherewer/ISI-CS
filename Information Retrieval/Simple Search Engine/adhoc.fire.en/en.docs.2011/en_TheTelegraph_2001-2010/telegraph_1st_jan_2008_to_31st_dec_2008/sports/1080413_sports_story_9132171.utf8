            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting is excited about playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League and is eagerly looking forward to the experience. The Australian captain, who will be playing under Sourav Ganguly, feels the tournament will also help mend fences with the Indian players after the acrimonious tour Down Under.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The IPL concept         
	This is a great opportunity for me And for anyone who really knows what to expect from this tournament. At our first training session I could sense the excitement all around. This is a chance to play alongside some pretty exciting players and a good chance for the Indian youngsters.         
	Wary about the reception here after the volatile series Down Under?         
	Im not sure what to expect As a cricketer I always hope I will be well received all around the world. A lot more has been made of the last series than it should have been. After the Sydney Test, the rest of the summer was played in pretty good spirits.         
	Whether IPL will help mend fences between the two teams         
	It certainly will... Some of the guys will be playing for us and some against us. We will get to understand each other better This is one of the most exciting things about this tournament. Its a chance to play alongside some of the guys we have been playing against all along For the young Indians it is also an opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the games best Good fun         
	On Shoaib Akhtars absence         
	In this format of the game he will be badly missed but theres not much we can do about it. Weve got to do the best with the players we have and learn the skills of the Twenty20 game well.         
	If hes relaxed without captaincy         
	Im looking forward to playing without shouldering the responsibility of captaincy. It is a good opportunity to relax and spend some time with the young Indian players. Thats what I will do I am here for the first few games. Its important I give off my best.         
	Playing under Sourav Ganguly         
	Sourav has always done a great job when leading India. Hes been a great player for India for a long time. He has a job in hand here with a mixture of players from all around the world. Its not an easy job, especially with players from different countries. He has to accept the challenge and along with the coach has to make sure we perform to the best of our abilities.         
	If he has spoken to Shah Rukh Khan         
	Not yet I havent had the opportunity having arrived only yesterday. I think the name Knight Riders is terrific We wore black at practice today and it was a bit tough in the sultry conditions But the team jersey of black and gold will be striking as well.         
	On playing alongside Ishant Sharma         
	I wont face him in the nets I would prefer to stay away! He had a terrific tour of Australia Hopefully he can do a great job for our team.

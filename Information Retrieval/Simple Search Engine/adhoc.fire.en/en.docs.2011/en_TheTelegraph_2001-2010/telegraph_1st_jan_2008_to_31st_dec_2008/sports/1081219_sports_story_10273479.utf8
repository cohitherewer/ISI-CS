	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan struck a devastating blow to defending champions East Bengal, defeating them 5-3 (1-1) via a nail-biting tie-breaker to qualify for their seventeenth Federation Cup final on Thursday.         
	They will now lock horns with Dempo SC in the finals on Sunday.         
	After regulation time failed to produce a winner, Jose Ramirez Barreto, Marcos Pereira, Lalkamal Bhowmick, P.C. Lalawmpuiya and Lukram James Singh all scored for the green-and-maroon brigade in the shoot-out. Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee saved Sunil Chetris shot after Parveen Kumar, Mehtab Hossain, and Jayanta Sen had all converted for East Bengal.         
	They thus extended their unbeaten streak against East Bengal to nine games at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Earlier, the city rivals were tied 1-1 after extra time. While a spirited red-and-gold brigade went into the lead with a brilliant Sanju Pradan left-footer in the 61st minute an equally threatening Bagan took another eight minutes to restore parity via a Jose Ramirez Barreto header off a Marcos Pereira free-kick from the left.         
	In what was an electrifying derby, the archrivals started on an aggressive note.         
	Back to back forays, counter attacks, shots hitting the bars, chances squandered, goalkeepers on both ends messing up things and Bhaichung Bhutia trying a sneaky Hand of God summed up the clash of the titans.         
	Sunil Chetri came up with an ambitious attempt with the match only eight minutes old. A well-timed run to meet a loose ball, but the Delhi-boy headed it over the bar.         
	Moments later, it was Mohun Bagan challenging Subrata Paul, who replaced Abhra Mondal in the goal. From left half of the top box a Marcos Pereira free-kick swung in over the wall, and a casual Paul had the ball bounce dangerously in front of goal before hitting the post and going out of play.         
	Five minutes later Suley Musah came up with a long ball from the left for an unmarked Sunil Chetri who managed to release a shot only to witness Sangram pull off a great diving save.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade, equally dangerous on the day bounced back with an Ishfaq Ahmed header off a James Singh corner that too went on to hit the bar before going out of play.         
	However, Bagan at times enjoyed the upper hand, forcing their rivals to commit more men in defence. Musah did a fine job along with Syed Rahim Nabi. But, abrasive football from Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Nirmal Chetri earned them bookings.         
	Goalkeeper Subrata Paul, Nirmal Chetri, Jayanta Sen and Sunil Chetri were all booked.         
	Coach Stanley Rozario after the change of ends, brought in Alvito DCunha for the Nigerian Musah. And Alvito was just on target. Within two minutes the sturdy Goan took the free-kick that swung in and deflected off Rakesh Masih for the opportunistic Sanju Pradhan to shoot it in.         
	But that was not all. Bagan took another eight minutes to come back stronger. Thereafter it was another story of forays and counter forays without any result. However, Ishfaq came close to scoring in the 72nd minute but could do no better than to hit the post with his right footer off a Bhaichung Bhutia cross from the centre.         
	What East Bengal lacked on the day was confidence. It was the thin diving line between the two on the day that saw some lively soccer.

	Linares: Viswanathan Anand drew with Peter Leko of Hungary to maintain his lead after the 12th round of Morelia-Linares chess tournament .         
	Playing white, Anand tried to make a foray with a Ruy Lopez opening but Leko thwarted him. The peace pact helped the Indian to reach 7.5 points .         
	The game of the day was the triumph of Norwegian Magnus Carlsen over Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria.         
	The victory helped Carlsen bridge the gap between him and Anand. With just two rounds remaining Carlsen is just a half point adrift of Anand.         
	Levon Aronian is the only one besides Anand and Carlsen with any realistic chance of winning the title. The Armenian played out a draw against Spaniard Alexei Shirov in 77 moves and moved to 6.5 points.

	Guwahati: Bengal kicked off their National One-dayers with a bang crushing hosts and zonal defending champions Assam by nine wickets at the NF Railway Stadium here.         
	The visitors reached the target of 148 in only 29 over to garner an additional bonus point.         
	With the wicket rendering very little help to the bowlers in the second session, the Bengal opening pair of Anustup Majumdar (47) and Arindam Das (60 not out) shared a partnership of 89 runs before spinner Arlen Konwar found the only breakthrough. Wicketkeeper-batsman Wridhiman Saha remained unbeaten on 24 (2x4, 1x6).         
	Earlier, Assam were restricted to only 147 after the home side elected to bat first on a green top. Experienced Bengal pacer Shib Shankar Paul was quick to make use of the conditions and struck early blows.         
	Paul struck in successive overs to scalp the crucial wickets of openers S. Suresh (8) and Souvik Das (5) while Shiv Shankar Roy ran himself out trying to steal a single to reduce Assam to 15 for three in just four overs.         
	Assam could not overcome the early hitch as skipper Sadagopan Ramesh too was trapped leg before by his Bengal counterpart Lakshmi Ratan Shukla for only four runs. His partnership with the seasoned S. Sharath yielded only 16 runs from 54 balls which could have been at least 15 runs more had the duo been quick in running between the wickets.         
	Allrounder Swarupam Purkayastha, who made his debut with a flambouyant 60 against Orissa at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday, fell to Iresh Saxena for 14.         
	A 51-run unbeaten last wicket partnership between Sharath (80 off 148 balls, 9x4, 1x6) and tailender Krishna Das (14) consolidated the innings after the home side was reduced to 96 for nine in 42.5 overs.         
	Ramesh later admitted that the running between the wickets by the seniors was poor and that the entire side batted poorly.         
	Jolted by the humiliating defeating, the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has held the captain and the coach Sanath Kumar K responsible and hinted at major changes in the squad for the remaining matches against Tripura and Jharkhand.         
	It was a decision of the entire team to bat first on winning the toss. The team wanted to take a chance with the wicket, which unfortunately did not work in our favour, said Ramesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im used to big events, says Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Im used to big events, says Shah Rukh
- A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Bangalore: Its like a release  perhaps even bigger  for Shah Rukh Khan and hes looking forward to what has been billed as a Super Friday, Day I of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Kolkata Knight Riders owner, wholl be here some hours before the first match, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the opener.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His thoughts before match No.1         
	The closer it gets to the IPL release (Laughs) Sorry, Im used to talking in filmi language The closer D-Day is, the lesser my role Its out of my hands now and the focus is where it should be  on the playing field. Ive just got to wear a good shirt, nice jeans Dark glasses Comb my hair well Theres nothing left for me to do anymore, except enjoy myself Id told my office, a while back, that now is the time to do and not talk of whats not been done.         
	Expectations         
	That well win every match.         
	On his approach as the team owner         
	You know, it always happens in life The best of plans never get implemented the way you want them In some ways, it will be so with the Kolkata Knight Riders too, but I intend enjoying myself         
	Whether theres a similarity between this build-up and a release         
	(Pauses) Without sounding strange, lets say Im used to big events But, yes, Id be lying if I said Im very anxious and am biting my nails People in my office, though, have certainly been very anxious Some of them have even been breathing heavy while talking to me Its too late (for second thoughts) Weve jumped into the water and weve got to swim through We wont let ourselves drown.         
	Finally, the difference between owning a cricket team vis-a-vis anything else in his name         
	Ill find out So far, while others have been doing other things, Ive simply been promoting the Kolkata Knight Riders Thats what I usually do for my films I think all those who know about the IPL also know about my team Indeed, Ive popularised it enough I think we were the first to come out with the ad campaign Ive been trying to make sure that the Kolkata Knight Riders is a brand and that the team stands for an ideology Its only now that Ill get to experience first-hand what it feels to be an owner whose team wins/loses.

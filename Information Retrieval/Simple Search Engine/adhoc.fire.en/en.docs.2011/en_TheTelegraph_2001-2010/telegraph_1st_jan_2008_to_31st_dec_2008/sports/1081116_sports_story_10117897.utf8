	Shanghai: Russian Nikolay Davydenko beat an exhausted Andy Murray 7-5, 6-2 to set up a Masters Cup final against world No. 3 Novak Djokovic on Saturday.         
	Briton Murray, who would have won $1.34 million if he had gone through the tournament undefeated, was clearly feeling the effects of Fridays three-hour epic victory over Roger Federer  a match he did not need to win.         
	Davydenko, the world No. 5, took full advantage to reach his first final in four appearances at the season finale and will play against Serbian Djokovic, who earlier beat Frenchman Gilles Simon 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.         
	I was lucky Murray beat Federer yesterday (Friday), said the 27-year-old Davydenko, who would have played Federer in the semis had the Swiss overcome the Scot.         
	Davydenko was well aware that Murrays previous match had finished only 20 hours before they took to the court and attacked immediately, moving the Scot around the court and clinching a break in the first game.         
	The 21-year-old Murray still had enough in the tank to break straight back but the Russian hussled and harried in his customary style to break again for 6-5 and a backhand winner sealed the first set in just over an hour.         
	With Murray now running on empty and getting irritated with his errors, Davydenko stormed to a comfortable victory. He fired 33 winners to the Britons seven over the match and sealed it on his first match point with an ace.         
	Australian Open champion Djokovic made 21 errors in losing the opening set but his nerves settled after an early break in the second and he ground out a win after two hours 50 minutes.         
	Defeat ended a fairytale ride for Simon, who won his ticket to the season finale when world No. 1 Rafael Nadal pulled out injured and then beat defending champion Roger Federer in a round-robin match.         
	I defeated the No. 2, I played three sets in three hours against the No. 3 so thatll give me confidence for next year, said the 23-year-old, who will finish the year as world No. 7.

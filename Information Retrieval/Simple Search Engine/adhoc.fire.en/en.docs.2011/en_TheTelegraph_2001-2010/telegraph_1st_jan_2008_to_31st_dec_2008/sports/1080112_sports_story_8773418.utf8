	Pak ask ICC to change Oval result
 Karachi: Pakistan have asked the ICC to change the official result of the Oval Test against England played in 2006. England were declared winners after Pakistan forfeited the match on the fourth day in protest over umpire Darrell Hair rsquo;s decision to penalise them for alleged ball-tampering. It was the first forfeited result in Test history. ldquo;We have moved the application on the basis of the ICC dropping the ball-tampering charges against our team, rdquo; said an official, who did not want to be named. ldquo;The good thing is that England supported our plea and the matter was discussed at the executive board meeting of the ICC and then referred to the cricket committee for discussion. rdquo;
 
	Malik, Lawson warned
 Karachi: Captain Shoaib Malik and coach Geoff Lawson will have to produce the goods or else step down, PCB chief Nashim Ashraf said on Friday. Malik, who succeeded Inzamam-ul Haq, will be in charge till the end of this year. Lawson was appointed last August on a two-year contract. ldquo;We have to be patient and have given them enough time to produce results. If they don rsquo;t, they will have to go, rdquo; Ashraf said. 
 
	 Fresh doubts
 Sydney: Australia rsquo;s planned tour of Pakistan in March is in doubt again following a suspected suicide bombing in Lahore. Australia is closely monitoring the situation and plans to send an inspection team to Pakistan next month before making a decision on whether to tour. ldquo;We are very concerned about the latest bombing, rdquo; Australia rsquo;s foreign affairs Minister Stephen Smith said on Friday.

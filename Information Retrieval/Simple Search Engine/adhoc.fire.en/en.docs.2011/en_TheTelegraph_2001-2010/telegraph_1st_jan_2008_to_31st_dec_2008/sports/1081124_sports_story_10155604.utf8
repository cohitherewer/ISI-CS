    London: Australian spin legend Shane Warne now claims that he was never scared of Sachin Tendulkar and his 1998 remarks were ldquo;no gospel rdquo;.
  In his recently published book lsquo;Shane Warne rsquo;s Century rsquo;, Warne had named Tendulkar the No. 1 batsman he has played against ahead of West Indian Brian Lara.
    ldquo;He never frightened me. I think I might have said lsquo;I rsquo;m going to have a few nightmares tonight' once and some journalists took it as gospel, but I was never frightened of anyone. And that rsquo;s not me being big-headed, I was just confident in my ability.
    ldquo;Players like (Brian) Lara and Tendulkar were always a challenge, because they were the best in the business and if you want to compete at that level you rsquo;ve got to step up to the mark. Of course some days they rsquo;re going to smash you out of the park and you congratulate them afterwards, but you're going to get them next time, rdquo; he told a British daily.

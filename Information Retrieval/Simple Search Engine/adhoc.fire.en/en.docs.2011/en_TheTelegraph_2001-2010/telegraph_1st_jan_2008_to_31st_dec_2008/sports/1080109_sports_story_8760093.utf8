	Fabio Capello has been so buoyed by the public reaction to his arrival that he believes he has already won the first and most difficult match as England manager.         
	After a weekend watching FA Cup ties at Villa Park and Kenilworth Road, Capello began work at the Football Associations Soho Square headquarters on Sunday by meeting leading officials, notably the Under-21 manager Stuart Pearce.         
	Capello, though, has told friends in Italy that he has been taken aback by the warm welcome he has received from England fans.         
	The great thing is that people have not made me feel like a foreigner, said Capello. In all honesty, I was not expecting a welcome like this. I have won the first match, which for me, is the most difficult.         
	Capellos assistant, Franco Baldini, was also at Soho Square on Sunday, while the other three members of his coaching team will join him at the Carling Cup semi-finals this week. For the goalkeeping coach, Franco Tancredi, it will be a chance to assess the form of Tottenhams Paul Robinson.         
	Capello spent around an hour speaking with Pearce, who is expected to be involved in the new set-up. I had a very good meeting with Stuart Pearce, said Capello. I want to have a close working relationship with him.         
	Capello also spent time discussing arrangements for the fixtures meeting in Zagreb next week which will determine the schedule for Englands 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.         
	David Beckham played under Capello at Real Madrid and admitted that the 61-year-old had the capacity to spread fear among players in a comparable style to Sir Alex Ferguson.         
	He has an aura that players will enjoy, said Beckham. Apart from Sir Alex Ferguson, I have never seen anyone so dedicated to watching football and learning about it. The fear factor is important.

Picture below shows former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram presenting the overall bowler award to Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan in Karachi on Friday.

	Karachi: Sourav Ganguly took centre stage in the inaugural Castrol Asian Cricket Awards, for 2007, which were presented at the Pearl Continental here on Friday afternoon.         
	Owing to father Chandis illness (hes hospitalised in London), Sourav couldnt make it, but wife Dona was present to collect two awards  overall cricketer and overall batsman.         
	A video-recording of Souravs acceptance speech, so to say, was played out and greeted with a round of applause.         
	For the past six months, though, the national selectors have only been considering the former Team India captain for Tests. The awards do mean a lot for Sourav, Dona told The Telegraph.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan also bagged two awards  overall bowler and Test bowler  but Sourav got the biggest one.         
	Ironically, gloveman Kamran Akmal got the award for overall fielder at a time hes out of favour.         
	Three Pakistan-specific awards too were presented, with Hanif Mohammed getting the one for lifetime achievement. Surprisingly, the cricketer of the year award went to captain Shoaib Malik.         
	Speaking at the function, the iconic Hanif said: We learnt to play straight by hanging balls from a tree and hitting them straight back. If we didnt, the balls wouldnt come back to us...         
	Other awardees who spoke on the occasion included (alphabetically):         
	Gautam Gambhir: The T20 format has worked out really well for me... I must thank Virender Sehwag for the runs, as theyve come from the bat he gave me.         
	Fervez Mahroof: I try to keep it simple... Bowl in the right areas and, by doing so, put pressure.         
	Muralidharan: Its getting tougher... The batsmen are getting better and theyre getting to know me better... Weve been working hard and thats the reason for our success.         
	Kumar Sangakkara: When youre in form, you look far more intelligent than you actually are... Weve been pushing ourselves to get better... If you really enjoy what youre doing, then it gets easier.

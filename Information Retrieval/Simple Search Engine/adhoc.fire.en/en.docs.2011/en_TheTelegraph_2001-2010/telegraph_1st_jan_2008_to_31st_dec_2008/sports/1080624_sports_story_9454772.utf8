	Karachi: The International Cricket Council security delegation that recently made a survey of the city as part of their preparations for the Champions Trophy expressed reservations on the safety of the National Bank Complex here. The Indians are slated to practice at the venue.         
	Their reservations were based on the fact that the ground is open and surrounded by residential houses and a high rise shrine which is visited by thousands of people everyday, a source said.         
	The Indians are due to practice at the venue in preparation for their match against Hong Kong in Karachi. (PTI)

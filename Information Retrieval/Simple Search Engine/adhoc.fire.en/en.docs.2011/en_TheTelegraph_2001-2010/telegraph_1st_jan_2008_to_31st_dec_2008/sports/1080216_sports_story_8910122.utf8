	Taylor: Ban on sledging won rsquo;t help  Perth: Questioning the merit of BCCI rsquo;s proposal to ban sledging from international cricket, former Australian skipper Mark Taylor has doubted that it could be a solution to prevent repeat of incidents like the recent racism row during Sydney Test.  ldquo;I have no problems with trying to improve things after the Harbhajan Singh incident in Sydney, but I am not sure that totally banning sledging is the answer, rdquo; he was quoted as saying by the Herald Sun. ldquo;It will be very hard to work out what exactly sledging is. You would have to define it, rdquo; Taylor said reacting to reports that the BCCI would propose to ban sledging at the ICC meeting next week.     
	IPL auction  Calcutta: DLF Indian Premier League (IPL) Friday announced the appointment of Richard Madley, one of the leading auctioneers from UK, to conduct the first ever auction of players for the inaugural edition of the DLF- IPL in Mumbai on Wednesday.     
	CSA apology  Centurion: Cricket South Africa (CSA) President Norman Arendse and CEO Gerald Majola have apologised for their roles in the controversy surrounding team selection for the tour of Bangladesh. ldquo;CSA must take full responsibility for not handling the issue in a manner that preserves the integrity and reputation of the sport, the pair said in a statement.    
	Smith rsquo;s view  Dhaka: The money-spinning Indian Premier League (IPL) could boost cricket around the world but organisers had to ensure there was as little overlap with internationals as possible, said South Africa rsquo;s Graeme Smith. ldquo;Scheduling is obviously going to be the key for the IPL, rdquo; the South African captain told reporters in Dhaka on Friday. ldquo;But you know if it was handled properly, structured right, it can certainly be a benefit to the game. rdquo;    
	Bird ecstatic  London: Legendary umpire Dickie Bird said he ldquo;never dreamed rdquo; of being immortalised in bronze as he unveiled a statue of himself in his home town of Barnsley. The 74-year-old took the wraps off a scale model of a six-foot statue which features him in his trademark flat cap and with upraised finger giving a batsman out, that will stand in Barnsley from October. ldquo;I have umpired at four World Cup finals and I was awarded an MBE (member of the order of the British empire medal) in 1986, but this moment is right up there with those, rdquo; said Bird.    
	Cup live on TV  New Delhi: The ICC U-19 World Cup, scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur from Sunday-March 2, will be telecast live on Star Cricket. The ICC rsquo;s 10 full members, hosts Malaysia and five qualifiers mdash; Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Ireland and Bermuda mdash; will take part in the two-week long tournament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A win for EB, at last 
                                                  A win for EB, at last 
            A STAFF REPORTER             Alvito at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Subrata Pauls excellent show under the bar helped East Bengal snap their eight-match winless streak in the ONGC I-League, surprising leaders Dempo SC 1-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	The East Bengal goalkeeper effected at least five saves from close range, inspiring his teammates to protect Alvito DCunhas goal in the 68th minute.         
	The 13th-round win provided a much-needed lifeline to the relegation-strugglers East Bengal, who remained in ninth place on the 10-team table, only ahead of Salgaocar, but took their tally to 11, just a point behind Viva Kerala and two behind Salgaocar.         
	Dempo still possess the top position with 27 points but their second loss has opened up the title race, with Churchill Brothers and JCT following them one and two points behind, respectively.         
	Fourth-placed Mohun Bagan (21) could have brightened their chances in the changed scenario, but they managed only a goalless draw with Air India at the Cooperage on Sunday.         
	Luck, for a change, favoured East Bengal when Alvito took the free-kick from near the left corner arc after Edmilson earned it for the red-and-gold outfit. Dempo defender Mahesh Gawli, challenged by Dipankar Roy, tried to clear it but the ball deflected off his feet and went in, surprising goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal. Since the own goal concept no longer exists in Indian football, the goal and the Man of the Match were later handed to Alvito.         
	But very few would dispute the fact that more than Alvitos left-foot, the win was possible courtesy the fingertips of Subrata. Such was the excellence shown by India coach Bob Houghtons first-choice keeper on Sunday that Dempos deadly attacking combine of Roberto da Silva Mendes Beto, Ranty Martins and Chidi Edeh became frustration personified when Dempos search for the equaliser was thwarted by Subrata again and again.         
	Drawing strength from his goalkeeper Majek Bolaji  who had to play with a bandage on his head after suffering an injury in the 11th minute  and Anupam Sarkar held up the East Bengal fort with conviction.         
	East Bengal had held Dempo to 2-2 draw in Goa on December 9 in a Round IV match and since then began their slide. Their solitary point over the next eight matches came through a goalless draw with Salgaocar.         
	As new coach Manoranjan Bhattacharya said: We badly needed this win. I hope it is the beginning of a turnaround.

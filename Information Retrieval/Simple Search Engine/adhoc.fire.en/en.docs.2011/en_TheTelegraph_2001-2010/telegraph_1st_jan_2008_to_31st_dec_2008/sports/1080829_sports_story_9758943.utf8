The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Forgotten Serb waits for his hour of glory
                                                                                                                                                                                             Forgotten Serb waits for his hour of glory
    - I feel positive jealousy          KAREN CROUSE                                    
	It is a long lob from Court 11, where Janko Tipsarevic toiled Wednesday at the US Open, and Arthur Ashe Stadium, the main show court reserved later in the afternoon for Tipsarevics fellow Serbs, Jelena Jankovic and Novak Djokovic. Tipsarevic could have been forgiven for feeling as if he needed a spaceship to bridge the distance. Arriving here hoping to gain ground on his high-flying compatriots, Tipsarevic retired with an injury from his first-round match against the wild card Sam Warburg after trailing, 6-2, 1-0.         
	The Serbian invasion of the top three in tennis has turned all the players  Jankovic, 23; Djokovic, 21; and Ivanovic, 20  into rock stars back home. Tipsarevic, 24, pushed Roger Federer to five sets at the Australian Open and upset Andy Roddick, a former world No. 1, at Wimbledon is the Serbs Fab Four version of George Harrison.         
	The emotions that I feel toward my countrymen, Id like to call it positive jealousy, Tipsarevic said. It bugs me that they are 1, 2, 3, and Im still 30, 40. But if the guys I see grow up can make it so high, I know that its difficult, but it can be done.         
	During the player introductions before the first match, the biggest cheers were not for the American, Warburg, who played at Stanford while earning his degree in communications, but for Tipsarevic, the beatnik from Belgrade. I was a little surprised, Tipsarevic said.         
	Tipsarevic, who appears as if he could be the love child of Salma Hayek and Sam Waterston, is a voracious reader who regularly quotes the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. He has a Dostoevsky saying, Beauty will save the world, tattooed on his lower-left arm in Japanese. Why Japanese? Because he finds the languages characters aesthetically pleasing.         
	The 25-year-old Warburg, who is ranked 169th, described Tipsarevic as a flashy player, a charismatic player, Warburg said, Hes a fan favourite here because of his guile and his entertaining ways.         
	Tipsarevics injury kept him from putting on a show. He opened with a double fault, and it was downhill from there. In his first two service games, he played 11 points and got only four first serves in. Warburg had five aces in the first set, which he won in 24 minutes.         
	Serving to start the second, Tipsarevic lost the game at love, then requested medical attention. The trainer arrived a few minutes later, and Tipsarevic did not bother taking his right sneaker off. He knew he was through.         
	It was the second consecutive year his body failed him at the Open. Last year, he retired in the third set of his second-round match against Rafael Nadal because of a torn rib muscle.         
	My first problem is myself, Tipsarevic said. Im not blaming anybody else.         
	After finishing 2007 ranked No. 52, Tipsarevic rose to a career-high No. 33 in May. Id love for my progress to go a little bit faster, he said. Im in my prime. There are no excuses that Im young or something like that.         
	His early exit here notwithstanding, Tipsarevics results in 2008 have helped him level the playing court, if only in his mind.         
	You will have good results, he said, when you see these top players are not as good as you think they are in your head.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

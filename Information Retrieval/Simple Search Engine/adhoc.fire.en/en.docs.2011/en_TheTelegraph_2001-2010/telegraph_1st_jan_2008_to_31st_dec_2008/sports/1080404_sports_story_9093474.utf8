                                                     Shukla: Batting at No. 5 helped
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shukla                           
	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla says the team is not out to prove anything in the National One-dayers. Bengal reached the semi-finals in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday, with Shukla scoring a superb 124 off 95 balls.         
	Theres nothing to prove We have got to admit that we played poorly in the Ranji Trophy. We cannot win back our place in the Super League through our performance in the one-day meet. Only if we perform well, everyone will take notice Shukla told The Telegraph on returning to the city on Thursday.         
	The allrounder felt batting at No.5 helped him play a big innings. This was my second century in the National One-dayers and came after nine seasons. Batting at No. 6 or No. 7 never allowed me to be there for longer periods. At No.5, you always get time to settle down The opportunity to score runs is always more. It reflected in my innings Moreover, a good start by Sreevats (Goswami) and Sourasish (Lahiri) made things easier, he said.         
	Shukla said Sreevats would continue to open with Sourasish in the semis. There was no particular reason to open with Sourasish Just thought the move could pay off and it clicked. Sreevats has also gelled well with the side.

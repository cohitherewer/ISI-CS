The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Humbled Darrell admits to nerves
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Humbled Darrell admits to nerves

	Re-inventing yourself is probably not that difficult, if you have the chameleon tendencies of Madonna, but when you are a hulking 6ft 5in umpire called Darrell Hair, with a large stubborn streak, any proposed changes are likely to be met with a healthy dollop of scepticism.         
	Hair would umpire his first Test match after 20 months when he stands alongside fellow Australian, Simon Taufel, in the second Test between England and New Zealand at Old Trafford on this Friday.         
	Many in Asian countries have been outraged by his return, following his role in Pakistans forfeit of the 2006 Oval Test, with his old nemesis Inzaman-ul-Haq calling it a disgrace. But Hair insists that time in the wilderness has made him, if not a better umpire, then certainly a better person.         
	Ive been involved in an umpire mentoring scheme with the International Cricket Council which has been very satisfying, Hair said.         
	Being a mentor means, you learn a lot yourself. It teaches you how to handle and deal with other people and understand their needs, the experienced umpire said.         
	It was his inability to deal sensibly with an irate Pakistan team at the Oval, 20 months ago, after he had handed them a five-run penalty for suspected ball tampering, and the notorious e-mail offering his resignation, for a price, that followed, which first lead to his removal from the ICCs Elite Umpires Panel.         
	Outwardly confident, and with a previously unflinching belief in his abilities as a decision-maker, the umpire admits that even he could be nervous when the game begins on Friday.         
	We all feel pressure, said Hair. But when youre going out there to officiate a game, the best thing you can do is to get those first few balls out of the way and clear away the butterflies and get on with all those things that work for you.         
	I think the decision-making ability is still there, the only thing that could change, that is a lack of confidence because I havent done a Test match recently, Hair added.         
	But provided I get the right processes and triggers into place, Im confident Ill be able to make the majority of correct decisions. But at the very moment I feel confident in my abilities and the fact that I can do it.

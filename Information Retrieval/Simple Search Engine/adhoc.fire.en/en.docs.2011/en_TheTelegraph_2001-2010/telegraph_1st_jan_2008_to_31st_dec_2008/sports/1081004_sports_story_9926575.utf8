	New Delhi: The top-seeded pair of Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy won their sixth match on the trot to advance to the semi-finals of the $869000 Japan Open in Tokyo Friday.         
	The Indo-Czech pair overcame a late challenge from Philipp Petzschner of Germany and Alexander Peya of Austria 6-2, 7-6(4) in one hour and eight minutes in the quarter final of the hard court event.         
	The Thailand Open winners next face Robert Kendrick of America and Jarkko Nieminen of Finland in the last-four stage.         
	In the quarter final, Paes and Dlouhy broke their rivals twice and saved two breakpoints on their own serve to run away with the first set.         
	The second set saw a furious fight in which both the teams got one break each and ultimately the top-seeded pair held their nerves in the tie-breaker to seal the match in their favour.

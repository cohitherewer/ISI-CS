	Dubai: Uncertainty over detained Pakistani pacer Mohammed Asifs fate lingers as the Dubai Court, before which he appeared on Sunday, adjourned soon after hearing recommendations of the prosecutors.         
	Asif on Sunday appeared before the court along with his lawyers and recommendations from the prosecutors were also heard before the proceedings were adjourned.         
	Senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Nadeem Akram, rushed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to bail out the pacer, said that the court had heard the recommendations of the prosecutors who have forwarded the case to the attorney general of Dubai.         
	The chief prosecutor cross-examined the witnesses who were instrumental in finding the banned substance from the bowler. The court case will resume tomorrow, Akram said, hoping that the final decision would come out on Monday.

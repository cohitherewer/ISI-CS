	ANECDOTS  
	Longevity  
	After nine hours, the final of the light-heavyweight greco-roman wrestling competition was a draw. The Swede, Anders Ahlgren, and the Finn, Ivar Boehling, were both awarded a silver medal instead of gold. In the semi-final, the contest between Estonian Martin Klein and Finlands Alfred Asikainen continued for 11 hours  a contest recorded as the longest in Olympic history. Each wrestler stopped every 30 minutes for a rest and Klein, who was the eventual winner, was so tired that he declined to take part in the final.         
	Tragedies         
	Portugals Francisco Lazaro fell prey to the rigours of the marathon at the 30km mark. Taken to hospital, he died the next day. Lazaro was the first of two athletes to die during the history of the Olympics  in 1960 the Dane Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed during the cycling event. He died a few days later.         
	Secret competitor         
	The literature category in the art event was won by MM Georg Ohrod et Eschbach. The text, written in French and German, won over the jury who found to their amazement that its author was none other than Pierre de Coubertin. The father of the Olympic Games, over the moon with the result, thus found himself among Olympic champions.  
	EXPLOITS  
	The Flying Finn         
	Even if he became less well-known than compatriot Paavo Nurmi, the Finn Hannes Kolehmainen created his niche in Olympic history with a tally of four gold medals, three of which were obtained in middle distance events during the Stockholm Games in 1912.         
	The Finnish athlete achieved these spectacular results following an innovative and professional period of training (notably, with help from a psychologist) which would not have been possible without the financial help of his brother, a professional athlete in the US.         
	Epic duel         
	Some 48 hours later, he recorded a time of 15:34.6 in the preliminary rounds of the 5000m, but was not as quick as Frances Jean Bouin who succeeded in recording a new Olympic record with a time of 15:05.         
	On July 10, the anticipated final of the 5000m turned out to produce one of the epic duels of the Olympic Games (both runners passed each other a total of 16 times).         
	Twenty-five metres from the finish line, the Finn, encouraged by the public, made a move which the Marseille athlete was unable to counter, and Kolehmainen won his second gold medal. In doing so, he became the youngest world record-holder of the 5000m (14:36.6).  
	SUMMARY  
	A relative success         
	The 1912 Games in Stockholm were by comparison to the first faltering steps of the previous events, a relative success.         
	This was mainly because of a number of welcome changes. For the first time, athletes from five continents took part in the Games and the events took place over what was a shorter period of just over two months.         
	The Games were also independent in that they were no mere appendage to a larger event or commercial exposition.         
	Duke crawls to gold         
	Hawaian swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, also widely acknowledged for the popularisation of surfing, eased toward the 100m freestyle gold with his innovation, the front crawl style.         
	American sprinter Ralph Craig romped to a double gold in the 100m and 200m events and his compatriot Jim Thorpe won the pentathlon and the decathlon.         
	Thorpe however was later accused of professionalism and was both stripped of his medals and black listed. It was not until 1982 that he was posthumously re-instated.         
	Several events featured for the last time, the long and high jump without run up and the two-handed hammer and discuss for example, while boxing, banned in Sweden at the time, was temporarily sidelined.         
	The Games were a great success for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its founder Pierre de Coubertin.         
	However, many were saddened by the death of Portuguese runner Francisco Lazaro, who collapsed during the race due to heat exhaustion.

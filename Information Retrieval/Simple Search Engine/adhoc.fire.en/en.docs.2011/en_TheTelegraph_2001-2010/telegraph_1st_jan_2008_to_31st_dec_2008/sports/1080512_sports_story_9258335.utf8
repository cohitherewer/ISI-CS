	London: Manchester United retained the Premier League title on Sunday when they won 2-0 at Wigan Athletic and Chelsea were held 1-1 at home by Bolton Wanderers.         
	It was the old and new faces of United who combined to secure the victory as Cristiano Ronaldo put them on their way with a 33rd-minute penalty and Ryan Giggs, on the day he equalled Bobby Charltons club record 758th appearance, completed the win 10 minutes from time.         
	United ended the season on 87 points, two clear of Chelsea, who were leading through Andriy Shevchenko until Bolton grabbed an injury-time equaliser.         
	It was Uniteds 10th Premier League title and 17th championship in all  one short of Liverpools record  and they will now go for a domestic and European double when they face Chelsea in the Champions League final on May 21.                   Wayne Rooney with the bubbly on Sunday      
	Everton qualified for the Uefa Cup after their 3-1 home victory over Newcastle United secured fifth place.         
	Birmingham City and Reading joined Derby County in being relegated after Fulham won 1-0 at Portsmouth to complete an unlikely escape.         
	There was also a remarkable game at Middlesbrough where the home side hammered Manchester City 8-1, helped by a hattrick from Afonso Alves, in a mid-table duel.         
	There was nothing mid-table about the two main events as United and Chelsea began the day locked together on 84 points.         
	The first breakthrough came when Wigans Emmerson Boyce tripped Wayne Rooney in the box and Ronaldo calmly sent the keeper the wrong way from the spot.         
	It was the Portuguese wingers 41st goal of the season for United and 31st in the league.         
	United had further reason to thank the referee soon after when he opted not to show Paul Scholes a second yellow card for a body check that could easily have ended his involvement.                   
	In London, Chelsea suffered an early setback when captain John Terry suffered a dislocated elbow after a collision with his own goalkeeper Petr Cech. Though he was taken to hospital, the defender said he hoped to be fit for the Champions League final.         
	After struggling for impact in the first half, Chelsea improved after the break and Shevchenkobundled them into the lead after 62 minutes.         
	With Uniteds goal difference far superior the title was still heading back to Old Trafford though and they made certain of it when Giggs, on as a 68th-minute substitute, tucked in the second.         
	That ended the race but Boltons late equaliser at Stamford Bridge gave United clear water in the standings.         
	Alex Ferguson later said: It was a tough one alright. We had some nervous moments and when it started to rain anything can happen on the greasy surface. Then our oldest player, Ryan Giggs, 10 medals, comes on and scores, fantastic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor first round by Chopra
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Poor first round by Chopra
                      
	Dallas: The extremely windy conditions had Daniel Chopra in all sorts of trouble and the Swede of Indian origin found himself way down the leaderboard at tied 104th after a poor opening round of four-over 74 in the $6.4 million Byron Nelson Championship.         
	Playing his back nine first, Chopra dropped first of his five bogeys on the 11th but managed to stay level par, courtesy the 13th hole birdie. But he dropped four more shots to slump down the chart.         
	Australian Mathew Goggin fired three-under 67 to join Ryan Moore and Eric Axley in the lead. (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra has penned a book on rifle shooting.         
	I wanted to give something back to the game, the 25-year-old shooter told The Telegraph on Saturday. I hope young people will feel encouraged to take up shooting after reading the book.         
	The book, named Ways of the Rifle, has been co-authored by his German coach Gabriele Buhlmann and technical trainer, Heinz Reinkemeier.         
	There are books on cricket, football and several other disciplines in India but not on shooting. So, I decided to share my experience with the people who are interested in the sport, Bindra said.         
	The 250-page book, yet to hit the stands, is a detailed documentation on technique, skills and coaching of rifle shooting.         
	The Chandigarh-based shooter said he was not sure when he would return to serious shooting again. Thats a question I cannot answer at the moment, he said. I have done well in the Olympics It would take some time to recoup. I am still going through that process So it is hard to say when I will start training again.         
	Buhlmann, who was present alongside Bindra, supported her ward and said it should be minimum six months before the ace-shooter returns to training.         
	Bindra said that though cricket is Indias most popular sport, shooting has become the face of Indian sports in the last few years.         
	Globally people know that Indians are becoming a formidable force in shooting. The sport is fast catching up in India, Bindra said.

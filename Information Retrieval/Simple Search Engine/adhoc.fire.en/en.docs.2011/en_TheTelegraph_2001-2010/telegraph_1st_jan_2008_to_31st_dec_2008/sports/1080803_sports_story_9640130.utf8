	Cincinnati: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy put up a valiant fight before bowing out of the $2,615,000 Cincinnati Masters. The sixth-seeded Indo-Czech pair plunged to a 6-7 (6-8), 6-7 (5-7) defeat against the second- seeded pair of Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia in the quarter finals after a one and a half-hour battle.    
	Both the pairs were engaged in an engrossing battle, unwilling to concede even an inch. The first set floated five breakpoints  two for Paes and Dlouhy, three for their opponents  but both the pairs were successful in saving them. In the second set, both pairs dropped their serve once before the tie-breaker in which the second seeds prevailed to advance to the next stage.         
	Cincinnati: Rafael Nadal marked an historic changing of the guard in tennis with a quarter final win at the Cincinnati Masters, ensuring Roger Federers fall from the summit after more than four years.    
	The patient Spaniard guaranteed he will claim the world no.1 ranking this month with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 victory over Ecuadors Nicolas Lapentti on Friday.    
	By reaching the semi-finals, Nadal is assured of overtaking Federer on August 18 at the latest.

	Humpy was joint fifth with three others  Pia Cramling of Sweden, Nataliya Pogonina of Russia and Muzychuk  with two points in the eight-player round-robin event.    
	Bulgarias Antoaneta Stefanova remained in sole lead.        
	Budapest: Formula Ones majority shareholder said on Saturday it doesnt intend to replace F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone despite FIA president Max Mosley describing his age as an impediment to the future of the sport.    
	Mosley, who has been FIA president since 1994, said on Saturday that CVC Capital Investment could be tempted to sell by a large offer and that should mean the end for Ecclestone.    
	There are no plans to replace Bernie Ecclestone, the chief of Formula One Management, of which CVC is the principal shareholder, said. It also said it had no plans to sell its 75-percent stake in F1.

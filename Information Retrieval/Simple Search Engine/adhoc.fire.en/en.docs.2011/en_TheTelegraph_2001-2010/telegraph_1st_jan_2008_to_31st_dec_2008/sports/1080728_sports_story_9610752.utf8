The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A furious Kumble scolds players
                                                                                                                                                                                                       A furious Kumble scolds players
    - Senior-most pro sachin tendulkar tells team comeback is possible           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble                                 
	Colombo: A furious Anil Kumble, the Team India Test captain, is understood to have given his players a tongue-lashing after Saturdays humiliation at the Sinhalese Sports Club.         
	Kumble really scolded the players... He was very angry, somebody who was present in the room told The Telegraph on Sunday morning, before the teams departure for Galle.         
	That Kumble hadnt taken the defeat well  actually, no captain could have  became obvious within minutes when he switched off a TV set (the first Tests highlights were being shown) while walking to the media conference.         
	According to the source, coach Gary Kirsten and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar also spoke at that team meeting.         
	Kirsten talked in a restrained manner, advising the players to quickly forget the disaster... That the defeat shouldnt be unnecessary baggage while moving forward, the source said.         
	Sachin, one learns, sought to lift morale by saying comebacks had been made in the past and that a comeback would again be made. Basically, that the shoulders shouldnt droop between now and the second Test, in Galle, from Thursday.         
	Its a three-Test series.         
	Meanwhile, the two selectors whore in Sri Lanka, Venkatapathi Raju and Sanjay Jagdale, declined to comment on Indias third biggest defeat.         
	Incidentally, theyre not part of the tour selection committee. Were here only as observers, Jagdale explained.         
	Footnote: Kumble and his men reached Galle (by coach) around 4 pm and were greeted by rain. As a venue, the Indians dont have happy memories  on the last full tour, seven years ago, the hosts won the Test there by 10 wickets.

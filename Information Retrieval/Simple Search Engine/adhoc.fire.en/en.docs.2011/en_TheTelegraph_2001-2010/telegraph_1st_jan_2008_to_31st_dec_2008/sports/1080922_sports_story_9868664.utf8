                                                                                                                                                                                                       Karim: It will be competitive
            A STAFF REPORTER            Karim Bencharifa                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa on Sunday said the forthcoming I-League is going to be very competitive and there are at least five to six contenders who can win the most prestigious tournament in the country.         
	The Moroccan also exuded confidence in his team and said he believed the boys can bring the I-League glory.         
	Apart from his side, Bencharifa picked Churchill Brothers (the squad he coached in the previous edition of the I-League), Dempo and East Bengal as the other favourites for the tournament .         
	There are at least five to six contenders for the I-League. Churchill (Brothers) have managed to hold their players. They just need proper guidance. Dempo are also a very consistent side. East Bengal are a quality team The league is going to be very competitive, the Mohun Bagan coach told The Telegraph.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade, who won the Calcutta Football Leagues Premier Division title by a solitary point, would end their conditioning camp after practice on Tuesday morning. They take on Mumbai FC in their opening match on Saturday at Barasat Stadium.         
	The coach also said that his main aim in the conditioning camp was to make sure that the team gelled together.         
	We did swimming and various other things barring practice. Its going well. I am focussing to build them as a unit I want the boys to have their full focus on the upcoming tournament, he quipped.         
	Asked about his teams chances, Bencharifa said the local league champions had the right balance to win the tournament.         
	I have no doubt about my boys They can bring the I-League glory. We have experience and leadership There is quality pace upfront and height at the back. The addition of Bhaichung (Bhutia) will also add to our goal-scoring abilities, he said.         
	Bhaichung has shown his worth in international matches. His inclusion is going to boost our forward line.         
	Bencharifa, who had to be content with the runners-up spot with the Churchill Brothers in the last version of the I-League, also wanted to give credit to his boys for the CFL win. The credit for whatever we achieved this season goes to the players. They sacrifice a lot during training everyday Im only here to guide them, he said.         
	The Bagan coach said his team would aim to control matches rather than play good football.         
	Im a realistic person. We have to get points Good football is linked with controlling the game. If you can control a game, the football also looks good and points will also come, he said.         
	Asked if he was aware of last seasons debacle when the green-and-maroon brigade had clinched the local league title but were unable to maintain the momentum, finishing fourth in the 2007 I-League, the coach said: Every year is a new year. Many players in this team were also involved last season. Hopefully it wont be repeated.

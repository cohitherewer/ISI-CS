	Hyderabad: The top order wobbled again but skipper S. Badrinath led with example and hit a sedate unbeaten 69 to fashion India As comprehensive five-wicket win against New Zealand A in the tri-series tournament here on Wednesday.         
	After Badrinath asked the visitors to bat, Piyush Chawla (3-43) and Praveen Kumar (2-17) shared five wickets between them to shoot out the Kiwis for 167 with Neil Broom, Peter Fulton and Grant Elliot making useful contributions.         
	Chasing a meagre target, the Indians could not settle down as the top order continued its slipshod show before Badrinath and in-form Yusuf Pathan (34 not out) put their foot down.           (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Shane Warne                           
	Calcutta: Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne wants to win Tuesdays IPL encounter against Kolkata Knight Riders for the blast-affected people of Jaipur. The leg-spinner also stressed on the need to maintain the winning momentum.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The game plan for Tuesdays match?         
	We plan our game before each match... There were specific plans for each team and there is also one in place for tomorrows match. There are plans for batting, bowling and fielding but the application has to be done perfectly at the ground Above all, we want to play good cricket. Its a must win match for the Knight Riders, so we need to be alert I feel it will be a tough fight. We would like to keep the winning momentum going         
	On Knight Riders performance so far         
	They are a dangerous team A very good outfit but they are inconsistent. They have a good batting line-up with a solid middle order. The bowling with Shoaib Akhtar and youngsters like Ishant and Dinda also looks good.         
	The Eden wicket         
	It seems the wicket will help the spinners But if we manage to win the toss we would like to bat first And we would like to play an extra batsman         
	Playing in front of a full house         
	Its great to play here Its just like our MCG         
	On the use of technology in modern sport         
	We at Rajasthan Royals dont believe in using computers. We keep it in our brains. Thats attitude for me         
	On captaincy         
	I enjoy captaincy. I have led Victoria, Hampshire, Australia in a couple of ODIs, and now the Rajasthan Royals In our team we create an environment in which everybody, from Dinesh Salunke to Graeme Smith can voice their opinions. I take the final call.         
	On Jaipur blasts and the security         
	I feel sorry for the Jaipur people. I have no security problems here and am really enjoying my stay in India. I want to win tomorrows match and win it for the Jaipur people         
	The spat with Sourav Ganguly in the first leg tie in Jaipur         
	I share a good rapport with Sourav There are no personal problems But what I have said are facts and I stand by what I have said Hope this never happens again.

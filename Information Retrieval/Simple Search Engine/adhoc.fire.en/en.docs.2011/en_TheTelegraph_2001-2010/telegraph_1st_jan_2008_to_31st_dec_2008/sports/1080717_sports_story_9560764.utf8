The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security issue on ICC agenda
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Security issue on ICC agenda
                      
	Karachi: Unhappy with the tardy implementation of security blueprint for the Champions Trophy by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the International Cricket Council (ICC) has called for an emergency meeting in Dubai on Sunday.         
	Reliable sources said that the ICC has called the meeting following reservations expressed by its security consultants on the security arrangements for the mega event in September, though the PCB described it as just a scheduled meeting to take stock of security measures being implemented so far.         
	The ICC security consultants are not happy with the implementation of the security plan for the tournament ... That is the main reason why this meeting has been called, a well-placed source said. The source also said that Pakistan has been tardy in implementing the security plans chalked out for the Champions Trophy.         
	Even for the Asia Cup, it was on the recommendation of these ICC security consultants that private experts were hired to go and constantly monitor the Asia Cup to see if their recommendations were implemented properly, said the source.         
	PCB chief operating officer Shafqat Naghmi, however, denied that it was emergency meeting and there was no threat on Pakistan hosting the mega tournament. It is not an emergency meeting ... Its a scheduled one and we remain confident that the Champions Trophy will not be relocated to any other country, Naghmi said. Basically the meeting has been convened to review the security arrangements we made for the Asia Cup and it will also go through the reports of the ICC security consultants who monitored the Asia Cup, he added.         
	Naghmi also said he was not concerned with reports of England having jumped into the fray as alternate venue if the Champions Trophy is relocated from Pakistan.         
	Look we are not bothered by what is being reported in the media. We know that the ICC has not indicated to us that the tournament would not be held in Pakistan and, secondly, the ICC secretariat in Lahore is also working as per schedule and making all preparations for the event, Naghmi stated.         
	Sources said the ICC hierarchy was also well aware of the potentially negative fall out of any decision to shift the tournament from Pakistan so late. The ICC and some of the member countries realise any decision to shift the tournament would do damage to Pakistan cricket but at the same time there are members who are insisting that no chance should be taken on the security of the players and officials in the tournament, a source stated.         
	Remember, Pakistan is also due to host the 2011 World Cup jointly with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Dont be surprised if some compromise solution is worked out at Sundays meeting for the Champions Trophy, the source said.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali with Mike Okoro during practice at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will be missing both their deadly foreign strikers  Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday  when they face Dempo SC in their Round IX ONGC I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.         
	While the Liberian Sunday is down with an injured calf-muscle, the Ghanaian striker, it has been learnt, has a torn hamstring.         
	The other foreigner, medio Adewusi Adebayo will therefore have some added responsibilities on a day when the city team can hardly afford a slip-up.         
	Both Okoro and Sunday however, attended the clubs practice on Wednesday at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.         
	While Sunday chose to relax on the sidelines after a brief warm-up session, Okoro did some stretches and participated in the dummy set-piece moves scripted by coach Shabbir Ali.         
	I have a terrible pain in my calf muscle. In the morning it was okay But now its killing me, Sunday said at the Rabindra Sarobar.         
	This is a serious problem Mike was complaining in the morning I never thought of missing Mike But after the test Mike was detected with a torn hamstring I cannot risk him for the rest of the matches, Shabbir Ali said on Wednesday evening.         
	In that case, Goutam Thakur along with Vimal Pariyar are likely to operate from the front. Jyoti Kumar and Satyajit Bose could also be Shabbirs options upfront. The final XI will be decided on Thursday morning.         
	The mid-field will be have the Nigerian Adebayo, along with Farooq Hyder, Sovan Chakraborty and Prasanta Chakraborty.         
	Madhab Das and comeback man Sheikh Azim along with Gurpreet Singh and Anit Ghosh will be guarding the Mohammedan Sporting citadel.         
	Meanwhile, Dempo SC coach, Armando Colaco will miss forward Iyomi Mboyo. He however, will have the services of big names like Ranty Martins, Joaquim Abranches and Anthony Pereira upfront and Clifford Miranda, Climax Lawrance, Peter Carvalho and Rob erto Mendes Silva in the midfield.         
	Besides, a strong defence with Samir Naik, Valeriano Rebello, John Dias and Mahesh Gawli will be at his disposal. We want to bag three points We had a bad start to the league, but there is no reason why we cannot turn things around , coach Colaco said.         
	The Goans are ranked seventh with 11 points from eight matches while their Thursday opponents are on the ninth position with nine points from equal number of ties.

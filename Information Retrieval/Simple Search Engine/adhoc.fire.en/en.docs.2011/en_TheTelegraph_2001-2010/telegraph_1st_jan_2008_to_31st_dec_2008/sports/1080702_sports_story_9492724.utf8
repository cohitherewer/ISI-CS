	London: Leander Paes and his partner Lukas Dlouhy pulled off an impressive straight set win over third seeds Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich to book a semi-final berth in the mens doubles event at Wimbledon Championships here Tuesday.         
	The ninth seeded Indo-Czech pair took one hour and 46 minutes to outplay the Israeli duo 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in the quarter final.         
	Conversion of breakpoints made the difference between the two teams with Paes and Dlouhy converting four out of the six that came their way while their opponents squandered all eight points.         
	In womens doubles, Sania Mirza and Bethanie Mattek set up a quarter final clash with American sisters Venus and Serena Williams after getting past the Uzbek-Belarussian pair of Akgul Amanmuradova and Darya Kustova in the third round.         
	The 13th seeded Indian-American pair was leading 4-6, 6-4, 2-0 when their opponents forfeited the match.         
	The Williams, seeded 11th and both of whom are already in the singles quarters, swept aside the fifth seeded Spanish pair of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-1, 6-4 in their third round match.         
	Sania has reached Wimbledon doubles quarters for the first time. The best that she had managed before this win was a third-round appearance last year, when she had teamed up with Israeli Sahar Peer.

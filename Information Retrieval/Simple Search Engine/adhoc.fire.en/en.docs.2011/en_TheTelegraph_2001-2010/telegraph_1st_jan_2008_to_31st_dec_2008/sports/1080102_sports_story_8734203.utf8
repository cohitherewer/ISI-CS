                                                   Hewitt storms into Round II

           
	Adelaide: Lleyton Hewitt opened 2008 in convincing fashion on Tuesday as he cruised past Israeli Dudi Sela 6-2, 6-2 in the Round I of the Adelaide International. 
    
	The top-seeded Australian, who won the first title of his career in Adelaide ten years ago, needed just 65 minutes to record his opening win of the new season. 
    
	Former Wimbledon and US Open champion Hewitt has been working hard over the past two months under the tutelage of his new coach Tony Roche and he was far too good for Sela, the world No. 64. 
    
	On a day when temperatures were just under 40 degrees Celsius, Hewitt produced an impressive performance as he set up a clash with Argentine Jose Acasuso or Alejandro Falla of Colombia. 
    
	Second-seed Paul-Henri Mathieu beat fellow Frenchman Julien Benneteau 7-6, 7-5 in a first-round match that lasted two hours, 22 minutes.

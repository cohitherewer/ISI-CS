The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rungta: It will be healthy for cricket in India Dhoni
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rungta: It will be healthy for cricket in India
  - Dhonis comment on live telecast of meetings pleases former selector       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Dhoni                            
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hasnt reacted to Mahendra Singh Dhonis we might as well have the whole (selection) meeting telecast live comment, made last Saturday, but the captain actually only repeated what Kishan Rungta had said way back in the summer of 1997.         
	Rungta, then Centrals man on the selection committee, had (on May 31 of that year) told The Telegraph: If proceedings can be telecast live from Parliament, something not even thought of till recently, I see no reason why selection meetings cant be accorded similar treatment.         
	Speaking from Mumbai, exactly a week after Dhoni raised the issue in Bangalore, Rungta said: The point I made then holds good now too I cant understand why a selection meeting has to be held behind closed doors Why should the deliberations be such a secret?         
	Rungta added: Bringing about transparency via a live telecast would, in my opinion, be healthy for Indian cricket Its important for players to know what the selectors and the two co-opted members (captain, coach) of the committee think about them Indeed, its important for players to know where they stand Im glad that Dhoni thinks on similar lines.         
	Dhoni, of course, had spoken out of anger  upset that the media got to know of his differences with the selectors over Rudra Pratap Singhs omission from the Team India XV.         
	While Rungta didnt make a written suggestion, he did verbally convey the live telecast bit to the-then BCCI secretary, Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	Nothing happened From what I remember, Mr Dalmiya felt telecasting live would become controversial Id be happy if the present dispensation takes steps in that direction, Rungta signed off.         
	Significantly, two former selectors are office-bearers of the BCCI and one of them endorsed Rungtas view. However, he did so in his private capacity and didnt wish to be quoted.         
	No selection meeting anywhere is telecast live, at least not in cricket, but whats the harm in setting a precedent?

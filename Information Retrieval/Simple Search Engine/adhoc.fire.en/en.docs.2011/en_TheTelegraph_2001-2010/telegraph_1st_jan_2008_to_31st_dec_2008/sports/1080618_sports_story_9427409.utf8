            A STAFF REPORTER            Sreesanth                           
	Calcutta: Sreesanth will miss the Asia Cup in Pakistan after failing to recover from the injury that ruled him out of the tri-series in Dhaka. The pacer, who is suffering from a left side strain, has been advised another two weeks rest.         
	According to physio Paul Close at the NCA, Sreesanth hasnt yet recovered from the injury. His bowling rehabilitation programme will start on Monday and requires further two weeks before full recovery, Board secretary Niranjan Shah said.         
	Sreesanth suffered the injury during Kings XI Punjabs last IPL league game against Rajasthan Royals in Mohali on May 28.         
	It is learnt that Manpreet Singh Gony, who was included in place of Sreesanth for the Dhaka tournament, will accompany the side to Pakistan as well. A formal announcement will be made later.         
	Meanwhile, Arindam Ganguly, the Tripura Cricket Association secretary, will continue as Team India manager for the Asia Cup. Ganguly was manager on the just concluded tri-series in Dhaka where India lost the final to Pakistan.         
	The Board decided to retain Ganguly as manager for the Asia Cup for the sake of continuity. The tournament begins on Tuesday.

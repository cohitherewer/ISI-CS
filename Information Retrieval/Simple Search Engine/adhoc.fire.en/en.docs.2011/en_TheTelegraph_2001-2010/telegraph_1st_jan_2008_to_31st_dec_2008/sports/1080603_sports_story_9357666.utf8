The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soccer is the next target
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Soccer is the next target
            [+uc('Nick Hoult   THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]                      
	Ambitious plans are being drawn up for the Indian Premier League (IPL) to extend their sporting interests beyond cricket as the franchise owners look to cash in on the popularity of football on the subcontinent.         
	Englishman Tim Wright starts work Monday as the new chief executive of the Deccan Chargers, the Hyderabad team that finished bottom of the inaugural IPL. Wright has spent the past five months working closely with the IPL in his role as senior vice-president for sports marketing firm IMG, and starts his new job with a brief to tap into Indias ravenous desire for top-level sporting action.         
	A top-four Premier League club have already held talks and could be the first English team to play in India. Chelsea have spent the past few months building up contacts in the subcontinent, but Wright is also a keen Manchester United fan and is aware of the value of a one-off appearance in India by the worlds biggest club.         
	With the dynamism of this economy, which could pretty much double over the next seven to eight years and the fact we have 450 million Indians under the age of 25, who have a huge demand for sport, the opportunities for the Deccan Chargers, and other franchises, are big as ones imagination, Wright said.         
	There is great interest in the Premier League and we have already been offered a top-four Premier League side. We have to look at something like that. In Calcutta last week Bayern Munich played against Mohun Bagan and there were 120,000 people at the game.         
	If a match against United gets off the ground, the Chargers will look into creating their own football team, one made up of recently retired players. The prospect of a team of travelling All Stars, made up of the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is being explored.         
	On the cricket front the Chargers, like all of the eight franchises, are keen to play matches in England and sign England players for the second IPL season. Away from headline names like Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff, players such as Stuart Broad and Monty Panesar could be in demand.         
	I love Panesar, said Wright. But the way to judge whether a player should be in our team is if he will bowl four tidy overs and take wickets. If the team management feel he is, then fantastic. But will we sign players just because they have marketing value in India? No.         
	The prospect of IPL franchises becoming full-time teams is real, with matches likely to take place this year in England, the United States, the Middle East and Canada.         
	The IPL was put together in a matter of weeks and the time to judge its success will be next year, when the organisers have had time to draw up long-term marketing strategies. But the potential is huge in a country that revels in any sporting success.         
	For the franchise owners, the vast sums paid at the outset look to be savvy investments. Contrary to what you may think, our objectives in the first season have been more than matched in terms of acquisition of the franchises, said Vijay Mallya, who paid $111.6million (56.4million) for the Bangalore Royal Challengers. The exposure we have generated in this tournament for ourselves has been remarkable.         
	That is due to the vast television audiences. Independent ratings show that a staggering 99 million watched the IPL group games. But the fear for the IPLs future is that a nation which has embraced Twenty20 so quickly could fall out of love with it just as fast.

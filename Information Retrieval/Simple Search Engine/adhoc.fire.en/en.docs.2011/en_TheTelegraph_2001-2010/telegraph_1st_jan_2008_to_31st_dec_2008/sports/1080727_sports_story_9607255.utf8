The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal misses cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Atwal misses cut
                      
	Ohio: The penultimate hole bogey cooked Arjun Atwals goose and the Orlando-based Indian missed the cut by just one shot in the $750,0000 nation-wide Childrens Hospital Invitational golf tournament.         
	After his horrendous opening round of five-over 76, Atwal needed to come up with a vastly improved show to hang around for weekend action but all he could manage was a round of 70 which saw him miss the cut by a whisker.         
	The cut line was set at 145, while Atwal finished with a two-day total of 146.         
	Atwal had a roller-coaster front nine, where two birdies were cancelled out by as many bogeys as he took the turn at level-par.         
	On resumption, he birdied the 12th and 15th and still could have made the cut before the 17th hole bogey put paid to his hopes.         
	At the top, Peter Tomasulo (137) blasted four-under 67 to grab the lead with Rich Barcelo (70) and Brendon Todd (69) breathing down his neck from one stroke behind.

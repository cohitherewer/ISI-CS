	Thundering Hooves is fancied ahead of , Bella and Feet Of Flames in the 1,200m Jimmy Bharucha Trophy, the main event at the Mumbai races on Thursday. However, Thundering Hooves run in the Breeders Produce Stakes is best ignored as the China Visit colt was up against a stiff company. The Cooji Katrak-trainee is expected to tackle the present lot and he may score in the hands of jockey Y. Srinath.

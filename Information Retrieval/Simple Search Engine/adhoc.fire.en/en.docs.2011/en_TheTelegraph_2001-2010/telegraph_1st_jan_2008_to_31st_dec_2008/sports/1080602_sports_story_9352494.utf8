	Gelsenkirchen: Captain Michael Ballack grabbed an 82nd minute winner for Germany, who fought back from a goal down to beat Serbia 2-1 on Saturday in their last friendly before the Euro 2008 finals.         
	World Cup runners-up France were held to a 0-0 draw by Paraguay in their penultimate Euro 2008 warm-up game.         
	A spectacular volley from defender Joan Capdevila earned Spain a last-gasp 2-1 win over Peru. The match looked to be heading for a draw after Peru striker Hernan Rengifo had cancelled out a first-half goal from David Villa but Capdevila smashed home from close range three minutes into injury time to secure the victory.         
	The victory extended Spains unbeaten record to 15 games before next months tournament in Austria and Switzerland.         
	Goals from midfielders Joao Moutinho and Simao Sabrosa earned Portugal a morale-boosting 2-0 win over Georgia in their last warm-up match before next months European Championship.         
	Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari began the match with the players most likely to start their opening game against Turkey on June 7. They also face the Czech Republic and Switzerland in group A.         
	France, who had started their final preparations with a 2-0 win over Ecuador last Tuesday, failed to breach their visitors tight defence and survived a few scares.         
	For their first outing since coach Raymond Domenech named his official 23-man list on Wednesday, France were missing midfielder and captain Patrick Vieira, who was nursing a sore left thigh.         
	Croatia captain Niko Kovac scored for both sides as his team scraped an unimpressive 1-1 draw with eastern European neighbours Hungary in their final Euro 2008 warmup match on Saturday.         
	Substitute playmaker Nicolae Dica scored twice to help Euro 2008 finalists Romania crush Montenegro 4-0 in their friendly on Saturday.         
	Substitute Oliver Neuville for Germany sidefooted home in the 74th minute to cancel out Bosko Jankovics first-half opener before Ballack drove a free kick through the Serb wall and into the net with goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic rooted to the spot.         
	It was a less than convincing performance from Germany, one of the favourites for the Euro 2008 tournament in Switzerland and Austria beginning on June 7.         
	It wouldnt have been great if we had lost so everyone stepped on the gas, Ballack said in a television interview. We are not yet at 100 percent but our form will improve.         
	Coach Joachim Loew had taken the precaution of resting striker Miroslav Klose, who has a minor ankle problem, and started with Mario Gomez and Kevin Kuranyi up front.         
	Gomez created an early chance for Ballack to put his side ahead but Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic was on hand to hook the Chelsea midfielders diving header off the line.         
	Serbia took the lead shortly after, Jankovic racing on to a defence-splitting pass and slotting past Jens Lehmann.         
	The Palermo midfielder almost had a second at the start of the second half when his close-range shot crashed off the bar but the introduction of Neuville with 20 minutes to go proved decisive when he turned in Jansens inviting cross.         
	In the first half we wasted our opportunities but thankfully it all came together at the right time, Loew said at a news conference.         
	Michael Ballack carried the team forward today and was a strong presence on the pitch, he added. The win is definitely important for the mood and confidence of the players.         
	Germany are in Group B at Euro 2008 with co-hosts Austria, Poland and Croatia.           (REUTERS)

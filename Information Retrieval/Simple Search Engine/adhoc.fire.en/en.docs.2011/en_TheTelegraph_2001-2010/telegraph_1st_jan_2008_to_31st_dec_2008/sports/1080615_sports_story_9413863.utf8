	Halle: Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy made a remarkable comeback through the super-tie breaker of their semi-final match to enter the summit clash of the euro 713,000 Gerry Weber Open.         
	After pocketing the first set, the fourth seed Indo-Czech pair lost the second set without getting on board but eventually pulled off a 6-4, 0-6, 10-4 win against Ivan Lubicic and Robin Soderling in one hour and 30 minutes.         
	Meanwhile, the eighth seed Indian Davis Cuppers Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna crashed out of the Artois Championships in London after losing their quarter final encounter in straight sets against Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonzic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fear factor key to win: Harrington
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fear factor key to win: Harrington
                  Padraig Harrington at a news conference on Monday                     
	Southport: British Open champion Padraig Harrington said on Monday that fear was the key to his successful title defence at Royal Birkdale.         
	The Briton played a commanding final round on Sunday to secure a four-shot victory over compatriot Ian Poulter and his second major triumph.         
	Fear has always been a motivator in my golf, quot; Harrington said.         
	I think winning a major last year, the biggest fear was not to go down the road of guys who have won majors and struggled to maintain the intensity.         
	Harrington, whose defence had been in doubt at the start of the week because of a right wrist injury, said he had worked with sports psychologist Bob Rotella to make it a motivating factor.         
	Fear is a big part of me. Id like to say that I have all the trust and faith (in my game) and be nice and relaxed but thats not my make-up.         
	He said that fear pushed him on, kept him practising and he had to work with it and use it.         
	The 36-year-old Dubliner, who has risen to a career-high third in the world rankings, also sealed his Ryder Cup place for Septembers clash with the US in Valhalla, Kentucky after moving to the top of the European world points list.         
	Ill now be checking to see all those on the bubble. The Ryder Cups very entertaining when youre on the team.         
	Its a tough process, so now that Im there I can look over the next month and a half and see the guys play their hearts out to try and make it, quot; said the champion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not afraid to visit Hyderabad: Malik
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Not afraid to visit Hyderabad: Malik
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik does not foresee any problem in playing the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches in Hyderabad despite his long running feud with an Indian family which claims that he has married their daughter and is not granting her divorce as per Islamic laws.         
	The Siddiqui family claims Malik performed nikaah with their daughter Ayesha in 2002 over the phone and is now refusing to divorce her.         
	The Pakistan captain says he never married Ayesha and accused the girls family of trying to victimise him.         
	Siddiqui has threatened to move court in Hyderabad against Malik. But the Pakistan skipper said he was leaving for Hyderabad to play in the IPL.         
	There are two legal notices with the Siddiqui family that I have sent them to retract their claims and apologise for trying to defame me, and they have kept quiet on those notices, Malik said.         
	If I had anything to hide or was afraid, I would not go to Hyderabad for the IPL game.         
	I dont think there will be any problem in me playing in Hyderabad. As it is, it is up to our captain Virender Sehwag if he even plays me because we already have eight overseas players in the side, Malik said.         
	Malik, who led Pakistan to a 5-0 whitewash in the one-day series and a win in the Twenty20 game on Sunday, said the IPL would be as much important for him as playing for Pakistan.         
	We are professional cricketers and we have a playing life span of around 12 to 15 years.         
	So we have to remain committed and perform to the best of our abilities. For me, the IPL is as important being a professional as playing for Pakistan, he said.           (PTI)

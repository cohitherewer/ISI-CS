	Calcutta: Rahil Gangjee began his campaign in the Hong Kong Open in Fanling on Thursday with a two-under 68 to be at tied 16th. According to information received here, the city-based golfer is the highest-placed Indian after Round I of the event which is co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours.         
	Gangjee, who trails joint leaders Liang Wen-chong of China and South Africas Richard Sterne by four strokes, parred the first 11 holes before his first birdie on the 12th. He picked up another stroke on the 14th before dropping one on the next hole. He closed with a birdie on the 18th.         
	He shares the 16th spot with the likes of two-time major winner John Daly and Colin Montgomerie, who won the title here in 2005.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, who has just come off a win at the Singapore Open, ended the day tied 73rd at one-over 71. He shares the spot, among others, with compatriots Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei, former Hong Kong Open champions Miguel Angel Jimenez and Simon Dyson and Swede Daniel Chopra.         
	I missed a few putts and also felt a little tired, said Jeev, who has jumped to the top of the Asian Tours Order of Merit list following his win in Singapore. Amandeep Johl brought in a par 70 to be tied 47th. He had birdies on the third, 10th, 12th and the 13th but dropped shots on the second, fifth, 15th and the 18th.         
	Shiv Kapur shot a two-over 72 for a share of 100th place and Digvijay Singh is a further stroke behind in tied 117th. Arjun Atwal and S.S.P. Chowrasia carded four-over 74s to be at tied 125th.         
	Wen-chong shot a six-under-par 64 to take a one-shot lead with Sterne.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand slips to joint 5th 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Anand slips to joint 5th 
                      
	Bilbao: Viswanathan Anands incredible winless streak was stretched as the world champion played out yet another draw with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan to slip to the joint fifth spot in the Bilbao Grand Slam final.         
	In a dramatic turn of events, overnight leader Magnus Carlsen of Norway was beaten by Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine while Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria too found his nemesis in Levon Aronian of Armenia.         
	With two of the highest ranked players in the standings going down, the field was thrown open but it was of no help to Anand who is still looking for his first victory.         
	As things stand, despite the loss, Carlsen remained atop the table on 11 points and Topalov is still on his heels a full point behind in the soccer-like scoring system that gives three points for a win and one for a draw.         
	Aronian also came within striking distance of Carlsen on nine points while Ivanchuk in fourth spot on eight points.         
	Anand and Radjabov share the fifth spot with six points apiece and three rounds to go.           . (AGENCIES)

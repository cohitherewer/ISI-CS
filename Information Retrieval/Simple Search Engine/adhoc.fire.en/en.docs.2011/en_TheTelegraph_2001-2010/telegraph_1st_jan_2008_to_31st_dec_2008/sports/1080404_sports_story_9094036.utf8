The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB chief serves notice on pacer, wants apology
                                                     PCB chief serves notice on pacer, wants apology
  - Shoaib Akhtar: at the centre of yet another controversy             Shoaib Akhtar                           
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman served a notice for alleged defamation on Shoaib Akhtar on Thursday for statements made after the fast bowler was banned for five years earlier this week.         
	In a legal notice sent to Shoaib on Thursday, Dr Nasim Ashraf demanded an unconditional apology and Rs 200 million rupees for defaming him personally and sullying the name of the PCB and the team.         
	The notice was served after Shoaib, said in a television interview on Wednesday, that Ashraf tried to extort money for allowing him to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and that the disciplinary action was taken against him because he refused to make the payment.         
	The fast bowler claimed that other players were also asked for commission for getting them the IPL contracts.         
	If you fail to strictly and immediately comply with the above take note our client reserves his and the boards right to avail any and all legal remedies under the civil and criminal laws of Pakistan, the notice said.         
	The notice added that Shoaibs allegations were utterly outrageous, fabricated, manifestly baseless and are vehemently denied in the strongest possible words         
	Although Akhtar, in another television interview on Thursday, denied making such allegations.         
	The PCB on Thursday also defended its decision saying ball tampering, doping scandals, abusing officials and brawls with teammates were linked with him.         
	The PCBs disciplinary committee chairman lieutenant general (retired) Muneer Hafeez said banning Shoaib was a difficult but right decision. There was no ulterior motive involved in it.         
	I can tell you with all honesty that there was no ulterior motive involved in the ban. It was a situation where we had to decide how much longer could we allow Shoaib Akhtar to keep on violating discipline and work ethic, Hafeez said.         
	For years now, he has been violating team ethics and discipline. For years now, he has been challenging authority and defying the management, Hafeez, who had recommended the severe sanction against Shoaib said.         
	There have been numerous incidents of fitness problems and breaking down in matches and tours. The ban is not just for giving statements against the policies of the board but for other violations as well, Hafeez said.         
	The fact that he was also under a two-year probation and he accepted this condition last year when he was banned for 13 matches and fined 3.4 million rupees made it incumbent on us to take some action, Hafeez added.         
	He pointed out that both Shoaib and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria were given a fair chance to defend themselves. (PTI)

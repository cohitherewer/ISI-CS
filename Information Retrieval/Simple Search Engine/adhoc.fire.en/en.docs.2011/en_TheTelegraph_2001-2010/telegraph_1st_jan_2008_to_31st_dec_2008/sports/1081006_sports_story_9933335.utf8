                  Leander Paes                     
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhys bid for a second successive ATP title ended in disappointment after the top seeds were stunned by the Russian-German pair of Mikhail Youzhny and Mischa Zverev in the finals of AIG Japan Open in Tokyo on Sunday.         
	The unseeded Youzhny and Zverev beat the Indo-Czech pair 6-3, 6-4 to capture their second ATP title together, according to information received here.         
	Playing a solid service game, Youzhny and Zverev converted two of the four break points that came their way and protected their serve against four break point chances that Dlouhy and Paes earned in the 58-minute encounter.         
	It is the second time this year that Youzhny and Zverev have combined to deny Paes and Dlouhy a title win, having also done so when they claimed their maiden ATP title at Halle in June.         
	Paes and Dlouhy were chasing their second straight title after capturing their first last week at Bangkok.         
	The 35-year-old Paes was bidding for his 41st ATP doubles title and second in Tokyo, after triumphing in 2000 with former partner Mahesh Bhupathi.         
	In singles, Czech Tomas Berdych halted fifth seed Juan Martin del Potros hot streak by beating the Argentine 6-1, 6-4 to win the Japan Open on Sunday.         
	Ninth seed Berdychs fourth ATP Tour title and his first since winning on grass in Halle last year came after Del Potro left the court to take medicine for an upset stomach.         
	Everyone could see he had some problem, said Berdych, who stunned second seed Andy Roddick in the semi-finals. But he took some pills and was getting back into the match.         
	It might have been different if Juan Martin was feeling better but I served well and everything came together.         
	Del Potro had been strong favourite to win the final at the $969,000 Tokyo hardcourt tournament having won 29 of his previous 30 matches but Berdych dominated from the start.         
	Warned for taking too long for a lavatory break after the fifth game, Del Potro took a medical timeout for stomach problems after surrendering the first set in just 22 minutes.         
	The 20-year-old Argentine, who recently helped his country reach the Davis Cup final, was broken again early in the second when Berdych forced him into a loose backhand.         
	Berdychs nerve held and he closed out a surprisingly comfortable victory with a huge serve Del Potro was unable to control.         
	The Czech picked up $135,000 for the win while Del Potro, conqueror of top seed David Ferrer in the last eight, boosted his hopes of a place at the season-ending Masters Cup.         
	Del Potro will climb to ninth in the race for next months lucrative eight-man Shanghai shootout and a career-high ninth in the ATP world rankings.         
	His game confused me, admitted Del Potro, whose only loss in his previous 30 outings had come against Briton Andy Murray in the US Open quarter finals.           (AGENCIES)

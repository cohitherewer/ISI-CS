The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Move to remove Gavaskar from a key ICC position
                                                     Move to remove Gavaskar from a key ICC position
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had no qualms in removing Sunil Gavaskar as the National Cricket Academy head.         
	That was in September 2006.         
	Eighteen months later, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is keen to see him out as chairman of its prestigious cricket committee. All because of the stand he took, both on TV and through his columns, during Team Indias recent tour of Australia.         
	Gavaskar, who has been heading the committee for quite some time now, got re-appointed for a three-year term last June.         
	Significantly, till late on Tuesday, there had been no announcement from the BCCI that it would actually take up cudgels on the iconic former captains behalf.         
	But, then, its the present regime run by Sharad Pawar which removed Gavaskar from the Academy. Its another matter that a year later, the same men worked overtime to get him on the Indian Premier League bandwagon.         
	Gavaskars son Rohan, by the way, is with the rebel Indian Cricket League.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the BCCIs working committee, which met here on Tuesday afternoon, was only told by Pawar that news emanating from the UK about Gavaskars removal was incorrect.         
	Bottomline is that Gavaskar has been asked to present himself at the ICC HQ in Dubai and explain his position (on the wearing of multiple hats) to the outgoing chief executive, Malcolm Speed.         
	Gavaskar is already in Dubai on a private visit and could meet the Australian on Thursday. By all accounts, the two havent been on the best of terms.         
	Indeed, back in January, Speed had sought an explanation from Gavaskar for his comments in his column on Mike Procter, the Match Referee during the India-Australia Test series.         
	For Gavaskar, the trouble really began then.         
	The first informal steps at getting him out of the ICC, though, were taken during the recent executive board meeting in Dubai. Ironically, the same meeting appointed Inderjit Singh Bindra as the first-ever principal adviser.         
	Gavaskar wasnt on the agenda, but quite a few members felt there was a conflict of interest between his role as a mediaman and as chairman of the cricket committee.         
	Clearly, people forgot that hes been a columnist for over two decades. Also, that hes been doing TV assignments across the world for a number of years too.         
	England and Australia, it seems, took the lead in that anti-Gavaskar move. The buzz is that the Australians are intent on having ex-captain Mark Taylor replace Gavaskar.         
	Last year, before Gavaskar got re-appointed, even Pakistan had been asking for the chairmanship to be rotated. Briefly, there had been a move to lobby for Majid Khan, also a former captain.         
	Confirmation couldnt be got, but somebody influential in the BCCI maintained that Gavaskar had, last year itself, indicated he wouldnt stay on for the full three years of his new term.         
	Perhaps, but Gavaskar isnt the type  so far, at least, he hasnt been  to buckle down under pressure. And, today, its a changed scenario.         
	If anything, Gavaskars a proud Indian and jumping to Team Indias defence, when we were being pushed around in Australia, came naturally to him.         
	No matter what England and Australia feel, theyd better not underestimate Gavaskar.

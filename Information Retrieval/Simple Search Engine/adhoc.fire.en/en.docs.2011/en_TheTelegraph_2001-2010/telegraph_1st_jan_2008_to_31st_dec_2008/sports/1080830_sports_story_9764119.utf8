The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jankovic scrambles into fourth round
                                                                                                                                                                                           Jankovic scrambles into fourth round
  - Nadal blows away American qualifier

	New York: Second seed Jelena Jankovic came through another bruising battle at the US Open on Friday, edging past Zheng Jie 7-5, 7-5 to reach the fourth round.         
	The Serb, chasing her first Grand Slam title, scrambled into the last 16 after two hours nine minutes combat and will meet 14th seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus or Caroline Wozniacki, the Danish 21st seed. Having been pushed to three sets in the previous round, Jankovic again became embroiled in a tough encounter as Wimbledon semi-finalist Zheng matched her from the baseline.         
	 Ana Ivanovic was unceremoniously tossed out on Thursday by an obscure Frenchwoman who had never played a tour-level match before arriving at Flushing Meadows. Julie Coin set alight the Arthur Ashe Stadium when she produced the match of her life to shatter the world No.1s title hopes in the second round 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.         
	Coins compatriot Severine Bremond and Italys Tathiana Garbin continued a day of upsets. Bremond secured a 7-5, 6-3 win over 20th seed Nicole Vaidisova and Garbin beat Hungarian 13th seed Agnes Szavay 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Like Ivanovic, mens world No.1 Rafael Nadal faced a Grand Slam debutant.         
	Unlike Ivanovic, though, Nadal emerged unscathed in a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 demolition of American qualifier Ryler DeHeart. Venus Williams looked set to hand Paraguays Rossana De Los Rios the dreaded whitewash after bagging the first seven games, but eventually settled for a 6-0, 6-3 win.         
	In her two matches so far, she has dropped only eight games and is determined to maintain her ruthless streak .         
	Id like to have a more recent memory, as of like 08. I guess, (Im) kind of overdue. So thats pretty much the goal, said Williams, who won her fifth Wimbledon title in July. Sister Serena, also enjoyed an easy ride. She beat Russian Elena Vesnina 6-1, 6-1.         
	Dinara Safina appeared to be in a hurry to reach the last 32, and had it not been for lapses in concentration, the sixth seed would have beaten Italys Roberta Vinci more emphatically than suggested by the final 6-4, 6-3 scoreline.         
	Mens sixth seed Andy Murray narrowly avoided being stretched into a fifth set in his 6-4, 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 win over Frances Michael Llodra, while ninth seed James Blake seemed set for a marathon encounter until his Belgian opponent Steve Darcis quit with a back injury. The American was leading 4-6, 6-3, 1-0.

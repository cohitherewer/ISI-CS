                                                   Im pretty relaxed: Dravid

           
	Canberra: Rahul Dravid may be struggling to recover his peak form but the former India captain on Thursday insisted that he was pretty relaxed and would look to find the gaps more frequently to overcome the lean patch. 
    
	Dravid, who scored 62 in the first innings of the three-day match against ACT XI, said he opted to play not because he was perturbed by his poor form but to get some practice in the middle. 
    
	Captain Anil Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman opted out of the three-day game at the Manuka Oval, leaving Dravid as the most experienced player in the side. 
    
	Despite whatever the impression is being conveyed, I am in a pretty relaxed frame of mind and keen to play, said Dravid, who gave signs of returning to form in Sydney but would still like to feel better at the crease. 
    
	His impressive knock of 62 on Thursday came on a pitch where the ball came on to the bat. 
    
	I looked to play the ball on merit. It also came to the bat a lot better and once I was set, I played a few more shots, Dravid said. 
    
	Dravid looked back at the Sydney Test as a happy experience, especially the one in the first innings, and suggested his struggle early on in the series was a mixture of poor form and inability to find gaps. 
    
	Sometimes when you are able to find gaps, say four or five boundaries from 100 balls, a score of 40 could look 55 or 70, said the elegant batsman. I thought I was hitting the ball well but just not finding the gaps, Dravid said. 
    
	In the context of the match, the first innings was important. Its important to last the early stages of the kookaburra ball. Laxman, at the other end, made batting look so easy but I was satisfied that i could raise important 175 runs with Laxman, he said. 
    
	Dravid had encouraging words for Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Yuvi and rest of the guys would like to get a lot more runs. It does help confidence. It hasnt happened but there is one more hit in the middle. 
    
	I hope it doesnt play on their mind. Yuvi, only two matches before, had scored a brilliant hundred. He just needs to stay positive and not worry, he said. 
    
	Dravid explained Virender Sehwags struggle as an outcome of no hits in the middle for sometime now. He has looked in good touch in the nets but hasnt had much batting in the middle lately. He looked in good touch, middled the ball well and was out to a good catch, the former skipper added. (PTI)

	Gujarati shines for America  
	Raj Bhavsar, born to Gujarati parents Bob and Sue Bhavsar, should have won an Olympic medal for India. Instead, the gymnast did America proud. The 28-year-old Houston lad was part of the six-member American mens team that won the bronze medal in artistic gymnastics, says Our Correspondent.  
	Bindra honour         
	The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) on Tuesday suggested that Bharat Ratna be conferred on shooter Abhinav Bindra, says Our Correspondent. NRAI secretary Baljit Singh Sethi, who is also the deputy chef-de-mission, has spoken to sports minister M.S. Gill and would soon write a letter formally recommending his name.         
	Failed dope test         
	The captain of Bulgarias volleyball team at the Beijing Olympics has been temporarily removed after a doping test, says a report from Sofia. Plamen Konstantinovs test showed substances that were in the upper range of the permissible levels, Bulgarian Volleyball Federation chief Dancho Lazarov said on Tuesday.         
	Gritty Iraq         
	The perseverance of the Iraqi athletes has amazed some competitors here. It takes a brave athlete to compete for Iraq these days, considering what has happened to some of their fellow sportsmen. Only four of seven would-be Olympic athletes from Iraq are in Beijing because of a dispute between Iraqis Olympic committee and the International Olympic Committee. That disagreement threatened Iraqs chances of competing at the Games.         
	Athlete pulls out         
	Womens Olympic marathon champion Mizuki Noguchi of Japan has withdrawn from the Beijing Games due to injury, Japans Olympic delegation chief said on Tuesday.         
	According to a statement, Noguchi has injured muscles in her left thigh. A report from the Japan Association of Athletics Federations said that the runner would not be able to compete.         
	Touts trade in daylight         
	Foreign and Chinese touts are openly selling tickets for over 10 times their face value outside Olympic venues despite the threat of jail, amid complaints about empty seats at many stadiums. The trade was taking place under the noses of passing police cars, security guards and Olympic volunteers even though scalping is illegal in China.

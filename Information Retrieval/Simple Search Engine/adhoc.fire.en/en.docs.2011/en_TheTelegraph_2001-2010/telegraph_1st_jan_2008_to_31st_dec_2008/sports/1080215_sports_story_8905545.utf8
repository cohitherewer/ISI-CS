The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev a shot adrift of leaders
                                                   Jeev a shot adrift of leaders
                      
	Jakarta: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a five-under 65 to be at tied third spot after the first round of the Indonesia Open on Thursday.         
	Australias David Bransdon and Joost Luiten of The Netherlands carded 64s to share the lead as rain did not allow 42 others to complete their rounds.         
	They will return early on Friday to complete the first round in the $1.2 million co-sanctioned event between the Asian Tour and European Tour.         
	Joining Jeev at third spot were Liang Wen-Chong, Prayad Marksaeng, Juan Abbate, Kyron Sullivan, Philip Golding and Felipe Aguilar.         
	Jeev, who missed the cut at the Indian Masters, closed with a birdie on the final hole.         
	Playing the back nine first, Jeev parred the 10th before unleashing a birdie hattrick to take the turn at three-under. He dropped a shot on the third but birdies on the sixth, seventh and the ninth had him just one shot behind the leaders.         
	Arjun Atwal was four-under with one more hole to go . Gaurav Ghei ended the day at three-under with six more holes to play. Jyoti Randhawa mixed five birdies and three bogeys to finish with 68, one shot ahead of Shiv Kapur.         
	 Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee was even-par after three holes when he had to run for cover. (PTI)

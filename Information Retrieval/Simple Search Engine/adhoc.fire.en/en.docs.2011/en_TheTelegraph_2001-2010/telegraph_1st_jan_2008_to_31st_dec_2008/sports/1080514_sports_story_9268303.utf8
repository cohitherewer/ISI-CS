The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils dance to Shoaibs tune
                                                                                                                                                                                                     DareDevils dance to Shoaibs tune
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shoaib Akhtar was struggling to keep his feet on the ground. As the Kolkata Knight Riders players chaired him off the field, he must have felt like a man floating in the air.         
	What a month it has been for the fast bowler who has seen more troughs than peaks! Tuesday was different and he will remember it for a long while.               
	Kolkata Knight Riders stay in fourth spot with 10 points from nine games after Tuesdays victory. Delhi DareDevils are fifth with eight points from as many matches.               
	There can be no better sight than a fast bowler tearing away at the opposition. The visitors flinched in the face of pace and movement as the top order was laid to dust on the Eden green.         
	The figures of 3-0-11-4 said it all. Despite their resistance in the middle overs, Delhi DareDevils had lost the plot within the first five overs of the match. Not without reason did Shah Rukh Khan jump on to Shoaibs lap during the prize distribution.         
	The Knight Riders are firmly placed for a semi-final berth with the 23-run win.         
	The sight of Shoaib hurtling in off his full run-up sent shivers down the visitors spine. After having clocked an average of 145 kmph in the very first over, he only accelerated, never willing to ease the pressure.         
	Four wickets in his first and only spell of three overs spelt doom for Virender Sehwags men. The visiting captain failed to keep his bat away from the second delivery of the innings  a late outswinger and he was caught on the drive.         
	Then Gautam Gambhir couldnt resist the temptation for the pull and David Hussey at backward point leapt in the air for the catch. A.B. De Villiers thick top edge found Tatenda Taibu at square leg. The batsman crossed over and Manoj Tiwary is caught plumb in front of the next ball. The hattrick was prevented but the fortunes were more or less decided.         
	It was also Shah Rukhs day. Each time a wicket fell he would rush out from the dressing room balcony in a celebratory jig egging on an almost full house. An over-enthusiastic supporter hurled a bottle at him sending the security into a frenzy. But nothing could stop the team owner from gyrating tonight. His dream of a seeing a fired up Shoaib sending the crowd into a frenzy had been realised.         
	Shah Rukh had got Eden to sing korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re after the 134-run target seemed too little. In keeping with the mood, the PA system belted out, were the knighterswe never give up. Even IPL commissioner Lalit Modi was seen shaking a leg.         
	Was Shoaib hell bent on sending out a message? To PCB chief Dr Nasim Akhtar or to national captain Shoaib Malik sitting in the dug out after failing to make the DareDevils XI!         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan and Amit Mishra did stage a brilliant comeback with a free flowing 34-run partnership for the seventh wicket. But some athletic fielding and Laxmi Ratan Shuklas brilliant bowling (0.5-0-6-3) at the death sealed the visitors hopes. But it had to be Shoaibs day.         
	Will he? Wont he? The big question on everyones mind before the start was whether Shoaib Akhtar would play. Edens resident DJ provided the first hint when an hour before the start he roared, watch Ishant and Shoaib take on Gambhir and Sehwag!         
	The alarm bells were sent ringing. Even as Delhi DareDevils players warmed up, they kept an eye on Shoaibs fitness. The fast bowler was loosening up at one corner as John Buchanan and Adrian le Roux kept a close watch.         
	Once the session got over it was time for playing pranks on teammates as Shoaib kept laughing and whistling away. The green signal seemed to have come through from the coach.         
	Shah Rukhs arrival set all speculation to rest. As the players huddled together for the customary match-eve pep-talk the team owner walked up and presented the team jersey to debutants Shoaib and Iqbal Abdullah. This was followed by a warm hug and a few words of encouragement.         
	The strong bowling attack prompted Sourav to bat first. Salman Butt and Aakash Chopra pushed and prodded their way on the slow surface before Sourav Ganguly decided to send Yo Mahesh for a straight six of the second ball he faced.         
	It was time to remind all that we were indeed watching a Twenty20 match. But his luck did not hold out as he perished two balls later attempting a wild heave of the same bowler.         
	Butt was there still trying to up the tempo. His limitations were proving to be a major handicap. David Hussey found the going tough too as the Pradeep Sangwans, Maheshs and Fervez Mahroofs excelled, not to speak of McGrath. Butts 44-ball 48 and Husseys run-a-ball 31 was unable to repair the earlier damage.

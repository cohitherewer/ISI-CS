	Calcutta: Vijay Kannan gave India some reason to rejoice, claiming the Coal India-ITF Mens Futures doubles title at the Jaidip Mukerjea Tennis Academy on Friday.         
	After Indian hopes evaportaed with the exit of Vivek Shokeen and Ranjeet Virali-Murugesan in the quarter finals on Thursday, the world No. 726 Kannan, partnered Alexey Kedryuk of Kazakhstan to pip the Chinese Taipei duo of Huai-En Chang and Hsien-Yin Peng 7-6 (7), 7-6 (4) en route to the title.         
	On a day when both the singles semi-finals were one-sided, the doubles summit clash saw a keen contest. Both players held each others serves as the first set went into tie-breaker in which the Indo-Kazakh duo struggled hard to come to terms with the proceedings. However the duo were a touch clinical in the second set to bag the title.         
	The Chennai-based Kannans match reading did the trick, felt New Delhi-based national coach T. Chandrasekaran. Kannan is also a former national (hard court) champion.         
	Having seen Kannan many a time Chandrasekaran added: Hes very consistent and has a powerful serve. Moreover his match temperament is good. He reads his opponent very well to enjoy the upper hand.         
	Kannan, who was a member of the Davis Cup team, earned India a gold medal in the Afro-Asian Games (Hyderabad) in 2003. Kannan-Kedryuk bagged a prize-money of Rs 37,500 while the runners-up were richer by Rs 19,600.         
	The title showdown Saturday will see a battle between top seed Alexander Satschko of Germany and seventh seeded Hyun-Woo Nam of Korea.         
	Satschko eased past his Taepei opponent Tsung Hua Yang 6-3, 6-3 in 95 minutes to make the final, while Nam had to sweat it out in the second set against Serbian David Savic. Nam wrapped up the first set 6-1. In the second set, Savic took a 3-0 lead before Nam bounced back 6-4 to settle the match in 90 minutes.

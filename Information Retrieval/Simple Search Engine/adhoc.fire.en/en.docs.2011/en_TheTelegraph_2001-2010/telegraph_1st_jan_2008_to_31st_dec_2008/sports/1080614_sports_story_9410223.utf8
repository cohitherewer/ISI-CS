	Zurich: Gianluigi Buffon saved a late penalty from Adrian Mutu to give Italy a 1-1 draw with Romania on Friday at the European Championship.         
	Daniel Niculae was dragged down by Christian Panucci in the 80th minute, and a penalty was awarded. Buffon dived to his left and reached back with his hand to stop Mutus shot, and the ball then deflected away off the goalkeepers leg.         
	Mutu, who plays for Fiorentina, had given Romania the lead against the World Cup champions. He took advantage of a defensive mistake by Gianluca Zambrotta in the 55th minute, but Panucci equalised a minute later for Italy for his fourth goal in 55 internationals.         
	Romania has two points in group C, while Italy, who lost to The Netherlands 0-3 in their opener, have one. The Italians now must beat France in their final group game to advance.         
	Both teams also came close to scoring in the first half. Romania captain Cristian Chivu hit the post in the 20th when his long-range free kick deflected off Panucci, and Italy forward Luca Toni had a goal annulled for a controversial offside call in first-half injury time.

	Calcutta: Mumbai, Calcutta and Delhi turf clubs are limping back to normalcy, while the increasing number of viral fever cases in Mysore may force the clubs stewards to pull down shutters on the season. The Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) and the Hyderabad Race Club (HRC), on the other hand, are taking preventive measures. As a result, HRC has announced a two-week shut-down of racing from early December to vaccinate all horses. BTC plans to take more bio-security measures.

	Chandigarh: Players need not shun aggression and passion while playing but limits should not be crossed, Australian great Glenn McGrath said on Monday while reacting to the row involving Harbhajan Singh and Sreesanth.         
	You still have to play with aggression but there is a line and dont cross that, 38-year-old McGrath said.         
	I have played cricket aggressively and with passion but there is a line which should not be crossed, he said on being asked about the shocking incident which marred the tournament.         
	On the domination of Australian players, McGrath said over the years we have learnt how to play in India. We have played a lot of cricket in India in the last 10-12 years. We know the conditions very well.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win yet to sink in: Duminy
                                                                                                                                                                                           Win yet to sink in: Duminy
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Debutant JP Duminy said on Monday that the full impact of South Africas brilliant victory against Australia at Perth was yet to sink in, adding that so far it has been a fairy tale beginning for him in Tests.         
	Its still sinking in.....such a phenomenal victory. It is something that I will savour for the rest of my life, he said.         
	It is unbelievable to come here for the first time with the Test side and pull off a victory in our first Test match. I am lost for words to say how I am feeling at the moment. Ive lived through all those days of getting so close to beating the Aussies and not quite getting there, the 24-year old said.         
	Duminy has come in for all round praise for his contribution in South Africas remarkable Test victory over Australia in Perth, but the batsman believes that credit goes to Mickey Arthur too for the care the coach took to ensure he made a smooth transition to the Proteas Test side.         
	Duminy acknowledged that having been a part of the Test squad for a period of time had helped him cope with the jitters of making his Test debut against the number one team in the world.         
	I didnt want to portray a nervous and uncomfortable feeling out there. I was feeling the pressure but my main objective was to soak up the pressure and take it ball by ball, the left-handed batsman said.

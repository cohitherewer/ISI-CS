The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden stays focused
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Hayden stays focused
                      
	Melbourne: Clearing the air on speculation about his retirement, Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden Wednesday said he would reassess his future after the Test series against South Africa ends next month.         
	Im still enjoying the game. Ive still got a role to play as a senior player, Hayden was quoted as saying by an Australian news agency.         
	The 37-year-old has been under fire recently owing to a slump in form that has seen him make 282 runs at 23.5 in seven Tests since recovering from an Achilles injury.         
	Ive got to perform as weve all got to perform, because thats the expectation of Australian cricket. I really want to play good Test match cricket for this next series and then see where we are at, he said.         
	Hayden also said he was taking one series at a time and not looking at the 2009 Ashes yet.         
	Weve still got one-dayers and a long summer ahead of us. Kellie, my wife, and I have just really put every series into context. We weigh it up, as simple as that. Im not looking to (next years tours of) South Africa or England at this stage, Im looking at these next two Test matches, he said.         
	Meanwhile, asserting that Matthew Hayden was past his use-by date, pace legend Jeff Thomson Wednesday said he would have sacked the embattled opener had he been in the Australian cricket teams selection panel.         
	Matty is a friend and while Ive got nothing against him, I do think hes past his use-by date, the legendary pacer, who took 200-Test wickets, was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.

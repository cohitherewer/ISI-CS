	Wellington: New Zealand opener Tim McIntosh took advantage of a West Indies fielding blunder to put his side in a good position at 145 for two in their first innings at the close of the second day of the second Test on Saturday.         
	McIntosh had a let-off when he was on 10 and New Zealand 36 for two in reply to the West Indies first innings total of 307.         
	Bowler Fidel Edwards and wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin let a skied pull shot fall harmlessly between them as both stood still waiting for the other to take the catch. By close, McIntosh had moved to 62 with Ross Taylor, having just come to the crease.

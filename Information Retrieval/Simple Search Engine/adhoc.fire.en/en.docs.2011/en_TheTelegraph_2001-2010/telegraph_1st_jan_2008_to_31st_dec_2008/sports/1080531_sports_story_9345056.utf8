The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev tied third after 1st round
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jeev tied third after 1st round
                            
	New Port: Jeev Milkha Singh blasted a brilliant hattrick of birdies on the back nine for a flawless six-under 65 to finish tied third at the Celtic Manor Wales Open.         
	Australian Scott Strange covered nine holes in just 28 strokes to fashion an eight-under-par 63 and lead the first round by a stroke on Thursday.         
	Jeev set off with a flawless front nine, dropping two shots at the third and ninth holes while parring the rest.         
	The Chandigarh golfer looked unstoppable on the back nine as he sank a birdie on the 13th hole and followed it up with three back-to-back birdies on the 16th, 17th and 18th to share the third place with Alvaro Velasco of Spain.         
	However, a sub-par card eluded SSP Chowrasia and Jyoti Randhawa as the two carded an identical one-over 72 to finish joint tied-91. Delhi lad Shiv Kapur turned in a disastrous two-over 73 to languish at tied-111.         
	Last weeks PGA title-winner and European money-list leader Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain retired at the 12th in the morning, suffering from a knee injury.           (AGENCIES)

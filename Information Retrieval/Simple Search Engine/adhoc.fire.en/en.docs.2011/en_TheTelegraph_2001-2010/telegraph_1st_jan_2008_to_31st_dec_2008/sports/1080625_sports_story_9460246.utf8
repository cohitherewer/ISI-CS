The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania battles pain to advance
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sania battles pain to advance
                  Sania Mirza at Wimbledon on Tuesday                     
	London: Sania Mirza battled through the pain barrier to reach the second round of Wimbledon with a scrappy 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 win over Colombias Catalina Castano on Tuesday.         
	The Indian making a comeback after undergoing a wrist surgery in April needed a medical time out at 4-1 down in the second set to treat a pectoral injury.         
	Although the rub down could not save her from losing the second set, the Mirza stood solid in the decider to wrap up her victory after two hours 16 minutes. Its always good to get through matches like this, even when youre not playing your best and specially coming back from an injury, Mirza told reporters.         
	Today (Tuesday) I actually felt nervous again to go out. I didnt really sleep well last night, to be honest. But I think that happens when youre coming back from injury.         
	Getting through matches like this is whats going to help you get better and I think it was very good for me to get through that.         
	While the Hyderabadi girl lapped up the applause from the Indian fans packed into court 11, Castano was left to reflect on yet another fleeting visit to the All England Club.         
	In six appearances at the grass court Grand Slam, she has lost in the first round every time. Mirza, seeded 32nd, will have to beat Spaniard Maria Martinez Sanchez to reach the third round here for the first time.         
	The 21-year-old, however, admitted that her wrist was still not 100 percent fit.         
	Medically, its fine now, said Mirza, who could face defending champion Venus Williams in the third round.         
	But, I still have pain when I hit a late forehand because thats something that even the doctors have said would stay.         
	Sometimes it goes away in three months, sometimes it takes eight months.         
	Thats something you have to play through. Its a new wrist, so it requires time to get used to taking 100 mile an hour balls for over two hours.           (REUTERS)

	The following are excerpts:         
	P.K. Banerjee: Its a special moment in my life. I wont be able to describe how it feels when one retires after a long career I can remember the day when I retired Watching a great goalkeeper like Kahn playing his last match is a real privilege.         
	 But I expected a more competitive match. He had to handle the ball only once!         
	Syed Nayeemuddin: I feel honoured as a footballer to watch Kahn playing his last match. I feel proud and believe that Calcuttans are lucky to watch him in action I enjoyed watching him but I am also a bit sad because we wont be able to watch Kahn playing again. The city can consider itself lucky as well as the Mohun Bagan players         
	Mike Okoro: I cannot believe my eyes today! I have actually seen Kahn playing That I saw him from a few metres away Its one of the most memorable days of my life. Its a mixed feeling actually.         
	On one hand its a joyous moment to witness him (Kahn) playing, but on the other hand it makes me sad when I remember its his farewell match. I feel as a footballer and a Kahn fan I am honoured. I will carry this moment all through my life.         
	Sangram Mukherjee: Its a glorious moment of my life. I am lucky to play against a prestigious team like Bayern Munich and the legendary goalkeeper who bid adieu to his long career.         
	Though I was on the other end, I tried to follow him from there also. I thank god to have given me this opportunity. And I feel proud to be part of Kahns last match History will remember me too.

                                                   East Bengal to lodge protest with AIFF

      A STAFF REPORTER
           
	Calcutta: East Bengal officials on Wednesday  miffed at poor refereeing  threatened to move the AIFF after match commissioner Joginder Singh refused to take note of their protest against referee K. Sankar. 
    
	Coach Manoranjan Bhattacharjee claimed that the referee knowingly turned down the penalty against Edmilson in the 81st minute. 
    
	It was 200 per cent a penalty But the whole team is suffering for somebodys vindictive attitude towards a particular player. 
    
	He added that their recent complaint, incidentally, was their third against the same referee. 
    
	Influential East Bengal official Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta claimed: The referee directly threatened their player saying I will kill you if I meet you outside (the state) Yet no action is taken against him. 
    
	Its very sad that when the AIFF is trying to improve the standards of the game poor referring decisions playing spoilsport. 
    
	Bhattacharjee, however, admitted that East Bengal were still in the relegation zone and need to buck up.

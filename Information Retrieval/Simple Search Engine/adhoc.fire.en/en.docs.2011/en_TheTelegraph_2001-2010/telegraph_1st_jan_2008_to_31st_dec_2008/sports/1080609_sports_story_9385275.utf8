                                                                                                                                                                                           Pakistan crush Bangla 
                      
	Dhaka: Pakistan bulldozed Bangladesh by 70 runs in the rain-curtailed tri-series opener to extend their unbeaten run in one-day Internationals to 12 at Sher-e-Bangla stadium on Sunday.         
	Riding on sparkling half-centuries by Salman Butt (70) and Mohammed Yousuf (59), Pakistan scored a challenging 233 before being folded in 39.3 overs, after sent in to bat in a match reduced to a 40-40 affair.         
	They then restricted their rivals to 163 for eight in their quota of 40 overs to register their 12th consecutive win.         
	Shahid Afridi (3/19) and left-arm pacer Wahab Riaz (3/22) shared six wickets between them, breaking the spine of Bangaldesh batting.         
	Hosts skipper Mohammed Ashraful was the only batsman who put up some resistance and remained unbeaten on 56.         
	Shahriar Nafees (9) and Tamim Iqbal provided a steady if not flamboyant start to Bangladesh against a good Pakistan attack, led by Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir.         
	The opening pair put up 35 before Riaz had Nafees caught behind.           (PTI)

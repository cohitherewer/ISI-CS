The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Halfway through US Open, men have the advantage 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       Halfway through US Open, men have the advantage 
    - The womens draw has been marked by upsets and lacklustre play             KURT STREETER            Roger Federer                                       
	New York: Not to sound like too much of a caveman, but at the halfway mark of the US Open a grand theme has emerged: Men good, women... bad?         
	Well, to put it more nicely, replace bad with sputtering. From the women, top to bottom, there have been few truly stirring performances. Gone is the No. 1-seeded player, Ana Ivanovic, and the No. 3, Svetlana Kuznetsova. The player seeded second, Jelena Jankovic, has clunked her way through three matches, nearly falling prey to an upset herself.         
	This is particularly sad to say at a tournament where the ghosts of Navratilova, Graf, Evert and Seles swirl, but this week women need to raise their games if theyre to rev up excitement for Saturdays final. Okay, enough depressing thoughts, lets move on to something thats going a good bit better.         
	Over on the testosterone-driven side of the draw, Roger Federer played Sunday, looking like his old self. He easily walked through Radek Stepanek, a tough Czech known to sometimes come up with a stunner, as he did in beating Federer earlier this year.         
	On Sunday, everything was different; the elegant Swiss won, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, moving smoothly and hitting deeply, a must if he is to win this tournament for the fifth straight time. After a year of darkness, Federer now looks deeply focused.         
	The way this tournament has set up, expect Federer to sail into the semi-finals, since none of his potential opponents have given him much trouble. One player who has troubled the recently deposed King of Tennis is third-seeded Novak Djokovic.         
	The Serb beat Croatian teen Marin Cilic in a tense four-set battle Sunday night to advance to the fourth round. Its apparent from seeing Djokovic prowl the court that to beat No. 1 Rafael Nadal, he need not alter his game as much as Federer must.         
	My naked eye assessment? The ball has been booming off Djokovics racket a bit heavier, cleaner, faster and lower than it has when struck by Federer. This could spell trouble for Nadal, who is somewhat allergic to heavy, clean, fast and low.         
	But trouble isnt the same as being ripe for a surprising defeat. In winning every set hes played last week Nadal was his typical snarly, powerful, intense and smart self. Recall that the Spaniard is my pick to walk off with the big prize this week. So far, nothing here dissuades me.         
	The others? Many have been great, but the player to keep your eye on is Juan Martin del Potro, a lanky, 19-year-old Argentine who comes to this tournament running as fast and smooth as a Maserati on the Autobahn. Hmm, hes 19, tall, carefree, and playing as if he cant miss. Remember Pete Sampras when he came from nowhere to win here in 1990?         
	Five, six, eight years ago, womens tennis here was as compelling as the mens, maybe more. Those days are over. Thank goodness for the Williams sisters. Theyve come motivated and focused, which means everyone else is probably toast.         
	Sadly, the draw this year has them steered toward a collision in the quarter finals. Watching Serena drive the ball this week, a sight as sweet as a Manny Ramirez line shot, I give her a slight edge in that match, and through Saturday nights final. Question: If one of the sisters is not on court for the final, will anyone watch? Okay, that may be a bit harsh.         
	But backing up my overall assessment is Robert Lansdorp, the South Bay tennis guru who guided Tracy Austin, Lindsay Davenport and Maria Sharapova. Laid up with a bad back, he spent last week at his Redondo Beach home, watching the Open on TV. We spoke over the phone after Ivanovic suffered one of the biggest upsets in tennis history: No. 1 losing to No. 188. Lansdorp was unsparing, and deeply disappointed.         
	I dont know whats wrong with this group, he said, referring to the top women. One moment they play great. One moment they play awful. You cant count on them. Ivanovic played with a bad thumb, but if shes the best player she should have been able to beat that other girl with nine fingers... Other than maybe the Williams sisters Im very disappointed.
